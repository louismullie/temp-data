## Question

Estrogen dosing for hormone replacement therapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about estrogen dosing for hormone replacement therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of using the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration. Then, I should verify how dose varies by indication, including vasomotor symptoms, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and osteoporosis prevention. Next, I will examine route-specific dosing, especially oral versus transdermal, and the role of progestogen when the uterus is present. After that, I need to consider special populations such as those with premature ovarian insufficiency, transgender women, and adolescents with hypogonadism. Finally, I should review monitoring, titration, and drug–drug interactions, and close with a concise, practical dosing summary that aligns with guidelines and labels.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle so I don't jump to conclusions: across guidelines and FDA labeling, the consistent directive is to use the lowest effective dose of estrogen for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals, with periodic reassessment every 3 to 6 months to determine ongoing need and to attempt tapering when feasible [^115RdAq5] [^1159WgZJ] [^1134k2WV].

> Now, for vasomotor symptoms, I should verify the effective low-dose ranges. Low-dose oral options include conjugated equine estrogen 0.3–0.45 mg/day and micronized estradiol 0.5 mg/day, while transdermal estradiol 0.025–0.0375 mg/day is effective and may take 6–8 weeks for full symptom control; ultra-low doses like 0.014 mg/day transdermal or 0.25 mg/day oral estradiol have mixed efficacy and are not universally effective for hot flashes, so I need to ensure we don't overpromise on ultra-low dosing [^112GdnYY] [^111FNApr] [^115RdAq5].

> Hold on, I should verify the genitourinary syndrome of menopause dosing because it differs from systemic therapy. Low-dose vaginal estrogen is first-line for local symptoms, with 10 µg estradiol tablets used daily for 2 weeks then twice weekly, or a 7.5 µg estradiol ring every 90 days; importantly, systemic absorption is minimal at these doses, so progestogen is not required for endometrial protection, though I should double-check for any breakthrough bleeding that warrants evaluation [^111Nhbv6] [^1119rHMg].

> For osteoporosis prevention, I need to check whether lower systemic doses suffice. Evidence supports that 0.3 mg/day conjugated equine estrogen with adequate calcium and vitamin D preserves bone density, and transdermal estradiol 0.025–0.05 mg/day also has beneficial skeletal effects; however, hormone therapy is FDA-approved for prevention, not treatment, of osteoporosis, so I should frame this as risk reduction rather than therapy for established disease [^111sMGQB] [^116L6LEC] [^116JmUGp].

> Next, I should review route-specific pharmacokinetics because they influence dose selection and safety. Oral estrogens undergo first-pass hepatic metabolism, increasing estrone sulfate and potentially affecting coagulation and lipids, whereas transdermal estradiol avoids first-pass effects and is associated with lower VTE risk in observational data; thus, for women with higher thrombotic risk or intolerance to oral therapy, transdermal routes at low doses are reasonable, and I should confirm that this aligns with endocrine guidance favoring non-oral routes in VTE risk profiles [^11738ecU] [^113ZS4Am] [^113r69Zv].

> I will now examine progestogen requirements because this directly affects estrogen dosing strategy. In women with a uterus, systemic estrogen must be paired with adequate progestogen to mitigate endometrial hyperplasia risk; options include continuous medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5–5 mg/day or micronized progesterone 100–200 mg/day, or sequential regimens such as medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day for 12 days monthly; I should confirm that continuous combined regimens are acceptable and often preferred for bleeding control, while still individualizing based on tolerance and risk [^115RdAq5] [^111BNytH] [^111q3rop].

> But wait, what if the patient is younger with premature ovarian insufficiency or surgical menopause? In POI, full replacement doses are appropriate, typically oral estradiol 1–2 mg/day or transdermal estradiol 100 µg/day, with progestogen added if the uterus is present; treatment should continue until the average age of natural menopause, and I should ensure we distinguish replacement dosing from contraceptive dosing, as combined oral contraceptives are not replacement therapy and carry different risk profiles [^111BNytH] [^114ehkXC].

> For transgender women, I need to ensure I apply the same safety-first principle while acknowledging different goals. Transdermal estradiol is preferred due to lower VTE risk, with typical starting doses around 0.025–0.05 mg/day transdermal or 1–2 mg/day oral, titrated to physiologic female ranges and combined with an antiandrogen as needed; I should confirm that ethinyl estradiol is avoided because of higher thrombotic risk and that monitoring includes estradiol, testosterone, and safety labs at defined intervals [^117925F3] [^114hpqXb].

> For adolescents with hypogonadism, let me think about pubertal mimicry. Estrogen should be initiated low and escalated slowly over 2–4 years to mimic normal puberty, typically starting around age 11–12 if diagnosis is established, with transdermal estradiol favored for its physiologic profile; progestin is added about 2–2.5 years after estrogen initiation or at breakthrough bleeding to protect the endometrium, and I should confirm that adult dosing is reached gradually to avoid premature epiphyseal closure [^115Kj21V] [^112fWaFw].

> I should double-check monitoring and titration practices so we don't miss safety steps. Clinical response should guide dose adjustments, with reassessment every 3–6 months; routine estradiol level monitoring is not recommended for systemic therapy, but if symptoms persist despite dose escalation, especially after switching routes, checking levels can be reasonable to assess absorption or adherence; for vaginal therapy, systemic absorption is usually low, but I need to watch for bleeding and evaluate if it occurs [^115RdAq5] [^1134k2WV] [^111Nhbv6].

> Hold on, I should verify drug–drug interactions that could alter estrogen exposure. Certain antiretrovirals like efavirenz and etravirine can reduce estradiol levels, necessitating dose titration to maintain symptom control; conversely, some protease inhibitors may increase estrogen exposure, so I need to check the ART regimen and adjust accordingly, and I should remember that oral estrogen can increase GH requirements in adults with GH deficiency, which matters if the patient is on GH therapy [^113CZG2T] [^111DZiLk] [^114rBUYY].

> Let me reconsider the practical dosing summary to ensure internal consistency. For typical postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms, start with low-dose transdermal estradiol 0.025–0.0375 mg/day or oral micronized estradiol 0.5–1 mg/day, titrating every 3 months to effect and attempting taper at 6–12 months; for GSM, use low-dose vaginal estradiol 10 µg twice weekly after a 2-week induction; for osteoporosis prevention, 0.3 mg/day conjugated equine estrogen or transdermal estradiol 0.025–0.05 mg/day can be considered if systemic therapy is otherwise indicated; always pair systemic estrogen with appropriate progestogen when the uterus is present, and prefer transdermal routes in women with higher VTE risk or intolerance to oral therapy [^115RdAq5] [^111FNApr] [^111Nhbv6] [^116L6LEC] [^113r69Zv].

---

Estrogen dosing for HRT should be **individualized to the lowest effective dose** [^115RdAq5] that controls symptoms, with periodic reassessment every 3–6 months [^1159WgZJ]. For vasomotor symptoms, typical starting doses are 0.5–1 mg oral estradiol or 0.025–0.05 mg transdermal estradiol weekly [^116JmUGp]; adjust based on response and taper as tolerated [^111FNApr]. For genitourinary symptoms, use low-dose vaginal estrogen (e.g. 10 µg estradiol tablet twice weekly) [^111Nhbv6] after an initial 2-week daily course, with no routine progestogen needed unless there is a uterus and systemic absorption is high [^1119rHMg]. In women with a uterus, add progestogen for endometrial protection [^116JNwsq]; in POI, use higher replacement doses (e.g. 1–2 mg oral estradiol or 100 µg transdermal) [^111BNytH] until the average age of menopause. Avoid ethinyl estradiol due to higher VTE risk [^117925F3]; transdermal routes are preferred for patients with higher VTE risk [^113r69Zv].

---

## General principles of estrogen dosing

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose consistent with treatment goals, reassessing periodically (every 3–6 months) [^115RdAq5] [^1159WgZJ].

- **Individualization**: Tailor dose, route, and duration to symptoms, risk profile, and patient preference [^114dwtC8].

- **Route selection**: Transdermal estrogen is preferred for patients with higher VTE risk or intolerance to oral therapy [^113r69Zv] [^116szEzN].

## Standard estrogen dosing for menopausal symptoms

| **Route of administration** | **Estrogen formulation** | **Standard starting dose** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Oral | Estradiol (micronized) | 0.5–1 mg daily | Adjust dose based on symptom control [^1159WgZJ] |
| Oral | Conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) | 0.3–0.45 mg daily | Lower doses may be effective for some women [^112GdnYY] |
| Transdermal | Estradiol patch | 0.025–0.05 mg weekly | Adjust to symptom control; lower VTE risk than oral [^116JmUGp] [^113ZS4Am] |
| Transdermal | Estradiol gel | 0.25–1.5 mg daily | Equivalent to 0.5–2 mg oral estradiol [^114AhonK] |

---

Low-dose regimens (e.g. 0.3 mg CEE or 0.5 mg oral estradiol) are effective for many women and have a **better adverse effect profile** than standard doses [^112GdnYY] [^1167czKD].

---

## Estrogen dosing for genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)

- **Local estrogen**: Preferred for GSM; low systemic absorption [^111Nhbv6].

- **Standard regimen**: 10 µg estradiol tablet, daily for 2 weeks, then twice weekly [^111Nhbv6].

- **Maintenance**: Use the lowest effective dose, often twice weekly [^111Nhbv6].

- **Progestogen**: Not routinely required unless systemic absorption is high and uterus is present [^1119rHMg].

---

## Estrogen dosing for osteoporosis prevention

Estrogen therapy prevents bone loss [^116L6LEC] with **dose-dependent effects** [^116L6LEC]; low-dose regimens (e.g. 0.3 mg CEE or 0.025 mg transdermal estradiol) can preserve bone density, though efficacy may be less than with standard doses [^112tE3YM]. Use the lowest effective dose and reassess periodically [^116JNwsq].

---

## Special populations and considerations

### Women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)

In POI, **replacement dosing** uses 1–2 mg oral estradiol or 100 µg transdermal estradiol daily [^111BNytH], continuing until the average age of menopause (about 50–51 years) [^114ehkXC].

---

### Women with increased cardiovascular risk

For women with increased cardiovascular risk, **transdermal estrogen** is preferred due to a lower VTE risk than oral formulations [^113r69Zv] [^113ZS4Am].

---

### Transgender women

For transgender women, **transdermal estradiol** is preferred; avoid ethinyl estradiol due to higher VTE risk [^117925F3]. Titrate to physiologic female levels (typically estradiol 100–200 pg/mL) [^117925F3].

---

## Duration and discontinuation of estrogen therapy

- **Short-term use**: Generally ≤ 5 years for symptom control [^notfound].

- **Long-term use**: Individualize based on ongoing symptoms and risk–benefit assessment [^114ehkXC].

- **Discontinuation**: Gradual tapering is often recommended; symptoms may recur in ~50% of women [^111FNApr] [^114vNTEq].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Regularly assess symptom control, adverse effects, and risks; adjust the dose or discontinue as appropriate [^1159WgZJ]. Routine estradiol level monitoring is **not generally required** but may be considered in select cases (e.g. poor symptom control or suspected malabsorption) [^1134k2WV].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose, reassessing every 3–6 months [^115RdAq5] [^1159WgZJ].

- **Route selection**: Prefer transdermal estrogen in patients with higher VTE risk or intolerance to oral therapy [^113r69Zv] [^116szEzN].

- **GSM**: Use local vaginal estrogen; no routine progestogen needed unless systemic absorption is high and uterus is present [^111Nhbv6] [^1119rHMg].

- **POI**: Use replacement doses until the average age of menopause [^111BNytH] [^114ehkXC].

- **Individualization**: Tailor therapy to symptoms, risk profile, and patient preference [^114dwtC8].

---

Estrogen dosing for HRT should be **individualized to the lowest effective dose** [^115RdAq5], with route and duration tailored to symptoms, risk profile, and patient preference. Transdermal estrogen is preferred for patients with higher VTE risk, and local estrogen is effective for GSM with minimal systemic absorption [^113r69Zv] [^111Nhbv6].

Tailoring menopausal hormone therapy — shared decision-making, dosing, and monitoring are specified as follows: "We suggest a shared decision-making approach to decide about the choice of formulation, starting dose, the route of administration of MHT, and how to tailor MHT to each woman's individual situation, risks, and treatment goals". Clinicians prescribe estrogen alone for women without a uterus, use "the lowest effective dose with upward titration based on clinical response", and "usually do not measure estradiol levels to monitor therapy except when symptoms do not improve with escalating doses, particularly after changing the mode of administration from oral to transdermal". For younger women with surgical menopause or those with POI, higher starting doses may be used, for example "transdermal estradiol, 100 μg", then tapered as tolerated, and "the reassessment and tapering of MHT dose seems reasonable" as premature menopause approaches the natural menopause age.

Hormone therapy duration — dose and time — emphasizes that the lowest dose of hormone therapy should be used for the shortest amount of time to manage menopausal symptoms; although fewer than 5 years is recommended for estrogen with progestogen therapy, duration should be individualized; for estrogen therapy alone, more flexibility in duration of therapy may be possible, but there are reports of increased risk of breast cancer after 10 to 15 years of use in large observational studies with estrogen alone.

Use of the lowest clinically effective dose of postmenopausal hormone therapy conforms to current recommendations and good clinical practice. Although accumulating evidence demonstrates the efficacy and tolerability of low hormone therapy doses, data about their use are limited by a lack of long-term, randomized studies. This review evaluates current evidence on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of these preparations and their role in menopausal management.

Dosing of systemic estrogen therapy (ET) and progestogen — The therapeutic goal should be to use the most appropriate, often lowest, effective dose of systemic ET consistent with treatment goals, and the appropriate dose of progestogen is added to provide endometrial protection if a woman has a uterus, unless CEE is combined with BZA. Progestogen dosing-regimen options that provide for endometrial safety are dependent on the potency of the progestogen and vary with the estrogen dose, and different types and doses of progestogens, routes of administration, and types of regimen (sequential or continuous-combined) may have different associations with health outcomes; patient preference can and should be considered because many women will opt for regimens that avoid periodic menstrual bleeding.

Primary ovarian insufficiency — hormone therapy dosing and monitoring: Exogenous estrogen replacement is recommended, and a first-line approach is HT (either orally or transdermally) that achieves replacement levels of estrogen; serum estradiol level testing is not recommended to monitor treatment. Estrogen replacement can be achieved with 1–2 mg oral 17β-estradiol daily, 100 micrograms transdermal 17β-estradiol daily, or conjugated equine estrogens 0.625–1.25 mg daily. For endometrial protection, progestogen options include continuous 2.5–5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate daily (oral) or 100 mg micronized progesterone daily (oral), and sequential 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate daily (oral) for 12 days each month or 200 mg micronized progesterone daily (oral) for 12 days each month; select one of the estrogen options to be combined with one of the progestogen options.

### Review of hormone replacement therapy in girls and adolescents with hypogonadism [^115Kj21V]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Girls with either hypo- or hypergonadotropic hypogonadism need treatment with estrogens to initiate puberty and maintain a normal hormonal milieu. The focus of this review is hormone replacement treatment in girls with hypogonadism, to initiate and progress through puberty, and to maintain a healthy hormonal milieu in women. It also addresses what is known in the literature regarding estrogen levels in girls and women, instructive cases, practical tables for reference and application, and thoughts on future directions in this area. It represents a thorough literature review with author opinions and recommendations. Girls with normal ovarian function begin puberty on average at 10.5 years old, although there is variation according to ethnicity and degree of excess weight gain. The aim of estrogen therapy to initiate puberty is to mimic normal onset and rate of progression. On the basis of the currently available literature, when a diagnosis of hypogonadism is established, we recommend initiating treatment between age 11 and 12 years of age, with dose increases approximately every 6 months until adult levels are reached. In some situations, treatment may be delayed to allow time for diagnosis or permit more time for linear growth, or address unique risks found in girls treated for various cancers or blood disorders. When adult dosing is reached, progestins are also used to protect uterine health. This can be combined sequentially, allowing regular menstruation, or combined continuously when menstrual bleeding is not preferred. Treatment is continued until the average age of menopause, again with various considerations for longer or shorter duration on the basis of risk-benefit ratios. Transdermal estrogens are considered the most physiologic replacement and theoretically might have fewer associated risks. We review what is known about risks and outcomes and areas for future research.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111FNApr]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) — hormone therapy dosing, timelines, and discontinuation guidance — Compared with placebo, estrogen therapy (ET) alone or estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) reduced weekly symptom frequency by 75% (95% CI, 64.3–82.3). Lower-dose regimens — oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) 0.3 mg, oral 17β-estradiol ≤ 0.5 mg, or an estradiol patch 0.025 mg — may take 6 to 8 weeks to provide adequate symptom relief. The lowest dose-approved estradiol weekly patch (0.014 mg/d) appears effective for VMS but is FDA approved only for prevention of osteoporosis. Progestogen-only options reported effective for VMS include medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 10 mg, oral megestrol acetate 20 mg, and micronized progesterone (MP) 300 mg. VMS return in approximately 50% of women after hormone therapy is discontinued, and there is no consistent evidence that gradual tapering is superior to abrupt stopping.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to considerations for hormone therapy, SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend to administer estrogen-progestogen regimens either continuously (estrogen-progestogen taken every day) or following a cyclic regimen, with estrogen taken every day and progestogen taken for 12–14 days every month. Consider administering estrogen alone taken every day in patients with hysterectomy.

### Transdermal vs. oral hormone replacement therapy… [^115ZR3cR]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Estrogen replacement therapy reduces bone loss, alleviates vasomotor symptoms and may decrease mortality from cardiovascular causes in postmenopausal women. However, cyclic hormone replacement therapy frequently induces a recurrence of uterine bleeding in women with an intact uterus. This withdrawal bleeding leads to a significant decrease in patient compliance. Continuous combined hormone replacement regimens have been developed that significantly reduce the incidence of bleeding, particularly with extended duration of therapy. The majority of these regimens are based on oral formulations, but recently transdermal continuous combined hormone replacement products have been developed. By avoiding the first-pass metabolism, this dosage route should eliminate the hepatic synthesis of several proteins and triglycerides.

A study conducted by Mattsson and colleagues compared the efficacy of two dosages of a transdermal formulation with an available oral combination in terms of incidence of amenorrhea, frequency of climacteric symptoms, prevention of endometrial hyperplasia and subjective tolerability. 2 patch; a 20-cm² patch; or a daily oral dose of 2 mg estradiol and 1 mg norethisterone acetate. All treatments were given for a total of 13 continuous cycles of four weeks' duration. Patches were applied twice weekly, and tablets were given daily. Women were assessed at baseline and at 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks of treatment for climacteric symptoms, bleeding frequency and tolerability. The initial and final visits also included general physical and gynecologic examinations, cervical smears, transvaginal ultrasonography and mammography.

The authors concluded that transdermal application of a low dosage of combined estrogen-progestogen may be a good alternative in women requesting hormone replacement therapy, because all preparations studied alleviated climacteric symptoms and did not induce endometrial hyperplasia. Because the low-dose transdermal application had the lowest reported incidence of adverse effects, it seems that this dosage would be preferable for relief of symptoms. However, this study did not evaluate whether low-dose transdermal estrogen is effective in preventing the bone loss and cardiovascular disease associated with menopause; a long-term study will be necessary to obtain that information.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and cancer-NCI… [^1123aAk6]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

What is menopausal hormone therapy. Menopausal hormone therapy — also called postmenopausal hormone therapy and hormone replacement therapy — is sometimes used to replace the natural hormones estrogen and progesterone in a woman's body during and after menopause, when levels of these hormones drop. Providers may recommend MHT to relieve common symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness, and to address long-term biological changes, such as bone loss, that result from declining levels of estrogen and progesterone. MHT can be given in a variety of ways. When the goal is to treat hot flashes and other systemic symptoms or to prevent osteoporosis, it is usually given as a pill, but it can be also be given systemically through the skin or via an implant.

When the goal is to address genitourinary symptoms such as vaginal dryness, MHT is applied directly in the vagina. Which form of MHT is used depends on whether a woman has a uterus. Because estrogen, when used alone for systemic MHT, is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, estrogen is used alone only in women who have had a hysterectomy. Women who have a uterus — that is, who have not had a hysterectomy — are generally prescribed estrogen plus progestin for systemic MHT. Vaginal estrogen to treat genitourinary symptoms is prescribed regardless of hysterectomy status.
- The WHI Estrogen-Alone Study, in which women without a uterus were randomly assigned to receive either a hormone pill containing estrogen alone or a placebo. The median duration of treatment was 7. 2 years.

Both trials were stopped early, when it was determined that both types of therapy were associated with specific health risks. relief of hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and painful intercoursewith systemic and local estrogen or systemic estrogen plus progestin for as long as MHT is taken lower risk of hip and vertebral fractureswith systemic estrogen or estrogen plus progestin for as long as MHT is taken lower risk of breast cancerwith systemic estrogen lower risk of death from breast cancerwith systemic estrogen.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Use estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestogen, at the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Re-evaluate postmenopausal women periodically as clinically appropriate to determine whether treatment is still necessary.

One capsule orally each evening with food. (2.1)

2.1 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms Due to Menopause

Take a single estradiol and progesterone capsule orally each evening with food. Generally, start therapy with estradiol and progesterone capsules, 0.5 mg/100 mg dosage strength. Make dosage adjustment based on the clinical response. Attempt to taper or discontinue estradiol and progesterone capsules at 3 to 6 month intervals.

### Menopausal hormone therapy: current considerations [^114KkBWo]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor and vaginal symptoms. Today, symptomatic women younger than 60 years of age or less than 10 years since onset of menopause yield the greatest benefit of MHT with the lowest risks when compared with older women remote from menopause. Careful assessment before initiating therapy includes severity of bothersome symptoms, treatment preferences, medical history, presence of contraindications to MHT, and personal risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Considerations of type of MHT, dosing, and route of administration, and recommendations regarding duration of therapy are discussed.

### NAMS 3rd utian translational science symposium, October 2016, Orlando, Florida A conversation about hormone therapy: is there an appropriate dose, route, and duration of use? [^115cYaqB]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) held the 3rd Utian Translational Symposium on October 4, 2016, in Orlando, Florida, to answer questions about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women. This report is a record of the proceedings of that symposium. The maxim about HT for the past 15 years since the publication of the initial results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) has been to prescribe the "lowest dose for the shortest period of time". With new clinical trials, observational data, and further analysis of the WHI and the cumulative 13 years' follow-up, it was time to hold a conversation about the state of the evidence and recommendations for HT dose, route, and duration of use. The symposium brought together experts in the field of HT to speak on these topics, organized by session, after which working groups gathered to synthesize the presentations into areas of what still needs to be known and how to proceed with areas of needed research. After the presentations, there was consensus that postmenopausal women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset without contraindications and who desire to take HT for relief of vasomotor symptoms or prevention of bone loss if at elevated risk can safely do so. The working groups raised the possibility that the use of "Big Data" (pharmacy and cancer databases) would allow answers that cannot be found in clinical trials. This could lead to more appropriate FDA labeling and patient package inserts reflecting the true risks associated with various types and formulations of HT, with differences among estrogen alone, estrogen with a progestogen, and estrogen plus a selective estrogen-receptor modulator for the younger women most likely to initiate these therapies for symptom relief. Differences were found for potential risk among estrogen alone, estrogen with synthetic progestins contrasted to progesterone, lower doses, nonoral doses, and low-dose vaginal estrogen. With all of the available routes and dosages, including vaginal estrogen alone for genitourinary symptoms, there are many options when considering the most appropriate type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, taking into account the age of the woman at initiation of HT and the time from menopause.

Sex hormone replacement therapy after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) — puberty and bone considerations include that androgens and estrogens promote bone formation and that puberty onset and progression can be delayed or fail to progress after HCT; for girls, puberty generally "should be induced by age 12 years (or bone age of 11 years)", with estrogen replacement beginning low and increased "over 2 to 4 years", adding progesterone cycling "2 to 2.5 years after initiation" or sooner if breakthrough bleeding occurs; for boys, testosterone replacement typically begins "at around 12 years" with dose increases "every 6 months" until adult dosing is reached.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 141: management of menopausal symptoms [^112GdnYY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Medium credibility.

Low-dose and ultra–low-dose HT dosing and efficacy — Examples of low-dose systemic estrogen therapy formulations include 0.3–0.45 mg/d of oral conjugated equine estrogen, 0.5 mg/d of oral micronized estradiol, 5 micrograms/d of ethinyl estradiol, and 0.025–0.0375 mg/wk of transdermal estradiol (patch), and there is good evidence that oral and transdermal low-dose estrogen regimens effectively alleviate vasomotor symptoms in women. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation assessed more than 2,500 postmenopausal women and found a similar reduction in vasomotor symptoms with a conjugated equine estrogen dosage of 0.625 mg/d and all lower combination doses, and another study of 333 women found that a dosage as low as 0.5 mg/d of oral estradiol is effective in treating hot flushes. For ultra-low doses (0.25 mg/d of oral micronized estradiol and 0.014 mg of transdermal estradiol), results have been mixed and these doses are not FDA approved for this indication; an RCT of 425 women showed that 41% experienced a reduction in moderate and severe hot flushes with 0.014 mg/d estradiol patch compared with placebo, whereas an RCT of 333 women found a 0.25-mg dose of oral estradiol was not more effective than placebo. Given variability and risks, it is recommended that health care providers individualize care and treat women with the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration that is needed to relieve vasomotor symptoms.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 141: management of menopausal symptoms [^1119rHMg]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Medium credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — estrogen for menopausal vaginal symptoms: Estrogen therapy effectively alleviates atrophic vaginal symptoms related to menopause, and local therapy is advised for women with only vaginal symptoms; all low-dose systemic estrogen formulations are FDA-approved for atrophic vaginitis. Oral conjugated equine estrogen as low as 0.3 mg/d and transdermal estradiol 12.5 micrograms/d have demonstrated improvements in vaginal atrophy. Local vaginal estradiol or conjugated equine estrogen in cream, ring, and tablet forms are effective, with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing that even low-dose (10 micrograms) vaginal estradiol tablets improve symptoms. Typical use is daily for 1–2 weeks as induction therapy followed by indefinite low-dose maintenance, and the 3-month estradiol-releasing vaginal ring is preferred to cream because of greater comfort, ease of use, and satisfaction. Systemic absorption has been documented with 25 micrograms of estradiol, but a Cochrane meta-analysis of 19 trials with 4,162 women found no increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia versus placebo; thus, progestin for endometrial protection is not needed, and use of progestin or local estrogen therapy does not require endometrial surveillance unless women experience postmenopausal bleeding, which would require diagnostic evaluation.

### Hormone replacement therapy: current controversies [^113XrSU9]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal hormonal therapy is used to manage the climacteric symptoms that impair the quality of life of a substantial number of women. The difficulty is achieving the desired effects with minimal side-effects and no adverse health risks. Fundamental to this is understanding the physiology of oestrogen in women and the metabolism of the therapeutic compounds. Although the effects of oral oestrogen therapy have been studied extensively, there is insufficient evidence to assess adequately the independent effects of progestin use, other oestrogen compounds, differing doses and duration of treatment. We have reviewed some basic concepts of oestrogen physiology and how these relate to exogenous oestrogen administration, the risks of greatest concern, and the role of androgens and newer treatment alternatives.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115sA7UY]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Key points for systemic estrogen therapy (ET) and estrogen‑progestogen therapy (EPT) — the appropriate, often lowest, effective dose of systemic ET consistent with treatment goals that provides benefits and minimizes risks for the individual woman should be the therapeutic goal; formulation, dose, and route of administration for hormone therapy should be determined individually and reassessed periodically; different hormone therapy doses, formulations, and routes of administration may have different effects on target organs, potentially allowing options to minimize risk; the appropriate formulation, dose, and route of administration of progestogen is needed to counter the proliferative effects of systemic estrogen on the endometrium; overall, the increased absolute risks associated with oral ET and EPT are rare (< 10/10,000/y) and include increased risk for VTE and gallbladder disease, and EPT carries a rare increased risk for stroke and breast cancer and, if estrogen is inadequately opposed, an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer; the absolute risks are reduced for all-cause mortality, fracture, diabetes mellitus (EPT and ET), and breast cancer (ET) in women younger than 60 years.

### When is it appropriate to prescribe postmenopausal hormone therapy? [^1164dZpo]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence and consensus-based recommendations for the use of hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal women.

Design

Using evidence from clinical trials and other publications, a multidisciplinary group of women's health experts developed consensus-based recommendations for HT use in more than 300 clinical scenarios. These panelists utilized the RAND Appropriateness Method and a quantitative scale to rate the appropriateness of treatment options for women with various risk factors and clinical scenarios.

Results

The panel judged it appropriate to prescribe all forms of HT to women with intolerable menopause symptoms and usual (age-expected) risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), venous thromboembolism (VTE), or stroke. Use of HT was judged not appropriate for the clinical scenarios of bone preservation, cosmetic appearance, current memory loss, loss of libido, or CVD protection. For a woman still using HT after 5 or more years, it was considered appropriate to recommend the options of stopping or lowering the dose even if stopping was previously attempted. In treating intolerable symptoms in the presence of some elevated risk for diseases related to HT, route of administration may affect appropriateness but prior stroke or TIA# is a contraindication.

Conclusions

Standard HT is appropriate for women with intolerable menopause symptoms in the absence of HT-related risk factors (eg, CVD, stroke, VTE, breast cancer). Panelists judged it appropriate to repeatedly present the option of stopping or reducing the dose. In most cases, presence of risk factors makes standard-dose oral HT not appropriate; however, some women may be candidates for a different dose or route of administration.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^114arqhw]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Women are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with men. While traditional risk factors for CVD seem to disproportionately affect women and contribute to this disparity, increased prevalence of CVD at midlife calls into question the contribution of menopause. Given the potential role that declining hormone levels play in this transition, menopause hormone therapies (MHT) have been proposed as a strategy for risk factor reduction. Unfortunately, trials have not consistently shown cardiovascular benefit with use, and several describe significant risks. Notably, the timing of hormone administration seems to play a role in its relative risks and benefits. At present, MHT is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. For women who may benefit from the associated vasomotor, genitourinary, and/or bone health properties of MHT, CVD risks should be taken into account prior to administration. Further research is needed to assess routes, dosing, and formulations of MHT in order to elucidate appropriate timing for administration. Here, we aim to review both traditional and sex-specific risk factors contributing to increased CVD risk in women with a focus on menopause, understand cardiovascular effects of MHT through a review of several landmark clinical trials, summarize guidelines for appropriate MHT use, and discuss a comprehensive strategy for reducing CV risk in women.

### The chronobiology of hormone administration: "Doctor, what time should I take my medication? " [^116RiDtd]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

In HRT, estrogen therapy should be accompanied by an adequate dose of progestin (administered continuously or sequentially) to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in non-hysterectomized women. Hysterectomized women, on the other hand, should be prescribed estrogen-only HRT. AMAB patients also are not prescribed progestin, but estrogen is combined with an antiandrogen.

The goal of combined hormonal contraceptives is not hormone replacement, but contraception achieved by suppression of the gonadotropic axis. Therefore, dosages of estrogen and progestin are higher than in HRT therapeutic schemes. Most combined hormonal contraceptive formulations contain EE; however, due to their potentially safer profile, natural estrogens such as 17-β-estradiol or its ester valerate are increasingly prescribed. Regardless of the agent prescribed, estrogen and progestin therapy must be taken at the right times to maintain appropriate circulating levels. Available formulations include oral (estrogen, progestin, or both) to be taken at the same time each day; vaginal (EE +etonogestrel) to be inserted and left in the vagina for 3 consecutive weeks; and transdermal (estradiol hemihydrate or ethinylestradiol + norelgestromin) to be changed weekly. Ideally, administration should mimic normal ovarian function: transdermal and vaginal routes delivering estradiol 0.100 mg daily are the first rudimentary step in this direction. These formulations mimic the daily ovarian production rate of estradiol and achieve average serum estradiol levels of 100 pg/mL. Regarding daily formulations, such as pills, current data does not sufficiently support the recommendation of taking the therapy at a specific time of day. Given the extreme complexity and variability of both estrogen and progesterone circadian and ultradian rhythms, it is unlikely that any specific administration timing may prove better than others (Fig. 1B).

Treatment — hormone replacement approaches: Treatment of hypogonadism seeks to normalize ovarian hormone levels; estrogen may be replaced with oral, micronized, or transdermal preparations, and progesterone therapy is also needed to avoid an unopposed estrogen effect and maintain endometrial health in women with a uterus. Oral contraceptives and intrauterine devices provide a variety of estrogen and progesterone forms and dosing options. Ovarian hormone replacement therapy (HRT) regimens differ for survivors who were prepubertal before cancer therapy and those who experience gonadal failure after menarche.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3-month to 6-month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.

Patients should be started at the lowest dose for the indication.

1. For treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, vulval and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause, the lowest dose and regimen that will control symptoms should be chosen and medication should be discontinued as promptly as possible.

Attempts to discontinue or taper medication should be made at 3-month to 6-month intervals. The usual initial dosage range is 1 to 2 mg daily of estradiol adjusted as necessary to control presenting symptoms. The minimal effective dose for maintenance therapy should be determined by titration. Administration should be cyclic (e.g., 3 weeks on and 1 week off).

2. For treatment of female hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure.

Treatment is usually initiated with a dose of 1 to 2 mg daily of estradiol, adjusted as necessary to control presenting symptoms; the minimal effective dose for maintenance therapy should be determined by titration.

3. For treatment of breast cancer, for palliation only, in appropriately selected women and men with metastatic disease.

Suggested dosage is 10 mg three times daily for a period of at least three months.

4. For treatment of advanced androgen-dependent carcinoma of the prostate, for palliation only.

Suggested dosage is 1 to 2 mg three times daily. The effectiveness of therapy can be judged by phosphatase determinations as well as by symptomatic improvement of the patient.

5. For prevention of osteoporosis.

When prescribing solely for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, therapy should be considered only for women at significant risk of osteoporosis and for whom non-estrogen medications are not considered to be appropriate.

The lowest effective dose of estradiol has not been determined.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^116szEzN]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal sex HT — indications, cautions, dosing, and route considerations are provided: Menopausal sex HT is primarily indicated to control menopause-related quality of life issues and should not be prescribed for prevention or treatment of vascular diseases; because sex HT increases risk for thrombosis, there is a black box warning on oral estrogen for women with known coronary artery disease, thromboembolic disorders, or prior cerebrovascular accident. Women at higher ASCVD risk are more likely to have even higher risk when taking oral menopausal sex HT. In general, prescribing the lowest effective dose is recommended, but doses lower than 0.3 mg of oral conjugated estrogen given at night will not control hot flashes (though protective against bone loss). Transdermal or vaginal delivery may be associated with fewer adverse events than oral, have smaller effects on clotting factors, lipid metabolism, inflammatory biomarkers, and sex hormone-binding globulin, and observational data suggest less risk of venous thromboembolism and stroke than oral estrogen.

### Norethindrone acetate / ethinyl estradiol (femhrt) [^11493cQo]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be limited to the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Patients should be evaluated for breast abnormalities in accordance with good clinical practice.

Patients should be started at the lowest dose.

femhrt therapy consists of a single tablet taken once daily.

1. For the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms associated with the menopause

femhrt should be given once daily for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause. Patients should be reevaluated at 3 to 6 month intervals to determine if treatment is still necessary.

2. For Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis

When prescribing solely of the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, femhrt should only be prescribed to postmenopausal women who are at significant risk of osteoporosis. Non-estrogen medications should be carefully considered. Risk factors for osteoporosis include low bone mineral density, low estrogen levels, family history of osteoporosis, previous fracture, small frame (low BMI), light skin color, smoking, and alcohol intake. Patients should be treated with the lowest effective dose. This dose should be periodically reassessed by the healthcare provider. Response to therapy can be assessed during treatment by measuring biochemical markers of bone formation/resorption, and/or bone mineral density.

### Update on menopause hormone therapy; current indications and unanswered questions [^114pVtrs]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide clinicians involved in managing menopause with a summary of current evidence surrounding menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

Design

The authors evaluate and synthesize existing pooled evidence relating to MHT's clinical indications, efficacy, and safety and explore the limitations of existing data.

Patients

The review focuses on MHT-related outcomes in women with natural-timed menopause captured within observational studies, RCTs, and pooled data from pivotal meta-analyses and reviews.

Measurements

Available published data are scrutinized. Available evidence and notably lacking data from women not adequately represented in published MHT trials, such as those with socioeconomic adversity, significant comorbidities, and minority ethnic backgrounds, are highlighted and deliberated.

Results

The impact of MHT differs significantly between demographics. Current consensus recommendations for MHT emphasize the importance of tailoring type, route, dose, and duration of therapy to individual needs and risk/benefit ratio through shared decision-making. MHT impact can change over time. Current MHT data support its benefits for treating menopause symptoms and a potential window of opportunity in midlife to benefit skeletal health. Limitations of current evidence highlight menopause health inequalities and underscores the need for further research.

Conclusions

This review recommends tailored use of MHT for well-defined indications, recognizing its value for menopause symptom relief and skeletal benefits for many midlife women. MHT may be used as long as benefits outweigh risks, through shared decision-making. There is insufficient clinical evidence to support the long-term use of MHT in some contemporary cohorts of women accessing MHT in clinical practice.

Conclusions

We provided theoretical reasons to expect relevant changes in pharmacokinetics at menopause for many drugs. This expectation was supported by anecdotal evidence from literature. However, research into the menopausal effect on the safety and efficacy of drugs is very scarce and needs to be extended urgently, as for most drugs it is currently unclear if a dose adjustment at menopause is needed.

### Growth hormone and estrogen: a clinician's approach [^111xPptP]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Adult patients with growth hormone (GH) deficiency require long-term treatment with GH to support normal physiological functioning. For many female patients, endogenous estrogen levels have a considerable impact on the dosing requirements for GH. Estrogen appears to stimulate GH secretion by decreasing liver secretion of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), resulting in stimulation of the pituitary to synthesize and secrete GH. Oral estrogen results in a higher concentration of liver estrogen than transdermal administration of estrogen. The appropriate dose of GH needs to be determined for each patient based on his or her age, sex, concomitant estrogen therapy, IGF-I level, and short- and long-term response to therapy. Clinical endocrinologists are in the best position to put all these variables into a successful therapeutic scenario.

### Health care for transgender and gender diverse individuals: ACOG committee opinion, number 823 [^117925F3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Feminizing therapy — estrogen and antiandrogen use, targets, and monitoring highlights risk considerations, preferred formulations, titration goals, and laboratory schedules. Risks include venous thromboembolic embolism (VTE), hypertriglyceridemia, development of gallstones, and elevated liver enzymes. Ethinyl estradiol may increase the risk of VTE; therefore, because cycle control is unnecessary for transgender women, its use is not indicated, and transdermal preparations of estradiol typically used for hormone replacement therapy are recommended for those with risk factors; if using oral estrogens, 17-β estradiol preparations are preferred, and in general, prescribing the smallest dose possible to achieve desired effects is recommended. Antiandrogens such as spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, and 5-α reductase inhibitors are used to reduce endogenous testosterone; cyproterone is not available in the United States because of concern for hepatotoxicity, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are often expensive, so are not widely used, and spironolactone is the most commonly used antiandrogen in the United States; because of the risk of hyperkalemia with these medications, it is important to monitor patients' blood pressure and potassium levels. Although currently available data do not provide clear guidance on titration of dosing, it generally should be based on patient goals. Doses should be titrated to physiologic effects, with goals to maintain estradiol at the mean daily levels for premenopausal women (less than 200 ng/ml) and testosterone in female range (less than 55 ng/dl). Recommended laboratory surveillance includes estradiol and total testosterone levels, sex hormone binding globulin, and albumin levels every 3 months in the first year to titrate estrogen dosing. After the first year, laboratory tests are necessary only if there are patient or health care professional concerns about adverse effects or after a change in dosage. Patients taking spironolactone also should be tested for potassium and creatinine levels every 3 months for first year and then yearly. Notably, feminizing hormones do not result in substantial changes to voice.

### Low-dose estrogen therapy for menopausal women: a review of efficacy and safety [^112tE3YM]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Recent adverse events involving research of traditional estrogen therapy have led to interest in lower-than-standard doses of menopausal estrogen therapy.

Method

The Medline (1966-present) database was searched for randomized controlled trials (keywords: low-dose estrogen, minimum dose AND estrogen, menopause, and osteoporosis) regarding hot flashes, endometrial hyperplasia, vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness, and bone density. Studies are only a few years in duration.

Results

The decrease in hot flashes with half-strength estrogens, range 60%-70%, is less than the 80%-90% reduction with standard dosing. Some low-dose preparations preserve lumbar and femoral bone density (although the degree of effect and quality of evidence vary among preparations). Bone density effects are dose dependent for conjugated equine estrogen (CEE), transdermal estradiol ethinyl (E(2)), norethindrone acetate (E(2)/NETA), oral E(2), and esterified estrogens. Bone preservation is likely to be less efficacious with low-dose estrogens than with traditional doses. Low-dose estrogen alone may not protect bone unless adequate calcium is given. Breast tenderness and skeletal effects are likely dose dependent. The longest endometrial safety data are 2-year data, reported for 5 microg/1 mg EE(2)/NETA and for 0.3 mg/day esterified estrogens. Some low-dose preparations have better vaginal bleeding profiles than do higher dose preparations. Breast tenderness is not totally averted with new lower-dose preparations. There are no fracture, breast cancer, or cardiovascular outcome data and a general lack of direct head-to-head comparisons involving low-dose preparations.

Conclusions

Serious adverse effects linked with traditional doses of estrogens may not be averted with lower-dose preparations, and low-dose preparations should not yet be emphasized as being safer than traditional (e.g., 0.625 mg/day CEE doses).

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114rBUYY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

GH replacement therapy in adults — evidence and dose adjustments: GH replacement therapy (Tables 5 and 6) is approved for adults with rigorously proven GHD or for treating HIV-related muscle wasting. Younger patients require higher doses, especially if serum IGF-1 levels are particularly low. Initial low GH replacement doses are preferred because fluid retention is dose-dependent. As women exhibit features of relative GH resistance, they usually require higher starting and maintenance replacement GH doses, as do women receiving oral estrogens. Morbid obesity may also require increased GH dosing.

### Association between hormone therapy and muscle mass in postmenopausal women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114aJtWh]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Subgroup Analyses

Hormone therapy dosage was examined separately within estrogen-only and estrogen-progesterone treatment arms. The various estrogen types used in HT are not equivalent; therefore, all estrogen dosages were standardized using reference values (eTable 2 in the Supplement). All values were standardized to those of conjugated equine estrogens, the most commonly used estrogen type across the included studies. Estrogen-only and estrogen-progesterone arms were stratified by an estrogen dose of 0.625 mg or greater (standard dosage or higher) or less than 0.625 mg (low dosage). The proposed mechanism of action for HT on muscle maintenance is through estrogen. Therefore, the estrogen-progesterone treatment arms were not stratified by progesterone dosage.

Follow-up duration subgroups were categorized as longer (> 2 years) or shorter (≤ 2 years). These thresholds were selected because they most evenly dichotomized the study and participant types and captured the range of follow-up duration. Follow-up duration was used as a proxy for total duration of HT because the reported follow-up durations were similar or the same as the duration of HT use across most studies. It is crucial to explore the variability in the duration of estrogen treatment because prolonged exposure to estrogen may be required to pose benefits for LBM preservation. Menopausal age was characterized based on the time since menopausal onset of study participants. Studies with participants with menopausal onset within the past 10 years were included. Generally, it is recommended for postmenopausal women to begin HT use nearer to menopause, specifically within the first 10 years. Time-since-menopause subgroups were also categorized as shorter (< 5 years) or longer (≥ 5 years).

Study quality subgroups were categorized by fair or good quality vs poor quality. Lean body mass measurement type subgroups were categorized as DEXA or other. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is considered the criterion standard of body composition measurement; therefore, all other types were combined and compared against it.

### Estrogen, estrogen plus progestin therapy, and risk of breast cancer [^112Ty5vd]. Clinical Cancer Research (2005). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic evidence relating use of postmenopausal hormones to risk of breast cancer by nature relies on trends in prescribing practices. Data on the adverse effect of combination estrogen plus progestin used for long durations has only become available over the past decade. Evidence is reviewed relating estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin to increased risk of breast cancer. Whereas current evidence indicates that longer duration of use increases risk of invasive breast cancer regardless of formulation, the rate of increase in risk is greater for combination estrogen plus progestin therapy. Although data are limited, continuous combined therapy and sequential therapy seem to have comparable impact on breast cancer risk. Combination therapy is more strongly related to lobular breast cancer than is estrogen alone. Unresolved issues remain about dose of estrogen and progestin in relation to risk, and about identification of women for whom short-term use to relieve menopausal symptoms may be safe and effective.

### Approach to the patient: pharmacological management of trans and gender-diverse adolescents [^112yD8YF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Gender-affirming Hormone Therapy

Exogenous estrogen or testosterone may be prescribed to adolescents wishing to feminize or masculinize, respectively. The principal goal of GAH therapy is to induce desired secondary sex characteristics congruent with an individual's identity; however, specific goals and priorities for gender affirmation vary between individuals.

Where PS is commenced in early puberty and the adolescent is relatively naïve to sex hormone, GAH is conventionally introduced at a low dose with gradual incremental dose increases timed to mimic the tempo of typical puberty. For adolescents already in well-established puberty (Tanner 4+), introduction and escalation of GAH therapy can be more rapid.

Medications that contain 17 ß-estradiol are most commonly recommended for feminization. Use of ethinyl estradiol-containing medications should be avoided because of higher thromboembolic risks. Oral and transdermal agents are the most commonly used routes in many countries, with injectable and sublingual options available in some jurisdictions. Published dosing strategies are largely based on experience and expert opinion, and prospective controlled studies comparing different regimens are lacking.

Although exogenous estrogen therapy will provide some hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis suppression, experience in adult cohorts indicates that estrogen alone is unlikely to provide sufficient suppression without use of supraphysiological doses (and attendant increase in risk of adverse effects). Concomitant GnRHa therapy can therefore be beneficial, but use of an antiandrogen is a common alternative if GnRHa is not available. Ultimately, some transfeminine individuals elect to undergo gender-affirming surgery including orchiectomy, which will remove the need for GnRHa or an antiandrogen; however, this is generally not performed until age > 18 years.

Testosterone regimens in TGD adolescents seeking to masculinize reflect those used in hypogonadal cisgender males. International guidelines recommend use of short-acting injectable preparations (2–4 weekly) and these are the most commonly reported agents in adolescent cohorts. However, if unavailable or unacceptable (eg, because of frequent injections), alternative regimens and routes may also be used. Longer acting injectable testosterone preparations are more typically reserved for use in those with well-established pubertal hormone exposure. Dose modulation is more easily undertaken with short-acting injectable testosterone esters or topical preparations. PS or alternative therapies to modulate the effects of endogenous pubertal hormones (eg, progestogens) are typically continued until adult testosterone levels are consistently established.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114vNTEq]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — discontinuation: Controversy exists regarding how long hormone therapy may safely be used and when it should be discontinued. Based on WHI findings, breast cancer risk becomes detectable after 3 to 5 years in women using estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT), whereas for women without a uterus using estrogen therapy (ET) alone, breast cancer risk did not increase after 7 years, so a longer duration of hormone therapy use may be acceptable. There are few studies to guide the optimal way to stop, and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) will recur in approximately 50% of women after discontinuation; data directly comparing abrupt versus tapered discontinuation are lacking, although clinical experts generally advise gradually decreasing hormone therapy doses over time. If hormone therapy is being used for prevention of osteoporosis, protection against bone density loss and fracture prevention is lost rapidly with discontinuation. Although VMS generally improve with time, genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) worsens with prolonged estrogen deficiency, observational studies confirm the long-term safety of low-dose vaginal ET as a highly effective treatment for GSM, and, in the absence of contraindications, a woman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formulation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional.

### Bioidentical hormone therapy: a review [^111Xcbmc]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The terms "natural" or "bioidentical" hormone therapy (NHT) are used to describe hormone treatment with individually compounded recipes of certain steroids in various dosage forms, including dehydroepiandrosterone, pregnenolone, testosterone, progesterone, estrone, estradiol, and estriol. Based on the results of a person's salivary hormone levels, the final composition of the compounded dosage form is individualized to that specific person. Proponents claim that NHT is better tolerated than manufactured products. This paper is intended to review the concept of NHT and to determine whether there is sufficient scientific evidence to support its use.

Design

A literature search was performed in Medline using the following MeSH terms and key words: drug combinations; progestational hormones; hormone replacement therapy; endometrium; estrogen replacement therapy; climacteric; menopause; estradiol; estrogens; progesterone; drug monitoring; and drug compounding. Current Contents, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Lexis Nexis, Google, Medscape, MD Consult, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched with key words.

Results

There are a few observational studies and clinical trials comparing conventional hormone therapy with bioidentical hormone therapy. Studies generally lacked adequate study design, including small sample sizes and comparison of inequivalent doses, to prove safety and efficacy. Little evidence was found to support individualized hormone dosing based upon saliva hormone concentrations.

Conclusion

Evidence suggests that, although individualized hormonal products may decrease some symptoms of menopause, it seems they have no proven advantage over conventional hormone therapies and their use is not supported by evidence regarding pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy.

### Effect of low-dose hormone replacement therapy on bone… [^111sMGQB]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis prevention through the use of hormone replacement therapy has been clearly documented. However, the dose-related side effects of HRT have limited its acceptance, and many times patients do not even fill their HRT prescriptions. In addition, the lowest available dosages of HRT have not been tested for efficacy in preventing bone loss, particularly in elderly women. Several studies have shown an inconsistent benefit in the prevention of bone loss with low-dose HRT. The lowest dosage that produces bone effects has been thought to be 0. 625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens per day or the equivalent. Recker and associates hypothesized that spinal bone loss would be prevented in elderly, postmenopausal women who received continuous therapy with 0. 3 mg per day of conjugated equine estrogen combined with
2. 5 mg per day of medroxyprogesterone, supplemented by adequate calcium and vitamin D intake.

A total of 128 women met study criteria and were randomly assigned to receive low-dose HRT or placebo. All patients noted to have calcium intakes of less than 1 g per day received calcium carbonate supplementation in an amount sufficient to raise their daily dietary intake of calcium to the 1-g level. Of the 128 study participants, 107 completed the study; all dropouts occurred during the first year. The dropout rate was similar in both study groups. Side effects thought to be related to HRT were mild and brief. In the HRT-treated group, the most common side effect included vaginal spotting or a change in the nature of vaginal discharge. Most side effects from HRT disappeared within six months. The authors conclude that continuous oral therapy with 0. 3 mg per day of conjugated equine estrogen and
2. 5 mg per day of medroxyprogesterone combined with adequate calcium and vitamin D intake has a significant bone-sparing effect in elderly women.

The increase in bone mineral density demonstrated with low-dose HRT is equal to that reported with higher dosages of HRT. Undesirable side effects were rare and brief. The risk of endometrial cancer is likely to be less with lower doses of estrogen, but this requires further investigation.

### Committee opinion no. 698: hormone therapy in primary ovarian insufficiency [^114ehkXC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy in primary ovarian insufficiency — contraception, administration route, and duration are outlined as follows: Cyclic progestogen therapy allows earlier recognition of pregnancy, and the absence of a withdrawal bleed should prompt the patient to test for pregnancy. Combined hormonal contraceptives may allow ease of administration but are not replacement dosage and are significantly more potent than hormone therapy (HT); to date, no well-powered randomized trials compare HT with combined hormonal contraceptives for cardiovascular, quality-of-life, or bone outcomes. Because HT uses replacement doses of estrogen, HT may have a lower risk of venous thromboembolism, and some experts recommend treatment by the transdermal route. Combined hormonal contraceptives prevent ovulation and pregnancy more reliably than HT; for those prioritizing effective contraception while using noncontraceptive estrogen replacement, insertion of a levonorgestrel intrauterine device is preferable to oral progestin therapy. Treatment for all women with primary ovarian insufficiency should continue until the average age of natural menopause is reached (age 50–51 years), and treatment may continue past age 50–51 years if a woman has clinical symptoms or indications; the decision to continue HT should be individualized and based on symptoms and the risk–benefit ratio. HT is described as the central element of long-term clinical management, with full replacement doses of hormone for long-term treatment and the need for comprehensive longitudinal management emphasized.

### The pharmacokinetics and efficacy of different estrogens are not equivalent [^1149wn1F]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

In the next decade many women will turn to the medical community for advice on maintaining or improving health after menopause. Estrogen replacement therapy, with or without progestins, alleviates menopausal symptoms, prevents or manages osteoporosis, and reduces the increased cardiovascular disease risk that results from estrogen deficiency caused by ovarian decline. Although several estrogen replacement products are available, the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of these products may vary depending on either the estrogen formulation or the route of administration, or both. For example, oral estrogens, which elicit a marked hepatic response, induce greater beneficial effects on serum lipoproteins than transdermal estrogens, which circumvent first-pass liver metabolism. Oral conjugated estrogens and transdermal estradiol increase bone density and prevent bone loss. This article summarizes the studies comparing estrogen formulations and discusses the differential effects of various estrogen products that promote postmenopausal health.

### Esterified estrogens (Menest) [^114qpx3S]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3-month to 6-month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (See Boxed Warnings and WARNINGS .) For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.

Patients should be started at the lowest dose.

1. **Given cyclically for short term use only**:

For treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, or moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause.

Administration should be cyclic (e.g., 3 weeks on and 1 week off).

USUAL DOSAGE RANGES:

Vasomotor symptoms – 1.25 mg daily. If the patient has not menstruated within the last 2 months or more, cyclic administration is started arbitrarily. If the patient is menstruating, cyclic administration is started on day 5 of bleeding.

Moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy – 0.3 mg to 1.25 mg or more daily, depending upon the tissue response of the individual patient. Administer cyclically.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer phenotype: does dose matter? [^115ds5HC]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Duration and type of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) has been associated with increased breast cancer risk and the development of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors. The effect of HT dose on breast cancer tumor characteristics remains undefined. We sought to determine if HT dosing regimens influence breast cancer phenotype.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of incident female breast cancers occurring in the year 2003 listed in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Cancer Registry. Type of HT, dose, number of tablets dispensed, tumor phenotype, stage, grade, and histology were obtained from electronic records for women aged ≥ 50 years who had more than 1 year of uninterrupted pharmacy data (n = 1701). A dose index of HT exposure was created and odds ratios were used to determine if tumor phenotype varied between exposure groups. These results were compared with a previously published analysis of HT duration on tumor phenotype conducted with the same dataset.

Results

The cumulative effect of estrogen and progesterone hormone therapy as calculated by factoring both dose and duration of HT use prior to breast cancer diagnosis did not reveal any new associations that were not previously identified by analysis of HT duration of exposure alone. Low-dose-index combination-HT users were less likely to have tumors with an ER-positive phenotype. An overall trend developed in which low- and high-dose-index exposed women had the lowest rates of ER- and progesterone receptor (PR) -positive tumors.

Conclusion

Duration of use is an adequate surrogate for determining overall exposure to HT when considering the effect of HT on breast cancer phenotype.

### Sex and gender differences research design for basic, clinical, and population studies: essentials for investigators [^115um2oo]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

"The failure to consider exogenous hormone use… may contribute to the lack of reproducibility in many studies".

The use of exogenous hormones, such as oral contraceptives, menopausal hormone therapy, testosterone, and anabolic steroids, is particularly important to document. Taken systemically, by mouth, injection, or patch, such drugs affect reproductive and nonreproductive systems throughout the body, and they could be important to investigations in which the exposure–disease relationship could be affected by sex hormones. In the United States, sales of testosterone, available as oral medicine, gel, patch, or injection, grew 77% from 2010 to 2013, with 2.3 million prescriptions filled. It is estimated that 2.9 to 4 million Americans, largely men, have used anabolic steroids in their lifetime.

In addition to their direct impact on brain, bone, muscle, metabolism, immune, cardiovascular, and reproductive function, reproductive steroids often interact with other drugs. For example, among patients with growth hormone deficiency, women taking oral estrogen require twice as much growth hormone as men or women not taking oral estrogen to achieve the same levels of insulin-like growth factor 1; current guidelines for treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency now recommend the consideration of estrogen status in dosing. Basic scientists may find it illuminating to vary the levels of exogenous hormone exposures in their experiments to mimic widespread human exposures.

### The 2017 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111yvUiD]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) updates the 2012 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2012 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of HT differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized to identify the most appropriate HT type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing or discontinuing HT. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is most favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for those at elevated risk for bone loss or fracture. For women who initiate HT more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or are aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS or bone loss, with shared decision making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome GSM symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies and without indications for use of systemic HT, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies are recommended. This NAMS position statement has been endorsed by Academy of Women's Health, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Association of Nurse Practitioners, American Medical Women's Association, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Asociación Mexicana para el Estudio del Climaterio, Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, Australasian Menopause Society, Chinese Menopause Society, Colegio Mexicano de Especialistas en Ginecologia y Obstetricia, Czech Menopause and Andropause Society, Dominican Menopause Society, European Menopause and Andropause Society, German Menopause Society, Groupe d'études de la ménopause et du vieillissement Hormonal, HealthyWomen, Indian Menopause Society, International Menopause Society, International Osteoporosis Foundation, International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health, Israeli Menopause Society, Japan Society of Menopause and Women's Health, Korean Society of Menopause, Menopause Research Society of Singapore, National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health, SOBRAC and FEBRASGO, SIGMA Canadian Menopause Society, Società Italiana della Menopausa, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, South African Menopause Society, Taiwanese Menopause Society, and the Thai Menopause Society.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116L6LEC]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Osteoporosis key points — Hormone therapy prevents bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women, with dose-dependent effects on bone density (Level I), and hormone therapy reduces fracture risk in healthy postmenopausal women (Level I). Hormone therapy is FDA approved for prevention of bone loss, but not for treatment of osteoporosis (Level I). In the absence of contraindications, in women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, systemic hormone therapy is an appropriate therapy to protect against bone loss (Level I). Unless contraindicated, women with premature menopause without prior fragility fracture or osteoporosis are best served with hormone therapy or oral contraceptives to prevent bone density loss and reduce fracture risk, rather than other bone-specific treatments, until the average age of menopause, when treatment may be reassessed (Level II). Decisions regarding initiating and discontinuation of hormone therapy should be made primarily on the basis of extraskeletal benefits (ie, reduction of VMS) and risks (Level III).

### The chronobiology of hormone administration: "Doctor, what time should I take my medication? " [^113iCGsF]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Estrogen/Progesterone and Combined Estroprogestinic Therapy

Estrogens can be prescribed for several therapeutic purposes, such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for postmenopausal or hypogonadotropic women, contraception, menstrual abnormalities, and gender incongruence in assigned male at birth (AMAB) patients. Different routes of administration exist for estrogens (oral, transdermal, or vaginal), and they have different effects on clinical outcomes. Transdermal administration of 17-β-estradiol is the route that best mimics physiological serum concentrations of estradiol and offers a better safety profile compared to oral formulations. In fact, transdermal administration avoids the hepatic first-pass effect, minimizing the impact of estrogen on coagulation, and has little impact on the lipid profile, markers of inflammation and blood pressure. Transdermal 17-β-estradiol has also been shown more effective in achieving peak bone mineral density and reducing markers of bone resorption than oral ethinylestradiol (EE). On the other hand, several progestins are available and should be prescribed alone in some cases or as a component of combined HRT. Progestins and estrogens are metabolized by hepatic cytochromes, in particular CYP3A, which contribute significantly to their high hepatic first-pass effect, reducing their circulating levels after oral administration compared to vaginal and transdermal use. This also explains the high drug-drug interaction that estro-progestins undergo.

Oral estrogen therapy — oral estradiol tablets or conjugated estrogens are widely used and dose dependent: "Estradiol tablets or conjugated estrogens (synthetic or equine) are convenient, are studied most extensively, and alleviate climacteric symptoms in a dose-dependent fashion". "CEE, derived from pregnant mares' urine and used for decades, contain more than 200 compounds with varying estrogenic potency". Compared with transdermal estradiol, oral preparations "may result in up to 5-fold higher levels of circulating estrogen and 10- to 20-fold higher estrone sulfate" at comparable or higher doses, and "The biological effects of these estrone and estrone-sulfate increments are unknown".

### Estrogens, aging, and working memory [^113bRZFk]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Current guidelines suggest that hormone therapy started soon after menopause onset can offer specific health benefits for symptomatic women, but hormone therapy is not recommended at present as a means to treat or prevent cognitive decline in women who undergo natural age-related menopause. This guideline is based largely on the equivocal evidence of cognitive benefit observed in studies that have investigated forms of memory dependent on the medial temporal lobe, not studies of WM and its neural substrates. Currently, the corpus of evidence supporting effects of estrogens on WM is still small, but accumulating data indicate that further study is warranted. In women who choose estrogens after menopause, treatment must be individualized to identify the most suitable type, dose, and formulation and weighed against a possible increase in health risks associated with longer-term use. New intervention tools for menopausal women beyond conventional conjugated estrogens (e.g. Premarin) are under development. While low-dose estradiol continues to be tested [e.g. 70], promising alternative avenues for protecting women's brain health include simulating estradiol's effects on downstream molecular targets, new-generation selective estrogen receptor modulators, or emerging estrogen prodrugs that have a potential to act selectively in the CNS without exerting undesirable proliferative effects in the breast or endometrium.

### A contemporary view of menopausal hormone therapy [^114rkKyM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Enthusiasm for the use of hormones to ameliorate symptoms of perimenopause and menopause has waxed and waned over the years. Both treatment for symptoms and training of women's health care practitioners in the management of menopause have sharply declined since publication of the Women's Health Initiative initial results in 2002. Findings from that trial, which treated a population of older, asymptomatic patients, have been extrapolated over the past 21 years to all estrogen products, all menopausal women, and all delivery mechanisms. Our patients deserve a more nuanced, individualized approach. Conjugated equine estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate are no longer the predominant medications or medications of choice available for management of menopausal symptoms. All hormones are not equivalent any more than all antiseizure medications or all antihypertensives are equivalent; they have different pharmacodynamics, duration of action, and affinity for receptors, among other things, all of which translate to different risks and benefits. Consideration of treatment with the right formulation, at the right dose and time, and for the right patient will allow us to recommend safe, effective, and appropriate treatment for people with menopausal symptoms.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, consider addition of a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Generally, a woman without a uterus does not need to use a progestogen in addition to her estrogen therapy. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women who have a history of endometriosis may need a progestogen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.14)].

Use estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestogen at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Reevaluate postmenopausal women periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.

2.1 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms due to Menopause

Start therapy with Estradiol Transdermal System 0.025 mg per day applied to the skin once weekly. Make dosage adjustments based on the clinical response. Attempt to taper or discontinue Estradiol Transdermal System at 3 to 6 month intervals.

2.2 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Symptoms of Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy due to Menopause

Start therapy with Estradiol Transdermal System 0.025 mg per day applied to the skin once weekly. Make dosage adjustments based on the clinical response. Attempt to taper or discontinue Estradiol Transdermal System at 3 to 6 month intervals.

### Rethinking menopausal hormone therapy: for whom, what, when, and how long? [^116rfD6e]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) was widely used in the past, but with the publication of seminal primary and secondary prevention trials that reported an excess cardiovascular risk with combined estrogen-progestin, HT use declined significantly. However, over the past 20 years, much has been learned about the relationship between the timing of HT use with respect to age and time since menopause, HT route of administration, and cardiovascular disease risk. Four leading medical societies recommend HT for the treatment of menopausal women with bothersome menopausal symptoms. In this context, this review, led by the American College of Cardiology Cardiolovascular Disease in Women Committee, along with leading gynecologists, women's health internists, and endocrinologists, aims to provide guidance on HT use, including the selection of patients and HT formulation with a focus on caring for symptomatic women with cardiovascular disease risk.

### Esterified estrogens (Menest) [^117HTc8m]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

How should I take Menest?

Your healthcare provider will select the lowest appropriate dose of Menest, determine how frequently it will be taken, and determine the length of time you will be treated, depending on your condition.

For treatment of postmenopausal symptoms, the lowest dose that will control symptoms will be selected and used for the shortest amount of time.

In general, you will take Menest for several weeks, skip a week, and then begin taking Menest again. Again, your healthcare provider will discuss with you the instructions for taking Menest.

If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose, and go back to your normal schedule. Do not take 2 doses at the same time.

Estrogens should be used only as long as needed. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (for example, every 3 to 6 months) about whether you still need treatment with Menest.

What are the possible side effects of estrogens?

Less common but serious side effects include:

Breast cancer
Cancer of the uterus
Stroke
Heart attack
Blood clots
Dementia
Gallbladder disease
Ovarian cancer

These are some of the warning signs of serious side effects:

Breast lumps
Unusual vaginal bleeding
Dizziness and faintness
Changes in speech
Severe headaches
Chest pain
Shortness of breath
Pains in your legs
Changes in vision
Vomiting

### Estradiol (vivelle-dot) [^115XFJPh]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, consider addition of a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Generally, a woman without a uterus does not need to use a progestogen in addition to her estrogen therapy. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women who have a history of endometriosis may need a progestogen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.14)].

Use estrogen-alone or in combination with a progestogen at the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Reevaluate postmenopausal women periodically as clinically appropriate to determine whether treatment is still necessary.

2.1 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms due to Menopause

Start therapy with Vivelle-Dot 0.0375 mg per day applied to the skin twice weekly. Make dosage adjustments based on the clinical response. Initiate Vivelle-Dot at once in a woman not currently taking oral estrogens or in a woman switching from another estradiol transdermal therapy. In women who are currently taking oral estrogens, initiate treatment with Vivelle-Dot 1 week after withdrawal of oral hormone therapy, or sooner if menopausal symptoms reappear in less than 1 week. Attempts to taper or discontinue Vivelle-Dot at 3 to 6-month intervals.

Give Vivelle-Dot continuously in a woman who does not have an intact uterus. In a woman with an intact uterus, give Vivelle-Dot on a cyclic schedule (for example, 3 weeks on Vivelle-Dot followed by 1 week off Vivelle-Dot).

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111Nhbv6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Vaginal estrogen therapy — We recommend low-dose vaginal ET. (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕) Randomized controlled trials of low-dose vaginal estrogen products report rapid improvement of vaginal and urinary symptoms within 2 to 3 weeks, with objective improvements continuing at 12 weeks and maintained to 1 year. Limited evidence suggests that vaginal ET may prevent recurrent urinary tract infections and overactive bladder. Adverse effects include potential transfer to partner via penile or oral absorption and, with vaginal creams, residue on undergarments. During the initiation of therapy, vaginal atrophy may enhance systemic absorption, and when vaginal epithelium is restored, systemic absorption may decrease. Low-dose vaginal rings result in estradiol levels that remain within the normal postmenopausal range; however, bone resorption and lipid levels decrease, suggesting possible systemic effects, and insertion and removal at 3-month intervals may be difficult. For vaginal estradiol tablets, the 10-µg tablet provides standard twice weekly dosing, relieves vaginal symptoms by 8 weeks, is effective for at least 52 weeks, and therapy is initiated with daily administration for 2 weeks then twice weekly thereafter. Intermediate-dose estradiol tablets (25-µg) increase plasma estradiol from 3.1 ± 0.83 to 19.8 ± 6.1 pg/mL by 7 days, and an RCT of CEE vaginal cream ≥ 0.3 mg applied daily or twice weekly reported improvement in VVA by 12 weeks sustained for 52 weeks without reports of endometrial effects.

You may need to stop taking estrogens.

HOW SHOULD I TAKE ESTRADIOL TABLETS?

1. Start at the lowest dose and talk to your healthcare provider about how well that dose is working for you.

2. Estrogens should be used at the lowest dose possible for your treatment only as long as needed. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (for example, every 3 to 6 months) about the dose you are taking and whether you still need treatment with estradiol.

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF ESTROGENS?

Abstract

"The 2022 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society" (NAMS) updates "The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society" and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2017 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Advisory Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of hormone therapy differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing therapy. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and prevention of bone loss. For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or who are aged older than 60 years, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies in women without indications for use of systemic hormone therapy, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies (eg, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone or oral ospemifene) are recommended.

### Estradiol / norethindrone acetate transdermal system — combiPatch — estradiol / norethindrone acetate transdermal system [^117QpK3i]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Generally, when estrogen therapy is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus generally does not need a progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin. Use of estrogen-alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine whether treatment is still necessary. Adequate diagnostic measures, such as directed or random endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in a postmenopausal woman with a uterus with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.

Initiation of Therapy

Patients should be started at the lowest dose. Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. The lowest effective dose of CombiPatch has not been determined in clinical trials.

Women not currently using continuous estrogen or combination estrogen plus progestin therapy may start therapy with CombiPatch at any time. However, women currently using continuous estrogen or combination estrogen plus progestin therapy should complete the current cycle of therapy, before initiating CombiPatch therapy.

### Is it time to revisit the recommendations for initiation of menopausal hormone therapy? [^113Vxb4F]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies led to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) guidelines generally recommending the initiation of MHT be limited to women within 10 years of their menopause or before the age of 60 years. This recommendation has led to women who experience troublesome menopausal symptoms and who have not commenced MHT within these limits often being denied this type of therapy. Similarly, the majority of women who might benefit from the protective effects of MHT against bone loss and fracture are not offered this treatment option if they do not fit with these criteria. Based on review of the evidence that led to the conditional initiation of MHT, and subsequent studies, we propose that the recommendations regarding the initiation of MHT need to change to be more inclusive of women outside these chronological limits.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^116yxp7o]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent UK guideline concerning the management of unscheduled bleeding in women using HT has caused further confusion by recommending that women using high off-label estrogen doses should also receive a high off-label progestogen dose, to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. However, routinely prescribing high progestogen doses may cause side effects that limit adherence and is not necessary if women are "poor absorbers" and not exposed to unopposed estrogen. Indeed, increased use of HT in recent years, including "increasing numbers of women using high estrogen doses", has not been associated with an increased incidence of endometrial cancer.

Failing to emphasize that there is a paucity of safety data to inform dose recommendations, failing to acknowledge that the "lowest effective dose" might be an off-label dose for many women, and deliberately discouraging clinicians from prescribing off-label doses by exaggerating the potential (theoretical) risks of "overtreatment" while understating the (evidence-based) harms of undertreatment, has resulted in considerable anxiety and confusion for general practitioners (GPs) and women using HT in the UK. Many GPs no longer prescribe off-label doses, some have refused to prescribe HT altogether, and many women are turning to private menopause specialists because they are unable to access the care they need in the National Health Service.

The aims of this study were three-fold: 1) to measure the range in serum estradiol concentration in a real-world clinic cohort of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol; 2) to explore the association between serum estradiol concentration and estradiol dose, estradiol formulation, and age/menopause status; and 3) to estimate the number (%) of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with subtherapeutic levels despite using the highest licensed dose, who may require an off-label dose for clinical effect ("poor absorbers"). It is hoped that this will lead to an improved understanding of transdermal estradiol pharmacokinetics and enable clinicians to deliver more personalized, high quality menopause care.

### Effects of progestins in different hormone replacement therapy formulations on estrogen-induced lipid changes in postmenopausal women [^116UWnhs]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), used by many women to relieve the symptoms of menopause and for the prevention of osteoporosis, is available in an increasing number of formulations. Options include various combinations of estrogen and progestin as well as different routes of administration. For women with a uterus, who require a progestin, a convenient and commonly used option is combining the estrogen and progestin in a single pill. Such formulations have the lipid-modifying effects of estrogen, altered to specific type and dose of progestin used. The cardioprotective increases in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol associated with exogenous estrogen may be blunted or even reversed with certain HRT regimens. In addition, some progestins minimize the increase in triglycerides that occurs with exogenous estrogen, whereas others do not. Because of the importance of lipid markers as risk factors for cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women, these lipid effects should be carefully considered when selecting an HRT regimen.

### Menopausal hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114TgzZq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2005 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women.

Methods

The USPSTF commissioned a review of the literature to update evidence about the benefits and harms of using menopausal hormone therapy to prevent chronic conditions, as well as whether the benefits and harms of hormone therapy differ by population subgroups defined by age; the presence of comorbid medical conditions; and the type, dose, and method of hormonal delivery.

Population

This recommendation applies to postmenopausal women who are considering hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions. It does not apply to women who are considering hormone therapy for the management of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes or vaginal dryness. It also does not apply to women younger than 50 years who have had surgical menopause.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women. (Grade D recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against the use of estrogen for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy. (Grade D recommendation).

### Role of hormone therapy in the management of menopause [^114ExMCw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

There are many options available to address the quality of life and health concerns of menopausal women. The principal indication for hormone therapy (HT) is the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, and benefits generally outweigh risks for healthy women with bothersome symptoms who elect HT at the time of menopause. Although HT increases the risk of coronary heart disease, recent analyses confirm that this increased risk occurs principally in older women and those a number of years beyond menopause. These findings do not support a role for HT in the prevention of heart disease but provide reassurance regarding the safety of use for hot flushes and night sweats in otherwise healthy women at the menopausal transition. An increased risk of breast cancer with extended use is another reason short-term treatment is advised. Hormone therapy prevents and treats osteoporosis but is rarely used solely for this indication. If only vaginal symptoms are present, low-dose local estrogen therapy is preferred. Contraindications to HT use include breast or endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic disorders, and active liver disease. Alternatives to HT should be advised for women with or at increased risk for these disorders. The lowest effective estrogen dose should be provided for the shortest duration necessary because risks increase with increasing age, time since menopause, and duration of use. Women must be informed of the potential benefits and risks of all therapeutic options, and care should be individualized, based on a woman's medical history, needs, and preferences.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and cardiovascular disease: the role of formulation, dose, and route of delivery [^113ZS4Am]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

This mini-review provides an overview of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, with a focus on the role of hormone formulation, dose, and route of delivery.

Methods

This summary is based on authors' knowledge in the field of menopausal HT and supplemented by a PubMed search using the terms "menopause hormone therapy", "transdermal", "estradiol", "conjugated estrogens", "bioidentical", "cardiovascular disease", "lipoproteins", "glucose", "progestogens", "low dose".

Results

Available evidence indicates that oral unopposed estrogens have a favorable effect on lipoprotein levels, glycemia, insulin, and CVD risk; however, the addition of progestogens blunts the lipid-related effects. The progestogen with the smallest attenuating effect is micronized progesterone. Transdermal estrogens have less effect on coagulation, inflammation, and lipids than oral estrogens and observational studies suggest they pose a lower risk of venous thromboembolism and stroke than oral estrogens. Clinical effects of hormones were not consistently dose dependent.

Conclusions

Although HT continues to have an important role in menopause management, it is not recommended for primary or secondary CVD prevention. Different formulations, doses, and routes of delivery of HT have different effects on cardiometabolic markers and risks of clinical CVD events. However, long-term trials evaluating clinical outcomes with transdermal and other alternate HT regimens are limited.

### Recent analysis of hormone replacement therapy… [^117KXrUe]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Stuenkel and Barrett-Connor conducted a computer-based search to provide up-to-date recommendations for HRT. One use of HRT is relief of menopausal symptoms. Estrogen is the gold standard for treatment of hot flashes. No evidence has shown the benefit of estrogen-progestin combination therapy over unopposed estrogen therapy in reducing vasomotor symptoms. In women with vaginal dryness or urinary symptoms, topical estrogen therapy is as effective as systemic therapy. Local estrogen therapy is available in vaginal creams and other preparations, such as a silastic vaginal ring that requires replacement every three months. Vaginal estrogen therapy reduces the incidence of urinary tract infection, but the effect of HRT on urinary incontinence is less clear. Research on the cognitive and depressive symptoms occurring in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women have not shown a clear beneficial effect of HRT on anxiety, cognitive symptoms or affective disorders.

Evidence demonstrates that unopposed estrogen therapy reduces depressed moods more than the combination of estrogen with progesterone. Androgen replacement therapy may be associated with the greatest benefit. Estrogen is the treatment of choice in preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis-induced fractures. The timing of the initiation of HRT may be highly important, with more lifetime benefit occurring in women taking estrogen continuously from the start of menopause and only minimal difference in women starting therapy at 60 years of age. The National Osteoporosis Foundation has recently recommended starting HRT after the age of 60. Although
0. 625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen daily or its equivalent is the standard dosage for the prevention of bone loss, recent studies support the use of lower dosages, such as 0. 3 mg of esterified estrogen,
0. 5 mg of micronized estradiol or 0. 3 mg of conjugated equine estrogens.

The use of HRT appears to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and has also demonstrated positive changes in apolipoprotein and homocysteine levels, endothelial function and vascular reactivity. Results from clinical studies on the effect of estrogen in cardiovascular disease remain unclear. A major study showed an increase in short-term cardiac morbidity and mortality rates in women with preexisting coronary heart disease who received HRT for secondary prevention. Longer studies are needed to clarify this question.

### Sex and gender differences in clinical pharmacology: implications for transgender medicine [^1152YNMS]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS

During hormone therapy, high‐dose exogenous sex hormones replace the endogenous sex hormone profile in transgender adults. Clinicians may extrapolate drug–drug interaction data from the general adult population to predict the effect of hormone therapy on other prescribed medications. Transgender adults take pharmacologic doses of testosterone or estrogen, which cause significant physiologic changes and bidirectional changes in sex hormone concentrations. The following sections review sex‐related and gender‐related differences in major drug‐metabolizing and transport proteins, in addition to available sex‐hormone data, to address these complex outcomes and identify potential mechanisms of altered drug disposition in transgender adults. Where available, we also discuss pharmacokinetic data during pregnancy to examine the extent to which physiologic and hormonal changes may influence drug disposition.

### Do women need a change in dose of prescription drugs with onset of menopause? Time to find out [^1117bccv]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

These examples suggest that exposure to different drugs can either increase or decrease at menopause and that changes can be clinically relevant. We found several different examples in which CYP3A4 substrates reached significantly higher levels at menopause. As metabolism by CYP3A4 is a relevant factor for over 50% of drugs, a change in pharmacokinetics and drug exposure after menopause may be rather common. In contrast, we found an example of a CYP1A2 substrate, where blood levels decreased at menopause, to be expected given the inhibiting effects of estrogens on this enzyme. While such changes are often attributed to increasing age, our findings suggest that menopausal status itself may contribute independently to altered drug metabolism. Although drug dosage is frequently adjusted when patients age, this is often assumed to reflect chronological aging with less attention given to the physiological changes associated with menopause. Distinguishing age-related effects from those driven by the hormonal transition of menopause is challenging but clinically important for accurate dosing and better drug safety in women. Current prescribing guidelines do not account for menopausal status, which may contribute to a lack of awareness among clinicians when managing medication use in women of menopausal age.

Our search alerted us to the paucity in studies investigating potential effects of menopause. Yet, the possibility that menopause can be an important factor in drug availability is relevant for doctors of all medical disciplines. We therefore plead for more research into this subject. Investigating potential effects of menopausal status on pharmacokinetics is doable and feasible. Menopausal status should be determined during consultation as part of clinical routine and also as part of observational studies and randomized controlled trials to allow cross-sectional comparisons. In longitudinal cohort studies, premenopausal and menopausal drug concentrations should be examined to prospectively investigate menopausal effects. As such investigations take time, a rough estimate of the menopausal effect can already be obtained retrospectively by using data sets in large existing cohorts. Information on menopausal status can be estimated by comparing men and women of specific age groups; differentiation can be made between effects of aging (present in both sexes) or menopause (exclusively present in women). Mean menopausal age is 51 for Europe and 49 for the USA. Although interindividual variation is high, age can provide a rough approximation of menopausal status in larger samples.

We here advocate a medicine-wide effort to evaluate the influence of menopause, as this information is important to optimize pharmacotherapy for women. Such an effort is excellent value-for-money, as it can improve efficacy and prevent side effects in a large group of consumers.
