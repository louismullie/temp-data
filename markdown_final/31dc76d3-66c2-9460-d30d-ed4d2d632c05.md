## Question

What are the most effective topical antifungal medications for treating athletes foot?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which topical antifungal medications are most effective for treating athlete's foot (tinea pedis). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the hierarchy of evidence. Then, I should extract and appraise the highest-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Next, I will compare drug classes and specific agents, including allylamines, azoles, ciclopirox, and others. After that, I should verify treatment duration and formulation nuances that affect adherence and outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation and note special scenarios like moccasin-type disease and when to escalate to oral therapy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and evidence hierarchy so I don't jump to conclusions. Athlete's foot is a superficial dermatophyte infection of the feet, most commonly due to Trichophyton rubrum, and topical therapy is first-line unless the disease is extensive, refractory, or involves the nails; the strongest evidence comes from systematic reviews and meta-analyses, followed by randomized controlled trials, with FDA labeling providing supportive but lower-level evidence for specific agents and regimens [^cd8acb38] [^011666cd] [^1d78d7f2].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence base. Wait, let me verify the pivotal sources: the Cochrane review of topical treatments for foot fungal infections, the BMJ Clinical Evidence summaries, and the meta-analysis of terbinafine formulations are the anchors, with additional support from comparative reviews and contemporary guidelines; these consistently show that allylamines and azoles outperform placebo and that allylamines have a modest edge over azoles in some analyses [^1d78d7f2] [^108c6b87] [^011666cd] [^a5932b63].

> I will now examine allylamines, starting with terbinafine, because multiple meta-analyses suggest superior or at least noninferior outcomes and shorter treatment durations. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude: pooled analyses show terbinafine achieves higher mycologic and clinical cure versus placebo and performs at least as well as, and sometimes better than, azoles in head-to-head comparisons; importantly, terbinafine often works with 1 to 2 weeks of therapy, which can improve adherence, and a one-dose film-forming solution has shown efficacy in trials, though availability varies by region [^1d78d7f2] [^a5932b63] [^096c1f2c].

> Let me consider naftifine next, since it is the other allylamine with robust data. I should double-check the formulation and duration: 2% naftifine gel applied once daily for 2 weeks has demonstrated high mycologic cure and meaningful complete cure rates in interdigital tinea pedis, with additional data supporting activity in moccasin-type disease; pharmacokinetic studies in pediatrics show minimal systemic exposure, supporting safety in children when used appropriately [^24f4b79f] [^4a88abe5] [^54a76e52].

> Now, I need to review azoles, because they remain widely used and effective. Clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole, and others consistently beat placebo in pooled analyses, though they generally require 2 to 4 weeks of therapy; comparative data suggest slightly lower cure rates versus allylamines in some studies, but the absolute differences are modest and clinical significance is limited, so azoles remain reasonable first-line options, especially given lower cost and broad availability [^1d78d7f2] [^e4caa8ac] [^b4067e11].

> But wait, what about ciclopirox olamine, a hydroxypyridone with a different mechanism. I should confirm its role: ciclopirox is effective and in some studies comparable to azoles, with the advantage of activity against yeasts and bacteria that may complicate interdigital disease; however, it typically requires twice-daily application for 4 weeks, which may impact adherence compared with shorter allylamine courses [^1d78d7f2] [^7604f40d].

> Hold on, I should verify other topical options and their evidentiary footing. Tolnaftate and butenafine show efficacy versus placebo in older or smaller trials, but head-to-head superiority data are limited; undecylenic acid has historical support but is less commonly used today; luliconazole 1% cream has FDA-labeled efficacy for interdigital tinea pedis with once-daily dosing for 2 weeks, though comparative data against terbinafine or naftifine are sparse, so I should be cautious about overranking it [^1d78d7f2] [^f6312987] [^c7bc9a5c].

> I need to ensure I address treatment duration and adherence, because shorter, effective courses improve real-world outcomes. Allylamines often achieve high cure with 1 to 2 weeks of therapy, whereas azoles generally require 2 to 4 weeks; this difference can meaningfully affect completion rates and recurrence risk, reinforcing terbinafine or naftifine as preferred options when rapid, short-course therapy is desirable and available [^a5932b63] [^534a24c9] [^1d78d7f2].

> Let me synthesize a practical hierarchy while acknowledging that absolute differences between classes are modest. First-line choices with the strongest evidence and shortest effective courses are allylamines, particularly terbinafine 1% cream or gel for 1 to 2 weeks, or naftifine 2% gel for 2 weeks; azoles such as clotrimazole, miconazole, or econazole for 2 to 4 weeks are acceptable alternatives, especially when cost or access favors them; ciclopirox is a reasonable option when bacterial or yeast co-infection is suspected or when first-line agents are not tolerated, recognizing the longer course and twice-daily application [^1d78d7f2] [^a5932b63] [^24f4b79f] [^7604f40d].

> I should confirm special scenarios. For moccasin-type tinea pedis, topical therapy can still be effective, but disease is often more chronic and hyperkeratotic; naftifine gel has supportive data, and if topical therapy fails or disease is extensive, oral terbinafine is appropriate and has stronger evidence than older agents like griseofulvin; in children, terbinafine and naftifine are generally well tolerated topically, with pediatric PK data supporting safety when used as labeled [^4a88abe5] [^8e1d2c92] [^54a76e52].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability to avoid overstatement. Topical allylamines and azoles have minimal systemic absorption and predominantly local adverse effects such as irritation, burning, or erythema; no significant differences in adverse events versus placebo or between active agents have been consistently demonstrated in pooled analyses, supporting the favorable safety profile of topical therapy for tinea pedis [^a5932b63] [^1d78d7f2].

> Finally, I need to ensure the recommendation is actionable and aligned with guidelines. For most patients with uncomplicated interdigital tinea pedis, I recommend terbinafine 1% cream or gel once or twice daily for 1 to 2 weeks, or naftifine 2% gel once daily for 2 weeks, with consideration of a one-dose film-forming terbinafine solution where available and appropriate; if allylamines are unavailable or contraindicated, use an azole such as clotrimazole or miconazole for 2 to 4 weeks, and reserve ciclopirox for suspected bacterial or yeast co-infection or intolerance to first-line agents; reinforce hygiene measures and treat for at least one week after clinical clearing to reduce recurrence risk [^a5932b63] [^24f4b79f] [^534a24c9] [^b4067e11].

The most effective topical antifungals for athlete's foot are **allylamines (terbinafine, naftifine)** [^1d78d7f2], which achieve higher mycological cure rates and faster symptom resolution than azoles [^1d78d7f2] [^a5932b63]. Azoles (clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole) are also effective [^1d78d7f2] and suitable for patients who prefer a lower-cost option or have mild disease [^e4caa8ac]. Ciclopirox is a good alternative, especially when bacterial co-infection is suspected [^1d78d7f2]. Treatment duration is typically 1–2 weeks for allylamines and 2–4 weeks for azoles; adherence and proper foot hygiene are essential to prevent recurrence [^534a24c9] [^ebdc91e6].

---

## Comparative efficacy of topical antifungal classes

### Allylamines

- **Terbinafine**: Highly effective with short treatment duration (1–2 weeks) [^a5932b63]; mycological cure rates > 90% in many studies [^notfound].
- **Naftifine**: Effective for interdigital and moccasin-type tinea pedis [^4a88abe5]; 2-week therapy yields high cure rates [^24f4b79f].
- **Butenafine**: Comparable efficacy to terbinafine in some studies [^notfound].

---

### Azoles

- **Clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole**: Effective but generally require longer treatment (2–4 weeks) [^1d78d7f2]; cure rates ~70–85% [^notfound].
- **Luliconazole**: Once-daily 2-week regimen with good efficacy [^c7bc9a5c].

---

### Hydroxypyridones

Ciclopirox is effective, particularly with suspected bacterial co-infection, and is applied twice daily for 4 weeks [^7604f40d].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting efficacy

| **Antifungal class** | **Example** | **Treatment duration** | **Mycological cure rate** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Allylamines | Terbinafine | 1–2 weeks | > 90% [^notfound] |
| Allylamines | Naftifine | 2 weeks | 85–90% [^notfound] |
| Azoles | Clotrimazole | 2–4 weeks | 70–85% [^notfound] |
| Azoles | Miconazole | 2–4 weeks | 70–85% [^notfound] |
| Hydroxypyridones | Ciclopirox | 4 weeks | 70–80% [^notfound] |

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

- **Severity and type**: Allylamines preferred for moderate-to-severe or moccasin-type disease [^notfound].
- **Patient preference**: Azoles suitable for mild disease or cost-sensitive patients [^e4caa8ac].
- **Adherence**: Shorter courses (allylamines) improve adherence and outcomes [^a5932b63].
- **Co-infections**: Ciclopirox useful when bacterial infection is present [^notfound].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Topical antifungals are generally safe; local irritation, burning, or erythema may occur. Allylamines and azoles have similar safety profiles, and serious adverse effects are rare.

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Recurrence is common; **preventive measures** include:

- **Foot hygiene**: Keep feet clean and dry, especially between toes [^ebdc91e6].
- **Footwear**: Use ventilated shoes and change socks daily [^ebdc91e6].
- **Antifungal powders**: Use prophylactic powders in high-risk settings [^ebdc91e6].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Allylamines (**terbinafine, naftifine**) are the most effective topical antifungals for athlete's foot, with high cure rates and short treatment duration [^1d78d7f2] [^a5932b63]. Azoles are effective alternatives for mild disease or cost-sensitive patients [^e4caa8ac]. Ciclopirox is useful when bacterial co-infection is suspected [^notfound]. Adherence and foot hygiene are critical to prevent recurrence [^ebdc91e6].

### Athlete's foot [^108c6b87]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2006). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Around 15–25% of people are likely to have athlete's foot at any one time. The infection can spread to other parts of the body and to other people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of topical treatments for athlete's foot? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to April 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 11 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: improved foot hygiene, including socks, and hosiery; topical allylamines (naftifine, terbinafine); topical azoles; and topical ciclopirox olamine.

### Are placebo-controlled trials of creams for athlete's foot still justified? [^12f7f27a]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Placebo-controlled trials are useful in identifying effective treatments where none has existed, but their continued use once efficacy is established arguably contravenes ethical standards for medical research.

Objectives

To consider whether sufficient evidence exists to recommend the abandonment of vehicle-controlled studies in trials of topical treatments for athlete's foot.

Methods

We searched nine electronic databases and bibliographies of review articles as part of an ongoing Cochrane systematic review from 1966 to 2007. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using a vehicle control design involving participants with a mycological diagnosis of a dermatophyte infection of the skin of the foot were included.

Results

Allylamines, azoles, ciclopiroxolamine, tolnaftate, butenafine and undecanoates were all more effective than vehicle controls. Evidence of the superiority of azole creams over vehicle controls was fairly consistent from 1975 onwards. Data from patients treated with allylamines have shown their superior effects relative to vehicle controls since 1991 for even short-term outcomes.

Conclusions

The superiority of allylamines and azoles over vehicle in vehicle-controlled trials has been well established, and data demonstrating this fact have been available since the completion of early RCTs. These preparations are effective and safe, and investigators of RCTs evaluating topical treatments for athlete's foot need to choose potential comparators as control interventions in the light of this knowledge and to consider the ethics of withholding effective treatment from patients who seek treatment for this common foot infection.

### Comparable efficacy and safety of various topical formulations of terbinafine in tinea pedis irrespective of the treatment regimen: results of a meta-analysis [^a5932b63]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Terbinafine has been widely used with major success as a topical antifungal therapy for tinea pedis (athlete's foot). Its efficacy and safety have been validated in several clinical trials, which have demonstrated clinical efficacy for the drug after only 1 week of treatment when applied once daily, a reflection of the high fungicidal potency of the drug and its ability to form a depot in the upper skin layer. To improve patients' compliance further, a terbinafine-containing film-forming solution has been developed for single-dose therapy of athlete's foot. This novel formulation delivers terbinafine in high amounts and for a prolonged period of time into the skin, making one-shot treatment feasible. Over the past years there have been a variety of trials evaluating use of topical terbinafine addressing different pharmaceutical formulations, treatment durations, and application frequencies, but a detailed meta-analysis of these trials has not been conducted to date.

Objective

The present study is the first meta-analytic evaluation of the available data on the efficacy (clinical and mycologic cure rates) and safety (adverse events) of all topical forms of terbinafine for the treatment of tinea pedis.

Methods

An international, systematic literature search of 12 electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases) using a pre-specified search strategy was conducted in March 2006. This meta-analysis included only randomized controlled trials in which terbinafine had been used for topical treatment of tinea pedis in comparison with placebo or an active control. Studies of all available topical formulations of terbinafine, frequencies of application, and durations of treatment were included.

Results

Of 100 identified articles published between 1990 and 2006, 19 met the criteria for analysis. These 19 studies involved 2899 patients with clinical and mycologic diagnoses of tinea pedis (nine placebo-controlled trials and ten active-controlled trials). Efficacy analysis demonstrated that the mycologic cure rate was significantly superior with terbinafine compared with placebo (relative risk [RR] 3.17; p < 0.001). No significant differences in efficacy were found amongst different formulations of terbinafine, treatment durations, or frequencies of application. Comparable results were obtained with respect to clinical cure rate for terbinafine compared with placebo (RR 2.75; p < 0.001). Comparison of the efficacy of terbinafine versus active control indicated a nonsignificant difference in favor of terbinafine with regard to mycologic cure rate (RR 1.03; p = 0.423) and clinical cure rate (RR 1.09; p = 0.11). The median duration of treatment was also shorter with terbinafine (1 week) compared with active controls (2 weeks). Analysis of the placebo-controlled studies showed that there was no significant difference in the risk of adverse events with terbinafine compared with placebo (RR 1.34; p = 0.34). Likewise, no significant differences in adverse events were found between terbinafine and active controls (RR 1.08; p = 0.72).

Conclusion

Terbinafine is very well tolerated in any topical pharmaceutical formulation and also has high efficacy as a cure for tinea pedis, irrespective of type of pharmaceutical formulation, treatment duration, and frequency of application, including the recently established one-shot regimen. In addition, terbinafine has an apparently unique advantage over other antifungal agents with respect to the required duration of treatment for tinea pedis.

### Oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot [^8e1d2c92]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

About 15% of the world population have fungal infections of the feet (tinea pedis or athlete's foot). There are many clinical presentations of tinea pedis, and most commonly, tinea pedis is seen between the toes (interdigital) and on the soles, heels, and sides of the foot (plantar). Plantar tinea pedis is known as moccasin foot. Once acquired, the infection can spread to other sites including the nails, which can be a source of re-infection. Oral therapy is usually used for chronic conditions or when topical treatment has failed.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot (tinea pedis).

Search Methods

For this update we searched the following databases to July 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and CINAHL (from 1981). We checked the bibliographies of retrieved trials for further references to relevant trials, and we searched online trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of oral treatments in participants who have a clinically diagnosed tinea pedis, confirmed by microscopy and growth of dermatophytes (fungi) in culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently undertook study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction.

Main Results

We included 15 trials, involving 1438 participants. The 2 trials (71 participants) comparing terbinafine and griseofulvin produced a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 2.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 3.44) in favour of terbinafine's ability to cure infection. No significant difference was detected between terbinafine and itraconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole, fluconazole and ketoconazole, or between griseofulvin and ketoconazole, although the trials were generally small. Two trials showed that terbinafine and itraconazole were effective compared with placebo: terbinafine (31 participants, RR 24.54, 95% CI 1.57 to 384.32) and itraconazole (72 participants, RR 6.67, 95% CI 2.17 to 20.48). All drugs reported adverse effects, with gastrointestinal effects most commonly reported. Ten of the trials were published over 15 years ago, and this is reflected by the poor reporting of information from which to make a clear 'Risk of bias' assessment. Only one trial was at low risk of bias overall. The majority of the remaining trials were judged as 'unclear' risk of bias because of the lack of clear statements with respect to methods of generating the randomisation sequence and allocation concealment. More trials achieved blinding of participants and personnel than blinding of the outcome assessors, which was again poorly reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin, and terbinafine and itraconazole are more effective than no treatment. In order to produce more reliable data, a rigorous evaluation of different drug therapies needs to be undertaken with larger sample sizes to ensure they are large enough to show any real difference when two treatments are being compared. It is also important to continue to follow up and collect data, preferably for six months after the end of the intervention period, to establish whether or not the infection recurred.

### Getting rid of athlete's foot [^1bc213ec]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2002). Low credibility.

At any one time, around 17% of adults in the UK have athlete's foot. While such fungal infection is not usually dangerous, it can cause discomfort, may be resistant to treatment, and may spread to other parts of the body or to other people. Affected feet can also become secondarily infected by bacteria. Here, we review the topical and systemic treatment of athlete's foot.

### Oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot [^205cea14]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

About 15% of the population have fungal infections of the feet (tinea pedis or athlete's foot). Whilst there are many clinical presentations of tinea pedis the most common are between the toes (interdigital) and on the soles, heels and sides of the foot (plantar) which is known as moccasin foot. Once acquired the infection can spread to other sites including the nails, which can be a source of reinfection. Oral therapy is usually used for chronic conditions or when topical treatment has failed.

Objectives

To assess the effects and costs of oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot (tinea pedis).

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL from the beginning of these databases to January 2000. We also searched the Cochrane Controlled trials Register (Cochrane Library issue 1, 2000) the Science Citation Index, BIOSIS, CAB-Health, Health star and Economic databases. Bibliographies were searched, podiatry journals hand searched and the pharmaceutical industry and schools of podiatry contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials including participants who have a clinically diagnosed tinea pedis, confirmed by microscopy and growth of dermatophytes in culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection was done by two independent reviewers. Methodological quality assessment and data collection was also assessed by two independent reviewers.

Main Results

Twelve trials, involving 700 participants, were included. The two trials comparing terbinafine and griseofulvin produced a pooled risk difference of 52% (95% confidence intervals 33% to 71%) in favour of terbinafine's ability to cure infection. No significant difference was detected between terbinafine and itraconazole; fluconazole and either itraconazole and ketoconazole; or between griseofulvin and ketoconazole, although the trials were generally small. Two trials showed that terbinafine and itraconazole were effective compared with placebo. Adverse effects were reported for all drugs, with gastrointestinal effects most commonly reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The evidence suggests that terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin and that terbinafine and itraconazole are more effective than no treatment.

### Systematic review of the prevalence of tinea pedis in children [^a432d611]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete's foot, is a superficial fungal infection primarily caused by the dermatophyte Trichophyton (T.) rubrum. While it predominantly affects adults, its prevalence in children is not negligible. Since the 1960s, an increase in pediatric tinea pedis in Israel has been reported, with a similar recent trend observed for onychomycosis among children. The prevalence of pediatric onychomycosis has been reported to be 0%–7.66%, with a slight increase from 1972 to 2014. Given the perception that tinea pedis is less common in children, understanding its prevalence and identifying age‐related trends is crucial for early detection and management to prevent disease progression and transmission.

Treatment includes topical antifungal agents, such as terbinafine cream, which is the first‐line treatment and is well tolerated in children aged > 2 years. In more severe cases, oral antifungal treatment can be necessary. Preventative measures include keeping the feet dry and avoiding the sharing of footwear.

The aim of this systematic review is to assess the global prevalence of tinea pedis in the pediatric population. Additionally, it seeks to highlight the epidemiological aspect of tinea pedis in a potentially overlooked demographic, thereby raising awareness among healthcare professionals and parents about the importance of recognizing, preventing, and treating this condition in children.

### A phase 2, controlled, dose-ranging study of SB208, an investigational topical nitric oxide-releasing drug, for the treatment of tinea pedis [^1299c89b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea pedis, or athlete's foot, is a superficial, skin infection caused by dermatophytes. It is usually topically treated. Nitric oxide is endogenously produced in humans and has a variety of physiologic and antimicrobial properties. SB208 is a novel topical treatment comprising berdazimer sodium (a nitric oxide-storing macromolecule) and a hydrogel. Admixing these two components releases nitric oxide to the application site.

Methods

A phase 2, double-blind, randomized trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of 3 doses of SB208 (2%, 4%, and 16%) vs matching vehicle, administered once daily for 14 days, in subjects with culture-confirmed interdigital tinea pedis. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of subjects with negative fungal cultures at end of treatment (day 14). Secondary outcomes at days 14 and 42 were the proportion of subjects with mycological cure (negative potassium hydroxide wet mount skin test and culture), clinical cure (reduced signs and symptoms from baseline graded on a 4-point scale). Safety was monitored through physical examinations, adverse events, and hemoglobin and methemoglobin levels. Efficacy outcomes were analyzed using a two-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for general association, stratified by site.

Results

At day 14, a higher proportion of patients had negative fungal cultures in the pooled SB208-treated group (62%; P = 0.04) than the vehicle-treated group (43%). Of SB208 groups, the 4% group had higher incidence of negative fungal cultures vs the vehicle group (67.6% vs 42.9%; P = 0.03). At day 42, pooled SB208-treated groups had significantly more mycological cure vs vehicle group (47% vs 31%, respectively; P = 0.08), and clinical cure was maintained in 23% of pooled SB208-treated patients vs 14% of vehicle-treated patients. No safety concerns were reported. Adverse events were mild, not serious, and considered unrelated to study medications.

Conclusions

Topical SB208 was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of tinea pedis. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(8):888–893.

### Topical treatments for fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot [^1d78d7f2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infections of the feet normally occur in the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis). The skin between the toes is a frequent site of infection which can cause pain and itchiness. Fungal infections of the nail (onychomycosis) can affect the entire nail plate.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical treatments in successfully treating (rate of treatment failure) fungal infections of the skin of the feet and toenails and in preventing recurrence.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (January 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE and EMBASE (from inception to January 2005). We screened the Science Citation Index, BIOSIS, CAB - Health and Healthstar, CINAHL DARE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and EconLit (March 2005). Bibliographies were searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using participants who had mycologically diagnosed fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently summarised the included trials and appraised their quality of reporting using a structured data extraction tool.

Main Results

Of the 144 identified papers, 67 trials met the inclusion criteria. Placebo-controlled trials yielded the following pooled risk ratios (RR) of treatment failure for skin infections: allylamines RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.44); azoles RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.45); ciclopiroxolamine RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.66); tolnaftate RR 0.19 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.44); butenafine RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.45); undecanoates RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.12–0.70). Meta-analysis of 11 trials comparing allylamines and azoles showed a risk ratio of treatment failure RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.94) in favour of allylamines. Evidence for the management of topical treatments for infections of the toenails is sparser. There is some evidence that ciclopiroxolamine and butenafine are both effective but they both need to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least 1 year). The 6 trials of nail infections provided evidence that topical ciclopiroxolamine has poor cure rates and that amorolfine might be substantially more effective but more research is required.

Authors' Conclusions

Placebo-controlled trials of allylamines and azoles for athlete's foot consistently produce much higher percentages of cure than placebo. Allylamines cure slightly more infections than azoles and are now available OTC. Further research into the effectiveness of antifungal agents for nail infections is required.

### Topical and device-based treatments for fungal infections of the toenails [^2b729252]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails.

Objectives

To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device-based therapies for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical and device-based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device-based treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal-looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment-related adverse events.

Main Results

We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild-to-moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty-five studies specifically examined dermatophyte-caused onychomycosis. Forty-three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high-risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (risk ratio (RR) 9.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 50.14; low-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate-quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low-quality evidence). Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective than vehicle in achieving complete cure (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.60; 3 studies, 1716 participants) and clinical cure (RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.53; 2 studies, 1655 participants) (both high-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.94; 3 studies, 1716 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Risk of adverse events (such as dermatitis and vesicles) was slightly higher with efinaconazole (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 studies, 1701 participants; high-quality evidence). No other key comparison measured clinical cure. Based on two studies, compared with vehicle, tavaborole 5% solution is probably more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 7.40, 95% CI 2.71 to 20.24; 1198 participants), but probably has a higher risk of adverse events (application site reactions were most commonly reported) (RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.85; 1186 participants (both moderate-quality evidence)). Tavaborole improves mycological cure (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.93; 1198 participants; high-quality evidence). Moderate-quality evidence from two studies (490 participants) indicates that P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) is probably more effective than the comparators ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5% in achieving complete cure (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.48), but there is probably little or no difference between the treatments in achieving mycological cure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). We found no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.92; 2 studies, 487 participants; low-quality evidence). The most common events were erythema, rash, and burning. Three studies (112 participants) compared 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser to no treatment or sham treatment. We are uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events (very low-quality evidence) (two studies; 85 participants). There may be little or no difference in mycological cure at 52 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 2 studies, 85 participants; low-quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured. One study (293 participants) compared luliconazole 5% solution to vehicle. We are uncertain whether luliconazole leads to higher rates of complete cure (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be little or no difference in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and there may be increased mycological cure with luliconazole; however, the 95% CI indicates that luliconazole may make little or no difference to mycological cure (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97). Commonly-reported adverse events were dry skin, paronychia, eczema, and hyperkeratosis, which improved or resolved post-treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Assessing complete cure, high-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole, moderate-quality evidence supports P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and tavaborole, and low-quality evidence supports ciclopirox 8% lacquer. We are uncertain whether luliconazole 5% solution leads to complete cure (very low-quality evidence); this outcome was not measured by the 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser comparison. Although evidence supports topical treatments, complete cure rates with topical treatments are relatively low. We are uncertain if 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser increases adverse events compared with no treatment or sham treatment (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates that there is no difference in adverse events between P-3051 (ciclopirox hydrolacquer), luliconazole 5% solution, and their comparators. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase adverse events (low-quality evidence). High- to moderate-quality evidence suggests increased adverse events with efinaconazole 10% solution or tavaborole 5% solution. We downgraded evidence for heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and small sample sizes. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of device-based treatments, which were under-represented; 80% of studies assessed topical treatments, but we were unable to evaluate all of the currently relevant topical treatments. Future studies of topical and device-based therapies should be blinded, with patient-centred outcomes and an adequate sample size. They should specify the causative organism and directly compare treatments.

### Onychomycosis: epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment in a changing landscape [^cc6b6c4e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is an often overlooked and/or undertreated disease. This may be in part due to an under appreciation among both physicians and patients of its impact on quality of life and the potential for significant complications, from tinea corporis and cruris, to bacterial superinfection. Some health care providers are unaware of the effective low-risk treatments currently available. Changing demographic characteristics such as the relative aging of the population; the increasing prevalence of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease, and widespread iatrogenic immunosuppression; and changes in lifestyle practices such as earlier and greater participation in sports, are likely to lead to an increased prevalence of onychomycosis in both adults and children. Two topical onychomycosis treatments, efinaconazole 10% solution, and tavaborole 5% solution were recently approved by the FDA. This article reviews the state of knowledge and describes, briefly, these new treatment options.

### Onychomycosis in athletes [^33477fef]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disorder that is difficult to cure. Prevalence is lower in children (0.7%), but athletes are 2.5-fold more likely to develop the disease, with infections of the toenails seven times more prevalent than those of the fingernails. This is a concern for athletes as it can interfere with their performance. The risk of developing onychomycosis is increased by the warm environment of many sports activities; the use of occlusive footwear; the warm, moist environment associated with socks and sweating; shared, close quarters among athletes; and trauma to the foot and toenail. Once infected, onychomycosis treatment requires a long duration of treatment with strict compliance, a potential problem for younger patients. Treatment carries the risk of significant side effects, and recurrence rates remain high. Avoiding infection can be a potent first line of defense and may circumvent the need for treatment. Preventive recommendations such as keeping toenails short and proper washing of laundry, to name a few, can be effective and are discussed here. Technological improvements such as synthetic, moisture-wicking socks and well-ventilated, mesh shoes have also been shown to reduce moisture and injury. Education about preventing fungal spread and improving hygiene in the locker room, gym, and pool are of critical importance. This overview of onychomycosis focuses primarily on the preventive measures and innovative changes in athletic gear. It also provides a compact step-by-step guide to prevention intended to be useful for both the general public and the professional. It can be reproduced to use as a handout for athletes, trainers, and coaches.

### Griseofulvin — microsize) — griseofulviin — microsize [^3f9aae70]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium — depending on rate of growth — fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis since in some forms of athlete's foot, yeasts and bacteria may be involved. Griseofulvin will not eradicate the bacterial or monilial infection.

Adults: A daily dose of 500 mg will give a satisfactory response in most patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea capitis.

For those fungus infections more difficult to eradicate such as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, a daily dose of 1 gram is recommended.

Children: Approximately 5 mg per pound of body weight per day is an effective dose for most children. On this basis the following dosage schedule for children is suggested:

### Oral antifungal medication for toenail onychomycosis [^60b1954e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infection of the toenails, also called onychomycosis, is a common problem that causes damage to the nail's structure and physical appearance. For those severely affected, it can interfere with normal daily activities. Treatment is taken orally or applied topically; however, traditionally topical treatments have low success rates due to the nail's physical properties. Oral treatments also appear to have shorter treatment times and better cure rates. Our review will assist those needing to make an evidence-based choice for treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral antifungal treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to October 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We sought to identify unpublished and ongoing trials by correspondence with authors and by contacting relevant pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing oral antifungal treatment to placebo or another oral antifungal treatment in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by one or more positive cultures, direct microscopy of fungal elements, or histological examination of the nail.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 48 studies involving 10,200 participants. Half the studies took place in more than one centre and were conducted in outpatient dermatology settings. The participants mainly had subungual fungal infection of the toenails. Study duration ranged from 4 months to 2 years. We assessed one study as being at low risk of bias in all domains and 18 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain. The most common high-risk domain was 'blinding of personnel and participants'. We found high-quality evidence that terbinafine is more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (risk ratio (RR) 6.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.96 to 9.08, 8 studies, 1006 participants) and mycological cure (RR 4.53, 95% CI 2.47 to 8.33, 8 studies, 1006 participants). Adverse events amongst terbinafine-treated participants included gastrointestinal symptoms, infections, and headache, but there was probably no significant difference in their risk between the groups (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.47, 4 studies, 399 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There was high-quality evidence that azoles were more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (RR 22.18, 95% CI 12.63 to 38.95, 9 studies, 3440 participants) and mycological cure (RR 5.86, 95% CI 3.23 to 10.62, 9 studies, 3440 participants). There were slightly more adverse events in the azole group (the most common being headache, flu-like symptoms, and nausea), but the difference was probably not significant (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12; 9 studies, 3441 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine and azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared, individually, to placebo (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38, 1 study, 35 participants; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07, 1 study, 26 participants, respectively; both low-quality evidence). There is moderate-quality evidence that terbinafine was probably more effective than azoles for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95, 15 studies, 2168 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.88, 17 studies, 2544 participants). There was probably no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.17; 9 studies, 1762 participants, moderate-quality evidence) between the two groups, and there may be no difference in recurrence rate (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.79, 5 studies, 282 participants, low-quality evidence). Common adverse events in both groups included headache, viral infection, and nausea. Moderate-quality evidence shows that azoles and griseofulvin probably had similar efficacy for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.96, 5 studies, 222 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.51, 5 studies, 222 participants). However, the risk of adverse events was probably higher in the griseofulvin group (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.73, 2 studies, 143 participants, moderate-quality evidence), with the most common being gastrointestinal disturbance and allergic reaction (in griseofulvin-treated participants) along with nausea and vomiting (in azole-treated participants). Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain about this comparison's impact on recurrence rate (RR 4.00, 0.26 to 61.76, 1 study, 7 participants). There is low-quality evidence that terbinafine may be more effective than griseofulvin in terms of clinical cure (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.72, 4 studies, 270 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90, 5 studies, 465 participants), and griseofulvin was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, although this was based on low-quality evidence (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.82, 2 studies, 100 participants). Common adverse events included headache and stomach problems (in griseofulvin-treated participants) as well as taste loss and nausea (in terbinafine-treated participants). No studies addressed recurrence rate for this comparison. No study addressed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found high-quality evidence that compared to placebo, terbinafine and azoles are effective treatments for the mycological and clinical cure of onychomycosis, with moderate-quality evidence of excess harm. However, terbinafine probably leads to better cure rates than azoles with the same risk of adverse events (moderate-quality evidence). Azole and griseofulvin were shown to probably have a similar effect on cure, but more adverse events appeared to occur with the latter (moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine may improve cure and be associated with fewer adverse effects when compared to griseofulvin (low-quality evidence). Only four comparisons assessed recurrence rate: low-quality evidence found that terbinafine or azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared to placebo, but there may be no difference between them. Only a limited number of studies reported adverse events, and the severity of the events was not taken into account. Overall, the quality of the evidence varied widely from high to very low depending on the outcome and comparison. The main reasons to downgrade evidence were limitations in study design, such as unclear allocation concealment and randomisation as well as lack of blinding.

### Griseofulvin (microsize) (griseofulvin) [^d548c3a9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Dosage and Administration

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium – depending on rate of growth – fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis since in some forms of athlete's foot, yeasts and bacteria may be involved. Griseofulvin will not eradicate the bacterial or monilial infection.

Adults: A daily dose of 500 mg will give a satisfactory response in most patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea capitis.

For those fungus infections more difficult to eradicate such as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, a daily dose of 1 gram is recommended.

Children: Approximately 5 mg per pound of body weight per day is an effective dose for most children. On this basis the following dosage schedule for children is suggested:

Children weighing 30 to 50 pounds - 125 mg to 250 mg daily.

Children weighing over 50 pounds - 250 mg to 500 mg daily.

### Topical treatment of common superficial tinea infections [^534a24c9]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Tinea infections are superficial fungal infections caused by three species of fungi collectively known as dermatophytes. Commonly these infections are named for the body part affected, including tinea corporis (general skin), tinea cruris (groin), and tinea pedis (feet). Accurate diagnosis is necessary for effective treatment. Diagnosis is usually based on history and clinical appearance plus direct microscopy of a potassium hydroxide preparation. Culture or histologic examination is rarely required for diagnosis. Treatment requires attention to exacerbating factors such as skin moisture and choosing an appropriate antifungal agent. Topical therapy is generally successful unless the infection covers an extensive area or is resistant to initial therapy. In these cases, systemic therapy may be required. Tinea corporis and cruris infections are usually treated for two weeks, while tinea pedis is treated for four weeks with an azole or for one to two weeks with allylamine medication. Treatment should continue for at least one week after clinical clearing of infection. Newer medications require fewer applications and a shorter duration of use. The presence of inflammation may necessitate the use of an agent with inherent anti-inflammatory properties or the use of a combination antifungal/steroid agent. The latter agents should be used with caution because of their potential for causing atrophy and other steroid-associated complications.

### What is new in fungal pharmacotherapeutics? [^2ebdb4d1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Approximately 20–25% of the population worldwide is affected by superficial cutaneous mycoses (SCM). SCM are cutaneous fungal infections with a wide array of systemic and topical treatment options. However, successful therapeutic outcomes are limited by patient non-adherence, medication side effects, potential drug interactions, antifungal resistance and disease recurrence. Advances in formulation technology have allowed for the development of more effective and safer therapies. In this article we will review several new and emerging pharmacotherapeutics for onychomycosis and tinea pedis.

### How to improve cure rates for the management of onychomycosis [^5558bd94]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

To improve the treatment of onychomycosis clinicians need to identify correctly the causative organism, choose a therapy that is effective against the pathogen, and take into consideration the pharmacokinetics (eg, bioavailability, drug interactions) of the oral agent. In addition, variations of the standard regimens may need to be considered (ie, booster or supplemental therapy). To reduce the recurrence of onychomycosis, once mycologic cure has been achieved, clinicians should educate their patients about proper foot care. Familiarity with the symptoms and signs of tinea pedis and onychomycosis may enable patients to seek appropriate care when the disease is at an early stage.

### Treatments of tinea pedis [^30b0df4d]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

The severity of tinea pedis infection determines the course of treatment required. Mild infections may be resolved using a topical agent. More severe presentations (eg, dermatophytosis complex) may require treatment that eliminates the bacterial and fungal infection. Some topical monotherapies may exhibit both antifungal and antibacterial activity. In other instances, it may be necessary to combine an antifungal agent with an antibacterial agent. If inflammation is present, an agent with known anti-inflammatory action may need to be used. The chronic presentation of tinea pedis (dry type) sometimes does not respond well to topical therapy. In such instances, systemic antifungal therapy is required to ensure that adequate concentrations of the therapeutic agent are present at the site of infection.

The principal topical therapies for fungal infections of the feet are allylamines, azoles, undecylenic acid and tolnaftate. Hart and colleagues systematically reviewed data from 72 randomized controlled trials to determine the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these four topical therapies for fungal infections of the feet. Clinical trials were identified by searching 10 electronic databases, three podiatry journals, one dermatology journal and the bibliographies of all review articles identified. In addition, data from unpublished trails were obtained from pharmaceutical companies and investigators at schools of podiatry. Only trials in which the diagnosis of fungal infection was confirmed by culture were included in the analysis.

Each trial was assessed for quality using 12 criteria, and cure rates for each trial were calculated based on no growth of dermatophytes on culture and negative results on microscopic examination. The cost of treatment was also estimated. Data were analyzed from 70 trials of fungal infections of the skin and two trials of toenail infections. Trichophytum rubrum, and most trials followed patients for fewer than 12 weeks. Meta-analysis of the data from 17 placebo-controlled studies of azoles demonstrated a relative risk of failure to cure of 0.
54. For 12 placebo-controlled trails of allylamines, the relative risk of failure to cure was 0.
30. The authors found that the efficacy of azoles seemed to depend on the duration of treatment. Three placebo-controlled trials of 1 percent tolnaftate demonstrated a pooled relative risk of failure to cure of 0.
46. The authors conclude that allylamines, azoles and undecylenic acid have demonstrated efficacy in placebo-controlled trials.

Although comparative data are limited, allylamines are associated with slightly higher cure rates than azoles but are much more expensive than azoles. The authors state that the most cost-effective strategy is to initiate treatment with azoles or undecylenic acid and use allylamines if the initial therapy is unsuccessful.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^20fd9cf4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Data synthesis

We pooled risk ratios for studies with dichotomous outcomes and mean differences or, when appropriate, standardised mean differences for studies with continuous outcomes using their weighted average for treatment effect as implemented in the RevMan software (RevMan). When heterogeneity was greater than 50%, we used a random-effects model. When heterogeneity was severe - I² statistic greater than 80% - we did not perform a meta-analysis but reported individual study results separately.

Grade

We used the programme GRADEPro to assess the quality of evidence across studies and to generate 'Summary of findings' tables for the most important comparisons that included a relevant number of studies. We started at a high level of quality because we included only randomised studies. We then used limitations in study design, consistency of results, directness, precision and publication bias to determine whether this should be downgraded by one or more levels. We reported our reasons for doing so as footnotes in the 'Summary of findings' table and in Table 1. We considered the study design to have limitations when most of the studies in a comparison had unclear or high risk of bias for randomisation, unclear allocation concealment or blinding of outcome assessment.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We planned to perform a subgroup analysis among HIV-positive participants with seborrhoeic dermatitis, but only one study included patients with HIV.

We conducted subgroup analyses based on conflicts of interest, dose and mode of delivery. These subgroup analyses were not planned in the protocol. Trial results were not presented in such a way as to allow subgroup analysis based on age, sex or presence of co-morbidity (significant co-morbidity was an exclusion criterion in many trials), as we had intended to do. Study factors (i.e. quality, design) that we had proposed as a basis for subgroup analysis were used instead for sensitivity analysis.

Sensitivity analysis

We attempted to carry out a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies that we judged to have high risk of bias based on inadequate randomisation, allocation concealment or absence of blinding. However, we found too few studies on subgroup categorisation to effectively perform this. We deemed exclusion on the basis of accuracy of diagnosis (as stated in the protocol) as not worthwhile because most trials did not explicitly state whether the diagnosis was made by a physician. We dropped other criteria as stated in the protocol because they were not feasible (see Differences between protocol and review).

### Infectious diseases associated with organized sports and outbreak control [^7604f40d]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Tinea pedis (T pedis) management — Topical and systemic regimens with efficacy and pediatric approvals are detailed. Ciclopirox olamine cream or gel (0.77%) applied twice daily for 4 weeks was superior to 1% clotrimazole or vehicle, achieving ~60% versus 6% end-of-treatment cures and 85% versus 16% two weeks after treatment. For children, a dosage of topical application twice a day is recommended for use in children older than 10 years. Naftifine twice daily for 4 weeks and sulconazole nitrate 1% daily for 4 to 6 weeks yielded higher mycological clearance (57%–66%) than vehicle (13%–34% cleared), though sulconazole is not approved for use in children in the United States. Terbinafine 1% cream applied twice daily for 1 week produced > 93% mycological cure at 4 weeks and is approved for children 12 years and older, whereas a 1% luliconazole cream trial in adults cured less than 50% and is only approved for adults. Oral terbinafine, 250 mg once daily for 1 week, had similar efficacy to 4 weeks of clotrimazole 1% twice daily with faster clinical resolution and was similar to itraconazole, 100 mg over 2 weeks, with a slightly lower rate of relapse. Terbinafine is well tolerated in children, with occasional isolated neutropenia and rare liver failure, typically in people with preexisting liver disease.

### Ultramicrosize griseofulvin (fulvicin P / G 165) [^58f27e14]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium – depending on rate of growth – fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis. In some forms of athlete's foot, yeasts and bacteria may be involved as well as fungi. Griseofulvin will not eradicate the bacterial or monilial infection.

Adults: Daily administration of 330 mg (as a single dose or in divided amounts) will give a satisfactory response in most patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea capitis. For those fungus infections more difficult to eradicate, such as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, a divided daily dosage of 660 mg is recommended.

Children: Approximately 3.3 mg per pound of body weight per day is an effective dose for most children. On this basis, the following dosage schedule is suggested: Children weighing 30 to 50 pounds- 82.5 mg to 165 mg daily. Children weighing over 50 pounds – 165 mg to 330 mg daily.

Children 2 years of age and younger – dosage has not been established.

Clinical experience with griseofulvin in children with tinea capitis indicates that a single daily dose is effective. Clinical relapse will occur if the medication is not continued until the infecting organism is eradicated.

### Onychomycosis diagnosis and management: perspectives from a joint dermatology-podiatry roundtable [^fd7fab9e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis prevalence is expected to rise as the population ages and the prevalence of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and other significant risk factors rise. Until recently, treatment options were limited due to safety concerns with oral antifungals and low efficacy with available topical agents. Efinaconzole and tavaborole were approved by the FDA in 2014 for onychomycosis treatment and provide additional effective topical treatment options for patients with mild-to-moderate disease. Dermatologists and podiatrists both regularly treat onychomycosis, yet there are striking differences between specialties in approach to diagnosis and treatment. In order to explore these differences a joint dermatology-podiatry roundtable of onychomycosis experts was convened. Although it has little effect on mycologic cure, debridement may be a valuable adjunct to oral or topical antifungal therapy, especially in patients with greater symptom burden. However, few dermatologists incorporate debridement into their treatment plans and referral to podiatry may be appropriate for some of these patients. Furthermore, podiatrists may be better equipped to manage patients with concurrent diabetes or peripheral vascular disease and elderly patients who are unable to maintain proper foot hygiene. Once cure is achieved, lifestyle and hygiene practices, maintenance/prophylactic onychomycosis treatment, and proactive tinea pedis treatment in patients and family members may help to maintain patients' cured status.

### Exploratory study on short-term administration of oral fosravuconazole for tinea pedis [^f32dcc4d]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

We investigated the clinical efficacy of short-term, oral fosravuconazole (F-RVCZ) therapy for tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete's foot. F-RVCZ (equivalent to 100mg ravuconazole) was administered orally once daily for 1week for interdigital and vesicular tinea pedis and for 4weeks for hyperkeratotic tinea pedis. Efficacy was evaluated based on mycological efficacy and clinical symptoms at Weeks 1, 4, and 8 for interdigital and vesicular tinea pedis and at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 for hyperkeratotic tinea pedis. Efficacy was confirmed at the end of treatment. Therapeutic efficacy increased over time from the end of treatment for both types of tinea pedis. All adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were within expectations and there were no cases of discontinuation due to ADRs or serious ADRs. Short-term oral F-RVCZ therapy is expected to be as effective or more effective than terbinafine and itraconazole, which have already been approved in Japan and may be a useful option for the treatment of tinea pedis.

### Advances in topical and systemic antifungals [^81e471cd]. Dermatologic Clinics (2007). Low credibility.

Topical antifungal agents are generally used for the treatment of superficial fungal infections unless the infection is widespread, involves an extensive area, or is resistant to initial therapy. Systemic antifungals are often reserved for the treatment of onychomycosis, tinea capitis, superficial and systemic candidiasis, and prophylaxis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. With the development of resistant fungi strains and the increased incidence of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, some previously effective traditional antifungal agents are subject to limitations including multidrug interactions, severe adverse effects, and their fungistatic mechanism of actions. Several new antifungal agents have demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits and have broadened clinicians' choices in the treatment of superficial and systemic invasive fungal infections.

### Topical antifungal treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis [^33d684f9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea infections are fungal infections of the skin caused by dermatophytes. It is estimated that 10% to 20% of the world population is affected by fungal skin infections. Sites of infection vary according to geographical location, the organism involved, and environmental and cultural differences. Both tinea corporis, also referred to as 'ringworm' and tinea cruris or 'jock itch' are conditions frequently seen by primary care doctors and dermatologists. The diagnosis can be made on clinical appearance and can be confirmed by microscopy or culture. A wide range of topical antifungal drugs are used to treat these superficial dermatomycoses, but it is unclear which are the most effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antifungal treatments in tinea cruris and tinea corporis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 13th August 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. We handsearched the journal Mycoses from 1957 to 1990.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with proven dermatophyte infection of the body (tinea corporis) or groin (tinea cruris).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and analyses.

Main Results

Of the 364 records identified, 129 studies with 18,086 participants met the inclusion criteria. Half of the studies were judged at high risk of bias with the remainder judged at unclear risk. A wide range of different comparisons were evaluated across the 129 studies, 92 in total, with azoles accounting for the majority of the interventions. Treatment duration varied from one week to two months, but in most studies this was two to four weeks. The length of follow-up varied from one week to six months. Sixty-three studies contained no usable or retrievable data mainly due to the lack of separate data for different tinea infections. Mycological and clinical cure were assessed in the majority of studies, along with adverse effects. Less than half of the studies assessed disease relapse, and hardly any of them assessed duration until clinical cure, or participant-judged cure. The quality of the body of evidence was rated as low to very low for the different outcomes. Data for several outcomes for two individual treatments were pooled. Across five studies, significantly higher clinical cure rates were seen in participants treated with terbinafine compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 4.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.10 to 6.56, number needed to treat (NNT) 3, 95% CI 2 to 4). The quality of evidence for this outcome was rated as low. Data for mycological cure for terbinafine could not be pooled due to substantial heterogeneity. Mycological cure rates favoured naftifine 1% compared to placebo across three studies (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.14, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 4) with the quality of evidence rated as low. In one study, naftifine 1% was more effective than placebo in achieving clinical cure (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.41 to 4.16, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 5) with the quality of evidence rated as low. Across two studies, mycological cure rates favoured clotrimazole 1% compared to placebo (RR 2.87, 95% CI 2.28 to 3.62, NNT 2, 95% CI 2 to 3). Data for several outcomes were pooled for three comparisons between different classes of treatment. There was no difference in mycological cure between azoles and benzylamines (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07). The quality of the evidence was rated as low for this comparison. Substantial heterogeneity precluded the pooling of data for mycological and clinical cure when comparing azoles and allylamines. Azoles were slightly less effective in achieving clinical cure compared to azole and steroid combination creams immediately at the end of treatment (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.84, NNT 6, 95% CI 5 to 13), but there was no difference in mycological cure rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.05). The quality of evidence for these two outcomes was rated as low for mycological cure and very low for clinical cure. All of the treatments that were examined appeared to be effective, but most comparisons were evaluated in single studies. There was no evidence for a difference in cure rates between tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Adverse effects were minimal - mainly irritation and burning; results were generally imprecise between active interventions and placebo, and between different classes of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled data suggest that the individual treatments terbinafine and naftifine are effective. Adverse effects were generally mild and reported infrequently. A substantial number of the studies were more than 20 years old and of unclear or high risk of bias; there is however, some evidence that other topical antifungal treatments also provide similar clinical and mycological cure rates, particularly azoles although most were evaluated in single studies. There is insufficient evidence to determine if Whitfield's ointment, a widely used agent is effective. Although combinations of topical steroids and antifungals are not currently recommended in any clinical guidelines, relevant studies included in this review reported higher clinical cure rates with similar mycological cure rates at the end of treatment, but the quality of evidence for these outcomes was rated very low due to imprecision, indirectness and risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence to confidently assess relapse rates in the individual or combination treatments. Although there was little difference between different classes of treatment in achieving cure, some interventions may be more appealing as they require fewer applications and a shorter duration of treatment. Further, high quality, adequately powered trials focusing on patient-centred outcomes, such as patient satisfaction with treatment should be considered.

### Oral medications to treat toenail fungal infection [^b9be8f14]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Which oral antifungal medication is associated with the highest clinical (ie, normal appearance of the toenail) and mycological (negative culture, microscopy, or both) cure rates vs placebo or other antifungals when used to treat fungal infections?

Bottom Line

Both terbinafine and azole-based medications were associated with higher clinical and mycological cure rates compared with placebo (high-quality evidence). Azoles were associated with lower cure rates than terbinafine when compared directly.

Complications of warm water immersion injuries — infectious risks and therapy: Fungal infections are the most common complication of warm water immersion injuries and bacterial infections also can occur; prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated. Fungal infections should be treated with topical antifungal agents, and cellulitis or other bacterial soft-tissue infections should be treated with systemic antibiotics; there are no known long-term sequelae of WWIF or TIF. Recommendations state: Do not give prophylactic antibiotics (1B) and treat infections that occur as complications of warm water immersion injuries with topical antifungals or antibiotics, as appropriate (1A).

Ringworm

Background

Ringworm or "tinea" is a type of skin infection caused by several different species of fungus. A ringworm infection can occur on the scalp (tinea capitis), the body (tinea corporis), the hands (tinea manuum), the feet (tinea pedis or "athlete's foot"), the nails (tinea unguium), the groin or inner thighs (tinea cruris of "jock itch"), and the beard area (tinea barbae). Typical symptoms include red, itchy skin, a ring-shaped rash, and hair loss.

Ringworm spreads by contact with personal items from someone whohas a ringworm infection, such as towels, clothing, or hair care items, or surfaces that are contaminated with the fungus. It also can spread by contact with an infected dog or cat.

Treatment for ringworm depends on where the infection is on the body. Over-the-counter topical medication can treat infections on the skin, but a prescription medication taken by mouth is used to treat infections on the scalp. There are rare reports of infections that are resistant to antifungal medicines.

Recommendations

Allow entry of individuals who have ringworm infection once they have begun treatment for the infection. A rash should not be not used as a reason for excluding someone who has begun treatment, as a ringworm rash may persist for several weeks.
Refer guests who develop a rash while staying at the facility for medical evaluation by their primary care physician or licensed clinician.

### Common foot problems: over-the-counter treatments and home care [^a5574171]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Most foot disorders do not require podiatry referral or complex interventions. After the clinical diagnosis is made, these conditions can typically be managed with over-the-counter (OTC) and home remedies, with guidance from the primary care physician. Stretching and strengthening exercises, along with the use of heel cups, resolve most plantar fasciitis cases and are at least as effective as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or steroid injections. Hallux rigidus is best managed with a hard-soled shoe or rigid insert that relieves pain by restricting motion across the metatarsophalangeal joint. Hallux valgus responds to use of wide toe box shoes, and surgery is not clearly beneficial beyond one year. Plantar warts can be treated effectively at home with OTC salicylic acid and cryotherapy topical agents, which have equal effectiveness to liquid nitrogen. In patients with corns and calluses, OTC topical salicylic acid has short-term benefits, and pads and inserts that more evenly redistribute contact forces have long-term benefits. Inserts are commonly recommended to redistribute forefoot pressure and relieve pain. Several OTC preparations are available for the treatment of tinea pedis, with topical allylamines being the most effective. Although OTC topical treatments have been widely used for onychomycosis, they have poor long-term cure rates compared with prescription oral medications.

### Over-the-counter foot remedies [^6a2ec2ad]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Several effective and inexpensive over-the-counter treatments are available for minor but troubling foot problems. In most cases, one week of therapy with topical terbinafine is effective for interdigital tinea pedis. Treatment of plantar warts with 17 percent salicylic acid with lactic acid in a collodion base is as effective as cryotherapy, but treatment must be sustained for several months. Toe sleeves and toe spacers can relieve pain from hard or soft corns. Metatarsal pads can relieve the pressure associated with plantar keratoses. Heel cups often can relieve pain caused by age-related thinning of the heel fat pad. Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of anteromedial heel pain caused by repetitive strain on the plantar fascia. Although the mainstay of therapy is stretching exercises, ready-made arch supports and insoles can be helpful adjuncts.

### Infectious diseases associated with organized sports and outbreak control [^2d622315]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Tinea cruris (T cruris) management — Topical terbinafine 1% cream applied daily for 1 week has been used effectively with a mycological cure rate of approximately 94% and is approved for children 12 years and older. Over-the-counter alternatives include butenafine applied twice daily for 2 weeks and clotrimazole applied twice weekly for 4 weeks, although butenafine is only approved in adults. In adults, oral itraconazole (100 mg daily for 2 weeks or 200 mg daily for 1 week) has been effective and superior to oral griseofulvin (500 mg daily for 2 weeks). Several other azole topical formulations have been effective in adults, but none have been studied in any detail in children.

### Efficacy, tolerability and consumer acceptability of terbinafine topical spray versus terbinafine topical solution: a phase IIa, randomised, observer-blind, comparative study [^096c1f2c]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tinea pedis is one of the world's most prevalent dermatophyte infections. MedSpray™ tinea pedis 1% w/w (topical spray) is a novel, easy-to-use propellant-based spray formulation containing 1% w/w terbinafine, requiring no manipulation at the site of infection. This is in contrast to the only formulation currently approved in Europe for single application (none are approved in the USA for single use), which is Lamisil(®) Once 1% w/w (topical solution), containing 1% w/w terbinafine hydrochloride, which requires manipulation on the affected area.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and consumer acceptability of a topical spray versus a topical solution in the treatment of tinea pedis.

Methods

This study is a phase IIa, randomised, observer-blind, non-inferiority comparative study of the topical spray compared with the topical solution over a 12-week study period. The study was conducted at Bioskin GmbH, Hamburg and Berlin. Patients (n = 120) who presented with the presence of interdigital tinea pedis caused by dermatophytes on one or both feet were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned between the two treatment groups. Either the topical spray or the topical solution was administered by the study nurse and consisted of a single application (equivalent to 20 mg of terbinafine per foot) on day 1 of the study. No further applications were made for the duration of the study. The hypothesis formulated before commencement of the study was that the topical spray would prove to be non-inferior to the topical solution. Efficacy assessments, including clinical signs and symptoms, mycology and microscopy were performed at baseline and 1, 6 and 12 weeks after treatment.

Results

The rate of mycological cure at week 1 was statistically equivalent for both treatments. There was a significant reduction in the overall clinical score as assessed by the Physician's Global Assessment of signs and symptoms for both treatment groups.

Conclusion

The topical spray and the topical solution showed comparable anti-fungal activity. Furthermore, the non-inferiority of topical spray to the topical solution was confirmed as determined by the proportion of patients categorised as successfully treated at week 1. This confirms that a topical spray product, which can be applied once without touching the affected skin, is equally as effective in the treatment of tinea pedis and removes the risk of organism transfer associated with touching infected areas.

### Efinaconazole topical solution, 10%: the benefits of treating onychomycosis early [^b67f1041]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in onychomycosis patients with early and long-standing disease.

Methods

An analysis of 1655 patients, aged 18–70 years, randomized to receive efinaconazole topical solution, 10% or vehicle from two identical multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled 48-week studies evaluating safety and efficacy. The primary end point was complete cure rate (0% clinical involvement of target toenail, and both negative potassium hydroxide examination and fungal culture) at Week 52. Three groups were compared: those with early disease (< 1year), patients with a baseline disease of 1–5 years, and those with long-standing onychomycosis (> 5years).

Results

The majority of patients had long-standing disease; were older, male and white. While nail involvement of the target toenail did not differ noticeably amongst the three groups, the number of nails involved did increase progressively with disease duration. Differences were seen in terms of infecting pathogens in early disease that might have important treatment implications. Efinaconazole was more effective in treating early disease, however more than 40% of patients with long-standing disease were considered treatment successes.

Limitations

A period of 52 weeks may be too brief to evaluate a clinical cure in onychomycosis.

Conclusions

Treatment of onychomycosis early to avoid disease progression to other toenails is important. Once daily efinaconazole topical solution, 10% is particularly effective in these patients.

Tinea pedis (T pedis) prevention — Foot powder use after bathing has been associated with a decline in T pedis from 8.5% to 2.1% over a 3.5-year period, largely due to a decline in T mentagrophytes from 5.3% to 0.5%. Experts believe that careful and thorough drying between the toes after showers, daily changes of socks, and periodic cleaning of athletic footwear can be helpful.

### Improved efficacy in onychomycosis therapy [^5c2e7284]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The success rate of onychomycosis treatment is limited by several factors, including the access of the therapeutic agent to the fungal mass, the presence of conidia, and the susceptibility of the different infectious agents to the antifungals. Different strategies used to improve efficacy of the currently available antifungal treatments, their rationale, and the published evidence of their beneficial effects are reviewed. An improved efficacy was demonstrated for some of these strategies, such as combined oral and topical antifungal therapies, whereas most of them lack clear and direct evidence of an increase in therapeutic success.

Onychomycosis is a prevalent condition affecting the United States and global population. Treatment options are limited, with only 3 topical anti-fungal medications garnering approval in the US within the last 25 years: ciclopirox, tavaborole, and efinaconazole. The economic impact and quality of life burden due to onychomycosis are high. Here we provide an up-to-date review of all approved topical anti-fungal therapies for toenail onychomycosis. We discuss treatment efficacies, pharmacology, and use in special populations, as well as current evidence for complementary and alternative medicine.&nbsp; J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22:9(Suppl 1):s5-10.

### Onychomycosis: strategies to minimize recurrence [^df19b1d9]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrence (relapse or re-infection) in onychomycosis is common, occurring in 10% to 53% of patients. However, data on prevalence is limited as few clinical studies follow patients beyond 12 months. It has been suggested that recurrence after continuous terbinafine treatment may be less common than with intermittent or continuous itraconazole therapy, probably due to the fungicidal activity of terbinafine, although these differences tended not to be significant. Relapse rates also increase with time, peaking at month 36. Although a number of factors have been suggested to play a role in recurrence, only the co-existence of diabetes has been shown to have a significant impact. Data with topical therapy is sparse; a small study showed amorolfine prophylaxis may delay recurrence. High concentrations of efinaconazole have been reported in the nail two weeks' post-treatment suggesting twice monthly prophylaxis with topical treatments may be a realistic option, and may be an important consideration in diabetic patients with onychomycosis. Data suggest that prophylaxis may need to be continued for up to three years for optimal effect. Treating tinea pedis and any immediate family members is also critical. Other preventative strategies include avoiding communal areas where infection can spread (such as swimming pools), and decontaminating footwear.

### Griseofulvin (ultramicrosize griseofulvin) [^83c96009]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Ultramicrosize griseofulvin tablets are indicated for the treatment of the following ringworm infections; tinea corporis (ringworm of the body), tinea pedis (athlete's foot), tinea cruris (ringworm of the groin and thigh), tinea barbae (barber's itch), tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp), and tinea unguium (onychomycosis, ringworm of the nails), when caused by one or more of the following genera of fungi: Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton tonsurans, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton interdigitalis, Trichophyton verrucosum, Trichophyton megnini, Trichophyton gallinae, Trichophyton crateriform, Trichophyton sulphureum, Trichophyton schoenleini, Microsporum audouini, Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum. NOTE: Prior to therapy, the type of fungi responsible for the infection should be identified. The use of the drug is not justified in minor or trivial infections which will respond to topical agents alone. Griseofulvin is not effective in the following: bacterial infections, candidiasis (moniliasis), histoplasmosis, actinomycosis, sporotrichosis, chromoblastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, North American blastomycosis, cryptococcosis (torulosis), tinea versicolor and nocardiosis.

### Systematic review of the prevalence of tinea pedis in children [^90f4d875]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background/Objectives

Tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete's foot, is a fungal infection that affects the skin of the feet. While there is extensive research on the prevalence of tinea pedis in adults, data regarding prevalence in children are limited. Therefore, it is important to gain information about epidemiology and prevalence in pediatric patients to prevent and treat this condition in children.

Methods

A comprehensive search across PubMed and Embase was conducted for studies published up to October 10, 2024. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting on the prevalence of tinea pedis in children (0–19 years) with a study population of a minimum of 100 children. A total of 29 studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed to determine prevalence patterns, diagnostic methods, and etiological agents.

Results

The included studies revealed prevalence rates varying from 0.03% to 15.6%. The most common diagnostic methods were clinical examination, microscopy, and culture. The main etiological agents were dermatophytes, specifically Trichophyton rubrum.

Conclusions

This systematic review reveals heterogeneous studies with variations among countries when reporting the prevalence of tinea pedis in children of up to 15.6%. Healthcare professionals should increase awareness of recognizing tinea pedis and consider it a potential diagnosis within the pediatric population.

### Efficacy and safety of topical antifungals in the treatment of dermatomycosis: a systematic review [^f809fce9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

The analysis of comparative efficacy and safety of topical antifungals in the literature is restricted to the treatment of tinea pedis and onychomycosis. Therefore our objective was to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of topical antifungals used in the treatment of dermatomycosis, we performed a comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the following databases: Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Lilacs and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, we identified studies that compared the use of topical antifungals with other antifungals or with placebo published up to July 2010 in English, Spanish or Portuguese. The quality of reporting was assessed according to the Jadad scale; only studies with a score of 3 or more were included. The outcomes evaluated were mycological cure at the end of treatment, sustained cure, occurrence of adverse events and tolerability, including withdrawals due to adverse events. A total of 104 RCTs satisfied the inclusion criteria, containing a total of 135 comparisons, with 55 out of 120 possible comparisons among the 16 drugs evaluated. Pooled data on efficacy showed that all the antifungals were better than placebo. There were no significant differences among antifungal classes. No differences were found in safety or tolerability in any direct comparison. Sensitivity analysis indicated the robustness of the findings. Our results indicate the clear superiority of topical antifungals over placebo but that there is no consistent difference among classes. Mixed treatment comparisons are necessary to rank antifungals, as direct comparisons among many of them are lacking.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^b8b30066]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

The high global prevalence of seborrhoeic dermatitis, its explosive incidence rate in HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and its chronic course justify further research with the purpose of finding treatment options targeted to achieve effective control. Physicians are inclined to use different treatment regimens for management, and in some instances the long course of therapy may erode patient compliance. Furthermore, almost all treatments aim to obtain but not to maintain remission. Long-term control of the disease should be attainable.

A systematic review of current treatment options is the best means to explore evidence on efficacy and appropriateness of treatment. This review focuses on antifungal treatments and was originally published as the protocol 'Interventions for seborrhoeic dermatitis'. This topic was subsequently split into two reviews: 'Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis' and 'Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis'. The latter was published as a separate protocol in 2011 and later as a review (Kastarinen). We are also aware of a related Cochrane review on infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis (including cradle cap) that is in preparation (Victoire).

### Therapies for the treatment of onychomycosis [^36f61181]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis treatments include nail avulsion and debridement by chemical or surgical procedures, topical and oral antifungals, and device-based therapies. The advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of the different types of treatments — including the most commonly prescribed topical (ciclopirox) and oral (terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole) treatments for onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts — are reviewed. Safety and efficacy data for the healthy adult population and for special populations such as children and diabetic patients have confirmed the importance of proper mycological diagnosis before the initiation of therapy as well as the evaluation of the risks and benefits of the different treatments.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^71729e6d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Differences between protocol and review

Title

We changed the review title from 'Interventions for seborrhoeic dermatitis' to 'Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis'. In the protocol, we presented this review as an all-encompassing interventions review for seborrhoeic dermatitis. We had to modify that goal and limit ourselves to topical antifungal agents used for treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis. This decision was made because of the multiplicity of comparisons and the equally diverse outcome variables that we encountered. We reasoned that for meaningful comparisons, leading to coherent conclusions, it was best to split the review into segments focusing on major classes of treatment as we identified them from the trials that we scoured, which will be published in series, at the end of which an overview can be written.

Searches

We had proposed to conduct a search for side effects of various interventions used to treat seborrhoeic dermatitis. We did not carry out this search because we lacked the resources. In the included studies, adverse effects that were reported were non-specific; therefore with hindsight, we believe that a search for specific adverse effects would have been difficult to perform. We also decided that searching grey literature and conference proceedings, as proposed in the protocol, would not yield extra information. The quality of reporting of published trials was already low, which made analysis difficult. Conference proceedings that were covered by the electronic search provided very little in terms of data, and we believe that it was not useful to further pursue this search approach.

Excluded studies

We decided to exclude studies in which antifungals were combined with other active medicines in the same treatment; this was not specified in the protocol. This decision was made when it became clear that with these combination treatments, treatment effect could not be attributed to the antifungal when in combination with an active agent of another class, or to a specific antifungal when in combination with another antifungal.

Interventions

We set out to include all interventions for seborrhoeic dermatitis but later reconsidered this proposal and rather split the review into two parts. This part is related only to topical antifungals.

### Luliconazole [^c7bc9a5c]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

14.1 Interdigital Tinea Pedis

The safety and efficacy of Luliconazole Cream, 1% was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multi-center clinical trials in 423 subjects with a clinical and culture-confirmed diagnosis of interdigital tinea pedis. Subjects were randomized to receive Luliconazole Cream, 1% or vehicle. Subjects applied either Luliconazole Cream, 1% or vehicle cream to the entire area of the forefeet including all interdigital web spaces and approximately 2.5 cm (1 in) of the surrounding area of the foot once daily for 14 days.

The mean age of the study population was 41 years (range 13 to 78 years); 82% were male; 53% were White and 40% were Black or African American. Signs and symptoms of tinea pedis (erythema, scaling, and pruritus), KOH exam and dermatophyte culture were assessed at baseline, end-of-treatment (Day 14), 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment.

Overall treatment success was defined as complete clearance (clinical cure and mycological cure) at 4 weeks post-treatment. Luliconazole Cream, 1% demonstrated complete clearance in subjects with interdigital tinea pedis. Treatment outcomes at 4 weeks post-treatment are summarized in Table 1.

### Evidence-based topical treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis: a summary of a cochrane systematic review [^3e4c41e7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Tinea cruris and tinea corporis are common fungal infections. Most can be treated with a variety of topical antifungals. This review aimed to assess the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of topical treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Searches included the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, LILACS and ongoing trials registries (August 2013). One hundred and twenty-nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 18 086 participants evaluated a range of interventions - mostly azoles. Pooling of data for several outcomes was only possible for two individual treatments. In five studies, terbinafine showed a statistically significant higher clinical cure rate compared with placebo [risk ratio (RR) 4.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.10–6.56]. Data for mycological cure could not be pooled owing to substantial heterogeneity. Across three studies, mycological cure rates favoured naftifine (1%) compared with placebo (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.80–3.14) but the quality of the evidence was low. Combinations of azoles with corticosteroids were slightly more effective than azoles for clinical cure, but there was no statistically significant difference with regard to mycological cure. Sixty-five studies were assessed as 'unclear' and 64 as being at 'high risk' of bias; many were over 20 years old, and most were poorly designed and inadequately reported. Although most active interventions showed sufficient therapeutic effect, this review highlights the need for further, high-quality, adequately powered RCTs to evaluate the effects of these interventions, which can ultimately provide reliable evidence to inform clinical decision making.

### Treatment of ringworm and fungal nail infections… [^b4067e11]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Antifungal medications are used to treat ringworm and fungal nail infections.
- Medications may be creams/ointments or pills.
- Do not use steroid creams or ointments to treat ringworm or a rash that may be ringworm.
- Use antifungal medications exactly as directed for as long as directed. Overview Treatment for ringworm depends on symptom severity and the part of the body infected. Antifungal medications for ringworm come in the form of creams, ointments, lotions, powders, and pills. Some forms of ringworm can be treated with non-prescription antifungal medications. Ringworm infections may need to be treated with prescription antifungal medications. Treatment types Ringworm on the skin Ringworm on the skin like athlete's foot and jock itch are usually treated with non-prescription antifungal medications.

Antifungal creams, ointments, lotions, or powders are usually applied to the skin for 2 to 4 weeks. Follow product instructions and apply the antifungal for as long as directed even if symptoms start to improve. There are many non-prescription products available to treat ringworm, including:

- Clotrimazole
- MiconazoleA
- Terbinafine
- Ketoconazole. Ringworm on the scalp Ringworm on the scalp usually needs to be treated with prescription antifungal medication taken by mouth for 1 to 3 months. Creams, lotions, or powders don't work for ringworm on the scalp. Prescription antifungal medications used to treat ringworm on the scalp include:

- Griseofulvin
- Terbinafine
- Itraconazole
- Fluconazole.
- **Sold under different names, including**: Aloe Vesta Antifungal, Azolen, Baza Antifungal, Carrington Antifungal, Critic Aid Clear, Cruex Prescription Strength, DermaFungal, Desenex, Fungoid Tincture, Micaderm, Micatin, Micro-Guard, Miranel, Mitrazol, Podactin, Remedy Antifungal, Secura Antifungal.

### Treatment of onychomycosis in the diabetic patient population [^5dc2e10d]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2003). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common medical condition in patients with diabetes. Conflicting data exist as to whether diabetes predisposes patients to the disease. Controversy notwithstanding, patients with diabetes have several medical conditions (obesity, peripheral neuropathy, and retinopathy) that can inhibit the identification or mask the progression of fungal nail infections. In addition, vascular insufficiency, impaired wound healing, and compromised immunologic status associated with diabetic foot increase the risk of secondary infections in diabetic patients with onychomycosis. Such factors contribute to an increased morbidity and decreased quality of life in these patients and underscore the need for effective antifungal treatment. Oral antifungal agents are generally well tolerated, but serious adverse events independent of or associated with a number of significant drug interactions have been reported. The availability of a topical therapy, ciclopirox topical solution, 8% (Penlac Nail Lacquer), provides clinicians with an additional effective and well-tolerated treatment option. In order to further increase the efficacy of topical or oral treatment, mechanical intervention (e.g., debridement) may be combined with either of these options. Choice of appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of fungal nail infections can prevent significant morbidity in patients with diabetes.

### Clinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of a new topical treatment for onychomycosis [^48641fa4]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical study assessed the safety and efficacy of an investigational topical product for the treatment of onychomycosis (nail fungus).

Method

A prospective, multi-center, single-arm, self-controlled clinical investigation was done with adult subjects that met the inclusion criteria, primarily culture-confirmed dermatophyte infection of at least one great toe. Subjects self-treated in a weekly regimen of topical application for six months, with clinical assessment at one, three, and six months. Primary efficacy endpoint was clearance of fungal nail infection after six months of weekly treatment. Primary safety endpoint was freedom from product-related adverse events for the duration of the treatment term.

Results

Fifty males and 13 females, ages 24 to 65, infected with Trichophyton (n = 62) or Epidermophyton (n = 1) were enrolled; 53 completed six months of assessment. Sixty percent showed improvement in clinical parameters (nail color, nail plate involvement, onycholysis, thickness, and hyperkeratosis) at six months. Cumulative rates of dermatophyte-negative culture results (test of cure) were 28, 36, and 62 percent of subjects after one, three, and six months of treatment, respectively. Three minor adverse events were device-related, with no unanticipated or serious adverse events.

Limitations

This study was single-arm and self-controlled; 53 of 63 enrolled subjects completed the study.

Conclusion

This study describes a new topical medical device with safety and efficacy profiles that compare favorably to results reported for topically applied onychomycosis drug treatments.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^bc66b2de]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

The rationale for certain treatment regimens was seldom given; most studies simply stated that participants were treated for four weeks with a 2% solution to be applied twice daily. However, wide variation in dose and mode of delivery was observed without a clear explanation for this. It is interesting no relationship between dose and the outcome 'clearance of symptoms' was obvious at the study level as an indirect comparison. It was only when individual symptom outcomes were assessed that higher doses seemed to produce a better treatment effect. However, this observation was based only on single studies. In direct comparisons of dose effect, no reason was found to conclude that different doses had different treatment effects.

The major problem with the quality of the evidence was how outcomes were measured. We failed to identify any validated outcome measure for seborrhoeic dermatitis or outcome measures conventionally endorsed by expert committees or ranking specialist fora. This situation also applies to other dermatological disorders, as our consultation with experts in the field revealed. Our principal outcome measure, namely, total clearance, has face validity, but we do not know how reliably it can be measured. Global severity scores have the drawback that they can be based on assessment of any symptom/affected area combination, which could weaken the reliability of the measure. Therefore, we excluded studies that measured outcomes in this way. They are listed under excluded studies. Although we undertook rigorous assessment of treatment outcomes, considerable heterogeneity was observed in most comparisons, which we could explain only by attributing differences to the absence of validated outcome measures.

Reliable quality of life measurements, which constitute one of our prespecified outcome measures, could prevent in part measurement at symptom level and indicate how treatment influences a more general outcome. However no studies used this outcome. In addition, what constitutes a clinically relevant change in scores for symptoms is unclear. A validated scale should take the clinically relevant change into account.

### Clotrimazole / betamethasone diproprionate: a review of costs and complications in the treatment of common cutaneous fungal infections [^eebb5851]. Pediatric Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

The use of antifungal/corticosteroid combinations as topical therapy for dermatophytoses has been criticized as being less effective, more expensive, and the cause of more adverse cutaneous reactions than antifungal monotherapy. The combination of clotrimazole and betamethasone diproprionate (Lotrisone) is a mix of an azole antifungal and a high-potency corticosteroid, and is one of the most widely prescribed of these combinations. Our objective was to describe the beneficial and deleterious effects of Lotrisone in the treatment of common cutaneous fungal infections and its relative cost-effectiveness. We did a literature review documenting clinical trial data and adverse reactions to Lotrisone and collected a cost analysis of topical antifungal prescribing data over a 2-month period from a large midwestern staff-model health maintenance organization (HMO). Lotrisone is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis in adults and children more than 12 years of age. Treatment is limited to 2 weeks in the groin area and 4 weeks on the feet. The most concerning adverse effects of Lotrisone were reported in children and included treatment failure, striae distensae, hirsuitism, and growth retardation. This combination was also reported to have decreased efficacy in clearing candidal and Trichophyton infections as compared to single-agent antifungals. Lotrisone was considerably more expensive than clotrimazole alone and was found to account for more than 50% of topical antifungal expenditures as prescribed by primary care physicians, but only 7% of topical antifungals prescribed by dermatologists. We found that Lotrisone was shown to have the potential to induce many steroid-related side effects and to be less cost effective than antifungal monotherapy. This combination should be used judiciously in the treatment of cutaneous fungal infections and may not be appropriate for use in children.

### Naftifine hydrochloride (naftin) [^24f4b79f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

NAFTIN®​​ Gel has been evaluated for efficacy in two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multicenter trials that included 1175 subjects with symptomatic and dermatophyte culture-positive interdigital tinea pedis. Subjects were randomized to receive NAFTIN®Gel or vehicle. Subjects applied naftifine hydrochloride gel 2% or vehicle to the affected area of the foot once daily for 2 weeks. Signs and symptoms of interdigital tinea pedis (presence or absence of erythema, pruritus, and scaling) were assessed and potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination and dermatophyte culture were performed 6 weeks after the first treatment.

The mean age of the study population was 45 years; 77% were male; and 60% were Caucasian, 35% were Black or African American, and 26% were Hispanic or Latino. At baseline, subjects were confirmed to have signs and symptoms of interdigital tinea pedis, positive KOH exam, and confirmed dermatophyte culture. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with a complete cure at 6 weeks after the start of treatment (4 weeks after the last treatment). Complete cure was defined as both a clinical cure (absence of erythema, pruritus, and scaling) and mycological cure (negative KOH and dermatophyte culture).

The efficacy results at week 6, four weeks following the end of treatment, are presented in Table 1 below.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^c747bb6c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute, painful and potentially serious bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue that can have a substantial impact on patients. Pain, feeling very unwell and the need for elevation of the affected limb can result in reduced quality of life and substantial periods of work absence among people with cellulitis. 1 Cellulitis also places a considerable burden on the National Health Service (NHS). Between 2015 and 2016, 123 644 patients were admitted to hospitals in England for cellulitis. 2 While even a single episode of cellulitis can have a substantial impact on quality of life, approximately one‐third of people with cellulitis suffer recurrent episodes. 3, 4 Risk factors for the recurrence of cellulitis include previous episode(s) of cellulitis; lymphoedema; obesity; diabetes and skin disorders producing breaks in the skin (e.g. fungal foot disease, dry skin or insect bites).

The only treatment shown to reduce the risk of recurrence is long‐term, low‐dose antibiotics. 5 This strategy has not been widely implemented, possibly because of growing pressure to reduce antibiotic prescribing amidst fears of antibiotic resistance and possible side‐effects. The risk of further episodes may also be reduced by use of emollients for prevention of dry, cracked skin, checking for and treating tinea pedis, and managing lymphoedema using compression garments. 6

There has been little research into the role of skin care in the prevention of cellulitis, but a role for dry skin has been hypothesized and regular application of emollient has been shown to reduce dryness. 7 Previous research also suggests that there is a high rate of fungal foot disease in patients with recurrent cellulitis as skin breaks caused by fungal infection provide a 'portal of entry' for bacteria. 8, 9 Although fungal foot infection is common, many patients undertreat this as it can be asymptomatic, 10, 11 so it is possible that more active treatment of fungal foot disease may prevent recurrent cellulitis. In a recent James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership (PSP) for cellulitis, patients and health professionals identified the need to determine the best nonantibiotic intervention for the prevention of cellulitis (e.g. skin care; foot care; moisturizers; antiseptics; lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and exercise; compression garments/bandages; treating athlete's foot; complementary and alternative therapy) as a priority area for future research. 12

14.2 Interdigital Tinea Pedis

Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream has been investigated for efficacy in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multi-center trial in 217 subjects with symptomatic and dermatophyte culture positive interdigital tinea pedis. Subjects were randomized to receive Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream or vehicle. Subjects applied Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream or vehicle to the affected area of the foot plus a ½-inch margin of healthy skin surrounding the affected area once-daily for 2 weeks. Signs and symptoms of interdigital tinea pedis (presence or absence of erythema, pruritus, and scaling) were assessed and KOH examination and dermatophyte culture was performed at the primary efficacy endpoint at week 6.

The mean age of the trial population was 42 years and 71% were male and 57% were white. At baseline, subjects were confirmed to have signs and symptoms of interdigital tinea pedis, positive KOH exam, and confirmed dermatophyte culture. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportions of subjects with a complete cure at the week 6 visit (see Table 2). Complete cure was defined as both a clinical cure (absence of erythema, pruritis, and scaling) and mycological cure (negative KOH and dermatophyte culture).

The efficacy results at week 6, four weeks following the end of treatment, are presented in Table 2 below. Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream demonstrated complete cure in subjects with interdigital tinea pedis, but complete cure in subjects with only moccasin type tinea pedis was not demonstrated.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^992399a4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is distributed worldwide. It commonly affects the scalp, face and flexures of the body. Treatment options include antifungal drugs, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytic agents and phototherapy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults.

A secondary objective is to assess whether the same interventions are effective in the management of seborrhoeic dermatitis in patients with HIV/AIDS.

Search methods

We searched the following databases up to December 2014: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982). We also searched trials registries and checked the bibliographies of published studies for further trials.

Selection criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical antifungals used for treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis in adolescents and adults, with primary outcome measures of complete clearance of symptoms and improved quality of life.

Data collection and analysis

Review author pairs independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We performed fixed-effect meta-analysis for studies with low statistical heterogeneity and used a random-effects model when heterogeneity was high.

Main results

We included 51 studies with 9052 participants. Of these, 45 trials assessed treatment outcomes at five weeks or less after commencement of treatment, and six trials assessed outcomes over a longer time frame. We believe that 24 trials had some form of conflict of interest, such as funding by pharmaceutical companies.

Among the included studies were 12 ketoconazole trials (N = 3253), 11 ciclopirox trials (N = 3029), two lithium trials (N = 141), two bifonazole trials (N = 136) and one clotrimazole trial (N = 126) that compared the effectiveness of these treatments versus placebo or vehicle. Nine ketoconazole trials (N = 632) and one miconazole trial (N = 47) compared these treatments versus steroids. Fourteen studies (N = 1541) compared one antifungal versus another or compared different doses or schedules of administration of the same agent versus one another.

Ketoconazole

Topical ketoconazole 2% treatment showed a 31% lower risk of failed clearance of rashes compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.81, eight studies, low-quality evidence) at four weeks of follow-up, but the effect on side effects was uncertain because evidence was of very low quality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.64, six studies); heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I² = 74%). The median proportion of those who did not have clearance in the placebo groups was 69%.

Ketoconazole treatment resulted in a remission rate similar to that of steroids (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44, six studies, low-quality evidence), but occurrence of side effects was 44% lower in the ketoconazole group than in the steroid group (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.96, eight studies, moderate-quality evidence).

Ketoconozale yielded a similar remission failure rate as ciclopirox (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.26, three studies, low-quality evidence). Most comparisons between ketoconazole and other antifungals were based on single studies that showed comparability of treatment effects.

Ciclopirox

Ciclopirox 1% led to a lower failed remission rate than placebo at four weeks of follow-up (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94, eight studies, moderate-quality evidence) with similar rates of side effects (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11, four studies, moderate-quality evidence).

Other antifungals

Clotrimazole and miconazole efficacies were comparable with those of steroids on short-term assessment in single studies.

Treatment effects on individual symptoms were less clear and were inconsistent, possibly because of difficulties encountered in measuring these symptoms.

Evidence was insufficient to conclude that dose or mode of delivery influenced treatment outcome. Only one study reported on treatment compliance. No study assessed quality of life. One study assessed the maximum rash-free period but provided insufficient data for analysis. One small study in patients with HIV compared the effect of lithium versus placebo on seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face, but treatment outcomes were similar.

Authors' conclusions

Ketoconazole and ciclopirox are more effective than placebo, but limited evidence suggests that either of these agents is more effective than any other agent within the same class. Very few studies have assessed symptom clearance for longer periods than four weeks. Ketoconazole produced findings similar to those of steroids, but side effects were fewer. Treatment effect on overall quality of life remains unknown. Better outcome measures, studies of better quality and better reporting are all needed to improve the evidence base for antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Plain Language Summary

Antifungal treatments applied to the skin to treat seborrhoeic dermatitis

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition found throughout the world, with rashes with varying degrees of redness, scaling and itching. It affects people of both sexes but is more common among men. The disease usually starts after puberty and can lead to personal discomfort and cosmetic concerns when rashes occur at prominent skin sites. Drugs that act against moulds, also called antifungal agents, have been commonly used on their own or in combination.

Review question

Do antifungal treatments applied to the skin clear up the rashes and itching of seborrhoeic dermatitis?

Study characteristics

We included 51 studies with 9052 participants. Trials typically were four weeks long, and very few trials were longer. In all, 24 studies had some involvement of pharmaceutical companies such as funding or employment of the researchers.

Key results

Particpants taking ketoconazole were 31% less likely than those given placebo to have symptoms that persisted at four weeks of follow-up. This was seen in eight studies with 2520 participants, but wide variation was noted between studies. Ketoconazole was as effective as steroids but had 44% fewer side effects. Without causing more side effects, ciclopirox was 21% more effective than placebo in achieving clinical clearance of rashes. Treatment effect on redness, itching or scaling symptoms of the skin was less clear. Evidence was insufficient to conclude that that one antifungal was superior to other antifungals, but this observation was based on few studies. Ketoconazole and ciclopirox are the most heavily investigated antifungals and are more effective than placebo. Other antifungals might have similar effects, but data are insufficient to underpin this.

Common side effects were increased skin redness or itching, burning sensation and hair loss.

No studies measured quality of life. Only one study reported on percentage of compliance in different treatment groups. Other studies used surrogates such as acceptability to represent compliance. We therefore could not assess the effect of compliance on treatment outcomes. One study on patients with HIV reported no clear effects of treatments.

Quality of the evidence

Evidence for the effects of ketoconazole compared with placebo or a steroid was assessed to be of low quality. Evidence derived from comparison of ciclopirox versus placebo was assessed to be of moderate quality. Better quality studies with longer follow-up and better reporting are needed to enlarge the evidence base for antifungals.

### An open-label, multi-center, multiple-application pharmacokinetic study of naftifine HCl gel 2% in pediatric subjects with tinea pedis [^54a76e52]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea pedis is the most common superficial fungal infection. Naftifine hydrochloride is a topical antifungal of the allylamine class, displaying fungicidal activity and clinically significant anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical data on topical antifungal therapy using naftifine for tinea pedis in a pediatric population is limited.

Objective

To assess trends in efficacy, tolerability, safety, and to quantify the pharmacokinetics (PK) of topical naftifine hydrochloride gel 2% in pediatric subjects with tinea pedis.

Methods

Twenty-eight subjects (22 pediatric and 6 adult controls) were enrolled and treated in the study. Approximately 2 grams of naftifine hydrochloride gel 2% was applied to each foot (4 grams total) for subjects with tinea pedis. Pharmacokinetic blood and urine samples were collected at various time points throughout the study. Efficacy was assessed based on potassium hydroxide, dermatophyte culture, and signs and symptom results at days 7, 14, and 28. Adverse event information was collected routinely. <br/>

Results

The rate and extent of systemic exposure among the pediatric and adult control subjects was low. Adverse events were minimal and were not related to treatment. Positive results were observed as early as day 7; however the proportion of subjects achieving success generally increased over time through day 28 in both treatment groups.

Conclusions

Naftifine hydrochloride gel 2% was found to be well tolerated and safe. Trends in clinical benefit were observed throughout the treatment period; however, continued improvement in efficacy rates were observed during the post-treatment period.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^0f37c375]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included randomised controlled trials (including cross-over trials and cross-over trials of body parts) of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Types of participants

We included studies conducted with adults or adolescents who had been diagnosed by a healthcare practitioner, as explicitly stated or implied within context, as having seborrhoeic dermatitis (SD) of the scalp, face or both based on clinical case definition, with or without laboratory confirmation. The term 'healthcare practitioner' as used implies physicians or another cadre of care providers who used well-defined guidelines for making the diagnosis. We included studies that had described the diagnosis as seborrhoeic eczema or seborrhoeic dermatitis. No consensus has been reached on the difference between seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp and dandruff, which are seen by many as part of a continuous spectrum of dermatitis of the scalp. Therefore, we also included studies with patients who were diagnosed with dandruff.

### Efinaconazole solution in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis: a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study [^dc06df2e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a common nail infection that is difficult to treat successfully. The prevalence increases with age and is associated with diabetes. Oral treatments are limited by drug interactions and potential hepatotoxicity; topical treatments, by modest efficacy.

Objective

We investigated the efficacy and safety of a solution using a novel topical triazole antifungal, efinaconazole, in distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO).

Methods

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2 study in mild to moderate toenail DLSO (n = 135). Subjects randomized (2:2:2:1 ratio) to receive efinaconazole 10% solution (with or without semiocclusion), efinaconazole 5% solution, or vehicle, once daily for 36 weeks, with one 4-week posttreatment follow-up (week 40). Efficacy assessments included complete cure, mycologic cure, clinical efficacy, and other assessments of overall treatment effectiveness. No efficacy variables were designated as primary.

Results

At follow-up, complete cure was numerically higher in all active groups (16%-26%) compared with vehicle (9%). Mycologic cure rates with efinaconazole 10% semiocclusion, efinaconazole 10%, and efinaconazole 5% were 83%, 87%, and 87%, respectively. Efinaconazole 10% (with or without semiocclusion) demonstrated significantly greater clinical efficacy and treatment effectiveness when compared with vehicle (P = 0.0088 and .0064; .0056 and .0085, respectively, for both efinaconazole 10% groups). Adverse events were generally similar and mild. Local-site reactions were restricted to few subjects and did not differ meaningfully from those produced by vehicle.

Conclusions

This study provided evidence that once-daily efinaconazole 10% solution (with or without semiocclusion) applied topically for 36 weeks was more effective than vehicle in treating DLSO and was well tolerated. Based on these results, efinaconazole 10% solution was chosen for the phase 3 development program.

### Pulse versus continuous terbinafine for onychomycosis: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^087b9a98]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Effective treatments for onychomycosis are expensive. Previous studies suggest that less costly, pulsed doses of antifungal medications may be as effective as standard, continuous doses. Terbinafine is the current treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis.

Objective

Our purpose was to determine whether pulse-dose terbinafine is as effective as standard continuous-dose terbinafine for treatment of toenail onychomycosis.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, noninferiority, clinical intervention trial in the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The main inclusion criteria for participants were a positive dermatophyte culture and at least 25% distal subungual clinical involvement. Six hundred eighteen volunteers were screened; 306 were randomized. Terbinafine, 250 mg daily for 3 months (continuous) or terbinafine, 500 mg daily for 1 week per month for 3 months (pulse) was administered. The primary outcome measure was mycological cure of the target toenail at 18 months. Secondary outcome measures included clinical cure and complete (clinical plus mycological) cure of the target toenail and complete cure of all 10 toenails.

Results

Results of an intent-to-treat analysis did not meet the prespecified criterion for noninferiority but did demonstrate the superiority of continuous-dose terbinafine for: mycological cure of the target toenail (70.9% [105/148] vs 58.7% [84/143]; P = 0.03, relative risk [RR] of 1.21 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02–1.43]); clinical cure of the target toenail (44.6% [66/148] vs 29.3% [42/143]; P = 0.007, RR = 1.52 [95% CI, 1.11–2.07); complete cure of the target toenail (40.5% [60/148] vs 28.0% [40/143]; P = 0.02, RR = 1.45 [95% CI, 1.04–2.01); and complete cure of all 10 toenails (25.2% [36/143] vs 14.7% [21/143]; P = 0.03, RR = 1.71 [95% CI, 1.05–2.79). Tolerability of the regimens did not differ significantly between the groups (chi2 = 1.63; P = 0.65).

Limitations

The study population primarily consisted of older men with severe onychomycosis.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated the superiority of continuous- over pulse-dose terbinafine. We also found this expensive therapy to be much less effective than previously believed, particularly for achieving complete cure of all 10 toenails.

### Conservation of griseofulvin genes in the gsf gene cluster among fungal genomes [^e6301c6b]. G3 (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Griseofulvin (C 17 H 17 Cl 1 O 6) is a natural spirocyclic polyketide compound that is produced by ascomycetes. This fungistatic was first isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum Dierckx (syn. Penicillium patulum Bain.; Penicillium urticae Bain.) and had since been detected in many other species of the Penicillium genus such as Penicillium aethiopicum. Griseofulvin synthesis increases with cellular ATP/ADP ratio, and one may hypothesize that the benefit of griseofulvin production is to eliminate other fungal species to reduce competition. Nevertheless, given the cost of time and energy, one expects that only species that experience such competition would maintain the griseofulvin gene cluster in their genomes. Indeed, fungal endophytes such as Xylaria flabelliformis are commonly found within plant tissue and produces griseofulvin as an antifungal against plant pathogenic fungi. Furthermore, species in Genus Penicillium produce many other secondary metabolites in response to environmental changes, and some exometabolites are only expressed under unique circumstances.

Mechanistically, griseofulvin interacts with the mitotic spindle microtubule to inhibits cell division and induces cell death in cancer cell lines. Due to its low toxicity, Griseofulvin has been widely used in many applications. In agriculture, griseofulvin acts as a crop protectant to prevent against fungus infections. Notable medical applications of griseofulvin include treatment of ringworm infection in guinea pigs and treatment of dermatophyte infections in both humans and animals. Today, griseofulvin is largely replaced by new antifungal drugs, but the compound retained a niche in treating ringworm infection and athlete's foot. In addition, in recent years, the compound has garnered renewed interest because of its potential therapeutic effects to treat cancer and suppressive activities against the replication of hepatitis C virus.

Regarding medical management for onychomycosis, more specifically with respect to systemic antifungals, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to consider offering fluconazole (150–450 mg/week for 3 months in fingernail infection and at least 6 months in toenail infection) as an alternative in patients unable to tolerate terbinafine or itraconazole. Obtain baseline LFTs and a CBC. Monitor LFTs in high-dose or prolonged therapy and in patients at risk because of concomitant hepatotoxic drug use.

### Naftifine hydrochloride gel 2%: an effective topical treatment for moccasin-type tinea pedis [^4a88abe5]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Naftifine hydrochloride (naftifine) is a topical antifungal of the allylamine class, displaying fungicidal and fungistatic activity. Naftifine is generally used to treat interdigital tinea pedis; however, systemic therapy is often prescribed by healthcare providers for moccasin tinea pedis. Well-controlled clinical data on topical antifungal therapy for moccasin tinea pedis is limited.

Objective

The objective of this analysis is to present data from two pooled randomized, vehicle-controlled studies that evaluated efficacy of once daily topical naftifine gel 2% and vehicle at end of treatment (week 2) and at 4 weeks post-treatment in subjects with moccasin tinea pedis.

Methods

At visit 1, subjects were randomized to naftifine gel 2% or vehicle groups and subjects underwent baseline mycology culture, KOH, and symptom (erythema, scaling, and pruritus) severity grading. Naftifine gel 2% and vehicle treatment were applied once daily for 2 weeks and the subjects returned at weeks 2 and 6 for efficacy evaluation (mycology culture and grading of symptom severity). A total of 1174 subjects were enrolled with interdigital tinea pedis with or without moccasin infection. Of these subjects, 674 subjects had interdigital presentation while 500 subjects had moccasin infection in addition to the interdigital presentation. All 1174 subjects with interdigital presentation satisfied the inclusion criteria of a minimum of moderate erythema and scaling, and mild pruritus. Of the 500 subjects who had moccasin presentation, 380 satisfied the same inclusion criteria as mentioned above. Since data was analyzed as observed cases, between 337 and 349 subjects had data available for analysis of efficacy. Mycologic cure is defined as a negative dermatophyte culture and KOH, treatment effectiveness is defined as mycologic cure and symptom severity scores of 0 or 1, and complete cure is defined as mycologic cure and symptoms severity scores of 0.

Results

At week 6, the cure rates in the naftifine arm vs. the vehicle were statistically higher (P < 0.0001) for mycological cure rate (65.8% vs. 7.8%), treatment effectiveness (51.4% vs 4.4%), and complete cure rate (19.2% vs 0.9%).

Conclusion

Two weeks application of topical naftifine gel 2% is an effective monotherapy treatment for moccasin tinea pedis.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^e296266b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Authors' conclusions

Implications for practice

Ketoconazole was more effective than placebo at four weeks of follow-up and possibly at three months of follow-up, but few longer-term studies have been conducted. Evidence for this was of low quality. Evidence was insufficient to suggest a dose effect. The most often applied dose was 2%, but the frequency of application of treatments varied between studies from once or twice daily to once or three times weekly for varying lengths of time, and it is unclear which regimen works best.

Ketoconazole did not cause more side effects than were observed with placebo. Topical ketoconazole showed similar efficacy when compared with steroids, but steroids showed a two-fold greater risk of side effects than was seen with ketoconazole. Compared with other antifungals, we cannot say that ketoconazole consistently resulted in a more or less effective outcome because most of these comparisons involved single studies.

Ciclopirox was more effective than placebo but with a comparable incidence of side effects. Evidence was insufficient to reveal an effect of increased dose. Evidence was of moderate quality. Ciclopirox showed effects similar to those of ketoconazole. No comparisons of ciclopirox versus steroids were reported.

Bifonazaole was also found to be more effective than placebo.

Outome variables in this review were stratified according to site (scalp, face or scalp and face). Treatment outcomes were fairly consistent for ketoconazole and other antifungals across different application sites. Studies provided insufficient evidence that the mode of delivery accounted for consistent differences in treatment effect.
