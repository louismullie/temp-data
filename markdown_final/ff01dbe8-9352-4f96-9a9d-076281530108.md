## Question

What is the likelihood of ototoxicity from nebulized tobramycin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the likelihood of ototoxicity from nebulized tobramycin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics and whether systemic exposure meaningfully occurs with inhaled tobramycin. Then, I should verify what the pivotal clinical trials actually measured and what they found regarding hearing outcomes. Next, I will review postmarketing and case reports to gauge real-world risk. After that, I need to consider special populations and risk modifiers, including renal impairment, mitochondrial variants, and cumulative aminoglycoside exposure. Finally, I will synthesize a practical risk estimate and outline monitoring recommendations with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic premise, because if systemic absorption is negligible, the ototoxic risk would be expected to be low. Inhaled tobramycin has low systemic bioavailability, with typical serum levels around 0.06–1.89 mcg/mL one hour after dosing in patients with normal renal function, which is far below the peak and trough thresholds associated with IV aminoglycoside ototoxicity, and this low systemic exposure underpins the favorable safety profile relative to IV therapy [^202a88f0] [^5ee2b53f].

> Wait, let me verify what the randomized trials actually showed about hearing outcomes. In the two Phase 3 studies of TOBI (300 mg twice daily in 28-day on/off cycles), 8 patients (3%) reported transient tinnitus versus 0 on placebo, but no patient developed measurable hearing loss on audiometry, and no discontinuations occurred for tinnitus; dizziness and vertigo were uncommon and similar to placebo, supporting a very low rate of clinically significant ototoxicity in this setting [^2f36ae44] [^115146f4]. Hold on, I should double-check the exact numbers: yes, 8/258 on tobramycin vs 0/258 on placebo for tinnitus, and 0 cases of audiometric hearing loss in the trials, which aligns with the FDA labeling summaries [^2f36ae44] [^115146f4].

> I need to check postmarketing and case-level signals to see if rare events emerge outside trials. The FDA labeling notes that hearing loss has been reported in postmarketing experience with inhaled tobramycin, though frequencies are not quantified, and isolated case reports describe ototoxicity in contexts of renal impairment or high systemic exposure, including an adolescent with renal failure and a serum tobramycin level of 13.4 mg/L who developed profound sensorineural hearing loss after 3 weeks of inhaled therapy, and a lung transplant recipient with renal failure and vestibular injury, underscoring that systemic absorption can be higher in select patients [^d0dc4c0a] [^cd5b5061] [^2e9d562f]. But wait, what if nebulizer type changes absorption? A pediatric study using eFlow found that some children had post-nebulization serum levels above 1 mg/L, with one child showing high-frequency hearing loss, suggesting that device and patient factors can modestly increase systemic exposure in a minority of cases [^41bea1f4].

> Next, I should review risk modifiers. Renal impairment increases aminoglycoside accumulation and ototoxic risk even with inhaled therapy, and mitochondrial 12S rRNA variants (notably m.1555A > G) confer susceptibility to aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity even at therapeutic serum levels; the FDA advises considering alternatives in known carriers or those with a maternal history of aminoglycoside ototoxicity, and to monitor closely if use is unavoidable [^d0dc4c0a] [^c16d9367]. I should also confirm that cumulative lifetime exposure to IV aminoglycosides is a major driver of hearing loss in CF, with studies showing high rates of hearing abnormalities after repeated IV courses, whereas inhaled tobramycin monotherapy in trials did not show audiometric hearing loss, though vigilance remains warranted in heavily exposed patients [^39bcf089] [^2f36ae44].

> Let me consider non-CF populations briefly to ensure generalizability. In non-CF bronchiectasis, a randomized crossover trial of inhaled tobramycin 300 mg twice daily for 6 months reported no detectable ototoxicity, supporting safety in that context, although the sample was small and patients with significant hearing or balance disorders were excluded, which may underestimate risk in real-world cohorts [^c10ac816]. I should also note that expert guidelines for bronchiectasis advise caution and baseline assessment in patients with preexisting hearing or balance issues before initiating inhaled aminoglycosides, reflecting a conservative stance given class effects and limited high-certainty data outside CF [^398c689e].

> I will now examine the mechanistic angle to ensure biological plausibility aligns with the clinical data. Aminoglycoside ototoxicity is driven by oxidative injury to cochlear and vestibular hair cells, and vestibulotoxicity in particular has been described as time-dependent and not strictly tied to peak or trough serum concentrations, which helps explain why rare cases can occur even with low systemic levels from inhaled therapy in susceptible hosts or with prolonged exposure [^ad05592a] [^bc9bc1cc]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: this mechanism supports vigilance but does not contradict the low observed incidence with inhaled tobramycin in typical patients with preserved renal function and without genetic susceptibility [^ad05592a].

> Let me synthesize a practical risk estimate, keeping the caveats explicit. In patients with normal renal function using approved inhaled tobramycin regimens, the best available estimate from randomized trials is that transient tinnitus occurs in about 3% and clinically significant hearing loss was not observed on audiometry, suggesting a very low likelihood of ototoxicity attributable to inhaled therapy alone in this population. Postmarketing and case reports indicate that hearing loss can occur, particularly with renal impairment or high systemic exposure, but absolute risk appears low and is not precisely quantified, likely on the order of less than 1% in typical users, with higher risk in those with renal dysfunction, mitochondrial variants, or concomitant systemic aminoglycosides [^2f36ae44] [^d0dc4c0a] [^cd5b5061]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to cite a 0.5% figure for hearing loss from inhaled tobramycin, but I should correct that: the 0.5% comes from bronchospasm rates in clinical studies, not ototoxicity, so I should not conflate these and will avoid assigning a specific percentage to hearing loss given the absence of a reliable pooled estimate for inhaled therapy alone [^202a88f0].

> Next, I should review monitoring recommendations to translate this into practice. The FDA advises considering baseline audiometry in patients at increased risk of auditory dysfunction and prompt evaluation if tinnitus or hearing changes occur; given the CF population's high background exposure to IV aminoglycosides, CF Foundation otolaryngology consensus recommends periodic hearing assessment after systemic ototoxic therapy and consideration of extended high-frequency testing to detect early injury, with some centers implementing tablet-based audiometry to improve access and adherence [^263f5b60] [^39bcf089] [^25830512] [^737187fb]. I need to ensure I emphasize that routine serum tobramycin monitoring is not required with inhaled therapy in patients with normal renal function, but levels may be considered in renal impairment or when combined with systemic aminoglycosides, and patients should be counseled to report tinnitus, dizziness, or hearing changes promptly [^202a88f0] [^d0dc4c0a].

> Final take: In patients with normal renal function using standard inhaled tobramycin regimens, the likelihood of ototoxicity is very low, with transient tinnitus in about 3% and no signal for audiometric hearing loss in randomized trials. Real-world risk is nonzero, driven largely by renal impairment, mitochondrial susceptibility, or excessive systemic exposure, and rare case reports confirm that hearing loss can occur in those contexts. Clinicians should screen high-risk patients, counsel on symptoms, and monitor hearing if symptoms arise or cumulative IV aminoglycoside exposure is substantial [^2f36ae44] [^d0dc4c0a] [^39bcf089].

The risk of ototoxicity with nebulized tobramycin is **low but not zero** [^d0dc4c0a]. In clinical trials, transient tinnitus occurred in about 3% of patients, and no hearing loss was detected on audiometry [^2f36ae44] [^115146f4]. Postmarketing reports include rare cases of hearing loss, especially with renal impairment, mitochondrial variants, or concomitant systemic aminoglycosides [^d0dc4c0a] [^cd5b5061]. Routine audiometric monitoring is not required for all patients, but baseline and periodic hearing checks are reasonable for those with risk factors or symptoms [^202a88f0] [^25830512]. Overall, nebulized tobramycin is **generally safe** regarding ototoxicity when used as directed, but clinicians should remain vigilant in high-risk patients [^b3c3b9bd].

---

## Clinical trial evidence

- **Transient tinnitus**: In two Phase 3 trials (258 patients, 6–48 years), 8 patients (3%) on nebulized tobramycin reported transient tinnitus vs none on placebo; all resolved without stopping therapy and were not linked to audiometric hearing loss [^2f36ae44] [^115146f4].

- **No audiometric hearing loss**: Audiometric testing up to 8,000 Hz did not show hearing loss attributable to nebulized tobramycin in these trials [^202a88f0].

- **Vestibular symptoms**: Dizziness and vertigo occurred at rates similar to placebo, suggesting no excess vestibular toxicity signal in trials [^115146f4].

---

## Postmarketing and real-world data

Postmarketing reports include **rare hearing loss** with nebulized tobramycin, often in patients with renal impairment, mitochondrial DNA variants, or concomitant systemic aminoglycosides [^d0dc4c0a] [^cd5b5061]. Case reports document **ototoxicity in high-risk settings**, such as renal failure or lung transplantation, where systemic absorption may be higher [^cd5b5061] [^2e9d562f]. Observational CF cohorts show low rates of ototoxicity with inhaled tobramycin, though cumulative IV aminoglycoside exposure increases risk [^39bcf089] [^9ecaf9ef].

---

## Risk factors for ototoxicity with nebulized tobramycin

Several factors **increase risk**:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Renal impairment | Reduced clearance increases systemic exposure and ototoxic risk [^d0dc4c0a] [^cd5b5061] |
| Mitochondrial DNA variants | m.1555A > G variant predisposes to aminoglycoside ototoxicity even at normal serum levels [^d0dc4c0a] [^c16d9367] |
| Concomitant systemic aminoglycosides | Additive ototoxic potential [^d0dc4c0a] [^96e2764e] |
| High cumulative exposure | Repeated or prolonged courses increase risk [^bc9bc1cc] [^39bcf089] |

---

## Mechanisms of ototoxicity

Aminoglycosides cause **cochlear and vestibular hair cell injury** via reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to irreversible damage [^ad05592a]. Inhaled delivery yields low systemic exposure, but **measurable serum levels** can occur, especially with impaired renal function or certain nebulizers, enabling systemic ototoxicity in susceptible patients [^202a88f0] [^41bea1f4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Routine audiometric monitoring is **not required** for all patients on nebulized tobramycin, but baseline and periodic hearing checks are reasonable for those with risk factors or symptoms [^202a88f0] [^25830512]. Patients should be counseled to report tinnitus, hearing changes, or balance symptoms promptly, and clinicians should consider audiometry if symptoms occur [^263f5b60] [^d0dc4c0a].

---

## Comparison with other aminoglycosides

Among aminoglycosides, **tobramycin has a relatively favorable ototoxicity profile**, with lower rates of cochleotoxicity than amikacin and similar or lower rates than gentamicin in some analyses [^bc9bc1cc]. Inhaled formulations further reduce systemic exposure and ototoxic risk compared with IV administration, though risk remains in vulnerable patients [^b3c3b9bd] [^d0dc4c0a].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Evidence source** | **Ototoxicity findings** |
|-|-|
| Clinical trials | - 3% transient tinnitus <br/> - No audiometric hearing loss [^2f36ae44] [^115146f4] |
| Postmarketing | Rare hearing loss, often with renal impairment or mitochondrial variants [^d0dc4c0a] [^cd5b5061] |
| Case reports | Ototoxicity in renal failure, lung transplant, or high systemic exposure [^cd5b5061] [^2e9d562f] |
| Guidelines | - No routine monitoring required <br/> - Baseline/periodic checks in high-risk patients [^202a88f0] [^25830512] |

---

The risk of ototoxicity with nebulized tobramycin is **low but not negligible**; transient tinnitus occurs in about 3% of patients, and clinically significant hearing loss is rare in trials but reported postmarketing in high-risk patients. Clinicians should identify risk factors, counsel patients, and use baseline and symptom-triggered audiometry to mitigate risk [^2f36ae44] [^d0dc4c0a] [^25830512].

### Efficacy and safety of aerosolized tobramycin in cystic fibrosis [^790b2ac1]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2001). Low credibility.

Aerosolized tobramycin has been extensively used in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in order to directly deliver the antibiotic to the endobronchial site of infection, and decrease toxicity by limiting systemic absorption. Aerosolized tobramycin doses ranging from 80 mg twice or three times daily to 600 mg three times daily have been used in various clinical trials. At an 80-mg dose, preservation of pulmonary function with little or no improvement over the baseline was reported. Tobramycin, nebulized at 600 mg three times daily, significantly improved clinical and pulmonary functions and reduced the density of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum. No ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity was reported at either dose. TOBI, a tobramycin solution for inhalation, received Food and Drug Administration approval for maintenance treatment of P. aeruginosa lung infections in CF patients at least 6 years of age. Patients received TOBI nebulize 300 mg of tobramycin every 12 hr daily for 28 days, followed by 28 days off the drug in alternating cycles. In phase III trials, TOBI improved pulmonary function and decreased sputum density of P. aeruginosa compared to placebo. Serum creatinine was minimally, transiently elevated in both groups. More patients in the TOBI group reported voice alterations. All reports of tinnitus were in the TOBI group. An increased risk of emergence of resistant strains of P. aeruginosa was noted at all doses, after prolonged use.

4.2 Recommendations

Concerning the findings of this study and the current evidence base, baseline audiometric assessment of all persons with CF is recommended before first IV AG exposure. Testing using EHFs up to, or beyond, 12,500 Hz is advocated, as 8000 Hz may fail to detect AG‐induced ototoxicity. Future studies should prospectively measure hearing at baseline and changes with ongoing IV AG exposure. There is no well‐established threshold of IV aminoglycoside exposure in pediatric or adult patients that reliably predicts the risk of ototoxicity. In fact, in adult CF patients, one course of IV tobramycin was sufficient to cause HI and other ototoxic symptoms 4 weeks after treatment ended. Dong et al. showed that their advanced pharmacokinetic modeling is able to provide an informed analysis predicting ototoxicity risk in patients with CF treated with tobramycin. Hence, as most adult patients with CF are frequently exposed to intravenous AG, resulting in HI at a rate significantly higher than what would be expected from aging alone.

4.3 Clinical Applications

Early detection may lead the clinician to consider alternative treatment to prevent ongoing HI. For example, choosing nebulized antibiotics rather than IV, which have a greater surface area deposition in lungs, lower systemic absorption, and lower incidence of adverse effects like ototoxicity. The therapeutic potential for ameliorating HI with concomitant use of otoprotectants such as N‐acetyl cysteine, D‐methionine or glutathione may offer future benefits, but both the patient population who would benefit most and the clinical efficacy of these regimens are currently ill‐defined and more work needs to be done to ensure lack of interference between the otoprotectant with the AGs' antibacterial activity.

### Tobramycin (Tobi) [^d0dc4c0a]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1	Bronchospasm

Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of TOBI. In clinical studies with TOBI, changes in FEV1measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of TOBI should be treated as medically appropriate.

5.2	Ototoxicity

Ototoxicity with use of TOBI

Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides.

Transient tinnitus occurred in eight TOBI treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with TOBI therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving TOBI have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking TOBI. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing TOBI.

Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants

Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies.

5.3	Nephrotoxicity

Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with TOBI but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with TOBI should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing TOBI.

### Formulation of aerosolized therapeutics [^0c131236]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), which colonizes the airways of approximately 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) at some point during their lives, is an important contributor to the vicious cycle of infection and inflammation leading to bronchiectasis and eventual respiratory failure. Oral antibiotic therapy is often ineffective in treating PA infections. Instead, in-hospital IV aminoglycoside therapy administered in combination with other IV antibiotics, such as beta-lactams or quinolones, is the mainstay of treatment. The specific chemical and physical properties of CF sputum require high serum antibiotic levels for effective antimicrobial treatment; however, IV aminoglycoside therapy is associated with an increased risk of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. In an attempt to avoid systemic toxicity and effectively treat PA infections, clinicians have combined IV antibiotics with sterile solutions of saline or water to aerosolize the mixture for inhalation. Experience with such "home brews" has clearly demonstrated that IV preparations are neither intended nor medically indicated for inhalation. Patients may experience coughing, mucosal irritation, or bronchospasm in response to the preservatives, stabilizing agents, and other additives commonly found in IV preparations. While the rationale for aerosolized drug delivery remains compelling, concerns about uniform dose delivery, ineffective nebulization, and therapeutic adherence arise. Since the 1940s, when these efforts began, ongoing research and clinical trials have identified several additional factors affecting inhaled drug delivery and deposition in the airways. This article chronicles some of the challenges faced by researchers and elucidates factors critical to the reformulation of a safe and effective antibiotic solution for aerosolized delivery.

### Vestibulotoxicity in a patient without renal failure after inhaled tobramycin [^0d17c061]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aminoglycoside antibiotics have a long history of use in the control of gram-negative bacterial infections, but their systemic use has been complicated by known ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Because of the utility of these medications in patients with frequent pulmonary infections, there has been a move towards the use of inhaled agents, in particular tobramycin, due to a lower rate of systemic complications. Inhaled tobramycin is generally consider to be safe from otologic complications, with only two previous reports of ototoxicity, both in patients who had underlying chronic renal disease. Here we present the first case of a patient developing isolated vestibular toxicity, without associated hearing loss or evidence of renal insufficiency, in a patient receiving inhaled tobramycin. This is an extremely rare complication of an inhaled aminoglycoside and underscores the importance of careful monitoring despite perceived safety.

5.1 Bronchospasm

Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV1measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate.

5.2 Ototoxicity

Ototoxicity with use of Tobramycin inhalation solution

Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides.

Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss.

Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution.

Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants

Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range.

### Administration of aerosolized antibiotics in cystic fibrosis patients [^a3c13081]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

High rates of colonization and the challenge of managing Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have necessitated a search for safe and effective antibiotics. Currently, therapy with an aminoglycoside in combination with a beta-lactam or a quinolone antibiotic is the standard. Unfortunately, it is difficult to deliver high doses of these antibiotics via the IV route without significant systemic adverse events (AEs) (eg, ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity). Recently, a reformulation of the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin has become available in a preservative-free, pH-adjusted solution for inhalation by jet nebulizer. A 96-week series of clinical studies including 520 patients, aged > or = 6 years, with moderate-to-severe CF has evaluated the long-term safety and effectiveness of this formulation. Patients received tobramycin solution for inhalation (TSI) or placebo, which was administered in alternating cycles of 28-days-on and 28-days-off therapy, plus their usual CF care for 6 months with open-label follow-up extended to 2 years. Most AEs declined in frequency with increasing TSI exposure. Patients receiving TSI spent 25 to 33% fewer days in the hospital. Following the initiation of TSI treatment, patients experienced significant increases in FEV(1). FEV(1) values were maintained above baseline for the duration of the study series. Antibiotic susceptibility of the bacterial isolates did not predict clinical response. TSI was safe, well-tolerated, and effective for long-term treatment (96 weeks) of P aeruginosa colonization and infection in CF patients.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Although there are no available data on tobramycin inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery.

Data

Animal Data

No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted withtobramycin (tobramycin administered by inhalation). However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin ≥40 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin.

5.1 Bronchospasm

Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate.

5.2 Ototoxicity

Ototoxicity with use of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution

Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. In postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] .

Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants

Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies.

5.3 Nephrotoxicity

Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution.

### Aminoglycoside-induced vestibular injury: maintaining a sense of balance [^bc9bc1cc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the mechanism and risk factors for the development of aminoglycoside-induced vestibular injury and discuss their implications for therapeutic monitoring of aminoglycoside antibiotics.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1975-January 2008) was performed to identify literature on aminoglycoside-induced vestibular injury and risk factors associated with this outcome and their impact on therapeutic drug monitoring. Additional references were identified through review of bibliographies of identified articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Data on the mechanisms of vestibular toxicity and its development in association with aminoglycoside exposure were extracted from identified references.

Data Synthesis

The mechanism leading to the development of irreversible vestibular injury from exposure to aminoglycosides appears to be through the excessive production of oxidative free radicals. This production and subsequent toxicity appears to be a time-dependent process and is unrelated to dose or serum concentration. For similarly designed studies, the pooled incidence of vestibular toxicity is 10.9% for gentamicin, 7.4% for amikacin, 3.5% for tobramycin, and 1.1% for netilmicin. Current evidence suggests that this form of drug toxicity is not restricted to traditionally dosed systemic therapy, since intraperitoneal administration, high-dose once-daily administration, topical inhalation, and eardrop administration have all been associated with the development of this adverse outcome.

Conclusions

Given the lack of association between serum concentrations and vestibulotoxicity, it is imperative for the pharmacist to interview the patient and not focus solely on maintaining target range drug concentrations. Minimizing the duration of exposure to aminoglycosides is recommended to reduce the risk from this form of drug toxicity.

5.1 Ototoxicity

Ototoxicity with use of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution

Caution should be exercised when prescribing Tobramycin Inhalation Solution to patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction.

Findings related to ototoxicity as measured by audiometric evaluations and auditory adverse event reports were similar between Tobramycin Inhalation Solution and placebo in controlled clinical trials.  Hearing loss was reported in two (1.1%) Tobramycin Inhalation Solution-treated patients and in one (0.9%) placebo-treated patient during clinical studies.  Additionally, dizziness and vertigo, both of which may be manifestations of vestibular forms Tobramycin Inhalation Solution of ototoxicity, were observed in similar numbers of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution- and placebo-treated patients.  Dizziness occurred in two (1.1%) Tobramycin Inhalation Solution-treated patients and one (0.9%) placebo-treated patient and vertigo occurred in two (1.1%) Tobramycin Inhalation Solution-treated patients versus no placebo patients in clinical studies. None of the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution patients discontinued their therapy due to hearing loss, dizziness or vertigo.

Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity.  No reports of tinnitus occurred in patients during clinical studies with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, but because it has been observed with inhaled tobramycin solutions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)], onset of this symptom warrants caution.  Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides.  Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking Tobramycin Inhalation Solution.

### Inhaled tobramycin in non-cystic fibrosis patients with bronchiectasis and chronic bronchial infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^c10ac816]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Non-cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with bronchiectasis usually develop chronic bronchial infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) that is related to worsening lung function and increased morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To determine whether direct aerosol delivery of tobramycin to the lower airways may control infection and produce only low systemic toxicity.

Methods

A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial involving 30 patients was conducted to determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of 6-month tobramycin inhalation therapy. Patients received 300 mg of aerosolized tobramycin or placebo twice daily in 2 cycles, each for 6 months, with a one-month washout period. The number of exacerbations, number of hospital admissions, number of hospital admission days, antibiotic use, pulmonary function, quality of life, tobramycin toxicity, density of PA in sputum, emergence of bacterial resistance, and emergence of other opportunistic bacteria were recorded.

Results

The number of admissions and days of admission (mean +/- SD) during the tobramycin period (0.15 +/- 0.37 and 2.05 +/- 5.03) were lower than those during the placebo period (0.75 +/-1.16 and 12.65 +/- 21.8) (p < 0.047). A decrease in PA density in sputum was associated with tobramycin administration in the analysis of the first 6-month cycle (p = 0.038). No significant differences were observed in the number of exacerbations, antibiotic use, pulmonary function, and quality of life. The emergence of bacterial resistance and other bacteria did not differ between the 2 periods of study. Inhaled tobramycin was associated with bronchospasm in 3 patients, but not with detectable ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity.

Conclusions

Aerosol administration of high-dose tobramycin in non-CF bronchiectatic patients for endobronchial infection with PA appears to be safe and decreases the risk of hospitalization and PA density in sputum. Nevertheless, pulmonary function and quality of life are not improved, and the risk of bronchospasm is appreciable.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary exacerbations—aminoglycoside dosing and monitoring: Once-daily aminoglycoside dosing achieves higher peaks and longer drug-free intervals than divided dosing (for tobramycin, “a dose of 10 mg/kg/d tobramycin given every 24 hours is effective … to produce a peak blood level of 25–35 μg/ml and a 9- to 10-hour period with the drug concentration below detectable levels,” whereas the same “10 mg/kg/d tobramycin given every 8-hour intervals will yield only a 1- to 2-hour period” below detection), and a meta-analysis “found that once daily administration of aminoglycosides was as effective as multiple daily dosing, with a lower risk of nephrotoxicity.” The committee “identified five trials” in CF and advises monitoring: “patients treated with frequent courses of aminoglycosides should receive periodic monitoring of drug concentration … [and] periodic assessment of toxicity such as audiograms and measurement of serum creatinine are also recommended.” Formal recommendation: “The CF Foundation recommends that once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides is preferable to 3-times daily dosing for treatment of an acute exacerbation of pulmonary disease.

### Presence of tobramycin in blood and urine during selective decontamination of the digestive tract in critically ill patients, a prospective cohort study [^3ba6ede9]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Risk of toxicity

Tobramycin toxicity is associated with high prolonged serum concentrations and especially high trough concentrations. Persistent leakage of tobramycin may be toxic, especially for the inner ear and kidneys. Tobramycin could be detected in the serum in 83% of the patients when using a sensitive method (detection > 0.050 mg/L). Previous studies using a slightly less sensitive method (detection > 0.18 mg/L) found detectible serum tobramycin concentrations in 9/15 ventilated patients (> 1 mg/L in 2 patients), in 56% of the samples from 22 intensive care patients receiving SDD for 10 days with concentrations > 2 mg in the 2 patients with renal failure, and in 12/19 critically ill patients treated with continuous venovenous hemofiltration (> 1 mg in 4 patients). We found a concentration > 1 mg/L only once and a steady state after repeated administrations (see Figure 1). Recently, a serum tobramycin concentration of 18.9 mg/L was reported 30 days after oesophago-gastrectomy. The patient developed AKI and remained dialysis dependent. Toxic tobramycin concentrations were likely explained by colonic ischemia, motility disorders, a blind jejunal loop and additional suppositories. Mild toxic effects are difficult to determine in critically ill patients without a randomized controlled design due to the complexity of critical illness and its associated multiple drug use and also because tobramycin leakage during the first ICU day was already associated with oliguria at ICU admission, before any tobramycin was administered. We could not show major kidney injury due to tobramycin leakage, because creatinine at hospital discharge and change in creatinine (at discharge divided by pre-hospital admission) were not higher in the patients with tobramycin leakage. We did not take audiograms in our patients, thus otoxicity was not monitored. Fortunately, tobramycin leakage in our patients was not associated with crude outcome markers like ICU stay or hospital mortality. To prevent possible toxicity of SDD, monitoring blood tobramycin concentrations should be considered in patients with a prolonged vasopressor-dependent circulation, renal dysfunction, enteral dysmotility and especially when adding tobramycin suppositories or nebulization in patients. When serum concentrations remain > 1 mg/L, enteral tobramycin dose should be reduced.

### Aerosolized amikacin for treatment of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infections: an observational case series [^22bc976f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Aminoglycosides, particularly amikacin, have been recommended and variably used for limited duration (less than 4 to 6 months) parenteral therapy for NTM infections. The aminoglycosides exhibit significant concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against NTM. More extended parenteral therapy duration has been avoided due to the substantial risks of nephrotoxicity (15%), ototoxicity (37%) and vestibular toxicity (9%). Aerosol antibiotic delivery offers the potential advantage of achieving high lung drug concentrations with concomitant low systemic absorption, low serum drug concentrations, and thus a diminished risk of systemic toxicities. In a small intensive care unit study, aerosolized amikacin delivered to mechanically ventilated patients at doses of 400 mg every 8 hours resulted in mean peak sputum concentrations of more than 5,000 mcg/ml, an impressive level that would be completely unachievable (and toxic) when delivered systemically. Aerosolized antibiotics have been used with notable success in the treatment of chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis. Recent studies have expanded on this concept and have demonstrated safety and tolerance of inhaled tobramycin solution for inhalation in the management of non-cystic fibrosis patients with severe bronchiectasis. These studies were able to demonstrate a decrease in the number of hospitalizations, improvement in respiratory symptoms and in health related quality of life. Inhaled aminoglycosides (gentamycin, kanamycin and streptomycin) have also been reported to provide benefit when used as a salvage therapy in complex and refractory pulmonary tuberculosis infections.

The addition of aerosolized amikacin to standard oral therapy for NTM pulmonary infection has the potential to improve treatment efficacy without increasing the risk for systemic toxicity. Inhaled amikacin has been considered as adjunctive therapy for pulmonary NTM infections for a number of years, and has been used in very limited circumstances, but no formal evaluation of the pharmacokinetics, tolerability or therapeutic efficacy of inhaled amikacin has been undertaken. This current investigation reports the pharmacokinetics of inhaled amikacin in adults, as well as our preliminary experience with inhaled amikacin therapy in a small patient cohort with pulmonary NTM infection.

MAC-PD—aminoglycoside strategies, efficacy, and toxicity: In a multicentre study of 146 HIV-negative patients with MAC-PD, participants were randomised to intramuscular streptomycin (15 mg/kg) or placebo thrice weekly for the first 3 months alongside clarithromycin, rifampin and ethambutol; streptomycin yielded higher culture conversion (71% vs 51%, p<0.05) after approximately 2 years, but a third in each group relapsed and there were no significant differences in symptoms or radiology. In a nonrandomised study, culture conversion did not differ significantly with an initial intramuscular kanamycin course (78%) versus none (58%). In six MAC-PD cases receiving aerosolised amikacin added to standard therapy, four were culture negative after 6 months, while others re-cultured MAC or could not tolerate treatment; nebulised amikacin (250 mg once or twice daily) in 20 refractory NTM-PD cases (3 MAC) had adverse events in 35%, with two discontinuations for hearing loss. Amikacin toxicity across regimens (15 mg/kg once daily or 25 mg/kg thrice weekly) included ototoxicity in 37%, vestibular toxicity in 8%, and nephrotoxicity in 15%; streptomycin, although less widely used for MAC-PD than amikacin, may have less ototoxicity. Aerosolised amikacin may be preferable to intravenous aminoglycoside for burden and toxicity, but outcome data are limited and it is unlikely to be helpful for cavitary disease.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:

Bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Ototoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Neuromuscular Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Embryo-fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

TOBI was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received TOBI in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks.

Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of TOBI patients during the two Phase 3 studies.

Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with TOBI:

Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus

Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia

Infections and Infestations: Laryngitis

Voice Alteration and Tinnitus

Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more TOBI-treated patients. Thirty-three patients (13%) treated with TOBI complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods.

Eight patients from the TOBI group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the TOBI treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the TOBI and placebo groups.

Changes in Serum Creatinine

Nine (3%) patients in the TOBI group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the TOBI group, creatinine decreased at the next visit.

10 OVERDOSAGE

No overdoses have been reported with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in clinical trials.  Signs and symptoms of acute toxicity from overdosage of intravenous tobramycin might include dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, loss of high-tone hearing acuity, respiratory failure, neuromuscular blockade, and renal impairment. Administration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin. Tobramycin is not significantly absorbed following oral administration. Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage.

In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered.

5.4 Bronchospasm

Bronchospasm has been reported with inhalation of tobramycin. In clinical studies with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, bronchospasm was observed in one (0.5%) Tobramycin Inhalation Solution-treated patient and in no placebo-treated patients. Wheezing occurred in ten (5%) Tobramycin Inhalation Solution-treated patients and four (4%) placebo-treated patients. Bronchospasm and wheezing should be treated as medically appropriate.

5.5 Laboratory Tests

Audiograms

Clinical studies of inhaled tobramycin solutions did not identify hearing loss using audiometric tests which evaluated hearing up to 8000 Hz. Physicians should consider an audiogram for patients who show any evidence of auditory dysfunction, or who are at increased risk for auditory dysfunction. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants caution.

Serum Concentrations

In patients with normal renal function treated with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, serum tobramycin concentrations range from approximately 0.06-1.89 mcg/mL one hour after dose administration and do not require routine monitoring. Serum concentrations of tobramycin in patients with renal dysfunction or patients treated with concomitant parenteral tobramycin should be monitored at the discretion of the treating physician [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

The serum concentration of tobramycin should only be monitored through venipuncture and not finger prick blood sampling. Contamination of the skin of the fingers with tobramycin may lead to falsely increased measurements of serum levels of the drug. This contamination cannot be completely avoided by hand washing before testing.

Renal Function

The clinical studies of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution did not reveal any imbalance in the percentage of patients who experienced at least a 50% rise in serum creatinine from baseline in either the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution group (n=26, 14%) or the placebo group (n=15, 13%). Laboratory tests of urine and renal function should be conducted at the discretion of the treating physician.

### Tobramycin sulfate (tobramycin) [^5ee2b53f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Patients treated with tobramycin injection and other aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation, because these drugs have an inherent potential for causing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.

Neurotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur.  The auditory changes are irreversible, are usually bilateral, and may be partial or total.  Eighth-nerve impairment and nephrotoxicity may develop, primarily in patients having preexisting renal damage and in those with normal renal function to whom aminoglycosides are administered for longer periods or in higher doses than those recommended.  Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions.  The risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations.  Patients who develop cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of eighth-nerve toxicity, and partial or total irreversible bilateral deafness may continue to develop after the drug has been discontinued.

Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy.  Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity usually is reversible.

Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy.  Peak and trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels.  Prolonged serum concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided.  Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation.  Such accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS).  Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts.  Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance should be measured periodically.  When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients.  Evidence of impairment of renal, vestibular, or auditory function requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment.

Geriatric Use

Elderly patients may be at a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity while receiving tobramycin (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and OVERDOSAGE).  Other factors that may contribute to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rising trough levels, excessive peak concentrations, dehydration, concomitant use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs, and cumulative dose.  Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).  Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.  Dose reduction is required for patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).  Elderly patients may have reduced renal function that may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine.  A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful.  Monitoring of renal function during treatment with aminoglycosides is particularly important in the elderly (see PRECAUTIONS).

Each mL of tobramycin (10 mg/mL or 40 mg/mL) contains 0.78 mg (0.034 mEq) of sodium.

General

Prescribing tobramycin injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Serum and urine specimens for examination should be collected during therapy, as recommended in the WARNINGS box.  Serum calcium, magnesium, and sodium should be monitored.

Peak and trough serum levels should be measured periodically during therapy.  Prolonged concentrations above 12 mcg/mL should be avoided.  Rising trough levels (above 2 mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation.  Such accumulation, advanced age, and cumulative dosage may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.  It is particularly important to monitor serum levels closely in patients with known renal impairment.

A useful guideline would be to perform serum level assays after 2 or 3 doses, so that the dosage could be adjusted if necessary, and at 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy.  In the event of changing renal function, more frequent serum levels should be obtained and the dosage or dosage interval adjusted according to the guidelines provided in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .

In order to measure the peak level, a serum sample should be drawn about 30 minutes following intravenous infusion or 1 hour after an intramuscular injection.  Trough levels are measured by obtaining serum samples at 8 hours or just prior to the next dose of tobramycin.  These suggested time intervals are intended only as guidelines and may vary according to institutional practices.  It is important, however, that there be consistency within the individual patient program unless computerized pharmacokinetic dosing programs are available in the institution.  These serum-level assays may be especially useful for monitoring the treatment of severely ill patients with changing renal function or of those infected with less susceptible organisms or those receiving maximum dosage.

Prior to starting long-term inhaled aminoglycosides, for safety reasons, (1) avoid using if creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, (2) use with caution if patient has significant hearing loss needing hearing aid(s) or significant balance issues; (3) avoid concomitant nephrotoxic medications.
Counsel patients about potential major side effects with long-term antibiotics and to seek urgent attention if these develop. Review the patient’s culture and mycobacterial status, optimise airway clearance and treat other associated conditions before starting long-term antibiotics. Prophylactic antibiotics should be only started by respiratory specialists. Review patients on long-term antibiotics 6 monthly with assessment of efficacy, toxicity and continuing need. Monitor sputum culture and sensitivity regularly, although in vitro resistance may not affect clinical efficacy.
As adverse event frequency of azithromycin is likely to be dose related, 250 mg 3 times a week is a pragmatic starting dose which can then be increased according to clinical response and adverse events.
Thresholds for long-term treatment may reduce if the patient is symptomatic between exacerbations and/or the exacerbations respond poorly to treatment and/or the patient is at high risk of severe exacerbation, for example, immunosuppressed.
Long-term antibiotic choice is complex and has to take into account factors such as tolerance, allergies and sensitivity; therefore, in some circumstances, other long-term antibiotic regimens may be appropriate (see full guideline appendix 3).
Perform a suitable challenge test when stable before starting inhaled antibiotics (see full guideline appendix 2).
Consider cyclical intravenous antibiotics in patients with repeated infections (≥5/year) despite other treatments.
Alternative inhaled/nebulised agents may become licensed as international studies are completed.
For patients receiving long-term prophylactic oral antibiotics, the preferred option is to remain on the same antibiotic as opposed to monthly rotation of antibiotics. If there is a subsequent lack of efficacy, the antibiotic can be changed guided by sensitivity results.

### Side effects of aminoglycosides on the kidney, ear and balance in cystic fibrosis [^bc826f9c]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with CF have a large lifetime exposure to multiple medications. Aggressive treatment with intravenous antibiotics slows the progression of lung disease, decreases morbidity and delays mortality, with a cost of an increased risk of side effects. Minimising the risk of side effects is of paramount importance within the ‘first, do no harm’ principle.

Recent single-centre studies have suggested that the prevalence of side effects such as chronic kidney disease, ototoxicity and vestibulotoxicity are disturbingly high in the CF population. If these findings are confirmed, clinicians will need strategies to minimise the risk of toxicity. CKD has implications for lung transplantation as it is well recognised that further nephrotoxicity occurs after transplantation.

Currently, there are limited options for monitoring the early signs of toxicity. Serum creatinine-based formulae are poor at predicting renal function in the CF population; a biomarker which reliably predicts GFR (or screens patients for renal impairment) is urgently needed in the clinical setting. Similarly, once the PTA has become abnormal due to aminoglycoside ototoxicity, hearing is not expected to improve. Further research evaluating the role of DPOAEs as an early marker of cochlear damage is required.

Some strategies have already been widely adopted, such as once daily aminoglycosides, the use of tobramycin rather than gentamicin and careful monitoring of drug levels. Other approaches such as the optimum time of day of administration of antibiotics, screening for mutations which predispose to ototoxicity and the use of aspirin and NAC in patients with CF require careful consideration and further research.

### Serum tobramycin levels following delivery of tobramycin (tobi) via eFlow advanced nebuliser in children with cystic fibrosis [^41bea1f4]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Safety and toxicity data for nebulised tobramycin are mainly derived from use of the Pari LC Plus nebuliser, yet many centres are now using advanced nebulisers, such as the eFlow.

Methods

Ten children (ages 2-16years) receiving 300mg TOBI via eFlow for clinical reasons participated. Serum tobramycin levels were obtained 1h post nebulisation. Nine provided samples for urinary NAG, and 10 underwent audiology.

Results

Tobramycin levels were >1mg/L in 3 children (maximum 3.8, 2 children aged 2years). Urine NAG/creatinine levels were raised (>0.94micromol/min/mmol) in 5 children, 1 of these had a tobramycin level of >1mg/L. One patient had high frequency hearing loss.

Conclusion

Serum tobramycin levels over 1mg/L can occur 1h post 300mg TOBI delivered by eFlow. Raised urinary NAG levels suggest that some children may have some associated early renal toxicity.

### Treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease: an official ATS / ERS / ESCMID / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^b0d39bb7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) pulmonary disease—inhaled amikacin or ALIS: In patients with newly diagnosed MAC pulmonary disease, we suggest neither inhaled amikacin (parenteral formulation) nor ALIS be used as part of the initial treatment regimen (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in estimates of effect). In patients with MAC pulmonary disease who have failed therapy after at least 6 months of guideline-based therapy, we recommend addition of ALIS to the treatment regimen instead of a standard oral regimen, only (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in estimates of effect). However, systemic use of parenteral amikacin has been associated with a high frequency of renal, auditory, and vestibular toxicity, and delivery of amikacin by hand-held nebulization may be a potential way to improve efficacy and decrease drug-related toxicity. Reports evaluating inhaled amikacin include five retrospective case series (N = 138 patients, 55 with MAC) using commercially available amikacin (parenteral formulation) with doses ranging from 250 to 500 mg once daily up to 15 mg/kg once daily added to an oral regimen; clinical responses were reported in 20–100% and sputum conversion in 18–67% of treatment refractory MAC pulmonary disease, with reported side effects ranging from 8 to 38%, ototoxicity 0 to 10%, nephrotoxicity in only 1 patient, and vertigo in 2 patients.

### Once-daily versus multiple-daily dosing with intravenous aminoglycosides for cystic fibrosis [^a51fc569]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

People with cystic fibrosis, who are chronically colonised with the organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa, often require multiple courses of intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics for the management of pulmonary exacerbations. The properties of aminoglycosides suggest that they could be given in higher doses less often.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of once-daily versus multiple-daily dosing of intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics for the management of pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cystic Fibrosis Specialist Register held at the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's editorial base, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and handsearching abstract books of conference proceedings.Date of the most recent search: 25 November 2013.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials, whether published or unpublished, in which once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides has been compared with multiple-daily dosing in terms of efficacy or toxicity or both, in people with cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently selected the studies to be included in the review and assessed the risk of bias of each study. Data were independently extracted by each author. Authors of the included studies were contacted for further information. As yet unpublished data were obtained for one of the included studies.

Main Results

Fifteen studies were identified for possible inclusion in the review. Four studies reporting results from a total of 328 participants were included in this review. All studies compared once-daily dosing with thrice-daily dosing. One study had a low risk of bias for all criteria assessed; the remaining three included studies had a high risk of bias from blinding, but for other criteria were judged to have either an unclear or a low risk of bias.There was no significant difference between treatment groups in: forced expiratory volume at one second, mean difference 0.33 (95% confidence interval -2.81 to 3.48); forced vital capacity, mean difference 0.29 (95% confidence interval -6.58 to 7.16); % weight for height, mean difference -0.82 (95% confidence interval -3.77 to 2.13); body mass index, mean difference 0.00 (95% confidence interval -0.42 to 0.42); or in the incidence of ototoxicity, relative risk 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.04 to 7.96). The percentage change in creatinine significantly favoured once-daily treatment in children, mean difference -8.20 (95% confidence interval -15.32 to -1.08), but showed no difference in adults, mean difference 3.25 (95% confidence interval -1.82 to 8.33).

Authors' Conclusions

Once- and three-times daily aminoglycoside antibiotics appear to be equally effective in the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. There is evidence of less nephrotoxicity in children.

### Safety of inhaled (tobi ®) and intravenous tobramycin in young children with cystic fibrosis [^fde5e27e]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Use of inhaled tobramycin therapy for treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in young children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is increasing. Safety data for pre-school children are sparse.

Methods

The aim of this study was to assess the safety of tobramycin solution for inhalation (TOBI®-TSI) administered twice daily for 2 months/course concurrently to intravenous (IV) tobramycin during P. aeruginosa eradication therapy in children (0-5 years). Audiological assessment and estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured prior to any exposure and end of the study.

Results

Data were available from 142 patients who were either never exposed to aminoglycosides (n=39), exposed to IV aminoglycosides only (n=36) or exposed to IV+TSI (n=67). Median exposure to TSI was 113 days [59, 119]. Comparison of effects on audiometry results and GFR, showed no detectable difference between the groups.

Conclusions

Use of TSI and IV tobramycin in pre-school children with CF was not associated with detectable renal toxicity or ototoxicity.

### The long-term use of inhaled tobramycin in patients with cystic fibrosis [^a5c501ce]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2002). Low credibility.

Tobramycin nebuliser solution (TNS) has been investigated in several clinical trials, including a large, placebo-controlled study that demonstrated efficacy over a 24-week period. The open-label extension phase of this trial enabled observations to be conducted for an additional period of almost 18 months. Patients from both treatment arms (n=396) entered the open-label phase and received up to nine 28-day on, 28-day off cycles of TNS 300 mg by aerosol twice daily (b.i.d.). Mean lung function in patients who had received placebo during the double-blind phase improved during the first three cycles of the open-label treatment. However, lung function in these patients did not recover to the levels seen in those patients who had received TNS throughout the double-blind and open-label phases. In both groups of patients, improvement was maintained during the study. Greater improvements were seen in adolescents compared with older patients. Adverse events were generally uncommon, with a notably lower incidence of fever, anorexia, abdominal pain and vomiting than was observed in the double-blind phase among patients who received placebo, and a generally low incidence of tinnitus. We conclude that long-term TNS administration is safe and effective.

### Tobramycin [^089ea01b]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of tobramycin IV in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Therapeutic blood levels in the mother do not equate with safety for the fetus. Aminoglycosides should be considered potentially ototoxic and nephrotoxic to the fetus. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. The drug tobramycin IV is classified under category D in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has caused, is suspected to have caused, or may be expected to cause, an increased incidence of human fetal malformations or irreversible damage.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^997d0244]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — topical antibiotics: Summary Statement 24: Consider a 3- to 6-week course of topical antibiotics for CRS. (Rec, C) Most topical antibiotic studies have involved administration of nebulized antibiotic for 3 to 6 weeks in prospective observational studies only rather than double-blinded or placebo-controlled studies, with excellent to good improvement reported in 82% of cases. Topical irrigation with 80 mg/L of gentamicin or tobramycin also can be useful for this purpose, and twice-daily irrigation with gentamicin for 3 to 15 weeks caused low but measurable systemic absorption, with blood levels ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 mg/mL; sensorineural hearing loss was noted in 23% of patients with CF who had used frequent irrigations, and topical aminoglycosides should be used with caution and for a defined treatment period.

Recommended clinical practice antibiotic treatment for MAC-PD in CF

A typical treatment schedule for individuals with CF with MAC infection is shown in figure 2. Antibiotic dosing regimens are listed in table 2 with important side effects/toxicities described in table 3.

Individuals with clarithromycin sensitive MAC-PD should be treated with a daily oral antibiotic regimen that includes a macrolide, rifampin and ethambutol (15 mg/kg), consistent with the ATS/IDSA recommendations for individuals with severe nodular bronchiectatic disease.Intermittent oral antibiotic therapy is not recommended due to the nature of the underlying lung disease and concerns regarding antibiotic absorption in CF. While there are no head to head trials showing a difference in outcome between individuals with MAC-PD treated with clarithromycin or azithromycin, the latter may be the macrolide of choice in CF, as it can be taken once daily, its serum levels may be less affected by rifamycinsand it has well established benefits in individuals with CF in addition to its effects on NTM.

Individuals with a high bacterial load (suggested by smear positivity, radiological evidence of lung cavitation and/or significant inflammatory change or the presence of systemic symptoms) may benefit from an initial (1–3 month) course of injectable amikacin or streptomycin, in addition to the standard three-drug regimen for MAC-PD. While the available data do not show a difference in toxicity between amikacin regimens dosed at 15 mg/kg once daily or 25 mg/kg thrice weekly, ototoxicity was found in 37% of all participants (associated with older age and larger cumulative dose), vestibular toxicity in 8% (usually reversible) and nephrotoxicity in 15% (usually mild and reversible).Streptomycin, although less widely used for MAC-PD than amikacin, may have less ototoxicity than amikacin.The use of aerosolised amikacin in place of an intravenous aminoglycoside may be preferable in terms of reduced burden of care and toxicity, but outcome data are limited and it is unlikely to be helpful for patients with cavitary disease in whom drug levels at the site of infection may be subtherapeutic.

### Tobramycin inhalation solution [^96e2764e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Concurrent and/or sequential use of tobramycin inhalation solution with other drugs with neurotoxic, nephrotoxic, or ototoxic potential should be avoided (7.1).
Concomitant administration with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or intravenous mannitol is not recommended due to possible enhancement of aminoglycoside toxicity (7.2).

7.1 Drugs with Neurotoxic, Nephrotoxic or Ototoxic Potential

Concurrent and/or sequential use of tobramycin inhalation solution with other drugs with neurotoxic, nephrotoxic, or ototoxic potential should be avoided.

7.2 Diuretics

Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering aminoglycoside concentrations in serum and tissue. Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be administered concomitantly with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or intravenous mannitol. The interaction between inhaled mannitol and tobramycin inhalation solution has not been evaluated.

### Side effects of aminoglycosides on the kidney, ear and balance in cystic fibrosis [^ad9b6245]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

Aminoglycoside antibiotics are a central component of the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (CF) and slow the decline in lung function which ultimately causes the death of most patients. The prognosis of CF has improved, and thus side effects of treatments have become increasingly important. Observational studies suggest that the morbidity from side effects of aminoglycosides is disturbingly common, and that aggressive treatment may lead to more side effects. This review of the current literature on side effects of aminoglycosides considers the pathophysiological mechanisms, epidemiology and risk factors, investigation of side effects and preventative strategies. Treatments which have shown early promise are identified and areas of future research are discussed.

Aminoglycosides

streptomycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, neomycin, amikacin, kanamycin, plazomicin, paromomycin

Overview

Structure :

Aminoglycosides have a hexose ring with amino group substituents to which various amino sugars are attached via glycosidic linkages. Aminoglycosides are classified into two main structural groups including the streptidine group consisting of streptomycin and the deoxystreptamine group consisting of gentamicin, tobramycin, neomycin, amikacin, kanamycin, plazomicin, and paromomycin (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 
Chemical structure of aminoglycosides. Structural groups: a streptidine; b, c, and d deoxystreptamines

Mechanism :

Aminoglycosides are bactericidal and inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.

Indications :

Aminoglycosides are particularly useful for infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli including Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, and Haemophilus influenzae. When combined with other agents, aminoglycosides can have effects against gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci, and Enterococci. Some aminoglycosides, particularly streptomycin and amikacin, are also active against mycobacteria. In addition to oral and intravenous (IV) administration for systemic infections, many aminoglycosides come in other forms. For example, gentamicin and tobramycin are available in topical forms to treat ophthalmic, otic, and skin infections. Tobramycin and amikacin are available in inhaled forms, such as nebulized solutions and inhalation powders or suspensions to treat pulmonary infections.

Known Pharmacologic Adverse Reactions :

The primary toxicities of aminoglycosides are nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Given the need for serum drug concentration monitoring and the availability of alternative and less toxic agents, the widespread use of aminoglycosides is limited.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Allergic reactions to aminoglycosides occur infrequently but are most commonly found to cause allergic contact dermatitis. Other cutaneous reactions as well as systemic reactions including anaphylaxis have been published in case reports.

Methods

Study design

The BATTLE study was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial, conducted in 6 hospitals in the Netherlands between September 2016 and December 2019. Full details of the study design are available in the Additional file 1. Documented approval from the Independent Ethics Committees and Institutional Review Boards was obtained from all participating centers before start of the study and after the interim analysis.

Study population

Patients with proven bronchiectasis on HRCT, aged ≥ 18-year-old, chronic respiratory symptoms and at least two respiratory exacerbations treated with antibiotics and/or prednisolone in the preceding year were recruited from the outpatient clinic. All participants had one or more positive sputum cultures for gram-negative pathogens or S. aureus in the preceding year, as well as one positive sputum culture with the predefined pathogens at baseline. Patients with known CF, active allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, tuberculosis or non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were the use of maintenance antibiotics, except for maintenance treatment with macrolides if treatment was not initiated within 1 month prior to study entry. We also excluded patients treated with prednisolone > 10 mg per day for > 1 month, and/or patients treated with mucolytics. For safety reasons, patients with chronic renal insufficiency (GFR < 30 ml/min), earlier diagnosed tinnitus, hearing impairment, balance disorders or neuromuscular disorders were excluded. An overview of the complete inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Additional file 1.

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation otolaryngology care multidisciplinary consensus recommendations [^39bcf089]. International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology (2022). High credibility.

Ototoxicity risks in cystic fibrosis (CF) include systemic antibiotics with cochleotoxic/vestibulotoxic effects, with aminoglycosides associated with high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or balance issues; macrolides have known ototoxic effects, particularly when paired with an aminoglycoside or loop diuretic. Clinically, the prevalence of hearing loss in CF is considerably higher than age-matched controls and is typically worse with more lifetime courses of intravenous antibiotics, and one study showed that 53% of patients with CF treated for ≥5 years with inhaled aminoglycosides exhibited hearing abnormalities. Permanent hearing loss is associated with depression, social isolation, and cognitive decline in both children and adults and may be partially reversible with early intervention and hearing restoration; there is no widely accepted guidance for ototoxicity monitoring (cochleotoxic/vestibulotoxic) of systemic antibiotic therapies in the CF population.

### Inhaled antibiotics for long-term therapy in cystic fibrosis [^b3c3b9bd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled antibiotics are commonly used to treat persistent airway infection that contributes to lung damage in people with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Objectives

To examine the evidence that inhaled antibiotic treatment in people with CF reduces frequency of exacerbations of infection, and improves lung function, quality of life and survival. To examine adverse effects of inhaled antibiotic treatment.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified from the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register.Last search: 31 January 2011.

Selection Criteria

Trials were selected if inhaled antibiotic treatment was used for at least four weeks in people with CF, treatment allocation was randomised or quasi-randomised, and there was a control group (either placebo, no placebo or another inhaled antibiotic).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, judged the risk of bias and extracted data from these trials.

Main Results

The searches identified 176 citations to 78 trials. Nineteen trials, with 1724 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Adequate meta-analysis was not possible because of the variability of study design and reporting of results. Seventeen trials with 1562 participants compared an inhaled antibiotic with placebo or usual treatment for a duration between 1 and 32 months. Inhaled tobramycin was studied in eight trials. Lung function (measured as forced expired volume in one second) was higher and exacerbations of lung infection (by different measures) were less in the antibiotic-treated group. Resistance to antibiotics increased more in the antibiotic-treated group than in placebo group when results were reported. No auditory or renal impairment was found; analysis showed tinnitus, voice alteration, hemoptysis and cough were more frequent with tobramycin than placebo. One trial, compared tobramycin with colistin in 115 participants, after one month the mean difference in forced expiratory volume at one second was 6.33 (95% confidence interval -0.04 to 12.70) favouring tobramycin.

Authors' Conclusions

Inhaled antibiotic treatment probably improves lung function and reduces exacerbation rate, but a pooled estimate of the level of benefit is not possible. The best evidence is for inhaled tobramycin. More evidence, from trials of longer duration, is needed to determine whether this benefit is maintained and to determine the significance of development of antibiotic-resistant organisms.

### Tobramycin (Tobi) [^61cdb500]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Signs and symptoms of acute toxicity from overdosage of intravenous (IV) tobramycin might include dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, loss of high-tone hearing acuity, respiratory failure, neuromuscular blockade, and renal impairment. Administration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin. Tobramycin is not significantly absorbed following oral administration. Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage.

Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of TOBI, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken.

In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered.

Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing tobramycin from the body.

### Aminoglycoside use in cystic fibrosis: therapeutic strategies and toxicity [^54a75c01]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the recent literature regarding the uses for and toxicity of aminoglycosides in cystic fibrosis (CF).

Recent Findings

Aminoglycosides are indicated in the management of acute exacerbations of CF, to control chronic infection, and to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa after recent acquisition. Intravenous gentamicin is associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury, whereas intravenous tobramycin is less so. Studies regarding chronic kidney disease related to cumulative aminoglycoside exposure are currently conflicting, but a prevalence of up to 42% has been reported. A single daily dose of intravenous tobramycin is as effective as a thrice-daily regimen and is less nephrotoxic. A large paediatric series has recently reported a prevalence of hearing impairment of 4.5%, and a small adult cohort has found a 30% rate of vestibulotoxicity. Neither appears to be related to cumulative exposure.

Summary

In recent years, the well known toxicities of aminoglycosides have been investigated in CF populations. It appears that intravenous tobramycin is well tolerated in the kidneys compared with gentamicin, and that cumulative exposure may result in chronic kidney disease. Hearing loss and vestibulotoxicity are also prevalent. These important epidemiological studies lay the groundwork to design interventional studies to reduce toxicity.

### Prospective cohort study of ototoxicity in persons with cystic fibrosis following a single course of intravenous tobramycin [^9ecaf9ef]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics, such as tobramycin, are known to be ototoxic but important clinically due to their bactericidal efficacy. Persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at risk for AG-induced ototoxicity due to the repeated use of intravenous (IV) tobramycin for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations. While it is well-established that ototoxic hearing loss is highly prevalent in this clinical population, the progression of hearing loss over time remains unclear. Cumulative IV-AG dosing has been associated with a higher risk of ototoxic hearing loss, yet some individuals lose substantial hearing after a single IV-AG treatment, while others never seem to lose hearing.

Methods

31 persons with CF (18 on IV tobramycin, 13 controls) were enrolled in an observational study. Pure-tone hearing thresholds (0.25-16 kHz) were measured at baseline (pre-treatment) and at follow-up for each subject. A hearing shift was determined using various metrics, and outcomes were compared to characterize changes in hearing bilaterally for both study groups.

Results

Comparison of pure-tone threshold shifts between baseline and follow-up audiograms following either a course of IV tobramycin (n = 18) or no intervening therapy (n = 13) demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) threshold shifts in all continuous metrics tested.

Conclusion

A single course of IV tobramycin causes ototoxic hearing loss in some people with CF, which supports the need for routine ototoxicity monitoring and management in this clinical population. These findings also suggest that people with CF are a suitable population for clinical trials examining ototherapeutics in single IV-tobramycin treatment episodes.

### Extended-interval aminoglycoside administration for children: a meta-analysis [^3826bb1b]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

There has been a long-standing debate regarding whether aminoglycosides should be administered on a multiple daily dosing (MDD) or once-daily dosing (ODD) schedule. Several unique characteristics of the aminoglycosides make ODD an attractive and possibly superior alternative to MDD. These include concentration-dependent bactericidal activity; postantibiotic effect, which allows continued efficacy even when serum concentrations fall below expected minimum inhibitory concentrations; decreased risk of adaptive resistance; and diminished accumulation in renal tubules and inner ear.

Objective

To assess the relative efficacy and toxicity of ODD, compared with MDD, of aminoglycosides among pediatric patients.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials among children, evaluating the relative efficacy and toxicity of ODD versus MDD of aminoglycosides, with similar total daily doses in the compared arms, were selected.

Data Sources

PubMed (1966-2003) and Embase (1982-2003) databases, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry (2003), and references of eligible studies and pediatric review articles were searched.

Data Extraction

Study population characteristics and outcome data were extracted independently in duplicate, and consensus was reached on all items. The following outcome data were considered: (1) clinical or microbiologic failure, as defined in each study; (2) clinical failure; (3) microbiologic failure; (4) primary nephrotoxicity, ie, any rise in serum creatinine or decrease in creatinine clearance with thresholds as defined in each study; (5) secondary nephrotoxicity, ie, urinary excretion of proteins or phospholipids; and (6) ototoxicity based on pure tone audiometry, brainstem auditory evoked responses, or otoacoustic emissions for neonates and infants, vestibular testing, clinical impression, or any other method. All of the efficacy and toxicity outcomes were evaluated at the end of therapy.

Results

Identification of eligible studies and study characteristics: 24 eligible studies published between 1991 and 2003 were identified. Aminoglycosides were used in different clinical settings (neonatal intensive care unit: 6 studies; cystic fibrosis: 3 studies; cancer: 5 studies; urinary tract infections: 4 studies; diverse infectious indications: 5 studies; pediatric intensive care unit: 1 study). Aminoglycosides used included amikacin (9 studies), gentamicin (11 studies), tobramycin (2 studies), netilmicin (2 studies), and tobramycin or netilmicin (1 study).

Efficacy

There was no significant difference between ODD and MDD in the clinical failure rate, microbiologic failure rate, and combined clinical or microbiologic failure rates, but trends favored ODD consistently. There was no between-study heterogeneity for any outcome. Efficacy analysis of all trials indicating either clinical or microbiologic failures demonstrated pooled failure rates of 4.6% (23 of 501 cases) in the ODD arms and 6.9% (34 of 494 cases) in the MDD arms. The fixed-effects risk ratio was 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45-1.11). A statistically significant benefit was seen with ODD over MDD in trials using amikacin, whereas no statistical significance was seen in trials using other antibiotics. The pooled clinical failure rates were 6.7% (22 of 330 cases) in the ODD arms and 10.4% (34 of 327 cases) in the MDD arms. The fixed-effects risk ratio was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.42-1.07). The pooled microbiologic failure rates were 1.8% (5 of 283 cases) with ODD and 4.0% (11 of 275 cases) with MDD. The fixed-effects risk ratio was 0.51 (95% CI: 0.22-1.18). NEPHROTOXICITY: There was no significant difference between ODD and MDD in the primary nephrotoxicity outcomes. Secondary nephrotoxicity outcomes were significantly better with ODD. The pooled primary nephrotoxicity rates were 1.6% (15 of 955 cases) in the ODD arms and 1.6% (15 of 923 cases) in the MDD arms. The fixed-effects risk ratio was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.55-1.69). The pooled secondary nephrotoxicity rates were 4.4% (3 of 69 cases) in the ODD arms and 15.9% (11 of 69 cases) in the MDD arms, suggesting a statistically significant superiority of ODD. The fixed-effects risk ratio was 0.33 (95% CI: 0.12-0.89). Results were consistent across types of clinical settings and aminoglycosides. OTOTOXICITY: There was no significant difference between ODD and MDD in the primary ototoxicity outcomes. The pooled ototoxicity rates for studies that provided auditory testing results were 2.3% (10 of 436 cases) in the ODD arms and 2.0% (8 of 406 cases) in the MDD arms. The fixed-effects risk ratio was 1.06 (95% CI: 0.51-2.19). In studies that provided clinical vestibular function testing results, no toxicity was documented among 209 patients given ODD and 206 patients given MDD. Studies noting only the clinical impression of hearing impairment also failed to identify any toxicity (ODD: 114 cases; MDD: 114 cases). SUBGROUP AND BIAS ANALYSES: We detected no statistically significant differences between ODD and MDD in any of the examined subgroups (neonatal intensive care unit, cystic fibrosis, cancer, or urinary tract infection), with respect to combined clinical or microbiologic failure outcomes, primary nephrotoxicity outcomes, or ototoxicity (based on auditory testing), when sufficient data were available. Moreover, there was no significant relationship between the effect size (risk ratio) and the trial size for any of the outcomes. DATA INTERPRETATION: Clinical failures were uncommon in the pediatric trials, regardless of the regimen used. If anything, fewer clinical failures tended to occur with ODD. Moreover, we observed a trend toward decreased bacteriologic failures. One meta-analysis of adult data suggested that ODD might reduce nephrotoxicity, whereas other meta-analyses showed nonsignificant trends or no difference in nephrotoxicity outcomes. In our meta-analysis, we were not able to show any reduction in the risk of primary nephrotoxicity outcomes with ODD. However, the event rate was much lower among children, compared with adults, and the secondary nephrotoxicity outcomes favored ODD. Finally, although the 2 regimens seemed equivalent with respect to ototoxicity, reporting on ototoxicity outcomes was incomplete. Reassuringly, even in the trials that performed auditory testing, the rates of ototoxicity in the MDD arms were very low. These results were consistent with meta-analyses of adult data, which showed no difference in ototoxicity rates between ODD and MDD.

Conclusions

Although single trials have been small, the available randomized evidence supports the general adoption of ODD of aminoglycosides in pediatric clinical practice. This approach minimizes cost, simplifies administration, and provides similar or even potentially improved efficacy and safety, compared with MDD of these drugs.

### Once versus three-times daily regimens of tobramycin treatment for pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis – the TOPIC study: a randomised controlled trial [^b2951fee]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Intravenous tobramycin (three-times daily) is widely used for pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis who have chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. We undertook a double-blind, randomised controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of once versus three-times daily tobramycin in these patients.

Methods

244 patients from 21 cystic-fibrosis centres in the UK were randomly assigned to once or three-times daily tobramycin (with ceftazidime) for 14 days. Treatment was given as 30-min infusions of tobramycin in 0.9% saline. Primary outcome measure was change in forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), over the 14 days of treatment, expressed as a percentage of the predicted normal value for age, sex, and height. We also measured the change in FEV1 expressed as a percentage of baseline. Secondary outcomes included change in serum creatinine. The study was powered for equivalence, and primary analysis was per protocol.

Findings

219 patients (107 once daily, 112 three-times daily) completed the study per protocol. None was lost to follow-up, although 20 discontinued intervention. Of 122 patients assigned to once daily treatment, three did not receive the study regimen. The mean change in FEV1 (% predicted) over 14 days was similar on the two regimens (10.4% [once daily] vs 10.0% [three-times daily]; adjusted mean difference 0.4% [95% CI -3.3 to 4.1]). Mean% change in FEV1 from baseline was also similar in both treatments (21.9% vs 22.1%; -0.1% [-8.0 to 7.9]). There was no significant difference in% change in creatinine from baseline (-1.5% [once daily] vs 1.7% [three-times daily]). However, in children, once daily treatment was significantly less nephrotoxic than was thrice daily (mean% change in creatine -4.5% [once daily] vs 3.7% [thrice daily]; adjusted mean difference -8.0%, 95% CI -15.7 to -0.4). No patients developed hearing loss during the study, although two reported acute dizziness and were withdrawn from the study.

Interpretation

Intravenous tobramycin has equal efficacy if given once or three-times daily (with ceftazidime) for pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. The once daily regimen might be less nephrotoxic in children.

### Improving ototoxicity monitoring in patients receiving aminoglycosides using a novel digital approach: a quality improvement project [^4a400de5]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Lessons learnt

The aim of the quality improvement project was to improve IVAG ototoxicity monitoring in a centre with no on-site and no prior audiology services. We have managed to achieve good adherence rates to screening our respiratory cohort. From the barriers we identified, we were able to overcome these issues, such as requesting teams to refer in advance patients admitted onto the ambulatory care unit, and regular communication with peripheral teams using different channels (emails, verbal) helped maintain referrals and knowledge of estimated discharge dates. Discussing the latter with patients should also be considered to improve adherence. However, reduced staffing was the consistent issue in maintaining high adherence. Recognising the high OMP personnel requirement, future research is required to risk stratify and identify patients at highest risk (age, higher BMI, higher HHIA scores, previous IVAG use, pre-existing hearing loss) and target OMP implementation alongside potential use of remote monitoring strategies given the increased use of ambulatory antibiotic administration.

Limitations

The information captured was from a single centre within a respiratory cohort, so was unable to reflect the full extent of ototoxicity from IVAGs that would be representative of a wider population. The significance of gentamicin ototoxicity over other IVAGs should be interpreted with caution as there were only small numbers of gentamicin courses compared with tobramycin and amikacin. A longer collection period may have captured more gentamicin courses and further studies including more gentamicin courses should be included to verify this finding. We did not review the patient’s previous IVAG use which is a known risk factor, nor concomitant vancomycin which can cause ototoxicity and should be considered in future studies. We detected ototoxicity with IVAG but are unable to determine whether this is permanent hearing loss. Further longitudinal monitoring is required to observe the delayed, long-term ototoxic effects of IVAGs and assess recoverability of hearing. Due to a lack of clear guidelines and inconsistent referrals, we designed a logistical pathway to suit our patient demographic which may need to be adapted for other patient cohorts. As such, there is a requirement to increase awareness of ototoxicity monitoring in healthcare professionals who treat patients in need of hearing assessment, to improve service delivery and provision of patient education.

Patient characteristics, risk factors for abnormal hearing and ototoxic shift

Patient characteristics completing baseline TBA are shown in table 1. Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), non-CF bronchiectasis, non-CF non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and symptoms of mild handicap and above (HHIA ≥18) were significantly associated with abnormal baseline hearing. CF was associated with normal hearing between frequencies 0.25 and 8 kHz.

Table 1 
Demographic data and risk factors at baseline tablet-based audiometry

Of individuals with abnormal baseline hearing between 0.25 and 8 kHz, 78% (28/36) were asymptomatic or mild/no handicap for hearing loss (HHIA ≤16), 94% (34/36) for tinnitus (THI ≤16) and 92% (33/36) for dizziness (DHI 0–30). In our baseline hearing assessments, we detected 49% (36/73) of patients with abnormal thresholds at any frequency between 0.25 and 8 kHz; this increased to 88% (64/73) when observing extended high frequencies (online supplemental material).

Seven IVAG courses were stopped following baseline audiometry: 57% (4/7) had asymptomatic (HHIA ≤16) bilateral hearing loss affecting most/all frequencies in the extended high frequencies and speech range frequencies. All patients were on dual gram-negative antibiotic cover (beta-lactam and IVAG), and for the six non-CF patients, beta-lactam monotherapy was continued. For the patient with CF, tobramycin was switched to intravenous colistin. All IVAG courses were extended-interval frequency dosing regimens (online supplemental material).

Within the study period, 17% of courses where baseline and end-of-course audiometry was performed showed evidence of ototoxic shift as per ASHA criteria (table 2). No patients had loss of response at three consecutive test frequencies where responses were previously obtained. Within univariate analysis, gentamicin use was significantly associated with ototoxicity, with age and pre-existing hearing loss between 0.25 and 8 kHz showing non-significant trends towards ototoxicity. Given the use of point-of-care screening technology, our criteria defining significant shifts and for sound-booth audiometry referrals were more conservative to prevent missed ototoxicity cases with 22% of cases fitting these criteria (online supplemental material).

2 Methods

This study included 28 patients (ages 0−6 years, 16 males and 12 females) under active follow‐up at the Royal Children's Hospital from August 2014 and October 2018 (as part of the PIANO‐CF Extension study, HREC 33188E). The RCH Pediatric Audiology Department criteria were used to identify HI in more than 85% of the cohort (n = 24) participated in the follow‐up hearing testing up to 1 year (Supporting Information).

2.1 Study Type

This was a single‐center study in which ototoxicity in children with CF receiving an IV AG were investigated. Patient characteristics are found in Table 1. When receiving an IV AG, nebulized or inhaled AGs are routinely withheld.

Table 1 
Characteristics of study cohort at baseline who consented for hearing testing.

2.2 Data Collection

Data were obtained from the patient's medical records. Thus, the analyses were based on clinical and laboratory data collected as part of the patients' regular medical care and inclusion criteria of the PIANO‐CF study (HREC 33188E). Of note, hearing tests were not routinely performed and so were performed as part of the study protocol in addition to standard care. Demographics (age6 years and gender), serum creatinine levels, CF genotype, chronic infection status, body mass index (BMI), lung function, CFRD status, transplantation status and data on lifetime exposure to intravenous AG and oral macrolide use were recorded. Exclusion criteria were IV AG in the previous 8 weeks or IV immunoglobulin in the previous 12 weeks, respectively, pre‐existing renal impairment or (reduced eGFR calculated by the Schwartz equation) or a pre‐existing kidney condition (including, but not limited to, nephrotic syndrome, vesicoureteric reflux, urolithiasis and pyelonephritis) and diabetes mellitus.

### Intravenous versus oral antibiotics for eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (TORPEDO-CF): a randomised controlled trial [^ec1ab4b9]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Intravenous treatment often entails hospital admission, requires intravenous access (which might be traumatic),and carries the risk of side-effects, including nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity with aminoglycosides such as tobramycin.Because there were no important clinical benefits to the use of intravenous over oral therapy, the large difference in cost suggests that oral therapy should usually be recommended for eradication of early infection with P aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis. If the findings of this trial are implemented in routine clinical practice, most patients will receive oral eradication treatment as an outpatient and many hospital admissions will be avoided, which in turn will reduce both treatment burden and health-care costs.

### Tobramycin safety and efficacy review article [^e7419d54]. Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common respiratory pathogen found in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), contributing to increased hospitalization, more rapid progression of CF lung disease, and increased risk of death. Guidelines recommend early therapy using tobramycin inhaled solution (TIS) or inhaled powder (TIP). Both TIS and TIP treatment regimens have demonstrated positive clinical outcomes in efficacy and safety, including improvements in FEV 1 , decreased sputum P. aeruginosa density, decreased rates in antipseudomonal antibiotic use, and reduced rates of hospitalizations due to respiratory events. In a comparison of patient preference for TIS versus TIP, a patient survey cited time savings and convenience as preferences for TIP. However, both TIP and TIS offer advantages that may benefit patients and increase treatment adherence depending on patient circumstances. TIS may be suitable for younger patients at home where parents and caregivers may better control proper administration, older individuals, and those with low FEV 1 . Dry powder inhalers are suitable when patients have less time to commit to their self-care (eg, patients who work, are remotely located, return home late, or are on vacation), and can reduce the patient treatment burden compared with nebulized delivery. In this expert review, we summarize the available data on tobramycin regarding its molecular characteristics, mechanism of action, and efficacy and safety for the treatment of acute and chronic P. aeruginosa infection.

Renal toxicity in cystic fibrosis

Acute kidney injury

Studies vary in their definition of toxicity, but approximately 5–10% of (non-CF) adult patients receiving an aminoglycoside have a significant increase in serum creatinine.Although toxicity is an aminoglycoside class effect, experimental data suggest that gentamicin is more toxic than tobramycin and amikacin.A quantitative overview of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reached broadly the same conclusions.

The tenacity of infection and altered pharmacokinetics in CF necessitate long courses of high-dose antibiotics.Since the introduction of regular 3-monthly intravenous antibiotic therapy for patients with chronic P aeruginosa in Danish CF clinics in the mid-1970s,the management of pulmonary infection in CF has become more aggressive. However, case reports of acute kidney injury (AKI; previously termed acute renal failure) associated with aminoglycoside antibiotics in CF were not published until the late 1990s.

The first report of AKI secondary to intravenous aminoglycosides in CFwas followed by several other cases and mini-series. Inhaled tobramycin has also been implicated.Bertenshaw et al conducted a national survey of AKI in patients with CF (AKI was pragmatically defined as an increased serum creatinine for age) and found that the incidence was 4.6–10.5/10 000 CF patients/year. A subsequent case–control studyestablished that an aminoglycoside in the previous week increased the risk of AKI >80-fold. Risk factors for renal impairment (including CF-related diabetes, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acute dehydration) were strongly associated with AKI (OR 24.0). Exposure to gentamicin in the previous year was associated with AKI while exposure to tobramycin was not.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Tobramycin inhalation solution was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks.

Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase 3 studies.

Table 1: Percent of Patients With Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in >5% of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Patients

1Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration.

Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated withtobramycin inhalation solution:

Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus

Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia

Infections and Infestations: Laryngitis

Voice Alteration and Tinnitus

Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients. Thirty-three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods.

Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups.

Changes in Serum Creatinine

Nine (3%) patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit.

### Investigating the potential hearing impairment and ototoxicity in children up to six years with cystic fibrosis after aminoglycoside exposure (PIANO-CF extension) [^59807429]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

The factors that determine an individual's susceptibility to AG‐induced ototoxicity include: individual tolerance, genetic predisposition (e.g. MT‐RNR1 mutation), familial susceptibility, age extremes, daily dosage, duration and route of drug administration and possibly dosing strategy, long term exposure (i.e. cumulative dose) to ototoxic agents, impaired renal function and concomitant exposure to other ototoxic agents.

The literature to date shows the significance of AG toxicities including ototoxicity in people with CF. We considered the relationship between HI and IV AG exposure using lifetime IV AG exposure (measured in mg, mg/kg and number of days), lifetime IV gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin exposure (in days) and lifetime IV AG courses (total number).

### Management of drug toxicity in Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease: an expert panel survey [^951cd231]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Lowering azithromycin doses may increase the risk of treatment failure in patients with severe or fibrocavitary disease in whom regular doses may already be subtherapeutic. A switch to clarithromycin can be successful, but it is unproven whether this is due to clarithromycin causing less bloating and diarrhea or being less ototoxic or due to lower macrolide exposure because of shorter half-life and greater reduction in serum clarithromycin (68%) than azithromycin (23%) concentrations caused by rifampicin-induced cytochrome P450 metabolism.

Ototoxicity with hearing loss is a notorious AE of parenteral aminoglycoside therapy and was observed in 42% (10/24) of patients treated with streptomycin and 27% (3/11) of patients treated with amikacin for macrolide-resistant MAC-PD. Our panel preferred to lower the amikacin dosing frequency to thrice weekly or stop amikacin, as ototoxicity risk is associated with total aminoglycoside exposure. Switching to an alternative drug was not a common strategy, likely because no alternative drugs with proven efficacy in severe MAC-PD exist. Because aminoglycoside antimicrobial activity is exposure dependent, lower dosing is likely to negatively impact microbiologic outcomes. Switching to amikacin liposome inhalation suspension (ALIS) or inhalation of conventional amikacin could be a rational strategy; in the CONVERT trial, only 10 of 223 (4.5%) patients receiving ALIS reported hearing loss vs 7 of 112 (6.3%) in the control arm. However, the safety of switching to inhaled formulations of amikacin has not been investigated in the setting of proven amikacin ototoxicity.

The panel was also asked to rank 5 antimicrobials (amikacin, clofazimine, moxifloxacin, linezolid, and bedaquiline) as their preferred replacements for ethambutol and rifamycins; clofazimine and amikacin (or streptomycin) were preferred replacements for both the rifamycins and ethambutol. This selection is in part driven by local availability and patient preferences, particularly for clofazimine, but also reflects in vitro activity and in vivo treatment outcomes ; the high ranking of the parenteral and toxic amikacin and streptomycin emphasizes the limited options available. The outcome of MAC-PD treatment with regimens in which amikacin replaces rifampicin or ethambutol or in which clofazimine replaces ethambutol has not been addressed in clinical studies.

### Effects of CFTR modulators on pharmacokinetics of tobramycin during acute pulmonary exacerbations in the pediatric cystic fibrosis population [^3243ae42]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) require higher dosages of aminoglycosides due to an increased volume of distribution (V d ) and clearance. Optimal dosing of aminoglycosides in the CF population is essential as repeated exposure to aminoglycosides during acute pulmonary exacerbations increases risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. To date, no studies have evaluated whether chronic cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy affects pharmacokinetics of aminoglycoside antibiotics in patients with CF. The objective of this study was to determine if the addition of a CFTR modulator affects elimination rate (K e ) for intravenously administered tobramycin in the pediatric CF population.

Methods

This retrospective study included patients aged 2 to 18 years with CF receiving chronic therapy with a CFTR modulator. Patients included had an admission both pre- and post-chronic CFTR modulator therapy during which they received therapy with IV tobramycin.

Results

Thirty-four patients were included in the study. The median time between pre- and post-modulator admissions was 16.5 (13.8) months. Duration of CFTR modulator therapy before post-modulator admission was a median of 8 (10.3) months. There was no significant difference in K e (hr -1 ) between pre- and post-modulator therapy, 0.41 (0.21) pre and 0.39 (0.09) post (P=.5). V d and peak concentration were similar between both groups. There was no difference in nephrotoxicity as defined by the pRIFLE criteria (P=.25).

Conclusions

The pharmacokinetic parameters of intravenously administered tobramycin during admission for acute pulmonary exacerbation do not appear to change significantly after initiating chronic therapy with a CFTR modulator. Empiric dose adjustments for patients on CFTR modulators are not recommended.

While intermittent and daily dosing regimens appear equally effective in several case series of individuals without CF, intermittent regimens may be associated with less toxicity, better tolerability and adherence, and lower cost.However, a large multicentre study utilising an intermittent dosing regimen in individuals with moderate or severe MAC-PD (including many with cavitary disease and with prior treatment failure), reported a culture conversion rate of only 13% after 12 months of treatment.There have, to date, been no studies in individuals with CF to determine an optimal dosing regimen for MAC therapy, but concerns about drug absorption and lung penetration in CF have meant that many centres have adopted daily dosing protocols.

It is unclear if use of an aminoglycoside during the initial phase of MAC antibiotic therapy is beneficial. In a multicentre study involving 146 HIV-negative patients with MAC-PD, participants were randomised to receive intramuscular streptomycin (15 mg/kg) or placebo thrice weekly for the first 3 months of therapy, in addition to clarithromycin, rifampin and ethambutol. Streptomycin-treated patients had a significantly higher culture conversion rate after approximately 2 years of treatment than did placebo patients (71% vs 51%, p<0.05), but a third of patients in each group experienced sputum relapse and there were no significant differences in symptoms or radiological response between groups.Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in culture conversion rates between individuals who received an initial course of intramuscular kanamycin (78%) compared to those who did not (58%) in a non-randomised study involving patients with MAC-PD.Recently, the use of aerosolised amikacin in addition to standard multidrug macrolide-based regimens was reported in six HIV-negative individuals with MAC-PD who had failed standard therapy.While four patients were culture negative after 6 months of therapy, one later cultured M. chelonae (resistant to amikacin), two re-cultured MAC and one patient was unable to tolerate prolonged therapy with aerosolised amikacin. A recent case series of the impact of nebulised amikacin (250 mg once or twice daily)in 20 individuals without CF with treatment refractory NTM-PD (of whom 5 had MAC) reported adverse events in 35% of cases. Two patients discontinued therapy due to hearing loss. Studies examining the use of liposomal amikacin (which may have a better side effects profile) for the treatment of NTM in individuals with CF are ongoing.

### Side effects of aminoglycosides on the kidney, ear and balance in cystic fibrosis [^4e47fffb]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

Strategies to reduce nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides

Many groups are currently investigating strategies to reduce the nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides. Potential approaches include blocking tubular uptake, reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting cellular signalling leading to apoptosis, and enhancing the ability of the kidney to regenerate. These were outlined 10 years ago but have not yet been translated into clinical practice.

Strategies to reduce nephrotoxicity already exist. Attention to the dose prescribed and monitoring serum levels are paramount in this. Patients with CF who develop AKI are more likely to have received gentamicin in the preceding year than tobramycin when compared with controls,so tobramycin is the preferred aminoglycoside in CF. Avoidance of risk factors such as concurrent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and dehydration would seem prudent.

Manipulation of the dosing regimen provides a cost-effective and simple method of reducing kidney injury. Given the saturable uptake of aminoglycosides, it follows that a single daily dose would be expected to be less nephrotoxic than the same daily dose in three divided doses (see figure 2). The TOPIC study, a large randomised trial of tobramycin for patients with CF, established that there is equal efficacy with a single daily dosing regimen as with a multiple daily dosing regimen,a finding confirmed in a subsequent meta-analysis.In the paediatric group receiving a single daily dose, the serum creatinine level decreased during the course of treatment compared with a rise in the group receiving three divided doses. In further support of renal safety, in the once daily arm the rise in NAG was 33% less than in the group receiving a three times daily regimen in both adults and children.

### Intratympanic gentamicin for Ménière's disease [^81240119]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

It is noteworthy that ‐ in this situation ‐ evidence regarding the risks of an intervention may come from different types of studies to those which consider efficacy. Clearly, placebo interventions are required to appropriately consider the efficacy of an intervention such as intratympanic gentamicin. However, when the procedure itself (intratympanic injection) is associated with specific risks, it is also relevant to compare the intervention to no treatment ‐ in order to appropriately gather information on the absolute risk of harms.

We are aware of a number of studies that compare intratympanic gentamicin to intratympanic corticosteroids ‐ these are not included in this review. The symptoms of Ménière's disease often fluctuate over time ‐ and may improve or worsen regardless of any treatment. Therefore, to establish whether intratympanic aminoglycosides are genuinely effective, we considered that they should be compared directly with no treatment or placebo.

Inhaled antibiotic therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to gram-negative bacilli—For patients with VAP due to gram-negative bacilli that are susceptible only to aminoglycosides or polymyxins (colistin or polymyxin B), we suggest both inhaled and systemic antibiotics, rather than systemic antibiotics alone (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Values and preferences place a high value on achieving clinical cure and survival and a lower value on burden and cost, and remarks state it is reasonable to consider adjunctive inhaled antibiotic therapy as a treatment of last resort for patients not responding to intravenous antibiotics alone, whether the infecting organism is or is not MDR. Supporting evidence identified 9 studies (five randomized trials and 4 observational) using tobramycin, gentamicin, or colistin as adjunctive inhaled antibiotics, and meta-analyses found improved clinical cure (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.13–1.47) without definitive effects on mortality (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, .63–1.12) or nephrotoxicity (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, .78–1.57).

### Newborn hearing screening: tobramycin and vancomycin are not risk factors for hearing loss [^bb45db05]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the chance of detecting hearing loss with neonatal hearing screening in relation to exposure to tobramycin and vancomycin.

Study Design

Automated auditory brainstem response (A-ABR) hearing screening was performed in all neonates with at least one risk factor. Data on drug administration were abstracted from patient files. Exposure to these drugs was related to the result of hearing screening. In patients failing hearing screening, exposure to ototoxic medication was assessed in the light of other risk factors for hearing loss.

Results

Six hundred twenty-five patients were analyzed; 45 neonates failed hearing screening. Tobramycin, vancomycin, and furosemide were used in 508, 130, and 174 patients, respectively. Exposure to vancomycin, tobramycin, or furosemide or a combination, defined in terms of treatment duration, total dose, or serum concentrations of antibiotics, was not related to failure to pass A-ABR screening. Ototoxic medication was not the most probable risk factor in any of the patients with serum concentrations outside the therapeutic range.

Conclusions

Routine therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin and tobramycin in neonates for ototoxicity reasons is not helpful in detecting patients at risk for clinically important hearing loss in the 2- to 4-kHz range. A longer period of audiometric follow-up is needed to determine any long-term effects.

### Side effects of aminoglycosides on the kidney, ear and balance in cystic fibrosis [^1827c557]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population with approximately 7000 affected individuals in the UK.A mutation in the CF gene leads to a defective or absent CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) which, in most patients, ultimately leads to bronchiectasis and chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Intravenous aminoglycosides are used for exacerbations owing to their efficacy against P aeruginosa. Patients often require several courses of intravenous antibiotics per year. The survival of patients with CF has improved, and side effects of treatment have become increasingly important.

We review the current literature on the side effects of aminoglycosides commonly used to treat pulmonary exacerbations of CF. The major side effects of aminoglycosides are kidney injury, hearing impairment and vestibular toxicity.

### Gentamicin [^78bcd541]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored when feasible to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels.  When monitoring gentamicin peak concentrations, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided.

When monitoring gentamicin trough concentrations, dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg/mL are avoided.  Excessive peak and/or trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides may increase the risk of renal and eighth cranial nerve toxicity.  In the event of overdose or toxic reactions, hemodialysis may aid in the removal of gentamicin from the blood, especially if renal function is, or becomes, compromised.  The rate of removal of gentamicin is considerably less by peritoneal dialysis than by hemodialysis.

In the newborn infant, exchange transfusions may also be considered.

Concurrent and/or sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs, such as cisplatin, cephaloridine, kanamycin, amikacin, neomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tobramycin, vancomycin, and viomycin, should be avoided.  Other factors which may increase patient risk of toxicity are advanced age and dehydration.

The concurrent use of gentamicin with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid or furosemide, should be avoided, since certain diuretics by themselves may cause ototoxicity.  In addition, when administered intravenously, diuretics may enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering the antibiotic concentration in serum and tissue.

Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see WARNINGS section).

### Topical antibiotics: strategies for avoiding ototoxicity [^a3da04d7]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

As we continue to learn more about ototoxicity from ototopical drugs, there are several key points we must keep in mind: Aminoglycoside antibiotics used in ototopical agents do have ototoxic potential. Reported cases of ototoxicity are relatively uncommon, but the potential for serious complications does exist. Subclinical unilateral vestibular deficits do go unrecognized. Superior alternatives to aminoglycoside drops, particularly the quinolone drops, are readily available. The quinolones are superior to the aminoglycosides in terms of safety, bacterial eradication, and clinical cure and are therefore the drops of choice for treating otorrhea in an open infected ear.

### Improving ototoxicity monitoring in patients receiving aminoglycosides using a novel digital approach: a quality improvement project [^737187fb]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Aminoglycoside antibiotics cause ototoxicity for which baseline audiometric testing is recommended but often not done. Barriers to successful implementation include limited availability of sound-booths and audiologists. An ototoxicity monitoring programme (OMP) was implemented using tablet-based audiometry (TBA) by non-audiologists.

A quality improvement project conducted over 1 year (19 April 2021 to 18 April 2022), using Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles, monitored the adherence to the OMP using Shoebox Standard Edition application on iPads. Barriers to adoption were identified to determine potential solutions for improved adherence. Adult respiratory patients (cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis, non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) infection) aged 17–82 years receiving >1 day of intravenous aminoglycosides (IVAGs) at a single tertiary-referral hospital were included. Other reported outcomes were patient characteristics, risk factors associated with abnormal hearing and ototoxic shift.

73 patients were tested in the OMP (46 received ≥2 hearing tests) giving an overall adherence rate of 69% after 12 months. Patient identification using referral and reporting systems initially improved adherence from 36% to 88% (p=0.03) during PDSA 1. Barriers to successful adherence were staff availability and COVID-19 infection outbreaks (p=0.057). Older age (p<0.001), higher Body Mass Index (p=0.041), non-CF bronchiectasis (p=0.01), non-CF NTM (p=0.028) and higher Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults scores (p=0.002) were significantly associated with abnormal baseline hearing. 78% with hearing loss were asymptomatic. Ototoxic shift was associated with gentamicin use compared to amikacin/tobramycin (p=0.027). TBA was associated with high usability in patients ≤50 years old.

TBA by non-audiologists was feasible and demonstrated good patient usability, permitting screening of patients within 72 hours of starting IVAG and earlier referrals for formal audiometry. Hearing loss and ototoxicity were detected at earlier stages, enabling more rapid decision-making and treatment modification.

### Renal and vestibular toxicity due to inhaled tobramycin in a lung transplant recipient [^2e9d562f]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic rejection is the major hurdle to long-term survival after lung transplantation. Endobronchial infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is common in patients with chronic rejection and this may further contribute to deterioration of the allograft. Inhaled tobramycin is commonly used to treat P aeruginosa airways infection in patients with cystic fibrosis. The safety of inhaled tobramycin in transplant recipients, however, has not been established. We describe the first report of a lung transplant recipient who developed renal failure and vestibular injury after receiving inhaled tobramycin. We review the literature regarding the safety of inhaled tobramycin and discuss potential mechanisms that may promote systemic toxicity in transplant recipients.

### Newborn hearing screening programme in Belgium: a consensus recommendation on risk factors [^52797cf8]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Medical care: NICU stay and use of ventilation or ototoxic drugs

The JCIH Position Statement (2007) considers a NICU stay exceeding 5 days to be risk factor associated with permanent congenital, delayed, or progressive hearing loss. The association between NICU stay (i.e. admission or length of stay) and hearing loss is controversial [,–]. Indeed, this indicator encompasses multiple conditions and treatments and thus may not reflect the complex and variable health situation of neonates hospitalised in the NICU. Moreover, this indicator is insufficiently considered by multivariable statistical models.

Newborns admitted to the NICU can receive ventilation support with endotracheal ventilation or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The prevalence of hearing loss does not differ significantly between mechanical ventilation and CPAP. Multivariable analyses performed exclusively on preterm neonates indicate that assisted ventilation lasting >5 days is an independent risk factor for hearing loss and a risk of failed hearing screening tests. However, a study of newborns admitted to the NICU reported no significant association between hearing loss and endotracheal assisted ventilation or CPAP after adjusting for infants’ characteristics and specialised medical procedures. Univariate analyses of different studies of newborns admitted to the NICU showed no significant association between hearing loss and assisted ventilation regardless of whether treatment duration was mentioned. Therefore, current evidence indicates that assisted ventilation is not obviously a neonatal risk factor for hearing loss.

Ototoxic drugs, specifically aminoglycosides and loop diuretics, can be administered to newborns. However, the association between aminoglycoside administration and hearing loss is inconsistent among studies; most studies reported no significant association with treatment duration, total dose, or peak or trough serum concentrations, whereas others reported ototoxicity of aminoglycosides [,,,–], particularly on high-frequency hearing. In some individuals, genetic predisposition (i.e. a specific mutation of mitochondrial DNA) is associated with aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss, making them particularly vulnerable to aminoglycoside toxicity. The association between loop diuretics administered to neonates and hearing loss is also inconsistent. However, their (over) use in combination with other treatments (e.g. aminoglycosides) appears to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss. The transient characteristic of loop diuretic-associated hearing loss has also been discussed. In those studies, the administration of ototoxic drugs was supposed to be clinically appropriate; inappropriate or uncontrolled drug administration may have shown a different association with hearing loss.

Problem

Our previous research highlighted a prevalence of hearing loss ~50% in our adults with CF at our CF centre.This is higher than the UK national average (one in every six people, that is, 11 million in 2015) and greater than the predicted increase to one in every five people (15.6 million) by 2035.The Royal Brompton Hospital treats one of the largest CF populations in Europe (>900 adult and paediatric patients) as well as patients with bronchiectasis, non-tuberculosis mycobacterial and primary ciliary dyskinesia who receive regular intravenous antibiotics courses (including IVAGs). Previously, our group validated TBA in adult CF outpatients, showing high correlation to sound-booth audiometry indicating its potential as a useful OMP screening tool for early hearing loss detection.With a large respiratory cohort receiving IVAG and a high prevalence of hearing loss, with no on-site audiology services, TBA was introduced as standard-of-care to detect for hearing loss in our adult respiratory patients when prior to this there were no regular audiology assessments carried out. In this quality improvement project to introduce a new OMP using TBA, our primary aim was to assess adherence to the OMP delivered by non-audiologists in adult respiratory patients receiving IVAGs. Adoption barriers and solutions were identified to improve compliance. As a secondary aim, we also report patient characteristics, risk factors associated with abnormal hearing and ototoxic shift in this population and patient usability of TBA.

### Biomarker-guided individualization of antibiotic therapy [^36567e42]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

TOXICITY BIOMARKERS

Antibiotic‐induced toxicities are a major challenge for multiple classes of antibiotics, several of which have narrow therapeutic windows. Explicitly considering toxicity guided by toxicity biomarkers could lead to safer treatments reducing morbidity and mortality. To date, TDM is still the most important clinical strategy to prevent occurrence of drug‐induced toxicities, but these approaches rely on static antibiotic exposure/concentration cutoffs. Such PK‐driven strategies may not be sufficient to predict the individual development of antibiotic‐induced toxicities, stressing the need for toxicodynamic (or PD) biomarkers to quantify and predict antibiotic‐induced toxicity.

Antibiotic‐induced toxicities can be either categorized as acute dose‐limiting toxicities or long‐term toxicological effects. Acute dose‐limiting toxicities can impact antibiotic treatment efficacy, thus potentially threaten efficient eradication of pathogens, and subsequently lead to increased risk of emergence of resistance. Examples of such toxicities include acute kidney injury caused by polymyxins, erythromycin‐induced hepatotoxicity, and β‐lactam‐induced mitochondrial toxicity.Acute toxicity is often reversible or alleviated by the termination of antibiotic treatment. Long‐term toxicity can have lasting and potentially permanent impact on patients, such as aminoglycoside‐associated ototoxicity. A summary of relevant examples of antibiotic‐related toxicities can be found in Table 3.

Table 3 
Overview of antibiotic related toxicities and potential toxicity biomarkers

Direct quantification of toxicity, such as drug‐induced tissue damage quantified by histology, is generally unfeasible in patients. For that reason, biomarkers relating to such toxicity can be of great clinical value to assess toxicity levels. The current clinical practice uses standard biomarkers, such as serum creatinine and liver enzymes, to monitor kidney and liver function, respectively. These markers are general indicators of organ function and do not specifically/exclusively reflect antibiotic toxicity. Although many potential toxicity biomarkers have been identified, they have yet to make it into clinical practice.

Biomarkers for toxicity can provide insight on current state of toxicity but also identify patients at high risk of developing toxicity. Identifying patients at high risk of toxicity related to specific antibiotics can aid in selection of appropriate drug therapy on an individual level, which may result in minimized risk of toxicity. The development of toxicity during a treatment can be assessed by measuring biomarkers relating to early toxicity signs, allowing for timely adjustment of treatment to prevent severe toxicities. Biomarkers can also play a role in confirming the occurrence, as well as quantifying the extent of toxicity. Quantitative knowledge about the state of toxicity can inform on appropriate treatment measures. The combination of such biomarkers into multiplex panels have been suggested to provide an even better estimation of the state of toxicity.

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin) [^fba04c2d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored when feasible to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels.  When monitoring gentamicin peak concentrations, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided.  When monitoring gentamicin trough concentrations, dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg/mL are avoided.  Excessive peak and/or trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides may increase the risk of renal and eighth cranial nerve toxicity.

In the event of overdosage or toxic reactions, hemodialysis may aid in the removal of gentamicin from the blood, especially if renal function is, or becomes, compromised.  The rate of removal of gentamicin is considerably lower by peritoneal dialysis than it is by hemodialysis.

In the newborn infant, exchange transfusions may also be considered.

Concurrent and/or sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs, such as cisplatin, cephaloridine, kanamycin, amikacin, neomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tobramycin, vancomycin and viomycin, should be avoided.  Other factors which may increase patient risk of toxicity are advanced age and dehydration.

The concurrent use of gentamicin with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid or furosemide, should be avoided, since certain diuretics by themselves may cause ototoxicity.  In addition, when administered intravenously, diuretics may enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering the antibiotic concentration in serum and tissue.

Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see WARNINGS section).

### Improving ototoxicity monitoring in patients receiving aminoglycosides using a novel digital approach: a quality improvement project [^acb97946]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Background

Aminoglycoside antibiotics remain the cornerstone of treatment in patients with chronic respiratory infections such as those with cystic fibrosis (CF), non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) and non-CF bronchiectasis.Ototoxicity is a known side effect of intravenous aminoglycosides (IVAGs) potentially causing irreversible hearing loss even after a single course.All IVAGs can cause hearing loss (cochleotoxicity), tinnitus and balance issues (vestibulotoxicity) but gentamicin and tobramycin are more vestibulotoxic while amikacin is more cochleotoxic.Extended high frequencies (>8 kHz) are initially affected before progression to speech range frequencies (≤8 kHz).The global prevalence of hearing loss associated with exposure to short courses of aminoglycosides (<16 days) is 16.6%.The socio-economic implications (educational costs, loss of productivity, quality of life) of hearing loss are estimated to exceed $981 billion globally.

American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) guidelines recommend that patients receiving AGs should have audiometric monitoring: at baseline (within 72 hours of starting), repeated weekly, at the end of treatment, and at 3 and 6 months post-treatment to detect for prolonged ototoxic effects.Ototoxicity monitoring programmes (OMPs) aim to detect ototoxicity earlier to modify treatment and plan appropriate aural rehabilitation.Despite these recommendations, there is great variability in implementation: for example, 72% of UK hearing services lacked ototoxicity management protocols and 45% of US adult CF units used audiometric monitoring.Barriers to implementing a successful OMP include but are not restricted to inconsistent referrals, limited resources including availability of sound-booths and audiologists as well as institutional policy and investment.In particular, not all healthcare institutions have on-site audiology services, which limits access.

Recent CF consensus documents recommend documenting hearing, tinnitus and vestibular issues during history taking, and using point-of-care assessments (tablet-based audiometry (TBA)). These should include extended high-frequency monitoring at baseline and end-of-treatment.Garinis et al proposed that audiology could be performed by audiologists or trained CF care team members to overcome challenges of OMP implementation for early ototoxicity detection.Recently, a pilot study demonstrated improved accessibility to audiology screening using TBA by pharmacists in 14 paediatric patients with CF.

### Aerosolized antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia: a pairwise and Bayesian network meta-analysis [^66104596]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

VAP remains an important infectious complication of mechanical ventilation and is commonly due to MDR pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp.). Because of MDR pathogens, the capability of commonly used intravenous antibiotics to cross the lung parenchyma is significantly inhibited. Inadequate concentrations of intravenous antibiotics may result in failure to reach inhibitory concentrations. Aerosolized antibiotics may be a useful treatment since aerosolization directly targets the airways and localizes the drug to the pulmonary parenchyma, thus bypassing the poor lung penetration of many antibiotics. Aerosolized antibiotics therefore make it possible to achieve high local antibiotic concentrations relative to an organism’s minimum inhibitory concentration while concurrently minimizing systemic toxicities by concentrating antibiotics in the lungs rather than spreading them throughout the body.

The appropriate aerosolized antibiotic remains a matter of controversy, and the most studied are colistin and aminoglycosides. The selection of the aerosolized antibiotic should encompass several properties and characteristics to achieve maximum effectiveness including: 1) activity against the causative pathogen; 2) physical properties to ensure maximal pulmonary delivery and minimal extrapulmonary loss; and 3) the achievement of adequate concentrations in the lung well above the pathogen’s minimum inhibitory concentration, taking into account the need for the prevention of resistance and the presence of biofilm.

In the presence of severe experimental lung infection, aminoglycoside plasma concentrations were found in the same range after nebulization and intravenous administration. Furthermore, inhaled aminoglycosides prevent growth of bacterial biofilms. Inhaled tobramycin has a wide range of activity against Gram-negative organisms, including P. aeruginosa. Tobramycin is also preferable for inhaled use because of moderately lipophilic and positively charged small molecules. Amikacin is another aminoglycoside. The low bioavailability of nebulized amikacin may result in administration of high dosesand hence potentially increase systemic toxicities. Mohr et al. reported that pharmacokinetic properties and dosing strategies were better defined for inhaled tobramycin than for inhaled amikacin. Studies in animals have shown that aerosolized colistin has a limited systemic diffusion in pneumonia. Likewise, inhaled colistin also has high mucin binding that might lead to insufficient antibiotic effectiveness to kill bacteria. As a consequence, a dosage exceeding the common dose of colistin treating VAP may enhance the rate of clinical recovery and microbiological eradication but increase the risk of toxicity. Therefore, tobramycin may have more potential effects on clinical recovery and be promising for its effects on mortality and nephrotoxicity.

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin sulfate in sodium chloride) [^21b59acd]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored when feasible to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. When monitoring gentamicin peak concentrations, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided. When monitoring gentamicin trough concentrations, dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg/mL are avoided.

Other factors which may increase patient risk of toxicity are advanced age and dehydration (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections).

The concurrent use of gentamicin with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid or furosemide, should be avoided, since certain diuretics by themselves may cause ototoxicity. In addition, when administered intravenously, diuretics may enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering the antibiotic concentration in serum and tissue (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions section).

Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy sections).
