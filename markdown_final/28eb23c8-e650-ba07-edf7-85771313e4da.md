## Question

How should chiropractors approach patients with suspected cauda equina syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how chiropractors should approach patients with suspected cauda equina syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why CES is an emergency. Then, I should verify the red flags that mandate urgent action. Next, I will review the focused history and examination elements, including bladder scanning. After that, I need to confirm the imaging strategy and when CT can substitute for MRI. Then, I should outline immediate referral and documentation requirements. Finally, I will consider special populations, medico-legal risks, and how to build a sustainable pathway in chiropractic practice, making sure each assertion is supported by evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why CES is an emergency. CES is a neurosurgical emergency caused by compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots, most often from a large central lumbar disc herniation, and delays in decompression lead to permanent bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction as well as lower limb deficits, so time-critical recognition and referral are essential to outcomes and litigation risk mitigation [^7c00d0b3] [^6974e77c] [^c10cab8b].

> I need to check the red flags that should trigger immediate escalation. The core CES red flags include saddle anesthesia, new urinary retention or incontinence, fecal incontinence, new sexual dysfunction, and severe or progressive lower extremity neurologic deficits; multiple red flags increase the probability of serious pathology, and urinary retention substantially elevates the likelihood of CES compared with patients without retention, so I should not wait for the full triad before acting [^aaa46058] [^d58a73d6] [^6974e77c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis from symptoms alone. I should confirm that clinical assessment has low sensitivity and specificity for CES, with studies showing that even experienced clinicians have only modest accuracy predicting MRI-confirmed compression, so I must maintain a low threshold for emergent imaging and surgical referral when red flags are present [^0923231e] [^16e838ef].

> Next, I should review the focused history and examination elements I must document. I need to ask about bladder function including retention, hesitancy, frequency, and incontinence; bowel function including constipation, fecal incontinence, and flatus control; sexual function including erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction; saddle or perianal sensory changes; and bilateral leg symptoms, weakness, or gait disturbance, while also noting time course and progression, because these features guide urgency and risk stratification [^6974e77c] [^6463f81a].

> I will now examine the patient with a targeted neurologic assessment. I should confirm motor strength in key myotomes, sensory testing including pinprick and light touch in the saddle region and lower limbs, deep tendon reflexes at the knees and ankles, and anal sphincter tone on digital rectal examination, and I should measure post-void residual with bladder scanning because a residual volume of 200 mL or more is a strong predictor of CES and helps risk-stratify the need for emergent MRI [^16e838ef] [^6974e77c].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging strategy. MRI of the lumbar spine is the gold standard to confirm or exclude cauda equina compression, and it should be obtained emergently when CES is suspected. If MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, CT myelography is an acceptable alternative, and in resource-limited settings an optimized CT protocol can serve as a triage tool with high sensitivity and negative predictive value for significant stenosis and impingement, though MRI remains preferred when available [^aaa46058] [^7012def1] [^75fcb66f].

> I should double-check the timing targets. Multiple quality improvement initiatives and national pathways emphasize reducing time to MRI and definitive care, with goals such as MRI within 4 hours of request or even within 4 hours of ED arrival, and ED-driven pathways that empower senior clinicians to order MRI without prior neurosurgical review have reduced time to diagnosis by roughly 30–36% in prospective cycles, underscoring the importance of streamlined logistics and clear protocols [^fbe6b08f] [^c47439ec] [^982ab59b].

> Next, I should review immediate actions and referral. If any CES red flag is present, I must stop all conservative care, avoid spinal manipulation, and arrange emergent transport to the nearest facility with emergent MRI capability and neurosurgical access, ideally notifying the receiving team in advance. I should document the time of symptom onset, the specific red flags identified, and the rationale for escalation to support timely surgical decompression and mitigate medicolegal risk [^6974e77c] [^7c00d0b3].

> I need to ensure meticulous documentation. I should record all red flags, neurologic findings, bladder scan results, and the exact time of escalation, because poor documentation is a recurrent contributor to delays and litigation in CES. Structured tools and templates improve completeness and can be adapted to chiropractic EHRs to reduce omissions and support quality assurance [^396f63a3] [^f8805e31] [^1f057c89].

> But wait, what if the patient has scan-negative CES. I should confirm that a substantial proportion of patients with suspected CES have no MRI evidence of compression, often reflecting functional neurological disorders or pain-mediated bladder dysfunction; in such cases, urgent urology or neurology follow-up is appropriate, and I should avoid unnecessary surgery while still ensuring safety-netting and close reassessment for any evolution of deficits [^0c82d032] [^dcc64ab2] [^30ecbe07].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, emergent decompression is feasible with appropriate positioning and anesthesia planning, and in older adults with multimorbidity, I should maintain a high index of suspicion because degenerative disease and medication effects can mask or mimic CES features, reinforcing the need for objective bladder assessment and early imaging when red flags arise [^ef3ec7fa] [^16e838ef].

> I should confirm the medico-legal implications to reinforce urgency. CES carries disproportionate litigation risk with high average settlements, and delays in diagnosis are frequently linked to poor documentation and failure to escalate; therefore, adhering to red flag screening, emergent imaging, and timely surgical referral is both a clinical and risk-management imperative [^c10cab8b] [^1e467511].

> Next, I should review how to build a sustainable pathway in chiropractic practice. I need to establish a written CES protocol, train all clinicians in red flag recognition and bladder scanning, integrate a CES documentation template into the EHR, and forge agreements with local EDs and neurosurgery for direct transfer and MRI access. Quality improvement cycles can track time to escalation and documentation completeness to drive continuous improvement [^f8805e31] [^c47439ec] [^0e39eacf].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not overstating any claims. The evidence base is largely retrospective and heterogeneous, but consensus guidelines and multiple QI studies converge on the same principles: screen for red flags, use bladder scanning to risk-stratify, obtain emergent MRI when indicated, and refer urgently for decompression, while documenting everything in a standardized fashion to reduce delays and improve outcomes [^4603f8e7] [^aaa46058] [^6974e77c].

---

Chiropractors must treat suspected cauda equina syndrome (CES) as a **medical emergency** [^7c00d0b3] and **stop all manipulative therapy immediately**. The priority is to **recognize red flags** — saddle anesthesia, new urinary retention or incontinence, fecal incontinence, severe or progressive lower-extremity neurologic deficits, and sexual dysfunction [^aaa46058] — and to **escalate urgently** [^6974e77c]. Do not delay for conservative care or imaging; instead, **arrange emergent MRI** [^aaa46058] and **direct referral to neurosurgery** for decompression within 24–48 hours when CES is suspected [^47655897]. Document all findings and communications, and **do not manipulate the spine**, as this may worsen compression and outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and red flags

CES presents with a constellation of symptoms; chiropractors should be vigilant for the following **red flags**:

- **Saddle anesthesia**: Loss of sensation in the perineal/saddle region [^6974e77c].
- **Bladder dysfunction**: New urinary retention, overflow incontinence, or altered stream [^aaa46058].
- **Bowel dysfunction**: Fecal incontinence or altered bowel habits [^6974e77c].
- **Sexual dysfunction**: New erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction [^3b4f1a50].
- **Motor deficits**: Severe or progressive lower-extremity weakness, gait disturbance, or foot drop [^100812ef].
- **Reflex changes**: Diminished or absent ankle reflexes [^6974e77c].

---

## Immediate actions for chiropractors

When CES is suspected, chiropractors should take the following **immediate actions**:

- **Stop manipulative therapy**: Cease all spinal manipulation immediately to prevent worsening compression [^notfound].
- **Emergency referral**: Arrange urgent transport to the nearest emergency department with neurosurgical capability [^6974e77c].
- **Document thoroughly**: Record all symptoms, signs, and communications with the patient and healthcare providers [^7c00d0b3].
- **Do not delay**: Do not wait for conservative care or routine imaging; CES is a surgical emergency [^6974e77c].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

MRI is the **gold standard** [^6974e77c] for confirming CES and identifying the cause and level of compression [^9dcc34f9]. If MRI is unavailable, CT myelography is an alternative [^aaa46058]. Limited-sequence MRI protocols can expedite diagnosis in resource-limited settings [^3382c3e7].

---

## Role of chiropractors in management

Chiropractors **do not treat CES**; their role is to recognize, stabilize, and refer urgently. Manipulative therapy is contraindicated because it may exacerbate nerve root compression and worsen outcomes [^notfound]. Post-surgical rehabilitation may involve chiropractors only after surgical decompression and under specialist guidance.

---

## Medicolegal considerations

CES carries significant medicolegal risk due to the potential for permanent neurologic injury and delayed diagnosis [^c10cab8b]. Chiropractors must:

- **Document meticulously**: Record all red flags, examination findings, and communications [^7c00d0b3].
- **Follow protocols**: Adhere to established emergency pathways and guidelines [^4603f8e7].
- **Communicate clearly**: Ensure the patient understands the urgency and rationale for emergency referral [^1e4e5699].

---

## Summary of recommended approach

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Recognize red flags (saddle anesthesia, bladder/bowel dysfunction, motor deficits) [^aaa46058] |
| 2 | Stop manipulative therapy immediately [^notfound] |
| 3 | Arrange emergent MRI and neurosurgical referral [^9dcc34f9] |
| 4 | Document all findings and communications [^7c00d0b3] |
| 5 | Provide patient education on the urgency of condition [^1e4e5699] |

---

Chiropractors must treat suspected CES as a **surgical emergency** [^6974e77c], stop manipulative therapy, and **escalate urgently** to MRI and neurosurgical care [^9dcc34f9]. Early recognition and referral are critical to preventing permanent neurologic injury and mitigating medicolegal risk [^c10cab8b].

### Evaluation and management of cauda equina syndrome [^7c00d0b3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome is a potentially devastating spinal condition. The diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome lacks sensitivity and specificity, sometimes occurring after irreparable neurological damage has happened. Timely diagnosis and treatment is imperative for optimal outcomes and for avoiding medicolegal ramifications. Cauda equina syndrome results from conditions that compress the nerves in the lumbosacral spinal canal. Although no consensus definition exists, it generally presents with varying degrees of sensory loss, motor weakness, and bowel and bladder dysfunction (the latter of which is required to definitively establish the diagnosis). A thorough history and physical exam is imperative, followed by magnetic resonance or computed tomography imaging myelogram to aid in diagnosis and treatment. Once suspected, emergent spinal surgery referral is indicated, along with urgent decompression. Even with expeditious surgery, improvements remain inconsistent. However, early intervention has been shown to portend greater chance of neurologic recovery. All providers in clinical practice must understand the severity of this condition. Providers can optimize long-term patient outcomes and minimize the risk of litigation by open communication, good clinical practice, thorough documentation, and expeditious care.

### What is the incidence of cauda equina syndrome? A systematic review [^cda1e502]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a surgical emergency requiring timely operative intervention to prevent symptom progression. Accurately establishing the incidence of CES is required to inform healthcare service design and delivery, including out-of-hours imaging arrangements.

Methods

A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus was undertaken to identify original studies stating the incidence of CES, and the estimates were combined in a meta-analysis as described in the protocol registered with PROSPERO (registration no. CRD42017065865) and reported using the PRISMA guidelines.

Results

A total of 1281 studies were identified, and 26 studies were included in the review. Data about CES incidence were available from 3 different populations: asymptomatic community populations, patients with nontraumatic low-back pain, and patients presenting as an emergency with suspected CES. The incidence of CES was 0.3–0.5 per 100,000 per year in 2 asymptomatic community populations, 0.6 per 100,000 per year in an asymptomatic adult population, and 7 per 100,000 per year in an asymptomatic working-age population. CES occurred in 0.08% of those with low-back pain presenting to primary care in 1 study, and a combined estimate of 0.27% was calculated for 4 studies of those with low-back pain presenting to secondary care. Across 18 studies of adults with suspected CES, 19% had radiological and clinical CES. Difficulties in comparison between studies resulted from the heterogeneous definitions of CES and lack of separation of more advanced CES with retention, which is unlikely to be reversible. In the studies of patients with suspected CES, the small sample size, the high number of single-center studies (18/18), the high number of studies from the United Kingdom (17/18), the retrospective nature of the studies, and the high number of abstracts rather than full texts (9/18) reduced the quality of the data.

Conclusions

From current studies, it appears that CES occurs infrequently in asymptomatic community populations and in only 19% of those presenting with symptoms. Determining accurate incidence figures and designing a bespoke service for investigation of patients with suspected CES would require a consensus clinical and radiological definition of CES and international multisite studies of patient pathways of investigation and management.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® low back pain: 2021 update [^9dcc34f9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the United States, acute low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, is the leading cause of years lived with disability and the third ranking cause of disability-adjusted life-years. Uncomplicated acute low back pain and/or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any imaging studies. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags, raising suspicion for a serious underlying condition, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria low back Pain [^ebf9c160]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most patients presenting with uncomplicated acute low back pain (LBP) and/or radiculopathy do not require imaging. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags raising suspicion for serious underlying conditions, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, and infection. Many imaging modalities are available to clinicians and radiologists for evaluating LBP. Application of these modalities depends largely on the working diagnosis, the urgency of the clinical problem, and comorbidities of the patient. When there is concern for fracture of the lumbar spine, multidetector CT is recommended. Those deemed to be interventional candidates, with LBP lasting for > 6 weeks having completed conservative management with persistent radiculopathic symptoms, may seek MRI. Patients with severe or progressive neurologic deficit on presentation and red flags should be evaluated with MRI. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Evaluation and treatment of acute low back pain [^06cd0123]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Acute low back pain with or without sciatica usually is self-limited and has no serious underlying pathology. For most patients, reassurance, pain medications, and advice to stay active are sufficient. A more thorough evaluation is required in selected patients with "red flag" findings associated with an increased risk of cauda equina syndrome, cancer, infection, or fracture. These patients also require closer follow-up and, in some cases, urgent referral to a surgeon. In patients with nonspecific mechanical low back pain, imaging can be delayed for at least four to six weeks, which usually allows the pain to improve. There is good evidence for the effectiveness of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, heat therapy, physical therapy, and advice to stay active. Spinal manipulative therapy may provide short-term benefits compared with sham therapy but not when compared with conventional treatments. Evidence for the benefit of acupuncture is conflicting, with higher-quality trials showing no benefit. Patient education should focus on the natural history of the back pain, its overall good prognosis, and recommendations for effective treatments.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^933c9fec]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome — future directions (Recommendation #1): Without sufficient high quality, reproducible evidence regarding the clinical intervention for cauda equina syndrome, a randomized trial is not possible, and current literature is limited to retrospective case series that are highly subject to bias. Prospective collection of information related to pre‑operative functional status and postoperative functional outcomes through a multicenter prospective registry will allow the collection of information that can potentially provide Level II evidence regarding the efficacy of early intervention on improving outcomes in patients with cauda equina syndrome.

### Evaluation and management of cauda equina syndrome in the emergency department [^6974e77c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) may be a devastating disease with the potential for significant patient morbidity. It is essential for emergency clinicians to be aware of how to effectively diagnose and manage this condition.

Objective

This article provides a narrative review of the diagnosis and management of CES for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Cauda equina syndrome is a rare but emergent condition associated with back pain. It can result in severe morbidity and can be due to a variety of causes, most commonly vertebral disc protrusion. Diagnosis is often delayed, which may result in a poor prognosis. Red flags and findings consistent with CES include bilateral neurogenic sciatica, reduced perineal sensation, altered bladder function leading to painless urinary retention, loss of anal tone, and loss of sexual function. In isolation, history and examination findings demonstrate poor sensitivity. Symptoms may occur either suddenly or gradually, and most patients do not present with all of these symptoms. Postvoid bladder volume assessments can assist in the evaluation, but the diagnosis typically involves magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography myelography if MRI is not available. Treatment relies upon surgical consultation and operative intervention for decompression.

Conclusion

Cauda equina syndrome can be a difficult diagnosis. However, knowledge of the history and examination findings, imaging, and treatment can assist the emergency clinician in optimizing management of this condition.

Next steps

Future iterations of the #CES tool may benefit from more explicit integration of GIRFT-defined red flags to distinguish features that require immediate escalation. For instance, incorporating visual cues, colour-coded alerts or time-sensitive prompts (eg, 'MRI within 24 hours recommended') could improve diagnostic prioritisation and reduce delays. In addition, to better demonstrate clinical benefit beyond documentation quality, subsequent PDSA cycles will aim to incorporate outcome-based metrics such as time to MRI, time from clerking to definitive management and appropriateness of neurosurgical referral. These will provide a clearer picture of how the tool impacts patient safety, diagnostic efficiency and care quality, thereby aligning the intervention with both national recommendations and measurable clinical outcomes.

### Cauda equina syndrome: is the current management of patients presenting to district general hospitals fit for purpose? A personal view based on a review of the literature and a medicolegal experience [^2599972b]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2015). Low credibility.

There is no universally agreed definition of cauda equina syndrome (CES). Clinical signs of CES including direct rectal examination (DRE) do not reliably correlate with cauda equina (CE) compression on MRI. Clinical assessment only becomes reliable if there are symptoms/signs of late, often irreversible, CES. The only reliable way of including or excluding CES is to perform MRI on all patients with suspected CES. If the diagnosis is being considered, MRI should ideally be performed locally in the District General Hospitals within one hour of the question being raised irrespective of the hour or the day. Patients with symptoms and signs of CES and MRI confirmed CE compression should be referred to the local spinal service for emergency surgery. CES can be subdivided by the degree of neurological deficit (bilateral radiculopathy, incomplete CES or CES with retention of urine) and also by time to surgical treatment (12, 24, 48 or 72 hour). There is increasing understanding that damage to the cauda equina nerve roots occurs in a continuous and progressive fashion which implies that there are no safe time or deficit thresholds. Neurological deterioration can occur rapidly and is often associated with longterm poor outcomes. It is not possible to predict which patients with a large central disc prolapse compressing the CE nerve roots are going to deteriorate neurologically nor how rapidly. Consensus guidelines from the Society of British Neurological Surgeons and British Association of Spinal Surgeons recommend decompressive surgery as soon as practically possible which for many patients will be urgent/emergency surgery at any hour of the day or night.

### 'Scan-negative' cauda equina syndrome: what to do when there is no neurosurgical cause [^0c82d032]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Suspected cauda equina syndrome is a common presentation in emergency departments, but most patients (≥ 70%) have no cauda equina compression on imaging. As neurologists become more involved with 'front door' neurology, referral rates of patients with these symptoms are increasing. A small proportion of patients without structural pathology have other neurological causes: we discuss the differential diagnosis and how to recognise these. New data on the clinical features of patients with 'scan-negative' cauda equina syndrome suggest that the symptoms are usually triggered by acute pain (with or without root impingement) causing changes in brain-bladder feedback in vulnerable individuals, exacerbated by medication and anxiety, and commonly presenting with features of functional neurological disorder.

### Common questions about chronic low back pain [^ca505542]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

More than 30% of U.S. adults report having experienced low back pain within the preceding three months. Although most low back pain is nonspecific and self-limiting, a subset of patients develop chronic low back pain, defined as persistent symptoms for longer than three months. Low back pain is categorized as nonspecific low back pain without radiculopathy, low back pain with radicular symptoms, or secondary low back pain with a spinal cause. Imaging should be reserved for patients with red flags for cauda equina syndrome, recent trauma, risk of infection, or when warranted before treatment (e.g., surgical, interventional). Prompt recognition of cauda equina syndrome is critical. Patient education should be combined with evidence-guided pharmacologic therapy. Goals of therapy include reducing the severity of pain symptoms, pain interference, and disability, as well as maximizing activity. Validated tools such as the Oswestry Disability Index can help assess symptom severity and functional change in patients with chronic low back pain. Epidural steroid injections do not improve pain or disability in patients with spinal stenosis. Spinal manipulation therapy produces small benefits for up to six months. Because long-term data are lacking for spinal surgery, patient education about realistic outcome expectations is essential.

### Expediting the management of cauda equina syndrome in the emergency department through clinical pathway design [^ae6d2284]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Subjectively, waiting for MRI was a source of great frustration and anxiety for patients. We hoped that this pathway would alleviate this problem and shorten the patient journey. Patient questionnaires used at baseline and with each PDSA cycle could have been used to assess whether a reduction in the waiting time for MRI led to greater patient satisfaction in the care they received.

Finally, the number of patient cases was low with 30 patients at baseline and 17 with each subsequent PDSA cycle. Although our results reached statistical significance, a greater number of patients would provide more robust evidence on the effectiveness of our clinical pathway. To recruit more patients, the duration of each PDSA cycle would have had to be extended, as CES remains a rare diagnosis in patients presenting with lower back pain.

### Delays in the treatment of cauda equina syndrome due to its variable clinical features in patients presenting to the emergency department [^4c6b3d5f]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify reasons for delay in management of patients with cauda equina syndrome (CES) and to determine commonly presented features of CES.

Methods

Retrospectively, the presenting features and management of patients treated for CES over a 4-year period were reviewed.

Results

Reasons for delay in treatment were identified in over half of the patients.

Discussion

Most patients do not present with all the characteristic features of CES. Sacral sensory loss is a sensitive and relatively specific sign for diagnosing CES.

### Improving the detection and documentation of suspected cauda equina syndrome: a quality improvement project [^396f63a3]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) can cause irreversible neurological and functional impairment if not diagnosed and treated swiftly, deeming it a medical emergency. This can lead to debilitating consequences, including permanent loss of bladder and bowel control, sexual dysfunction and motor weakness. Timely diagnosis and surgical intervention are crucial to improve patient outcomes and prevent permanent disability.

The 2019 GIRFT Spine Report and the 2023 GIRFT National Suspected CES Pathway established the UK standard for CES management. They emphasise timely recognition of red flags and standardised clinical evaluation to minimise diagnostic delays. Prior to this project, no standardised proforma for CES documentation existed in our Trust. Neurological findings were entered as unstructured free text, often omitting key indicators.

Complete and accurate documentation of neurological examination performed on patients presenting with suspected CES (usually suspected in patients presenting with symptoms such as incontinence, back pain or saddle anaesthesia) is essential for timely detection and consequent management. Nevertheless, poor documentation is a recurring problem, particularly in environments where clinicians face a high patient and workload with limited time pressures, leading to incomplete records. In such cases of potential CES, inadequate documentation can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, which increases the risk of permanent neurological impairment.

Previous efforts addressing issues with CES-related documentation included checklists and educational sessions to increase clinician awareness of red flag symptoms. Educational sessions were effective in increasing knowledge, but implementing this knowledge is challenging, especially in busy settings. Alternatively, manual checklists' efficacy is limited due to clinician resistance and the time taken to complete them. Moreover, manual entries are prone to human error and need continuous reinforcement through training. Prior to this project, no standardised proforma or structured checklist for CES documentation existed within the department. Documentation relied on free-text entries, leading to variability and frequent omissions of key red flags.

This quality improvement project (QIP) assesses the use of an automated digital documentation tool, '#CES', within the electronic patient record (EPR) system, to improve the accuracy and completeness of CES documentation. Like manual checklists, '#CES' serves as an aid-mémoire that guides clinicians through documenting key red flag signs for CES. By automating this, #CES minimises reliance on memory and reduces resultant inconsistencies. This project focuses on marking this shift from manual to digitally prompted documentation using structured templates.

### Expediting the management of cauda equina syndrome in the emergency department through clinical pathway design [^5e54ca0b]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Problem

Lower back pain is a common medical complaint and its prevalence is rising.

It represents one of the top five reasons why patients attend the emergency department (ED) and accounts for 4.4% of all ED consultations.ED physicians must be able to assess lower back pain in a timely fashion, distinguishing benign conditions from those associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a neurosurgical emergency caused by compression of the sacral and/or lumbar nerve roots, resulting in one or more of the following sequelae: bladder, bowel or sexual dysfunction, decrease perianal sensation, motor or sensory neurological deficit in the lower limbs.MRI is the gold standard diagnostic test. The Society of British Neurological Surgeons (SBNS) has produced guidelines for the standard of care that is expected in the timely assessment of suspected CES in the ED. They recommend that all EDs have an agreed protocol with their spinal service for the assessment, imaging and referral of patients with suspected CES. A multidisciplinary and coordinated approach between the ED, radiology and neurosurgical teams is necessary to reduce the time of diagnosis of CES. The Hull Royal Infirmary (UK) has even suggested that this process be standardised through the creation of a national referral pathway. Early surgical decompression surgery can prevent permanent bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunctionthat are associated with delayed diagnosis.

Charing Cross Hospital (CXH) is a tertiary neurosurgical referral centre in London, UK, and has a busy ED, seeing approximately 120 000 patients per year. The agreed practice instructed ED physicians to refer patients with suspected CES to neurosurgery for further evaluation, including the decision regarding the need for MRI. Senior ED physicians were unable to request MRI without prior neurosurgical review.

It was hypothesised that better coordination from the ED, radiology and neurosurgical teams could reduce the time of presentation to diagnosis or exclusion of CES. A team composed of ED senior house officers, registrars and consultants was created to lead a quality improvement project (QIP) evaluating our current practice for patients with suspected CES in the CXH ED. The team would identify factors that caused delay in diagnosis of CES and if applicable, design a new, sustainable, and cost-neutral intervention to expedite the management of suspected CES. The SMART aim of this QIP was to reduce the time to diagnosis of CES by 25% within 6 months. All data relevant to the study are included in the article.

### Orthopedic pitfalls: cauda equina syndrome [^909e3b5a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Low back pain is an extremely common complaint encountered by emergency and primary care physicians. Although the majority of patients have uncomplicated benign presentations, there is a small subset who has a much more severe disease process called cauda equina syndrome, which entails acute compression of the nerve roots of the cauda equina. These patients usually present posttraumatically with the triad of saddle anesthesia, bowel or bladder dysfunction, and lower extremity weakness. Significant morbidity can result from delayed diagnosis and treatment; therefore, the emergency physician should remain aware of this potential orthopedic pitfall. This case report discusses the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and relevant treatment of cauda equina syndrome in the ED.

Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) is an emergency clinical syndrome with correlating radiological evidence of spinal compression. Urgent recognition and treatment is key. In many units, it lacks a clear pathway of investigation and referral, despite a constantly expanding evidence base for its management.

Purpose

The aim of this article is to provide a systematic review of currently available guidelines internationally, and also an up-to-date review of current key evidence on topics central to the accurate assessment and investigation of CES.

Study Design

A systematic review of the literature was carried out to identify all previously published or proposed pathways internationally for CES.

Methods

Included articles were reviewed and data extracted and collected in excel format. Data extracted included year of publication, author, time to MRI in pathway, inclusion or exclusion of post void residual measurement and specific cauda equina red flags used. An evidentiary review was also carried out on key topics including digital rectal examination.

Results

Following removal of duplicates a total of 307 articles underwent title and abstract screening from which 9 were eventually included for data extraction. All included papers recommended urgent MRI with the presence of red flag findings. Red flags included in all papers were perianal/perineal/saddle sensory disturbance and bladder or bowel dysfunction of varying specifications. 8/9 papers included radicular/sciatic pain, 5/9 included new motor weakness, 4/9 included DRE findings and PVR was included in 5/9 papers. PVR and DR examinations retain clinical significance.

Conclusion

While specific guidelines show minor variability, overall the current literature presents a consensus that in cases of suspected cauda equina syndrome MRI should be carried out on an urgent basis.

### Cauda equina syndrome: the importance of complete multidisciplinary team management [^c5f628cf]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 44-year-old lady with a history of lumbar back pain presented to the emergency department complaining of severe back pain radiating to her buttocks. Positive examination findings were a loss of sensation in the perianal area and 348 mL of retained urine. An urgent MRI showed compression of the cauda equina by a herniated disc. The patient was operated upon that evening, having a lumbar 5/sacral 1 decompression and sequestrectomy. During follow-up, the patient was reviewed by a consultant spinal surgeon, a urologist and our cauda equina nurse at every appointment, as per the cauda equina pathway specifically designed and implemented by our spinal unit. This report shows the complex nature of cauda equina syndrome and broad functional deficit patients can suffer from. It shows the benefits of prompt diagnosis and surgery, together with intensive, multidisciplinary follow-up and treatment, all of which are possible by a specially created, cauda equina protocol.

### Pathology of the conus medullaris and cauda equina. beyond the usual suspects [^7e982954]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Disorders affecting the conus medullaris and the nerve roots of the cauda equina often produce overlapping clinical symptoms, making differentiation challenging. The conus medullaris, forming the terminal segment of the spinal cord, typically resides at the T12–L1 vertebral level. Injury or disease at this junction-particularly between T12 and L2-can result in conus medullaris syndrome, which is characterized by a combination of upper and lower motor neuron deficits due to involvement of both the spinal cord and adjacent nerve roots.

In contrast, cauda equina syndrome arises from damage or compression of the nerve roots below the conus, most commonly due to acute herniation of a lumbar intervertebral disc, but also from other causes such as trauma, tumors, or infections. This syndrome is considered a neurological emergency and, while rare, has an estimated incidence of about 1 in 65,000 individuals.

The clinical manifestations of cauda equina syndrome can develop suddenly or progress over time, and diagnosis generally requires the presence of at least two hallmark features: sensory disturbances in the perianal or "saddle" region, and dysfunction of bowel, bladder, or sexual function. Additional symptoms may include low back pain, radiating leg pain, lower limb weakness, diminished reflexes, and sensory changes in the legs.

Patients with conus medullaris syndrome may similarly present with severe back pain, saddle anesthesia, urinary retention, bowel incontinence, and lower limb weakness. However, a distinguishing feature is the simultaneous presence of upper and lower motor neuron signs, whereas cauda equina syndrome results exclusively in lower motor neuron deficits.

Given the clinical overlap and the potential for systemic conditions to affect both the conus medullaris and cauda equina, radiologists play a crucial role in identifying the underlying etiology using advanced imaging, particularly MRI. Some pathologies may present with atypical or widespread symptoms, further complicating the clinical picture.

This review aims to outline the most frequent and important causes to consider when evaluating lesions in the conus medullaris and cauda equina regions, as well as to highlight less common entities that should be included in the differential diagnosis. The goal is to enhance diagnostic accuracy and guide appropriate management by recognizing both typical and unusual imaging patterns.

### Cauda equina syndrome [^b455d8b3]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Patients with cauda equina syndrome (CES) require emergency imaging and surgical decompression. The severity and type of symptoms may influence the timing of imaging and surgery, and help predict the patient's prognosis. Categories of CES attempt to group patients for management and prognostication purposes. We aimed in this study to assess the inter-rater reliability of dividing patients with CES into categories to assess whether they can be reliably applied in clinical practice and in research.

Methods

A literature review was undertaken to identify published descriptions of categories of CES. A total of 100 real anonymized clinical vignettes of patients diagnosed with CES from the Understanding Cauda Equina Syndrome (UCES) study were reviewed by consultant spinal surgeons, neurosurgical registrars, and medical students. All were provided with published category definitions and asked to decide whether each patient had 'suspected CES'; 'early CES'; 'incomplete CES'; or 'CES with urinary retention'. Inter-rater agreement was assessed for all categories, for all raters, and for each group of raters using Fleiss's kappa.

Results

Each of the 100 participants were rated by four medical students, five neurosurgical registrars, and four consultant spinal surgeons. No groups achieved reasonable inter-rater agreement for any of the categories. CES with retention versus all other categories had the highest inter-rater agreement (kappa 0.34 (95% confidence interval 0.27 to 0.31); minimal agreement). There was no improvement in inter-rater agreement with clinical experience. Across all categories, registrars agreed with each other most often (kappa 0.41), followed by medical students (kappa 0.39). Consultant spinal surgeons had the lowest inter-rater agreement (kappa 0.17).

Conclusion

Inter-rater agreement for categorizing CES is low among clinicians who regularly manage these patients. CES categories should be used with caution in clinical practice and research studies, as groups may be heterogenous and not comparable.

### Outcomes reported after surgery for cauda equina syndrome: a systematic literature review [^c16c7701]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

At present, there is no COS for CES, which is to the detriment of patients and health services. The aim of this systematic literature review is to inform the future development of a COS by identifying all documented outcomes for patients after surgery in CES, identify if they are defined, and to assess what variability there is. The systematic literature review is the first step to inform the development of a COSfor patients who have undergone surgery for CES to be used in research and in practice.

### Non-invasive and minimally invasive management of low back disorders [^8909fb67]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Low back algorithm — evaluation of low back and back-related leg symptoms directs that patients with activity intolerance due to low back pain and/or back-related leg symptoms receive focused medical and work histories and physical examination to search for red flags, with neurologic screening and straight leg raising test and crossed SLR tests. If any red flags or symptoms of spinal stenosis, condition-specific actions are outlined: for dissecting or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, for low probability, sonography; for high probability, emergent CT or MRI scan; for spinal fracture, obtain plain-film radiography of lumbosacral spine, and if negative after 10 days and fracture still suspected or multiple sites of pain, obtain spiral CT, and consider consultation if result is positive or ambiguous; for cancer or infection, obtain CBC, ESR, U/A, note that in cancer or infection plain-film radiography may be negative, consider bone scan, and consultation if studies positive; and for cauda equina syndrome or rapidly progressing neurologic deficit, immediate consultation for studies and/or render definitive care. If symptoms of pseudoclaudication, treat with NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), progressive exercise, and surgery if severe or fails to improve sufficiently. In the absence of red flags, diagnostic testing is not helpful in the first 4 weeks for either low back or radicular pain; the algorithm then asks about evidence of serious disease with instruction to arrange appropriate treatment or consultation, and also about evidence of nonspinal problems causing back complaints.

### Chiropractic maintenance treatment, a useful preventative approach? [^9df4d68f]. Preventive Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Most chiropractors advise patients to have regular maintenance treatments with spinal manipulation, even in the absence of any symptoms or diseases. This article evaluates the evidence for or against this approach. No compelling evidence was found to indicate that chiropractic maintenance therapy effectively prevents symptoms or diseases. As spinal manipulation has repeatedly been associated with considerable harm, the risk benefit balance of chiropractic maintenance care is not demonstrably positive. Therefore there are no good reasons to recommend it.

### Facet joint syndrome: from diagnosis to interventional management [^a3e4a41f]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

There is currently no consensus on how best to evaluate lumbar FJ osteoarthritis with imaging. It has been reported that in clinical practice, imaging findings of degenerative abnormalities (including radiographs, MRI, CT, SPECT) have been assumed to be associated with nonspecific low back pain. Radiographic changes secondary to osteoarthritis are equally reported among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Radiological investigations report a poor correlation between clinical symptoms and degenerative spinal changes. Therefore, the role of FJ imaging in patient with LBP is still debated. The interest of imaging often lies in its ability to rule out differential diagnosis, commonly referred to as "red flag indications", rather than to prove a symptomatic condition. Red flag indications are intended to represent the potential for life or limb threatening conditions (suspicion of aortic aneurysm or dissection, neoplasm, infection, cauda equina syndrome, fracture, motor weakness). Advanced diagnostic imaging of the symptomatic level is appropriate and/or work-up for a non-spinal source of spine pain.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^d58a73d6]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD Low Back Pain — red flags evaluation and recommendation: The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low for detection of serious spinal pathologies by history/symptoms or physical examination, but given the high likelihood of catastrophic harms from a failure to identify a serious underlying condition and that the life-preserving benefits of conducting a history and physical examination to identify red flags outweigh very small potential harms, it determined a Strong recommendation is warranted and decided upon a Strong for recommendation, noting that conducting a history and physical examination including assessment of neurological deficits and red flags is generally feasible and accepted. Supporting risk data indicate that the presence of multiple red flags increases the probability of fracture to between 42% and 90%, and that urinary retention signals higher risk of cauda equina syndrome (CES), which has an estimated prevalence of 0.04% among patients presenting with LBP, whereas in patients without urinary retention, the probability of CES was approximately 0.01%.

### Improving the detection and documentation of suspected cauda equina syndrome: a quality improvement project [^7997e94c]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Problem and aims

The initial evaluation of 42 patients (May–August 2024) revealed major deficiencies in CES documentation. Only 4.9% of entries documented reflexes and sensory modalities (light touch, pinprick) were absent along with significant gaps in the documentation of red flag symptoms.

Our aim was to improve neurological examination documentation in suspected CES through:

Standardisation of documentation using a digitally prompted EPR tool.
Alignment with the GIRFT CES Pathway.
Improving clinician engagement via education and feedback.
Sustaining improvement across multiple Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles.

This was done by implementing '#CES' over 2 PDSA cycles (Baseline: 23 May 2024–2 August 2024, first PDSA cycle: 19 September 2024–20 October 2024, second PDSA cycle: 5 January 2025–5 February 2025).

### Spinal emergencies in primary care practice [^dcc42154]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Atraumatic spinal emergencies often present a diagnostic and management dilemma for health care practitioners. Spinal epidural abscess, cauda equina syndrome, and spinal epidural hematoma are conditions that can insidiously present to outpatient medical offices, urgent care centers, and emergency departments. Unless a high level of clinical suspicion is maintained, these clinical entities may be initially misdiagnosed and mismanaged. Permanent neurologic sequela and even death can result if delays in appropriate treatment occur. A focused, critical review of 34 peer-reviewed articles was performed to identify current data about accurate diagnosis of spinal emergencies. This review highlights the key features of these 3 pathological entities with an emphasis on appropriate diagnostic strategy to intervene efficiently and minimize morbidity.

### An optimized CT protocol for detecting suspected cauda equina syndrome: a comparative analysis with MRI [^7012def1]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Lumbar disc herniation, potentially leading to nerve root compression and cauda equina syndrome, is typically evaluated using MR imaging. However, the limited availability of MR imaging outside regular hours in certain health care systems poses considerable challenges. This purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an optimized CT lumbar spine protocol as a potential alternative to MR imaging in assessing suspected neural compression.

Materials and Methods

Patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected cauda equina syndrome or acute radicular symptoms secondary to lumbar disc herniation referred for MR imaging were prospectively enrolled for an additional CT optimized to assess spinal stenosis. An expert radiologist, blinded to clinical data, graded canal stenosis at each lumbar level on CT. The same grading process was applied to MR imaging after a 4-week interval to maintain blinding.

Results

Fifty-nine individuals were included in the final analysis. In 22 (39%) cases, no significant stenosis was identified. In a further 22 (37%) cases, disc pathology was identified that was managed conservatively. Thirteen (22%) individuals proceeded to urgent surgical decompression. In 1 (2%) instance, an alternative diagnosis was identified. Compared with MR imaging, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for CT in detecting disc pathology in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute neural compression were 97% (95% CI, 82%-99%), 97% (95% CI, 83%-99%), 97% (95% CI, 92%-99%), and 97% (95% CI, 83%-99%), respectively. CT accurately identified all cases requiring urgent decompression.

Conclusions

CT accurately predicted MR imaging findings in patients with suspected cauda equina and nerve root compression, demonstrating its utility as an adjunct tool for patient triage in emergency settings with limited MR imaging access. This protocol could enhance the allocation of emergency resources by appropriately selecting patients for emergent MR imaging.

### Low back pain [^9b06897d]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain — differential diagnosis and red flag screening note that in the vast majority of patients with low back pain, symptoms can be attributed to nonspecific mechanical factors, but in a much smaller percentage the cause may be something more serious such as cancer, cauda equina syndrome, spinal infection, spinal compression fractures, spinal stress fractures, ankylosing spondylitis, or aneurysm. Clinicians must be aware of the key signs and symptoms associated with serious medical conditions and develop a system to continually screen, which may include medical screening questionnaires and a neurological status examination. A neurological status examination should be included for patients with low back pain, and patients with paresthesias, sensory changes, weakness, or signs of central nervous system disorders should receive a thorough neurological examination including assessment of sensation, reflexes, muscle power, motor control, and movement coordination. When a potentially serious medical condition is suspected, clinicians should initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner.

### Expediting the management of cauda equina syndrome in the emergency department through clinical pathway design [^1e467511]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Background

The prevalence of CES is low, with estimates ranging between 1:33 000 and 1:100 000 inhabitants. Large central lumbar disc herniation at L4/5 or L5/S1 is the most common cause of CES, although rarer causes such as spinal trauma, neoplasm, spinal abscesses and multi-level stenosis can also be responsible. Red flag symptoms, such a motor weakness, loss of sensation in the legs or peri-anal area, decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, urinary incontinence or retention, and loss of anal tone should raise suspicion for CES. These signs help distinguish CES from other causes of lower back pain.

Female gender and age above 30 years have been identified as two risk factors associated with CESand it is felt that most patients affected are young to middle age. Delayed and/or misdiagnosis can cause irreversible sphincter and sexual dysfunction, a devastating outcome on a patient's personal and social life. It equally has high medico-legal ramifications. In the UK, the Medical Defence Union paid out £6.7 million in compensation over a 5-year period, with an average of £336 000 per claim based at 2003 rates.

The urgency of decompression surgery and how timing affects clinical outcomes has predominantly been studied in retrospective studies, as prospective randomised controlled trial are not ethically feasible. In those with preserved or partially preserved bladder function, early decompression within 24 hours increases the likelihood of bladder function recovery. DeLong et al 's meta-analyses showed that urinary retention is correlated to worst clinical outcomes, and in these cases, the effect of the timing of decompression surgery is less certain. However, since establishing the exact onset of symptoms in patients is difficult, the SBNS advocates that surgery for CES should be performed as soon as possible. A 4-year study at St. George's Hospital neurosurgical centre in London retrospectively investigated factors leading to delayed treatment of CES. It concluded that delayed treatment was most frequently caused by a delay in making the diagnosis.

In summary, there is evidence in the literature and recommendations from the SBNS to suggest that EDs should strive for early diagnosis of CES to decrease severe adverse patient outcomes. Clinical pathways and protocols have been successfully designed in the ED to streamline and improve patient care in sepsis. As such, a clinical pathway was felt to be the most cost effective, proven and tailored clinical intervention for the QIP.

### The clinical features and outcome of scan-negative and scan-positive cases in suspected cauda equina syndrome: a retrospective study of 276 patients [^dcc64ab2]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of patients presenting with suspected clinical cauda equina syndrome (CES) have no identifiable structural cause for their symptoms ('scan-negative' CES). Understanding these patients aids clinical differentiation and management in CES.

Methods

A retrospective electronic note review was undertaken of patients presenting with suspected CES, defined as ≥ 1 of acute bladder, bowel, sexual dysfunction or saddle numbness, to a regional neurosciences centre. We investigated radiology, clinical features, psychiatric and functional disorder comorbidities and outcome of patients with 'scan-negative' CES and patients with MRI confirmed compression of the cauda equina ('scan-positive' CES).

Results

276 patients were seen over 16 months. There were three main radiologically defined patient groups: (1) 'scan-positive' CES (n = 78, mean age 48 years, 56% female), (2) 'scan-negative' CES without central canal stenosis but with lumbosacral nerve root compression not explaining the clinical presentation (n = 87, mean age 43 years, 68% female) and (3) 'scan-negative' CES without neural compromise (n = 104, mean age 42 years, 70% female). In the two 'scan-negative' groups (no neural compromise and nerve root compression), there were higher rates of functional disorders (37% and 29% vs. 9%), functional neurological disorders (12% and 11% vs 0%) and psychiatric comorbidity (53% and 40% vs 20%). On follow-up (mean 13–16 months), only 1 of the 191 patients with 'scan-negative' CES was diagnosed with an explanatory neurological disorder (transverse myelitis).

Conclusions

The data support a model in which scan-negative cauda equina syndrome arises as an end pathway of acute pain, sometimes with partly structural findings and vulnerability to functional disorders.

### Improving the detection and documentation of suspected cauda equina syndrome: a quality improvement project [^c8f08d86]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Baseline: initial service evaluation and intervention

The goal was to assess the baseline accuracy of CES documentation and identify gaps. We hypothesised that inadequate documentation was impacting timely CES diagnosis and planned to assess this. From May to August 2024, we conducted a service evaluation, reviewing all patient records with suspected CES. The evaluation revealed significant gaps in documentation. For instance, only 4.9% of cases documented reflexes and 9.8% documented vascular assessments. Based on these findings, we recognised the need for a standardised documentation approach, which led to the development of the #CES template to ensure that key clinical examination findings were consistently recorded. While the evaluation confirmed documentation gaps, its impact on diagnostic delays was not directly measured. On 1 September 2024, the #CES tool was embedded in the EPR to prompt clinicians to document all essential neurological findings (figure 1).

PDSA cycle 1: implementation and initial use of #CES

After rolling out the #CES tool, we evaluated the documentation improvements from 19 September 2024 to 20 October 2024 using the same outcome measures. Although there was an increase in documentation of reflexes (57.1%) and vascular assessment (14.3%), adherence was incomplete, with only 25% of clinicians fully using the tool. This cycle aimed to increase the automated template's use by educating resident doctors, the clinicians who tend to document most of the neurological exams conducted on patients with suspected CES, on implementing the #CES automated template for standardising documentation. Moreover, to address partial completion, we engaged the informatics team to enhance the template with prompts for frequently missed signs. This refinement aimed to encourage complete documentation in subsequent cycles.

### The profile of older adults seeking chiropractic care: a secondary analysis [^0138dfcc]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Of the 946 older patients diagnosed with a back problem, 83 (5%) had radiating back pain. Chiropractors report regularly treating patients experiencing low back-related leg pain, and in those chiropractors who 'often' treat low back-related leg pain, they were more likely to treat degenerative spine conditions. While the methods of this study do not allow us to report the specific diagnosis of older patients with radiating back pain, symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis is often characterized by neurogenic claudication, defined as symptoms of pain, weakness and/or numbness radiating into one or both buttock, thigh, or lower leg. In the absence of progressive neurological deficits or cauda equina symptoms, non-surgical approaches are recommended for lumbar spinal stenosis, with conservative care that involves chiropractic (combined with one-on-one instruction on daily exercises and self-management strategies) being superior to self-directed care.

In high income countries, such as Australia and Canada, multimorbidity is mainly driven by age, and the proportion of the population living with two or more diseases is steadily increasing because of demographic change. We found that one-fifth of older chiropractic patients had more than one comorbidity, much less than the 75% of patients aged 65–74 years with multimorbidity at Australian general practitioner encounters (which increased to 83% in those aged ≥ 75 years). In community-dwelling older women with arthritis, 42% self-reported multimorbidity, more than twice the proportion in our study. Differences between doctor-, chiropractor- and self- reported medical conditions, and how they are categorized, may determine the reason for discordance, or it may be that older adults who receive chiropractic care are healthier than those who do not. Treating chronic diseases in isolation leads to complicated and costly interactions within the health system. Unless health systems shift the paradigm to a holistic treatment of the older patient in order to manage the consequences of chronic diseases, an increasing number of older patients may be disadvantaged.

### Management of cauda equina syndrome during pregnancy and postpartum [^ef3ec7fa]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare condition that occurs from multiple nerve root compression. It is considered a surgical emergency because it can lead to permanent neurological damage. There is limited literature regarding management and prognosis of CES for pregnant patients, leaving providers with many questions when encountering patients with this condition. We describe the case of a patient who developed CES during pregnancy. She presented at 30 weeks gestation and successfully underwent surgical decompression in prone position. She later delivered via elective caesarean at term. This case highlights management considerations for pregnant patients with CES, including positioning during surgery and use of regional anaesthesia.

Methods

Measures

To evaluate the efficacy of the '#CES' tool on the accuracy and completeness of examination records in suspected CES cases, both process and outcome measures were selected. Process Measures included the frequency of using #CES (measured as the number and proportion of suspected CES cases documented with the tool) and template completion (percentage of cases where all fields of the #CES templates were filled). These measures also highlight clinician engagement with the template, reflecting the level of adherence to documentation standards. Outcome measures looked at documentation of key neurological findings to evaluate whether clinicians noted CES-specific red flags among other neurological symptoms by ruling them in or out. This is crucial in terms of prioritisation, particularly when identifying patients that may need urgent management and ensuring it is initiated in a timely manner as per the GIRFT CES Pathway. Resultants were validated by reviewing the EPR logs of clerking documentation for suspected CES for consistency and completeness.

Data collection

An initial baseline service evaluation was conducted prior to the implementation of the #CES tool. This was followed by two full PDSA cycles. The initial service evaluation spanned May to August 2024, before the #CES template's introduction, to assess the documentation standard before implementing the intervention. This focused on the clerking documentation of patients presenting with back pain to the Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust. After the #CES tool's implementation and an initial teaching session on 1 September 2024, follow-up data were collected from 19 September 2024 to 20 October 2024 to track the intervention's impact, focusing on clinician adherence and documentation of neurological findings. A second PDSA cycle was then conducted from 5 January 2025 to 5 February 25, following the template's integration into resident doctor induction in December. This cycle aimed to reinforce template use and assess whether structured teaching at induction improved uptake and documentation completeness.

By comparing the results across all cycles, tracking direct template use and extent of completion, the impact of the intervention on documentation standards was evaluated. Variations in documentation among those who fully used the template, partially used it, or did not use it at all continued to serve as key indicators of the template's efficacy.

Clinician engagement involved a series of focus group discussions, department-wide surveys and iterative feedback sessions. The hospital's quality improvement (QI) team facilitated structured feedback-guided improvements, ensuring that the template was user-friendly and aligned with clinical workflows.

Limitations

While delivering the implementation, several practical issues limited the tool's efficacy assessment. These include the limited sample size and short timeframe, which may have restricted the project's ability to yield robust, generalisable data. Additional PDSA cycles with larger sample sizes and longer time frames would help further assess its impact, mitigate biases and support continuous improvement for long-term sustainability. Moreover, factors such as clinician turnover, varied familiarity with the EPR and fluctuating patient volumes in the emergency setting introduced potential biases and confounding factors. To minimise such issues, future PDSA cycles could involve continuous practical education sessions focusing on implementation aimed at clinicians who usually document the examination of patients presenting with potential CES. Moreover, regular feedback to reinforce template use and gather clinician input could be helpful to better tailor the tool to clinicians' preferences and hopefully increase their preference in using the tool in documentation. This could also be in the form of interviews with the project team, where clinicians are invited to give their input to help refine the tool and encourage its full use.

While the #CES tool significantly improved the documentation of neurological findings, a key limitation is that it does not fully distinguish between general neurological deficits (American Spinal Injury Association/ International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Canal Injury, ASIA/ISNCSCI) and specific red flag features for CES, as outlined in the GIRFT interactive CES pathway. This distinction is critical in clinical prioritisation and decision-making, particularly for red flags requiring urgent escalation, such as saddle anaesthesia, bilateral leg symptoms and bladder dysfunction. Although these features are included in the template, they are not currently highlighted or prioritised within the user interface. Future PDSA cycles should consider enhancing the template to prompt for GIRFT-defined red flags more explicitly, for example, using visual cues or priority labels, to improve recognition and escalation pathways.

Additionally, while this project effectively demonstrated improvements in documentation (a valuable process outcome), direct clinical outcome measures, such as time to MRI, time to neurosurgical review or time to theatre, were not evaluated. As such, although improved documentation may support better clinical care, this assumption remains unvalidated in this cycle. Future work will seek to correlate template usage with these outcome-based metrics to assess the tool's true impact on patient care and service efficiency.

### Cauda equina syndrome: a review of the current clinical and medico-legal position [^c10cab8b]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare condition with a disproportionately high medico-legal profile. It occurs most frequently following a large central lumbar disc herniation, prolapse or sequestration. Review of the literature indicates that around 50–70% of patients have urinary retention (CES-R) on presentation with 30–50% having an incomplete syndrome (CES-I). The latter group, especially if the history is less than a few days, usually requires emergency MRI to confirm the diagnosis followed by prompt decompression by a suitably experienced surgeon. Every effort should be made to avoid CES-I with its more favourable prognosis becoming CES-R while under medical supervision either before or after admission to hospital. The degree of urgency of early surgery in CES-R is still not in clear focus but it cannot be doubted that earliest decompression removes the mechanical and perhaps chemical factors which are the causes of progressive neurological damage. A full explanation and consent procedure prior to surgery is essential in order to reduce the likelihood of misunderstanding and litigation in the event of a persistent neurological deficit.

### Improving the detection and documentation of suspected cauda equina syndrome: a quality improvement project [^1f057c89]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare but critical neurological emergency. Prompt diagnosis and accurate documentation are essential to avoid permanent neurological impairment. This quality improvement project aimed to improve the accuracy and completeness of neurological examination documentation for patients presenting with suspected CES.

Methods

Using three Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, a digitally prompted documentation tool '#CES' was developed and implemented in the electronic patient record system. The tool was designed in alignment with the 2019 GIRFT Spine Report and 2023 GIRFT National CES Pathway. It included red flag symptoms and neurological assessment criteria from the ASIA classification. A teaching session on its use was delivered in January before the second data collection period (19 September 2024–20 October 2024), and it was later incorporated into resident doctor induction in December before the third data collection period (5 January 2025–5 February 2025).

Results

In the initial cycle (May–August 2024), documentation was inconsistent, particularly for sensory (0%) and reflex (4.9%) examination. Following implementation and a teaching session (September 2024), documentation improved in the second cycle (September–October 2024): sensation (81.3%), reflexes (57.1%), though tone and motor documentation declined. In the third cycle (January–February 2025), full template use rose to 80% (from 25%) and documentation further improved: sensation (94.1%), motor (64.7%), reflexes (64.7%), tone (64.7%), vascular (58.8%).

Conclusions

A CES-specific, digitally prompted template significantly improved documentation quality. Integration of GIRFT red flags, clinician codesign and repeated education enhanced uptake and accuracy. Further PDSA cycles will focus on sustainability, time-to-diagnosis metrics and addressing clinician workload concerns.

### Is cauda equina syndrome being treated within the recommended time frame? [^2b080d5c]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare but devastating medical condition requiring urgent surgery to halt or reverse neurological compromise. Controversy exists as to how soon surgery must be performed after diagnosis, and clinical and medicolegal factors make this question highly relevant to the spine surgeon. It is unclear from the literature how often CES patients are treated within the recommended time frame.

Objective

To determine whether CES patients are being treated in compliance with the current guideline of surgery within 48 hours and to assess incidence, demography, comorbidities, and outcome measures of CES patients.

Methods

We searched the 2003 to 2006 California State Inpatient Databases to identify degenerative lumbar disk disorder patients surgically treated for CES. An International Classification of Disease, ninth revision, clinical modification, diagnosis code was used to identify CES patients with advanced disease.

Results

The majority (88.74%) of California's CES patients received surgery within the recommended 48-hour window after diagnosis. The incidence of CES in surgically treated degenerative lumbar disk patients was 1.51% with an average of 397 cases per year in California. CES patients had worse outcomes and used more healthcare resources than other surgically treated degenerative lumbar disk patients; this disparity was more pronounced for patients with advanced CES. CES patients treated after 48 hours had 3 times the odds of a nonroutine discharge as patients treated within 48 hours (odds ratio = 3.082; P < .001).

Conclusion

In California, patients are being treated within the recommended 48-hour time frame.

### Mechanical low back pain [^3d3766dc]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Low back pain is usually nonspecific or mechanical. Mechanical low back pain arises intrinsically from the spine, intervertebral disks, or surrounding soft tissues. Clinical clues, or red flags, may help identify cases of nonmechanical low back pain and prompt further evaluation or imaging. Red flags include progressive motor or sensory loss, new urinary retention or overflow incontinence, history of cancer, recent invasive spinal procedure, and significant trauma relative to age. Imaging on initial presentation should be reserved for when there is suspicion for cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection. Plain radiography of the lumbar spine is appropriate to assess for fracture and bony abnormality, whereas magnetic resonance imaging is better for identifying the source of neurologic or soft tissue abnormalities. There are multiple treatment modalities for mechanical low back pain, but strong evidence of benefit is often lacking. Moderate evidence supports the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and topiramate in the short-term treatment of mechanical low back pain. There is little or no evidence of benefit for acetaminophen, antidepressants (except duloxetine), skeletal muscle relaxants, lidocaine patches, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in the treatment of chronic low back pain. There is strong evidence for short-term effectiveness and moderate-quality evidence for long-term effectiveness of yoga in the treatment of chronic low back pain. Various spinal manipulative techniques (osteopathic manipulative treatment, spinal manipulative therapy) have shown mixed benefits in the acute and chronic setting. Physical therapy modalities such as the McKenzie method may decrease the recurrence of low back pain and health care expenditures. Physical therapy modalities such as the McKenzie method may decrease the recurrence of low back pain and use of health care. Educating patients on prognosis and incorporating psychosocial components of care such as identifying comorbid psychological problems and barriers to treatment are essential components of long-term management.

### The clinical features and outcome of scan-negative and scan-positive cases in suspected cauda equina syndrome: a retrospective study of 276 patients [^30ecbe07]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of patients presenting with suspected clinical cauda equina syndrome (CES) have no identifiable structural cause for their symptoms ('scan-negative' CES). Understanding these patients aids clinical differentiation and management in CES.

Methods

A retrospective electronic note review was undertaken of patients presenting with suspected CES, defined as ≥ 1 of acute bladder, bowel, sexual dysfunction or saddle numbness, to a regional neurosciences centre. We investigated radiology, clinical features, psychiatric and functional disorder comorbidities and outcome of patients with 'scan-negative' CES and patients with MRI confirmed compression of the cauda equina ('scan-positive' CES).

Results

276 patients were seen over 16 months. There were three main radiologically defined patient groups: (1) 'scan-positive' CES (n = 78, mean age 48 years, 56% female), (2) 'scan-negative' CES without central canal stenosis but with lumbosacral nerve root compression not explaining the clinical presentation (n = 87, mean age 43 years, 68% female) and (3) 'scan-negative' CES without neural compromise (n = 104, mean age 42 years, 70% female). In the two 'scan-negative' groups (no neural compromise and nerve root compression), there were higher rates of functional disorders (37% and 29% vs. 9%), functional neurological disorders (12% and 11% vs 0%) and psychiatric comorbidity (53% and 40% vs 20%). On follow-up (mean 13–16 months), only 1 of the 191 patients with 'scan-negative' CES was diagnosed with an explanatory neurological disorder (transverse myelitis).

Conclusions

The data support a model in which scan-negative cauda equina syndrome arises as an end pathway of acute pain, sometimes with partly structural findings and vulnerability to functional disorders.

### Complex sacral fracture [^d8f37192]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We reported a case of a patient with suspected cauda equina syndrome secondary to sacral fracture, after sustaining a fall. The difficulty in early diagnosis of complex sacral fractures and the lack of clearly defined guidelines for treatment are highlighted. Thorough clinical examination is mandatory, in order to make an adequate initial assessment and follow symptoms progression and response to treatment. The threshold for performing CT imaging (or MRI, if advised), when suspecting sacral fracture and neurological compromise, should be low. A multidisciplinary approach, with contributions from orthopaedic and/or neurosurgical surgery and physiatry, should be the gold standard of treatment. In this particular case, conservative management and close follow-up led to a significant improvement of problems and a good final outcome, showing that surgical decompression is not the only valid option and that further prospective studies are needed, regarding patient selection and timing of intervention.

### Expediting the management of cauda equina syndrome in the emergency department through clinical pathway design [^c992bd35]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Strategy

PDSA cycle 1

The clinical pathway was introduced to all hospital staff members involved in the care of patients with suspected CES. It was presented to the ED staff during a mandatory weekly training session and to the neurosurgery and radiology departments during an internal meeting in July 2017. The pathway was updated on the guidelines section of the ED intranet page.

PDSA cycle 2

Interventions in the second PDSA cycle were designed in accordance to the feedback received by our staff, obtained through semistructured opportunistic interviews. The need for the pathway to be more readily visible and a demand for further teaching on the CES project were highlighted to the QIP team. There were multiple interventions performed simultaneously for the second PDSA cycle designed to increase the visibility of the pathway. Posters of the pathway were displayed in all key work areas in the ED, neurosurgery and radiology departments. An online PDF version of the pathway was used as a screensaver on the projector used in morning handover and a brief reminder about the pathway was incorporated into the daily morning handover. Teaching about CES and the pathway was added to the mandatory 2-day induction of new ED junior doctors. An ED senior house officer reviewed the assessment of lower back pain, CES and our pathway with the ED nurses as part of their mandatory teaching sessions. It was also presented to local GPs at a regional primary care engagement seminar.

### Limited sequence MRI to improve standards of care for suspected cauda equina syndrome [^3382c3e7]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Early cases of cauda equina syndrome (CES) often present with nonspecific symptoms and signs, and it is recommended that patients undergo emergency MRI regardless of the time since presentation. This creates substantial pressure on resources, with many scans performed to rule out cauda equina rather than confirm it. We propose that compression of the cauda equina should be apparent with a limited sequence (LS) scan that takes significantly less time to perform.

Methods

In all, 188 patients with suspected CES underwent a LS lumbosacral MRI between the beginning of September 2017 and the end of July 2018. These images were read by a consultant musculoskeletal radiologist. All images took place on a 3T or 1.5T MRI scanner at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury, UK, and Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, UK.

Results

The 188 patients, all under the age of 55 years, underwent 196 LS lumbosacral MRI scans for suspected CES. Of these patients, 14 had cauda equina compression and underwent emergency decompression. No cases of CES were missed. Patients spent a mean 9.9 minutes (8 to 10) in the MRI scanner.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that a LS lumbosacral MRI could be used to diagnose CES safely in patients under the age of 55 years, but that further research is needed to assess safety and efficacy of this technique before changes to existing protocols can be recommended. In addition, work is needed to assess if LS MRIs can be used throughout the spine and if alternative pathology is being considered. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2020;102-B(4):501–505.

### Improving the suspected cauda equina syndrome pathway at a district general hospital: a quality improvement project [^46f783a4]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Measurement

Baseline data were collected on patients attending with suspected CES. 58 patients were identified over 2 months in 2022 using electronic patient records. In combination with radiology request forms, we identified the time of ED presentation, the time of MRI request, the time of MRI and triage destination. The results showed that the median time from presentation to MRI was 5.9 hours (IQR 4.9–14.7), and 8% of patients were incorrectly sent to a GP-led Medway on Call Care (MEDOCC) service.

Following our first PDSA cycle, we established additional measurements to guide our secondary aims, which we were unable to retrospectively identify in our baseline data due to changes in the electronic patient records system.

Emergency MRIs were determined to be unnecessary if there was no documentation of any GIRFT red flag signs/symptoms of CES, which occurred in 38% of patients in cycle 1, with the scan burden of 0.5 MRIs for suspected CES/day.

The MRI sequence being done for CES was the standard lumbar spine MRI including sagittal T1, T2-weighted and STIR images with additional T2-weighted axial images through abnormal disc levels. The examination was taking up to half an hour per patient and risked missing cervical or thoracic spinal lesions causing CES symptoms.

Time from attendance to analgesia in cycle 1 was 5.3 hours (IQR 3.8–7.0) and 9% of patients were being inappropriately triaged to the ED GP-led service with no access to imaging adding delays.

Approximately 27 patients with suspected CES were reviewed in each subsequent PDSA cycles 1–3. PDSA cycles were set 2 months apart from July 2023 to January 2024 to allow time for change to be implemented.

### Impact of MR neurography in patients with chronic cauda equina syndrome presenting as chronic pelvic pain and dysfunction [^ce0dcf2b]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Chronic cauda equina syndrome, defined as persistent damage of the cauda equina nerve roots within the spinal canal can be a challenging diagnosis with varied presentations. MR neurography imaging is more commonly being used to evaluate the lumbosacral spine of patients suspected of having subacute or chronic cauda equina syndrome. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of lumbosacral plexus MR neurography in the diagnostic thinking and therapeutic management of patients presenting with chronic pelvic pain and dysfunction and suspected chronic cauda equina syndrome.

Materials and Methods

Consecutive MR neurography lumbosacral plexus examinations at our institution were reviewed retrospectively. Relevant data collected included the following: patient demographics, clinical history, pertinent physical examination findings, preimaging diagnostic impression, prior MR imaging lumbar spine findings, MR neurography findings, postimaging diagnosis, and postimaging treatment plan. The impact of imaging on the preimaging clinical diagnosis and therapeutic management was evaluated.

Results

Of 185 studies of patients who presented with chronic pelvic pain and/or dysfunction, 23 with clinically suspected chronic cauda equina syndrome and imaging findings were included in the study (2 subjects were lost to follow-up). The mean ages were 53 ± 12 years and 53 ± 16 years for men and women, respectively. The common etiologies included arachnoiditis (n = 8), tethered cord (n = 2), and simple/Tarlov cysts (n = 3). Eighteen of 23 (78%) subjects had a change in diagnosis resulting from MR neurography findings, and 5/23 (22%) had no change. Seventeen of 21 (81%) subjects had a change in management, and 4/21 (19%) had no change.

Conclusions

MR neurography impacts the diagnosis and therapeutic management of patients with suspected chronic cauda equina syndrome.

### Improving the detection and documentation of suspected cauda equina syndrome: a quality improvement project [^f8805e31]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare but critical neurological emergency. Prompt diagnosis and accurate documentation are essential to avoid permanent neurological impairment. This quality improvement project aimed to improve the accuracy and completeness of neurological examination documentation for patients presenting with suspected CES.

Methods

Using three Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, a digitally prompted documentation tool '#CES' was developed and implemented in the electronic patient record system. The tool was designed in alignment with the 2019 GIRFT Spine Report and 2023 GIRFT National CES Pathway. It included red flag symptoms and neurological assessment criteria from the ASIA classification. A teaching session on its use was delivered in January before the second data collection period (19 September 2024–20 October 2024), and it was later incorporated into resident doctor induction in December before the third data collection period (5 January 2025–5 February 2025).

Results

In the initial cycle (May-August 2024), documentation was inconsistent, particularly for sensory (0%) and reflex (4.9%) examination. Following implementation and a teaching session (September 2024), documentation improved in the second cycle (September-October 2024): sensation (81.3%), reflexes (57.1%), though tone and motor documentation declined. In the third cycle (January-February 2025), full template use rose to 80% (from 25%) and documentation further improved: sensation (94.1%), motor (64.7%), reflexes (64.7%), tone (64.7%), vascular (58.8%).

Conclusions

A CES-specific, digitally prompted template significantly improved documentation quality. Integration of GIRFT red flags, clinician codesign and repeated education enhanced uptake and accuracy. Further PDSA cycles will focus on sustainability, time-to-diagnosis metrics and addressing clinician workload concerns.

Table 1
Documentation of key neurological parameters across the PDSA cycles

Table 2
Summary of process measures across the baseline and two PDSA cycles

We monitored data completeness and accuracy by looking at which fields within the #CES template were filled to the expected standard. Missing documented data were associated with partial or lack of template usage rather than tool limitations, suggesting that the tool itself was effective in meeting its aim but required consistent engagement to maximise its effectiveness.

There were several unintended outcomes, positive and negative, on implementing the #CES template. Improvement was most notable in the documentation of red flag signs and sensory findings. Partial or non-use of the template was associated with poorer documentation, and the tool provided an embedded checklist serving as a learning aid that augmented memory. However, feedback from clinicians revealed an increased workload due to templates, particularly in terms of documenting negative findings that are not considered red flags. The variation in outcomes and perceptions of the tool accessibility and ease highlights the need for future cycles that address these workflow integration issues. No additional costs were incurred preimplementation, during or post implementation. Nevertheless, future cycles will directly assess time, that is, time to MRI and surgical intervention to quantify clinical impact implications and cost implications, that is, in terms of cost saved by more timely diagnosis. These findings suggest that while the tool supports more thorough documentation, further refinement and adaptation to ensure sustainability and implementation in busy and high patient load settings is required.

### Outcomes reported after surgery for cauda equina syndrome: a systematic literature review [^117ad0a3]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

RESULTS

A total of 1873 articles were identified by electronic database searches.
1 Medline (650)
2 Embase (949)
3 CINAHL Plus (239)
4 Registries (35) included Clinical Trials.gov (5), EU clinical trials registry (12) and ISRCTN (International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number) registry (18).

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart in Figure 2 shows the process during the systematic literature review. Following inclusion criteria in Table 1 resulted in 1838 articles plus the 35 studies from the online registry search giving a total of 1873 studies. Moreover, 10% of included studies were reviewed by a supervisor (MW and SC) to assess if inclusion criteria had been applied adequately and agreement was achieved after discussion amongst us. Uncertainty regarding eligibility of certain full text articles for inclusion were discussed with the clinical supervisory team (MW, SC, and TM) and settled leading to 61 included articles. Thirty-four articles were excluded after the full text was obtained and the reasons for this were given as in Figure 2.

Figure 2
PRISMA flowchart for online databases.

Summary details, patient demographics, and how many studies they were reported in out of the 61 included studies are detailed in Table 2. Most studies (90.2%) were retrospective. CES was not defined in 20 studies (32.8%). Even in the articles where CES is defined there were many differing definitions. The most common definition was CESI and CESR as described in Figure 1.

TABLE 2
Summary Characteristics and Demographics of Included Studies

A total of 737 outcomes were reported in the 61 included articles.– For ease of analysis in this study, these reported outcomes have been categorized to one of the 20 core outcome domains (Table 3). The nervous system core outcome domain had 10 subdomains, and the physical functioning has two subdomains (Table 3). The number of different variations in the description of outcomes can be seen in Table 4 linked to the outcome domains.

### Cauda equina syndrome in ankylosing spondylitis: challenges in diagnosis, management, and pathogenesis [^14cbd970]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare neurologic complication of longstanding ankylosing spondylitis (AS). It is unclear what causes CES, and no proven or effective therapy has been reported to date. We have encountered 6 patients with longstanding AS diagnosed with CES. We set about to study their features, review the literature, and generate hypotheses regarding pathophysiology, as well as to speculate on the possibilities of early recognition and prevention.

Methods

We obtained permission from 6 patients with longstanding AS and CES to access their medical records and imaging studies for research purposes related to this paper. We collected and reviewed each patient's medical history, imaging studies, disease duration, past therapies especially those that relate to AS, laboratory data, as well as any treatment they received for CES and followup results of each case to the present time.

Results

The 6 cases of CES with AS have remarkable similarity to each other in that several decades of the disease had passed before neurologic symptoms and later signs appeared. All cases have fused spines and facet joints without spinal fractures, spinal stenosis, or disc herniation.

Conclusion

CES is a rare yet debilitating neurologic complication of longstanding AS. The pathophysiology and treatments are far from clear. We postulate that chronic enthesitis of the vertebral column initiates the process that results in dural stiffening and formation of ectasias, causing downstream nerve root damage.

### Elsberg syndrome: a rarely recognized cause of cauda equina syndrome and lower thoracic myelitis [^802abbc9]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

ES is poorly defined and rarely reported, but it is probably frequently unrecognized. Based on the historical literature and our clinical experience, we formulated objective criteria for ES with 4 different levels of certainty (table 1). Radiculitis, manifest either clinically (table 1, A1), radiologically or electrophysiologically (table 1, A2) is required. A secure diagnosis is possible when evidence for infection by a causative virus is demonstrated and alternative causes excluded, but given the sensitivity of the serologic and virologic studiesand frequent delay in obtaining appropriate samples, clinical and radiologic evidence may suggest ES regardless of the microbiologic information. For this reason, we established criteria for clinically definite, probable, and possible ES (see supportive feature in table 1, B1–B5). In addition, we identified red flags that are cautionary but not exclusionary as well as exclusionary criteria (table 1, C and D).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^3399d9ee]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

NCCN recommendations — workup of suspected spinal metastases: Initial workup depends on the presence or absence of symptoms. For incidental, asymptomatic, metastatic lesions confirmed by systemic imaging, patients can be observed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and in the absence of symptoms it is not mandatory to obtain a spinal MRI for every incidental metastatic lesion seen on surveillance bone scans. For symptomatic presentations such as severe or new back pain, increasing intensity, duration, and changes in the character of pain should trigger an evaluation with an MRI study, and immediate spinal MRI is warranted when neurologic symptoms occur, including weakness, paresthesias, and bladder or bowel incontinence. Contrast can be used to highlight and further evaluate any focal abnormality, the MRI can be used to image the entire spine or a focal area of interest, and if the patient is unable to have an MRI, then a CT myelogram is recommended. A normal neurologic examination implies that there is no spinal radiculopathy or myelopathy correlating with the patient's symptoms and other causes should be considered; an abnormal neurologic examination includes motor abnormalities, sphincter abnormalities, and/or sensory deficits attributable to a dysfunction of nerve root(s) and/or the spinal cord, so detection of radiculopathy, myelopathy, or cauda equina syndrome is indicative of an abnormal examination.

### A qualitative study of experiencing cauda equina syndrome and its aftercare in the UK [^1e4e5699]. Spinal Cord (2025). Medium credibility.

A fragmented healthcare service

In our study, whilst patients were complimentary regarding their surgical treatment and relief of acute symptoms, they were more critical regarding the diagnosis and aftercare provided.

The communication from HCPs was reported as not being clear enough regarding the "red flag" signs of CES, which led to anger and frustration at the delayed diagnosis and unsatisfactory aftercare received especially by CESR patients with more severe symptoms. Research in chronic fatigue and pain has revealed that when symptoms are not visible or harder to measure they risk being dismissed by HCPs and society leading to patient distress and anger. Patients in this study felt HCPs in primary care and emergency departments did not take their concerns seriously enough. This could be ascribed to CES being clinically difficult to differentiate from the more common lower back pain or leg pain, which does not require immediate intervention. It is difficult to justify acute investigations in a healthcare system with limited resources when most back and leg pain improves with conservative management.

The short follow up and discharge for CES patients from spinal services explains why many of our participants described relying on close family and friends network for support. The combination of having a bad clinical outcome, feeling unsupported and being encouraged by medico legal companies to file a complaint seemed to contribute to litigation.

It is clear from this there needs to be a holistic service for CES patients, which focuses on long term care and management rather than acute management and discharge. This has been seen in other neurological conditions, for example in patients who have been treated for subarachnoid haemorrhage where post discharge services were not addressing long term needs. A consideration would be to position management of CES long term issues such as neuropathic pain with appropriate extra resources and funding within the remit of SCI rehabilitation services where these services already exist.

### Cauda equina compression in metastatic prostate cancer [^9690d1c4]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 67-year-old man presented to his general practitioner with intermittent episodes of unilateral sciatica over a 2-month period for which he was referred for an outpatient MRI of his spine. This evidenced a significant lumbar vertebral mass that showed tight canal stenosis and compression of the cauda equina. The patient was sent to the emergency department for management by orthopaedic surgeons. He was mobilising independently, pain free on arrival and without neurological deficit on assessment. Clinically, this patient presented with no red flag symptoms of cauda equina syndrome or reason to suspect malignancy. In these circumstances, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines do not support radiological investigation of the spine outside of specialist services. However, in this case, investigation helped deliver urgent care for cancer that otherwise may have been delayed. This leads to the question, do the current guidelines meet clinical requirements?

### BET 2: is sexual dysfunction a recognised sign of cauda equina syndrome in the ED? [^3b4f1a50]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

A shortcut review of the literature was carried out to examine the association of sexual dysfunction in the context of new-onset low back pain, with cauda equina syndrome (CES). Five papers were identified as suitable for inclusion using the reported search strategy. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of the best papers are tabulated. It is concluded that clinicians appear to be poor at recording this feature during assessment, but between 12% and 96%, patients with confirmed CES will report the presence of new-onset sexual dysfunction at presentation when asked. It appears that this can also be a single isolated red flag feature in the context of low back pain and as such should be a mandatory part of any clinical assessment that seeks to evaluate the risk of impending CES.

### Expediting the management of cauda equina syndrome in the emergency department through clinical pathway design [^c47439ec]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Results

The same endpoints used in the baseline measurements were recollected over an 8-week period, 20 July–14 September 2017, after the interventions of PDSA cycle 1 (introduction of the clinical pathway) and over a 12-week period, 2 November−25 January 2018, after the interventions of PDSA cycle 2 (improved visibility of the clinical pathway) to measure the effectiveness of our interventions. Seventeen patients were included in each cycle of data collection.

The primary outcome was the time interval between the patient's arrival to the ED and the MRI preliminary report. It was measured at 5 hours and 54 min in PDSA 1 and 5 hours 17 min in PDSA 2. Compared with a baseline of 8 hours 16 min, this represents a 29% and 36% reduction in time. The improved performance was statistically significant, p = 0.048 in PDSA cycle1 and p = 0.012 in PDSA cycle 2 (figure 2). Between PDSA 1 and PDSA 2, there was a statistically non-significant 10% reduction (p = 0.362).

Figure 2
Bar chart categorising the time interval between the patient's arrival to the emergency department (ED) and MRI preliminary report at baseline, PDSA 1 and PDSA 2. CES, cauda equina syndrome.

The length of stay in the ED was 3 hours and 5 min in PDSA 1 and 3 hours 18 min in PDSA 2. Although the average time in the ED decreased from baseline to PDSA 1, 65% of patients still breached the national 4 hours waiting time standard. In PDSA 2, 29% of patients breached, which was statistically significant compared with baseline (p = 0.03).

The overall proportion of patients who underwent MRI for the investigation of suspected CES remained constant between 10% and 12% at baseline, PDSA 1 and PDSA 2, irrespective of whether MRI were ordered by neurosurgery or ED physicians.

### Good outcome with conservative treatment of delayed spinal epidural hematoma following combined spinal-epidural anesthesia: a rare case report [^3438929c]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

A SEH can have catastrophic complications. So, MRI, which is the best diagnostic technique, should be performed immediately to confirm the diagnosis in cases of suspected SEH so as not to miss the optimal treatment opportunity. Unfortunately, in the present case, MRI couldn't be performed timely because of her inability to lying down. In fact, we could have administered potent opioids to alleviate pain so that MRI could be performed earlier. Moreover, when persistent neurological deterioration is considered, early surgical decompression is an effective treatment modality, rather than imaging findings, as the sole criterion for a treatment strategy. Fortunately, the patient's neurological function recovery was good.

Once the diagnosis of an SEH has been established, immediate neurosurgical consultation is very important to evaluate neurological deficits and making management decisions. The decision between conservative and surgical treatment often largely depends on several factors, including the size and location of the SEH, the severity and progression of symptoms and the patient's overall health and medical history. A multicenter retrospective study suggest that timely surgical decompression is recommended for patients with moderate/severe neurologic deficits or progressive neurologic deterioration. In addition, urgent evaluation and surgical intervention are recommended in most cases of compressive cauda equina syndrome and spinal cord compression.

Data Synthesis

Three reviewers independently extracted data on CES from the literature specific to its definition, clinical presentation, and etiology. Of 111 articles, 105 were included for review, and relevant information on CES was synthesized into a framework structured as per a clinical consultation. A content analysis was then conducted using the method adopted by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy whereby the level of consensus for each sign and symptom of CES was determined by its percentage coverage within the literature: 100% coverage equals unanimity, 75% to 99% equals consensus, 51% to 74% equals majority view, and 0% to 50% equals no consensus. This enabled the frequency of each reported sign and symptom to be ranked. Articles that included specific definitions for CES were divided into 3 categories: those that (1) included generalized statements, (2) stated a pathomechanical basis, and (3) defined the syndrome by its clinical presentation. Throughout this review, the frequencies of specific etiologies and pathologies were noted. Together with details of clinical presentation, this enabled a comprehensive review of CES. No single aspect of CES within the literature achieved unanimity or consensus; however, a majority view indicated that there would be bladder and sensory disturbance (74% and 66% of all articles, respectively). The most commonly cited pathology resulting in CES was identified as the disk (45% of all articles reviewed).

Conclusions

There are marked inconsistencies in the current evidence base surrounding the etiology and clinical presentation of CES, with 17 definitions identified. Subclassifications of the definition of CES are ambiguous and should be avoided. From reviewing 105 articles, a single definition of CES is proposed. For a diagnosis of CES, one or more of the following must be present: (1) bladder and/or bowel dysfunction, (2) reduced sensation in the saddle area, and (3) sexual dysfunction, with possible neurologic deficit in the lower limb (motor/sensory loss, reflex change).

### Beyond the spinal canal [^94171193]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Cross-sectional spinal imaging is common, and extraspinal findings are often incidentally identified during interpretation. Although some of these findings may cause symptoms that mimic a spinal disorder, the majority are entirely asymptomatic and incidental. It is essential that the radiologist not only identify those abnormalities that may have clinical significance but also recognize those that are clinically irrelevant and thereby prevent patients from being subjected to further unnecessary, expensive and potentially harmful interventions. This article focuses on those abnormalities that are commonly encountered and provides practical guidance for follow-up and management based on current recommendations.

### Improving the suspected cauda equina syndrome pathway at a district general hospital: a quality improvement project [^fbe6b08f]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Problem

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a time-critical condition of the spine caused by acute or rapidly progressive compression of the nerves in the lumbar or sacral spinal canal, most commonly from a large lumbar disc prolapse.CES requires emergency diagnosis and surgical treatment to prevent permanent bowel and bladder incontinence, sexual dysfunction, lower limb paralysis and chronic pain. The individual signs and symptoms have low sensitivity and specificity and are often associated with irreversible damage. Therefore, if CES is clinically suspected, an emergency MRI scan is required, followed by emergency surgery if CES is clinically and radiologically identified.

Getting it Right First Time (GIRFT) developed a national suspected CES pathway in 2023 to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected CES, with all NHS hospitals tasked with creating local provision to achieve 'emergency MRI as soon as possible, certainly within 4 hours of request' by June 2024.

Medway Hospital (MH) is a district general hospital (DGH) located southeast of London in Kent and Medway, with an emergency department (ED) treating 180 000 patients per year. On average, the ED manages one suspected CES patient every second day. MH is part of a regional hub-and-spoke spinal network and does not offer emergency spinal surgical services. An existing pathway to manage patients with suspected CES was in place.

Under the existing pathway, a patient presenting to ED with suspected CES may be triaged correctly to minors for ED doctor assessment, or incorrectly to general practitioner (GP) assessment (without MRI access), after which the patient would often be re-referred into ED, introducing substantial delay.

If a patient presents with symptoms of CES during MRI operational hours (7:30–20:00 hours), and a request is made in sufficient time, then the patient receives an MRI at MH. If the patient presents out-of-hours, the patient is discussed with the neurosurgeons at King's College Hospital (KCH), who decide if the patient requires blue-light transfer to KCH for MRI (1.5 hours away) or if the patient requires overnight admission at MH and an MRI as soon as possible the next morning. If imaging at MH reveals CES, the patient is sent by blue-light transfer to KCH for surgery.

### Medical screening and evacuation: cauda equina syndrome in a combat zone [^05cfcd0e]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Resident's case problem.

Background

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare, potentially devastating, disorder and is considered a true neurologic emergency. CES often has a rapid clinical progression, making timely recognition and immediate surgical referral essential.

Diagnosis

A 32-year-old male presented to a medical aid station in Iraq with a history of 4 weeks of insidious onset and recent worsening of low back, left buttock, and posterior left thigh pain. He denied symptoms distal to the knee, paresthesias, saddle anesthesia, or bowel and bladder function changes. At the initial examination, the patient was neurologically intact throughout all lumbosacral levels with negative straight-leg raises. He also presented with severely limited lumbar flexion active range of motion, and reduction of symptoms occurred with repeated lumbar extension. At the follow-up visit, 10 days later, he reported a new, sudden onset of saddle anesthesia, constipation, and urinary hesitancy, with physical exam findings of right plantar flexion weakness, absent right ankle reflex, and decreased anal sphincter tone. No advanced medical imaging capabilities were available locally. Due to suspected CES, the patient was medically evacuated to a neurosurgeon and within 48 hours underwent an emergent L4-5 laminectomy/decompression. He returned to full military duty 18 weeks after surgery without back or lower extremity symptoms or neurological deficit.

Discussion

This case demonstrates the importance of continual medical screening for physical therapists throughout the patient management cycle. It further demonstrates the importance of immediate referral to surgical specialists when CES is suspected, as rapid intervention offers the best prognosis for recovery.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^100812ef]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) — history and physical examination guidance and red flags are outlined as follows. Conducting a history and physical examination is considered standard of care and a cornerstone of clinical decision making, and history and physical examination should include assessment of signs and symptoms of serious underlying pathology. Signs and symptoms of serious underlying pathology requiring additional diagnostic workup and prompt treatment are generally referred to as "red flags". For cauda equina syndrome or conus medullaris syndrome, red flags include urinary retention, urinary or fecal incontinence, saddle anesthesia, changes in rectal tone, and severe/progressive lower extremity neurologic deficits. Infection red flags include fever, immunosuppression, IV drug use, and recent infection, indwelling catheters (e.g., central line, Foley). Fracture risk red flags include history of osteoporosis, chronic use of corticosteroids, older age (≥ 75 years old), recent trauma, and younger patients at risk for stress fracture (e.g., overuse). Cancer red flags include history of cancer with new onset of LBP, unexplained weight loss, failure of LBP to improve after 1 month, age > 50 years, and multiple risk factors present.

### Non-compressive postoperative cauda equina syndrome following decompression and transforaminal interbody fusion surgery [^571e778f]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Postoperative cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a known rare complication following lumbar disc surgery. Seldom are they seen following decompression for spinal stenosis and may be actually more frequent and under-reported? Emergent surgical exploration remains the mainstay of management as the factors responsible for postop CES remains a variety of compressive forces. Yet many a time postoperative imaging or surgical exploration fails to identify a pathology and this leads to an ischaemic theory responsible for CES. Our article highlights conservative management in these selective group. We share our experience in two cases of incomplete CES during our routine transforaminal interbody fusion which we followed closely without re-exploration eventually ending in a favourable outcome. Key messages: The factors responsible for postop CES remains mostly a variety of compressive forces though in some instances postoperative imaging or surgical exploration fails to identify such in some cases. This leads to an ischaemic theory responsible for CES. The role of conservative management of postoperative CES in certain selective cases has a favourable outcome as illustrated in our cases.

### Expediting the management of cauda equina syndrome in the emergency department through clinical pathway design [^0e39eacf]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

This QIP successfully achieved its aim by reducing the time interval from presentation to the exclusion or diagnosis of CES by an average 2 hours and 59 min, a 36% reduction from baseline. Originally designed to be cost neutral, patients were less likely to breach the national 4 hours ED waiting time which resulted in cost saving for the hospital. The change has been fully integrated and sustained into practice in all three departments involved. Following the success of the project, the pathway has been rolled out to St. Mary's Hospital, our sister hospital within the Imperial National Health Service Healthcare Trust. Our hope is that other EDs will draw from our experience and the lessons we have learnt through this project.

### Outcomes reported after surgery for cauda equina syndrome: a systematic literature review [^75e3f3bd]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is mainly caused by compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots below the conus medullaris. Clinically, symptoms and signs include low-back pain, saddle anesthesia, unilateral or bilateral sciatica, and motor weakness of the lower extremities with bladder and bowel dysfunction. However, CES is a clinical-radiological diagnosis as clinical signs are not particularly sensitive to a CES diagnosis. A lumbo-sacral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is required for diagnosis. Gleave and McFarlanestressed the importance of categorizing CES into CES incomplete (CESI) and CES complete with urinary retention (CESR) (Figure 1). It is deemed a surgical emergency and there have been numerous publications and debates relating to the ideal timing for surgery. – It can result in permanent damage to nerve roots resulting in long lasting or permanent disabling symptoms.

Figure 1
Symptoms relating to CESI and CESR.

There is no consultation with patients in the literature regarding importance of outcomes for CES. In addition, there is little known about the long-term outcomes, which was highlighted by Korse et al, who independently decided to focus on outcomes of micturition, defecation, and sexual function. Bias in studies, lack of universal definitions, and incomplete follow-up data were seen in this systematic review.

The problems with not having a core outcome set (COS) includes:
(i) Patients are not included so important outcomes to them may not be measured. This has been witnessed in other healthcare areas such as childhood asthma and esophageal cancer. –
(ii) Lack of a consistent approach makes individual studies difficult to interpret and put into context of other studies.
(iii) Possibility for synthesizing evidence in a systematic review and meta-analysis are diminished.
(iv) Waste and inefficiency. It is reported that 85% of research funding is wasted across the research cycle with key sources related to outcomes; important outcomes are not assessed, published research fails to set its position when compared with all previous similar research and 50% of planned study outcomes are not reported.

Baseline measurement

The project started in September 2016 and assessed the baseline performance of the CXH ED in managing patients with suspected CES. Using electronic online medical records, data were retrospectively collected for a 3-month period (15 June–15 September 2016) for patients presenting to the CXH ED with back pain. Data were collected for the following variables: patient demographics, arrival time to the ED, presenting complaint, findings on the lower limb neurology examination performed by the ED physician and neurosurgical physician, time the MRI was requested, time the MRI took place, time of MRI report. Data were collected onto a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft 2011) spread sheet.

A total of 393 patients presented for evaluation of lower back pain. Patients in which CES was not the primary differential diagnosis or those transferred directly to the neurosurgery service directly from another hospital were excluded. Thirty patients were referred by their general practitioner (GP) or self-presented, underwent emergency MRI with the intent of diagnosing CES. Eleven were male, 19 were female and the average age was 47 years. The presence or absence of five objective findings documented in the lower limb neurology examination were reviewed: decreased lower limb power, reduced/absent lower limb sensation, decreased/absent deep tendon reflexes, decreased/absent perianal sensation and decreased/absent anal tone. Comparing the documentation of the examination findings between the ED and neurosurgery physicians, there was an 81% agreement between the two. All patients assessed by the ED were referred to neurosurgery (NS) for further management. The NS evaluation agreed in 85% of cases referred that CES was the most likely diagnosis. All but three ED physicians were senior house officers and all assessments made by the neurosurgery team were registrars.

The average time needed to exclude or diagnose CES, measured by the time interval between the patient's ED arrival and release of the MRI preliminary report, was 8 hours and 16 min. This was categorised into the three steps: 3 hours and 3 min between the patient presenting to the ED and MRI request, 3 hours and 37 min between the request and scan taking place and 1 hour and 36 min for the release the preliminary report (table 1). The average length of stay in the ED was 5 hours and 48 min. The UK's national 4 hours ED waiting time target was breached in 63% of cases.

### Improving the suspected cauda equina syndrome pathway at a district general hospital: a quality improvement project [^982ab59b]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a surgical emergency caused by acute compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots, requiring urgent surgical decompression. Delays in management can lead to permanent bowel and bladder incontinence, sexual dysfunction, lower limb paralysis and chronic pain.

The Getting it Right First Time (GIRFT) National CES Pathway 2023 mandates that patients with red flag symptoms require an 'emergency MRI as soon as possible, certainly within 4 hours of request'. However, an audit at Medway Hospital (MH) showed that despite achieving this target, patients still experience delays from emergency department (ED) attendance (time of arrival) to MRI scan (median 5.9 hours).

In response, MH launched a CES working group of orthopaedic surgeons, radiologists, emergency doctors and managers. Having identified time to MRI request as a major driver of delays, the team altered the GIRFT target to a SMART primary aim of 4 hours from ED presentation to MRI. Two key interventions were planned: (1) the translation of the GIRFT guidelines into a standard operating procedure (SOP), cotargeting a secondary outcome improvement of more accurately identifying those at risk of CES, thus reducing unnecessary MRIs for those that did not meet those guidelines and (2) the extension of MRI operational hours.

The new SOP was implemented across three plan-do-study-act cycles, but MRI operational hours were not extended. The primary outcome of reduction in time from ED presentation to MRI was not achieved (5.9 to 5.7 hours). Secondary aim improvements include a reduction of unnecessary MRIs (38% to 18%), CES MRI scans/day (0.5/day to 0.4/day), time to analgesia (5.3 to 4.2 hours) and incorrect referrals to the General Practitioner-led Medway on Call Care service (9% to 0%).

Suggestions for further improvements within district general hospitals include a 24-hour emergency MRI service and a standardised CES MRI request form.

### Improving the suspected cauda equina syndrome pathway at a district general hospital: a quality improvement project [^9f3952bc]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This project demonstrates learning from improving the care of patients with suspected CES at a DGH. This improvement effort centres on understanding the problem and context locally, and the implementation of the GIRFT national guidelines locally with multidisciplinary consensus, in combination with regular education and engagement to reduce the implementation gap. Next steps are to have a standardised CES MRI request form to reduce unnecessary MRIs, and 24-hour emergency MRI provision to improve time to MRI.

Delays in the investigation and treatment of patients with suspected CES may have life-changing consequences for patients and financial and service consequences for hospitals. The authors strongly believe that the best quality care is also the least expensive care. Due to rising litigation costs, there is a strong business case for pathway improvement, including the use of already operational MRI scanners at night for emergency MRIs. This has the potential to save the hospital money in the form of litigation premiums to NHS resolution.

This QIP continues with the aim of better improving the patient experience of CES.

### Outcomes reported after surgery for cauda equina syndrome: a systematic literature review [^9319a48b]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This systematic review shows that there is significant heterogeneity in the outcomes measured for patients who have undergone surgery for CES with no consensus.

Most of the evidence regarding outcomes for CES patients after surgery is derived from level 4 evidence, namely, single centre retrospective cohort review studies. The average data collection period was over 8 years with a median number of 14 patients per study, which highlights the rare nature of the condition and difficulty in collecting meaningful data retrospectively. This feeling is also echoed by Todd and Dickson, 2016. Since 1990, the number of publications analyzing outcomes after an operation for CES have increased with the most being produced in the last 5-year period (43.5%). Median follow up was at 31 months reflecting the deficiency in the literature for any long-term outcomes.

The main investigation is MRI, which reflects the systematic literature review focusing on studies from 1990 onwards. Before this there may have been a reliance on myelography and CT to radiologically identify CES compression. The main etiology is disc herniation. There are no studies in the literature documenting the exact distribution of CES aetiology but the most common cause is believed to be because of disc herniation.

Poor definition of CES has been previously highlighted in a systematic review of the literature. Twenty studies (32.8%) did not define this and of the 41 studies where a definition was present, there was significant heterogeneity in the definitions. The most common definition for CES in this review was CESI and CESR. If a study fails to define CES then we are unsure of the condition to which the outcomes of the study belong to.

Epidural approach selection for lumbar symptoms indicates that a patient without previous surgical intervention with unilateral, single, or 2 level involvement may be treated with transforaminal, caudal, or interlaminar approaches; however, bilateral or involvement of multiple segments will lead to either interlaminar or caudal epidural injections based on the upper or lower levels being involved, and in case of extensive stenosis or lack of response to caudal or interlaminar approaches, transforaminal epidural approach may be appropriate.

### Expediting the management of cauda equina syndrome in the emergency department through clinical pathway design [^bb198281]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

As with all change, there were limitations encountered. A slow staff engagement was the biggest barrier at the start. To overcome this, multiple discussions were held with nurses, senior house officers, registrars and consultants during working hours to reiterate the importance of the pathway for patient care and encourage its use. If we could repeat this QIP, we would increase the time interval between designing the pathway and implementing it to allow for more education and awareness of the pathway prior to launching it. We learnt that for a pathway to be utilised, it must be readily visible and available. Feedback highlighted that using the ED website and initial teaching was not sufficient in raising awareness. Consequently, our second PDSA cycle was focused around promoting the pathway through a variety of other methods previously described.

Although our QIP did result in a reduction in the time needed to diagnose CES in the ED, we did not evaluate whether this translated to better patient outcomes from earlier surgical decompression surgery. The decision to proceed with emergency surgery overnight versus waiting until the morning, where more senior staff members are present, was beyond the scope of this project. Despite the SBNS recommending immediate surgery, some professional opinions have suggested that as long as surgery is performed within 48 hours of symptom onset, delaying surgery until the morning may be a safer alternative. As emergency physicians, the decision to proceed with surgery overnight is outside the limit of our practice. Equally, the neurosurgery team did not want this decision incorporated into the pathway, as it was dependent on multiple patient, physician and staffing factors. As CES is a condition where delaying surgery certainly does not improve outcomes, we believe a reduction in the time of diagnosis is an improvement in the care delivered to our patients. It gives the neurosurgeons the best possible tools to make a definitive treatment decision.

### The clinical features and outcome of scan-negative and scan-positive cases in suspected cauda equina syndrome: a retrospective study of 276 patients [^0923231e]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a devastating medical emergency caused by compression of the cauda equina nerve roots which without timely surgery results in bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction with potential lower limb weakness and numbness. Diagnosis is based on the clinical picture and MRI findings of cauda equina nerve root compression ('scan-positive' CES). However, at least half of all patients presenting with the acute clinical CES phenotype (acute bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction, saddle anaesthesia and pain) have no radiological correlate, so-called 'scan-negative' CES. A systematic review of the correlation between history, physical examination and MRI scan result found that the mean prevalence of patients having both clinical and radiological evidence of CES was 14–48% with no single individual sign or symptom being helpful in diagnosing CES; senior neurosurgical trainees asked to predict who would have a positive scan based on history and clinical findings had an accuracy of only 56%.

There has been little descriptive study of the 'scan-negative' CES group but a better understanding of their presentation may aid clinical differentiation and management. Based on our clinical experience and an initial pilot study of 18 patients from a different centre which demonstrated Hoover's sign of functional leg weakness in 82% of patients with 'scan-negative' CES and 0% of patients with 'scan-positive' CES, we hypothesised that some patients with 'scan-negative' CES would have evidence of a functional disorder and this may explain at least some of their clinical presentation. By a functional disorder we mean a disorder which is genuine but which is due to an abnormality of nervous system functioning rather than of structure. Functional neurological disorders describe symptoms of abnormal motor and sensory function such as limb weakness or numbness, but does not include chronic pain, even when that is unrelated to a structural cause. Common examples of functional disorders are irritable bowel syndrome and functional neurological disorders. We investigated the radiological findings, demographics, clinical features, comorbidity and outcomes of a retrospective consecutive series of patients referred to a tertiary neurosurgery centre with suspected clinical cauda equina syndrome. Our aims were to better phenotype patients with 'scan-negative' CES, to test our hypothesis that at least some patients had evidence of a functional disorder and to generate hypotheses about how functional disorders, medication, pain with or without nerve root compression may interact to explain the bladder symptoms that cause patients to present acutely with 'scan-negative' CES.

### Improving the suspected cauda equina syndrome pathway at a district general hospital: a quality improvement project [^eaa7f3d4]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Design

Three PDSA cycles were planned to achieve primary and secondary aims within a year, applying a number of quality improvement tools to support this process.

Following the baseline data review, our working group embarked on a qualitative thematic analysis of patient and staff experience, process mapping, root cause analysis and a driver diagram to develop a comprehensive understanding of the reasons for delay in time from attendance to MRI.

Five healthcare providers and six patients with lived experience of CES were interviewed by three medical students using a semistructured format. For healthcare professionals, the initial questions asked were as follows: (1) what is the current CES pathway, (2) what is your experience of using this pathway, (3) do you have any frustrations with the pathway and (4) how could the pathway be improved. For patients the initial questions asked were as follows: (1) how did you acquire your injury, (2) how did you present to the ED, (3) what treatment did you receive and (4) how is your recovery so far.

Interviews were then transcribed and independently coded by the three medical students. Codes were then compared, and where discrepancies existed, consensus codes and themes were identified.

The key themes derived from the thematic analysis were as follows: among healthcare providers: (a) medical professionals often misunderstood CES, (b) there was uncertainty between ED and orthopaedics as to who was responsible for the patient, (c) there was widespread frustration at the lack of out-of-hours MRI, with the scanners only operational from 8:00 to 20:00 hours. Among patients: (a) they experienced poor communication, (b) had difficulties in accessing care and (c) had to wait a long time to receive pain relief in the ED.

Following the root cause analysis (online supplemental figure 1) and driver diagram (figure 1), we identified a number of key barriers we divided into ED pathway challenges (such as variation in triage, missed red flags, delays to MRI request) and MRI challenges (variation in MRI sequence, vetting, MRI workload and lack of out of hours service). In addition to these, we recognised persistent bottlenecks external to this specific pathway, including variable and climbing ED waiting times, staffing and bed pressures.

### Improving the suspected cauda equina syndrome pathway at a district general hospital: a quality improvement project [^1584cccd]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

An audit at MH in 2022 showed that despite routinely achieving this target (median time from MRI request to MRI 1.7 hours (IQR 1.1–3.7)), patients still experience long delays in the overall journey from ED attendance (time of arrival) to MRI scan (median 5.9 hours (IQR 4.9–14.7)).

In response to this unwarranted variation and national guidance to be implemented, MH launched a CES working group of consultant orthopaedic surgeons, radiologists, radiographers, emergency doctors, the hospital transformation team and medical students, with input from nursing staff, community physiotherapists, the tertiary neurosurgical centre and executive management. The team recognised that while the GIRFT target was being met, this was often due to delayed requesting of MRI, and so the overall time from attendance to MRI was a more valid representation of risk to patient safety, clinical outcome, litigation risk and pressures on hospital beds and services.

Based on this, the primary SMART aim for this project was to reduce time from ED attendance to MRI to a median of less than 4 hours within 1 year.

Secondary SMART aims were established following the PDSA (plan-do-study-act) cycle 1 supported by patient and staff interviews, process mapping, driver diagrams and root cause analysis. These secondary aims were felt to address some of the root causes of delays from ED attendance to MRI, including misidentifying those at risk of CES leading to inappropriate MRI referrals and improve the patient experience.

The secondary SMART aims were to reduce unnecessary emergency MRI scans by 10%, standardise MRI sequences, reduce time from attendance to analgesia by 10% and eliminate inappropriate referrals from ED triage to the GP-led assessment service to 0%, within a year.

Curiously, there seems to be discord developing between approaches to the assessment and management of patients, depending on whether they present with an extremity or spinal disorder. This viewpoint will comment on examples of differences emerging in some current practices. The aim is not to present a scientific treatise about underpinning sciences and evidence-based practice or to comment on what is correct or incorrect. Rather, the aim is to stimulate thought on the seeming discord in clinical practice, with respect to both the clinical evaluation of, as well as management approaches to, extremity and spinal disorders.

### Expediting the management of cauda equina syndrome in the emergency department through clinical pathway design [^f022829e]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a neurosurgical emergency. Early diagnosis with MRI and subsequent surgical decompression surgery can prevent permanent neurological dysfunction. Charing Cross Hospital (CXH) is a tertiary neurosurgical referral centre where in the emergency department (ED), current practice mandated a neurosurgery review prior to requesting MRI.

Hypothesis

It was hypothesised that a new clinical pathway, with better coordination from the ED, radiology and neurosurgical teams could reduce the time of presentation to diagnosis or exclusion of CES.

Method

Retrospective case-note analysis of patients presenting with back pain to CXH ED over a 3-month period was performed. The primary outcome was the time interval between the patient's arrival to the ED and the MRI preliminary report.

Results

The baseline primary outcome was recorded at 8 hours and 16 min (n = 30). A new clinical pathway was designed empowering ED senior decision makers to order MRIs prior to neurosurgical review. Two Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles were performed, each measured over a 2-month period. The first PDSA cycle was performed after the pathway was initially launched (n = 17), while the second PDSA cycle measured the effect of staff education and active promotion of the pathway (n = 17). MRI was requested earlier, waiting and reporting time for MRI were reduced. The exclusion or diagnosis of CES was reduced to 5 hours and 54 min in PDSA 1 and 5 hours 17 min in PDSA 2, a 29% and 36% reduction (p = 0.048 and p = 0.012, respectively).

Conclusion

The clinical protocol was a cost-neutral and sustainable intervention that effectively reduced the time taken to diagnose or exclude CES and ED waiting times.

### A prospective study of the role of bladder scanning and post-void residual volume measurement in improving diagnostic accuracy of cauda equina syndrome [^16e838ef]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome (CES) remains difficult; clinical assessment has low accuracy in reliably predicting MRI compression of the cauda equina (CE). This prospective study tests the usefulness of ultrasound bladder scans as an adjunct for diagnosing CES.

Methods

A total of 260 patients with suspected CES were referred to a tertiary spinal unit over a 16-month period. All were assessed by Board-eligible spinal surgeons and had transabdominal ultrasound bladder scans for pre- and post-voiding residual (PVR) volume measurements before lumbosacral MRI.

Results

The study confirms the low predictive value of 'red flag' symptoms and signs. Of note 'bilateral sciatica' had a sensitivity of 32.4%, and a positive predictive value (PPV) of only 17.2%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 88.3%. Use of a PVR volume of ≥ 200 mL was a demonstrably more accurate test for predicting cauda equina compression on subsequent MRI (p < 0.001). The PVR sensitivity was 94.1%, specificity 66.8%, PPV 29.9% and NPV 98.7%. The PVR allowed risk-stratification with 13% patients deemed 'low-risk' of CES. They had non-urgent MRI scans. None of the latter scans showed any cauda equina compression (p < 0.006) or individuals developed subsequent CES in the intervening period. There were considerable cost-savings associated with the above strategy.

Conclusion

This is the largest reported prospective evaluation of suspected CES. Use of the PVR volume ≥ 200 mL was considerably more accurate in predicting CES. It is a useful adjunct to conventional clinical assessment and allows risk-stratification in managing suspected CES. If adopted widely it is less likely incomplete CES would be missed.

### Utility of electrodiagnostic testing in evaluating patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy: an evidence-based review [^cbba1ecd]. Muscle & Nerve (2010). Medium credibility.

Lumbosacral radiculopathy — recommendations for future research specify that the study design should be a prospective cohort survey; the cohort should include a wide spectrum of patients with alternative diagnoses, allowing the EDX to independently assess and determine the presence of radiculopathy; a consensus-based reference standard (gold standard) of lumbosacral radiculopathy must be developed for research purposes; all patients enrolled should complete the EDX with the presence of radiculopathy measured and the level and side documented; an investigator who is unaware of the EDX results should determine the final diagnosis; and studies may be performed to assess the utility of EDX in combination with or in isolation from alternative diagnostic studies and the sequence of studies and study combinations that provide the highest yield for identifying lumbosacral radiculopathies.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^1e114e3d]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Invasive clinical treatment recommendations overview — quality evidence indicates that patient outcomes are not adversely affected by delaying non-emergent surgery for weeks or a few months; in the absence of red flags, patients with radicular pain and other potential surgical conditions are treated with non-invasive treatments for typically at least 4 to 6 weeks. Patients with moderate to severe neurological deficits that are not improving or not trending to improvement at 4 to 6 weeks may benefit from earlier surgical intervention; those with progressive neurological deficit(s) are believed to have indications for immediate surgery, and those with severe deficits that do not rapidly improve are also candidates for earlier testing and surgery.

### Doing more with less: diagnostic accuracy of CT in suspected cauda equina syndrome [^75fcb66f]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Cauda equina syndrome typically requires emergent MR imaging to detect compressive lesions on the cauda equina, which may require surgical decompression. While CT is sometimes performed as a complementary imaging technique to evaluate osseous integrity in patients with cauda equina syndrome, the accuracy of CT in detecting significant spinal stenosis and cauda equina impingement is not well-defined in the literature. We hypothesized that percentage thecal sac effacement on CT of the lumbar spine would have high sensitivity and high negative predictive value in evaluating significant spinal stenosis and cauda equina impingement.

Materials and Methods

We analyzed imaging studies for 151 consecutive patients with clinically suspected cauda equina syndrome. The percentage thecal sac effacement (< 50%, ≥ 50%) was determined on CT and MR imaging. The presence or absence of cauda equina impingement was determined on MR imaging. Using MR imaging as the reference standard, we performed statistical analysis to determine the accuracy of CT in predicting significant spinal stenosis (percentage thecal sac effacement, ≥ 50%) and cauda equina impingement.

Results

Forty of 151 patients had a percentage thecal sac effacement of ≥ 50% on MR imaging. Nineteen of 40 had cauda equina impingement. Readers determined that there was a CT percentage thecal sac effacement of < 50% in 97/151 cases, and CT percentage thecal sac effacement of ≥ 50% in 54/151 cases. Reader sensitivity for the detection of significant spinal stenosis (MR percentage thecal sac effacement of ≥ 50%) was 0.98; specificity, 0.86; positive predictive value, 0.72; and negative predictive value, 0.99. No cases read as CT percentage thecal sac effacement of < 50% were found to have cauda equina impingement.

Conclusions

CT percentage thecal sac effacement of ≥ 50% predicts significant spinal stenosis on MR imaging in patients with clinically suspected cauda equina syndrome. CT percentage thecal sac effacement of < 50% appears to reliably rule out cauda equina impingement. This imaging marker may serve as an additional tool for the clinician in deciding whether MR imaging can be deferred.

### Utility of electrodiagnostic testing in evaluating patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy: an evidence-based review [^f254d15e]. Muscle & Nerve (2010). Medium credibility.

Lumbosacral radiculopathy — evidence limitations are noted: the available evidence is limited by the lack of a universally accepted case definition of lumbosacral radiculopathy; none of the studies presented methodological data in adequate detail to allow unbiased comparison of an objective reference standard to the electrodiagnostic (EDX) diagnosis; with the exception of one study a narrow spectrum of patients were used; EDX testing is often applied as part of an evaluation that also includes clinical history, physical examination, and imaging study; it would be useful to determine the independent contribution of EDX to the diagnosis; the studies reviewed did not address the optimal combination or sequence of testing; and none of the reviewed studies addressed the utility of EDX in prognostic outcome or response to treatments.
