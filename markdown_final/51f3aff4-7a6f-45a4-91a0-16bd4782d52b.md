## Question

What's next in a 75 yo male with direct bilirubin of 10 and AST ALT over 150 but under 200 in both cases, and a US just with stones.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the next diagnostic steps should be for a 75-year-old man with direct hyperbilirubinemia and elevated transaminases, with suspected choledocholithiasis and an ultrasound that shows only gallstones. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the laboratory pattern and what it implies pathophysiologically. Then, I should verify the imaging findings and their limitations. Next, I will risk-stratify for choledocholithiasis using validated criteria. After that, I need to choose the optimal second-line test and justify it against alternatives. Finally, I will outline management pathways based on likely findings and close with a concise recommendation and rationale [^116JpZ4J] [^115REwkA].

> Let me first confirm the laboratory pattern: a direct bilirubin of 10 mg/dL with AST and ALT in the 150–200 IU/L range in a 75-year-old strongly suggests cholestasis from extrahepatic obstruction rather than isolated hepatocellular injury, and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia generally implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction, which fits choledocholithiasis here given the gallstones on ultrasound [^114Kk3U6] [^113iG5vj] [^113EquiN].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging interpretation before I jump ahead: ultrasound showing gallstones without documented ductal dilation or visualized CBD stones lowers the immediate certainty of choledocholithiasis, but it does not exclude it because transabdominal ultrasound has limited sensitivity for small CBD stones and operator dependence is common, so a negative ultrasound cannot reliably rule out obstruction in this biochemical context [^1147c4rs] [^115REwkA].

> Next, I should review risk stratification using guideline-based criteria; I initially thought the combination of age over 55, abnormal liver tests, and a direct bilirubin of 10 mg/dL might place him at high risk, but hold on, I should verify the exact thresholds: the ASGE high-risk criteria require either a stone on imaging, cholangitis, or total bilirubin greater than 4 mg/dL plus CBD dilation, so with a direct bilirubin of 10 mg/dL I need to check the total bilirubin and the CBD diameter to confirm high-risk status, and if total bilirubin is under 4 mg/dL or the duct is not dilated, he would be intermediate risk pending those measurements [^116JpZ4J] [^111PNYtJ] [^111iiPZD].

> I need to ensure I am not over-relying on liver tests alone; guidelines emphasize that abnormal LFTs or bilirubin are insufficient to diagnose choledocholithiasis without further testing, particularly in older adults or acute cholecystitis, so I should confirm the total bilirubin and CBD diameter and then proceed to a second-line test rather than directly to ERCP unless high-risk criteria are met [^114xrDEe] [^112RxuPA] [^1145pfY5].

> Let me consider the optimal second-line modality; EUS and MRCP are both acceptable, but I should double-check comparative performance: EUS has higher sensitivity for small stones and allows same-session ERCP if positive, whereas MRCP is noninvasive with excellent accuracy but may miss very small stones; given his age and the need to avoid unnecessary ERCP, EUS is preferred if available, with MRCP as an alternative if EUS is not accessible or if patient preference and local expertise favor it [^115REwkA] [^1147c4rs] [^116JpZ4J].

> Hold on, I should verify the downstream management contingent on results: if EUS/MRCP confirms a CBD stone, ERCP with stone extraction is indicated; if negative, cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis can proceed without preoperative ductal intervention, ideally with intraoperative cholangiography or laparoscopic ultrasound to mitigate missed stones; in intermediate-risk patients, a cholecystectomy-first strategy with intraoperative cholangiography can shorten length of stay without increasing morbidity compared with routine preoperative ductal evaluation, though local expertise should guide the choice between preoperative EUS/MRCP and intraoperative imaging [^116Pd9YF] [^115q7ugu] [^116yRz7a].

> But wait, what if the total bilirubin is indeed above 4 mg/dL and the CBD is dilated on repeat imaging; in that case, I should correct my earlier hesitation and classify him as high risk, which would justify proceeding directly to ERCP for diagnosis and therapy rather than EUS/MRCP first, to avoid delay in definitive management of likely choledocholithiasis [^116JpZ4J] [^111PNYtJ] [^116Pd9YF].

> I should also confirm that we are not missing alternative causes of direct hyperbilirubinemia; however, the presence of gallstones, the pattern of cholestatic injury, and the absence of features suggesting autoimmune cholangiopathies or infiltrative disease make choledocholithiasis the leading diagnosis, and the immediate next step remains focused biliary imaging with EUS or MRCP rather than broad serologic testing at this time [^114Kk3U6] [^113EquiN].

> Final recommendation: I need to check the total bilirubin and obtain a repeat right upper quadrant ultrasound with CBD measurement; if total bilirubin is greater than 4 mg/dL and the CBD is dilated, proceed directly to ERCP; otherwise, given intermediate risk, obtain EUS as the preferred second-line test, with MRCP as an alternative if EUS is unavailable, and then manage based on confirmation or exclusion of CBD stones as outlined above [^116JpZ4J] [^115REwkA] [^1147c4rs].

---

The next step is to **order MRCP or EUS** to confirm suspected choledocholithiasis, as ultrasound alone is insufficient to detect small CBD stones [^115REwkA] [^1147c4rs]. If MRCP/EUS confirms stones, proceed to **ERCP with stone extraction**; if negative but clinical suspicion remains high, consider ERCP anyway [^116Pd9YF]. Concurrently, **admit the patient**, start IV fluids, and monitor for cholangitis or pancreatitis. Do not rely on LFTs or bilirubin alone to diagnose CBD stones [^114xrDEe] [^112RxuPA].

---

## Immediate diagnostic steps

### Confirm choledocholithiasis with advanced imaging

- **MRCP**: Non-invasive, high sensitivity (~90–100%) and specificity (~85–100%) for CBD stones; preferred first-line advanced imaging [^1147c4rs].
- **EUS**: Alternative to MRCP with similar accuracy; useful if MRCP is contraindicated or unavailable [^115REwkA] [^116JpZ4J].
- **CT cholangiography**: Consider if MRCP/EUS are unavailable or contraindicated.

---

### Laboratory evaluation

- **Fractionate bilirubin**: Confirm direct hyperbilirubinemia and exclude hemolysis or Gilbert syndrome [^113iG5vj].
- **ALP, GGT**: Assess cholestasis; elevated levels support biliary obstruction [^114k6r3r].
- **CBC, INR, creatinine**: Evaluate for infection, coagulopathy, and renal function [^notfound].

---

## Clinical risk assessment

Use **ASGE risk stratification** to guide management: high-risk features (CBD stone on imaging, total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL with dilated CBD, or cholangitis) warrant direct ERCP; intermediate-risk features (abnormal LFTs, age > 55, dilated CBD) warrant MRCP or EUS before ERCP [^116JpZ4J] [^111PNYtJ].

---

## Management plan

### If choledocholithiasis is confirmed

- **ERCP**: Diagnostic and therapeutic gold standard for stone extraction [^115uRB9S].
- **Antibiotics**: Start empiric coverage if cholangitis is suspected.
- **Cholecystectomy**: Plan after ERCP to prevent recurrence [^notfound].

---

### If choledocholithiasis is excluded

If choledocholithiasis is excluded, **evaluate for alternative causes** — such as hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, or malignancy — using serologies, CT/MRI, and consider liver biopsy if the diagnosis remains unclear [^1155asMt] [^113iKdyp]. Proceed to **cholecystectomy** for symptomatic gallstones to prevent future complications [^116JpZ4J].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **serial LFTs** to track bilirubin and transaminases, and surveillance for **complications** such as cholangitis, pancreatitis, and biliary strictures [^112LzhZW].

---

## Summary of recommended next steps

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Fractionate bilirubin and confirm direct hyperbilirubinemia |
| 2 | Order MRCP or EUS to confirm choledocholithiasis |
| 3 | If confirmed, proceed to ERCP with stone extraction |
| 4 | If excluded, evaluate alternative causes of jaundice |
| 5 | Plan cholecystectomy to prevent recurrence |

---

The next step is to **confirm choledocholithiasis with MRCP or EUS**, then proceed to ERCP if confirmed; if excluded, evaluate other causes of jaundice and plan cholecystectomy.

Suspected choledocholithiasis — initial investigations and imaging accuracy — For all patients with suspected choledocholithiasis, obtaining liver transaminases, bilirubin and a transabdominal ultrasound are recommended as preliminary investigations, and ultrasound findings consistent with choledocholithiasis include visualization of a common bile duct stone and a dilated common bile duct greater than 8-mm; the combination of clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings should be considered when deciding on management. If diagnosis remains in question, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive option with a sensitivity of > 90% and specificity nearing 100%, though common bile duct stones identified require intervention by another method to be removed; endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has average sensitivity and specificity approximately 95% and 97%, respectively.

### Marked elevation in serum transaminases: an atypical presentation of choledocholithiasis [^1177apKg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Choledocholithiasis causes elevations in levels of alkaline phosphatase out of proportion to aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Isolated marked elevation in AST and ALT levels over 1,000 IU/L has been reported infrequently in patients with choledocholithiasis.

Methods

The charts of 18 patients who presented between 1971 and 2002 with documented choledocholithiasis and AST or ALT levels greater than 1,000 IU/L were retrospectively reviewed. An extensive work-up for coexisting disease processes to account for the abnormal AST and ALT levels was negative.

Results

Eighteen patients (16 women, 16 Hispanics, age 38 ± 3 yr) presented with symptoms of choledocholithiasis and marked transaminase elevation. Peak levels of AST and ALT were 1,062 ± 129 and 1,119 ± 90, respectively. Following successful management of gallstone disease, AST and ALT levels fell rapidly to 129 ± 22 and 268 ± 61, respectively, within 3–14 days. There was also a concomitant improvement in the levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.

Conclusions

In the absence of other hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease, choledocholithiasis can result in elevations in AST and/or ALT greater than 1,000 IU/L. These levels fall markedly once the gallstone disease is appropriately managed.

### Practical recommendations for the prediction and management of common bile duct stones in patients with gallstones [^114wjmFM]. Surgical Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 10% of patients with symptomatic gallstones may have associated common bile duct stones (CBDS). However, the predictive value of noninvasive tests as well as the preoperative diagnosis and management of CBDS have not been well defined. The aim of this study was to define an accurate and simple model for the prediction and management of CBDS.

Methods

A prospective database containing 986 cholecystectomies performed from 1994 through 1999 was evaluated. Univariate analysis using the Pearson chi-square test was performed to determine the factors significantly related to the presence of CBDS. Then logistic regression analysis was performed for multivariate analysis to discover independent predictors.

Results

Of the 986 patients in this study, 48 (5%) had CBDS. Of the 48 patients with choledocholithiasis, 22 (46%) were men and 26 (54%) were women. The mean age was 55.3 years (range, 16–87 years). As a result of multivariate analysis, abdominal ultrasonographic findings suggestive of CBDS (common bile duct diameter exceeding 8 mm or visible stones), total bilirubin, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase levels above normal were the independent predictors of CBDS in patients age 70 or younger. On the other hand, an elevated bilirubin level was found to be the single independent factor related to CBDS in the elderly.

Conclusions

For patients with gallstones, suggestive ultrasonographic findings in those younger than 71 years and elevated direct or total bilirubin level in those older than 70 years are the most valuable and practical predictors of CBDS, and thus are the proper indications for preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography.

### Jaundice in the adult patient [^116MrcMJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice in an adult patient can be caused by a wide variety of benign or life-threatening disorders. Organizing the differential diagnosis by prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic causes may help make the work-up more manageable. Prehepatic causes of jaundice include hemolysis and hematoma resorption, which lead to elevated levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. Intrahepatic disorders can lead to unconjugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The conjugated (direct) bilirubin level is often elevated by alcohol, infectious hepatitis, drug reactions, and autoimmune disorders. Posthepatic disorders also can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gallstone formation is the most common and benign posthepatic process that causes jaundice; however, the differential diagnosis also includes serious conditions such as biliary tract infection, pancreatitis, and malignancies. The laboratory work-up should begin with a urine test for bilirubin, which indicates that conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is present. If the complete blood count and initial tests for liver function and infectious hepatitis are unrevealing, the work-up typically proceeds to abdominal imaging by ultrasonography or computed tomographic scanning. In a few instances, more invasive procedures such as cholangiography or liver biopsy may be needed to arrive at a diagnosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Kk3U6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

Question 5: Associated biliary tree stones: when to suspect, how to investigate when there is a high index of suspicion, when to treat, and which treatment?

Common bile duct stones occur in about 5–10% of patients with ACC. The strategy of non-selective preoperative endoscopic ultrasound or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, or the routine use of intraoperative cholangiography may not be appropriate options to manage these patients.

Extensive research for specific suggestion for associated biliary tree stone in case of ACC in elderly patients has been done. There is no evidence for any difference in the likelihood or diagnostic accuracy of different investigations in elderly patients compared to general population, to warrant a change in the recommendations for elderly patients.

Statement 5.1: Even in elderly patients, elevation of liver biochemical enzymes and/or bilirubin levels is not sufficient to identify ACC patients with choledocholithiasis and further diagnostic tests are needed. (LoE 3 GoR C)

As reported in the 2016 WSES guidelines for ACC, the normal liver biochemical tests have a negative predictive value of 97%, whereas the positive predictive value of any abnormal liver biochemical test result is only 15%. Positive predictive value of liver function studies is a poor tool for prediction of common bile duct stones, even in non-ACC, with results ranging from 25 to 50%.

The routine use of biochemical test should be used for the suspicion of common bile duct stones with the abovementioned limitations.

Statement 5.2: Even in elderly patients, the visualization of common bile duct stones on abdominal ultrasound is a very strong predictor of choledocholithiasis (LoE 5 GoR D). Even in elderly patients, indirect signs of stone presence such as increased diameter of common bile duct are not sufficient to identify ACC patients with choledocholithiasis and further diagnostic tests are needed. (LoE 2 GoR B)

### A cholestatic diagnostic dilemma [^113mH35x]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old man with hereditary spherocytosis presented with abdominal pain and jaundice. He had severe, mainly conjugated (642 μmol/l), hyperbilirubinaemia (1033 μmol/l), with elevated liver enzymes: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (163 IU/l), γ-glutamyltransferase (gGT) (277 IU/l) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (358 IU/l). Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed gallstones in the gallbladder but an absence of biliary duct dilation. Liver biopsy was consistent with cholestasis but showed no large duct obstruction. The cause of the cholestasis was unclear, was it a primary intrahepatic pathology or secondary to a posthepatic cause? He presented with similar symptoms days later with gallstones in the bile duct (choledocholithiasis) and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and cholecystectomy. This report guides one through the assessment of jaundice and serves as an example whereby the diagnosis of a common cause of illness is blurred by an atypical clinical presentation and relevant comorbidities. A diagnosis of benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is also considered.

### Severe elevation of liver tests in choledocholithiasis: an uncommon occurrence with important clinical implications [^1143Kinu]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Choledocholithiasis is not commonly associated with dramatic elevations in aminotransferase or total serum bilirubin. Ours is the largest case series thus far studying the prevalence of dramatic elevations in liver tests associated with choledocholithiasis.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with choledocholithiasis diagnosed on endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiogram at a tertiary referral hospital over 7 years. We identified 740 patients with available liver tests and determined the prevalence of aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 1000 IU/L and of total serum bilirubin > 10 mg/dL. We compared clinical characteristics of these 2 nonoverlapping groups.

Results

Of 740 patients, AST and/or ALT values > 1000 IU/L were present in 45 (6.1%) patients. On average AST and ALT decreased 79% and 56%, respectively, at discharge 1 to 8 days later. Total serum bilirubin levels > 10 mg/dL were present in 35 (4.7%) patients and decreased by an average of 64% at discharge 1 to 8 days later. When compared with the group with total serum bilirubin > 10 mg/dL, the group with elevated aminotransferases had significantly more females (93% vs. 43%, P < 0.001), had smaller common bile duct diameter (8.5 vs. 10.6 mm, P = 0.04), and were more likely to have had a prior cholecystectomy (40% vs. 14%, P = 0.01). These 80 patients had higher utilization of health resources: half had additional laboratory studies and one fourth had additional imaging studies performed.

Conclusions

In patients with high AST and/or ALT and serum total bilirubin levels with known choledocholithiasis, elaborate work up to look for another etiology is not required. As long as the values decrease significantly, they do not need to be followed until they normalize in the same hospitalization.

5.4 Liver Test Elevations

In the Phase III trial, 5% of patients had an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the entire clinical development program of SIGNIFOR, there were 4 cases of concurrent elevations in ALT greater than 3 x ULN and bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN: one patient with Cushing's disease and 3 healthy volunteers [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In these cases, total bilirubin elevations were seen either concomitantly or preceding the transaminase elevation.

Monitoring of liver tests should be done after 1- to 2 weeks on treatment, then monthly for 3 months, and every 6 months thereafter. If ALT is normal at baseline and elevations of ALT of 3–5 times the ULN are observed on treatment, repeat the test within a week or within 48 hours if exceeding 5 times ULN. If ALT is abnormal at baseline and elevations of ALT of 3 to 5 times the baseline values are observed on treatment, repeat the test within a week or sooner if exceeding 5 times ULN. Tests should be done in a laboratory that can provide same-day results. If the values are confirmed or rising, interrupt SIGNIFOR treatment and investigate for probable cause of the findings, which may or may not be SIGNIFOR-related. Serial measures of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, should be done weekly, or more frequently, if any value exceeds 5 times the baseline value in case of abnormal baselines, or 5 times the ULN in case of normal baselines. If resolution of abnormalities to normal or near normal occurs, resuming treatment with SIGNIFOR may be done cautiously, with close observation, and only if some other likely cause has been found.

5.5 Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis

Cholelithiasis has been frequently reported in clinical studies with SIGNIFOR [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. There have been postmarketing reports of cholelithiasis (gallstones) resulting in complications, including cholecystitis or cholangitis and requiring cholecystectomy in patients taking SIGNIFOR. Ultrasonic examination of the gallbladder before, and periodically during SIGNIFOR therapy is recommended. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue SIGNIFOR and treat appropriately.

We suggest that patients with other criteria such as abnormal liver tests, age > 55 years, and dilated common bile duct on US (intermediate risk for choledocholithiasis) undergo EUS, MRCP, or laparoscopic IOC or laparoscopic intraoperative US for further evaluation. The 2010 ASGE Guideline proposed risk categories as high [> 50%], intermediate [10%-50%], and low [< 10%].

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116yRz7a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons combined the published validated clinical scores and proposed a risk stratification of CBDS in three different classes, defined as follows: low risk (< 10%), moderate risk (10 to 50%) and high risk (> 50%) of CBDS (see Table 2). This proposed classification has clear clinical implications: patients with a low risk of CBDS should be operated on without further investigation; patients with moderate risk should be evaluated with a second-level examination, either preoperatively with endoscopic US (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or intraoperatively with laparoscopic US (LUS) or IOC, in order to select patients who need stone removal; finally, according to local expertise, laparoscopic transcystic CBD exploration is a valuable option. Patients with high risk of CBDS should undergo preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP. See Fig. 1 for the flowchart of management of ACC.

Table 2
Risk factors and classification of risk for CBDS (modified from Maple et al. 2010)

What is the best tool to stratify the risk for CBDS in patients with ACC?

2.5 We suggest stratifying the risk of CBDS according to the proposed classification modified from the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeon Guidelines. #QoE: very low; SoR: weak#

ASGE guidelines remains a valuable tool for the diagnosis and the management of CBDS in patients with ACC. According to their classification, high-risk patients have a probability of having CBDS exceeding 50%, which in turn means that up to 49% of patients undergoing ERCP will not have evidence of CBDS and, given the potential complications of ERCP, this may not be considered acceptable. For this reason, we would recommend more cautious approach: only patients with evidence of CBDS at abdominal US should be considered at high risk of CBDS and should undergo diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP directly; patients with total serum bilirubin > 4 mg/dl or enlarged common bile duct diameter at US with concomitant bilirubin level 1.8 to 4 mg/dl should be considered as moderate risk and should undergo second level investigation such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) or IOC, in order to avoid the complications related to ERCP. See Table 2 for the modified risk stratification.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^116JpZ4J]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

ASGE guideline — risk stratification to prompt ERCP specifies that in order to minimize the risk of diagnostic ERCP, we suggest the following HIGH-RISK criteria to directly prompt ERCP for suspected choledocholithiasis: (1) common bile duct (CBD) stone on ultrasound or cross-sectional imaging or (2) total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL AND dilated common bile duct on imaging (> 6 mm with gallbladder in situ) or (3) ascending cholangitis. In patients with INTERMEDIATE-RISK criteria of abnormal liver tests or age > 55 years or dilated CBD on ultrasound, we suggest EUS, MRCP, laparoscopic intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), or laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound for further evaluation. For patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis without any of these risk factors, we suggest cholecystectomy without IOC.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^115REwkA]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Choledocholithiasis pre-test probability — clinical and imaging predictors are as follows: On abdominal ultrasound, visualization of a common bile duct stone carries approximately a 73% sensitivity and 91% specificity. Strong predictors include clinical evidence of acute cholangitis, a bilirubin greater than 1.7 mg/dL and a dilated common bile duct (CBD), and the presence of two or more of these factors has a pre-test probability of 50%-94% for choledocholithiasis (considered high). Patients without evidence of jaundice and a normal bile duct on ultrasound have a low probability of choledocholithiasis (< 5%), and patients that fall between these two spectrums are categorized as having an intermediate probability of choledocholithiasis. Meta-analyses have found an observed superiority in the sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) as compared to magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) due to better accuracy for small stones, and EUS-directed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been advocated as a cost-effective method since both EUS and ERCP could be performed in the same session; the algorithm presented in Fig. 1 may be helpful for managing patients with suspected choledocholithiasis dependent on their risk stratification.

### How often are liver function tests normal in acute biliary pancreatitis? [^117VVopF]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The biochemical markers of a biliary etiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) include an ALT elevation of more than 3 times the upper range of normal (ULN) and a serum total bilirubin greater than 3 mg%.

Objectives

To analyze the frequency of normal LFTs (Bilirubin, ALP, ALT, and AST) in patients with biliary AP.

Design

In this prospective study data collected for other ongoing studies on AP in the division of Gastroenterology in the last 20 years were analyzed.

Material and Methods

Serum total Bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP levels in 269 patients with biliary AP out of 728 cases of AP of various etiologies were analyzed. The biliary etiology was confirmed on the basis of gallstones documented by transabdominal US or at surgery.

Results

We noted normal bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP levels in 14.5%, 12.3%, 11.2%, and 26.4% of cases of acute biliary pancreatitis respectively. When all the 4 laboratory tests were considered collectively, the incidence of normal values was 10.4%. We also noted an ALT elevation of < 3 x ULN in 16.7% of cases of biliary AP and 43.5% of cases had a T. Bilirubin level of less than 3 mg %.

Conclusions

Almost 15 to 20% of patients with biliary AP manifest with normal LFTs. The clinician should not exclude a biliary etiology solely on the basis of normal LFTs.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

In a retrospective analysis, Boys et al. found that the mean common bile duct diameter seen at abdominal US in ACC patients without and with CBDS was 5.8 and 7.1 mm, respectively (p = 0.004). A CBD diameter larger than 10 mm was associated with a 39% incidence of CBDS, while diameter smaller than 9.9 mm was associated with CBDS in 14%. The authors concluded that common bile duct diameter is not sufficient on its own to identify patients having significant risk for CBDS.

Which tests should be performed to assess the risk of CBDS in patients with ACC?

2.4 In order to assess the risk for CBDS, we suggest performing liver function tests (LFTs), including ALT, AST, bilirubin, ALP, GGT and abdominal US in all patients with ACC. #QoE: low; SoR: weak#

Several scores for the prediction of CBDS have been proposed and validated; however, none of the proposed scores is specific for ACC. The implementation of these predictive scores in clinical practice remains poor; all scores consider different combinations of the same clinical variables. Barkun et al. combined age > 55 years, elevated serum bilirubin, dilated common bile duct and evidence of CBDS; Menezes et al. combined age > 55 years, male sex, ascending cholangitis, dilated common bile duct, CBDS and abnormal LFTs; Soltan et al. included history of symptomatic disease, abnormal liver function tests, dilated common bile duct and presence of CBDS; Sun et al. included male sex, abnormal liver function test and dilated common bile duct; Sarli et al. combined positive AUS and abnormal liver function tests.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

### Updated guideline on the management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) [^1178tsxF]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Common bile duct stones (CBDS) are estimated to be present in 10–20% of individuals with symptomatic gallstones. They can result in a number of health problems, including pain, jaundice, infection and acute pancreatitis. A variety of imaging modalities can be employed to identify the condition, while management of confirmed cases of CBDS may involve endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, surgery and radiological methods of stone extraction. Clinicians are therefore confronted with a number of potentially valid options to diagnose and treat individuals with suspected CBDS. The British Society of Gastroenterology first published a guideline on the management of CBDS in 2008. Since then a number of developments in management have occurred along with further systematic reviews of the available evidence. The following recommendations reflect these changes and provide updated guidance to healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of adult patients with suspected or proven CBDS. It is not a protocol and the recommendations contained within should not replace individual clinical judgement.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^112RxuPA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

One flaw of the study is that index diagnosis depends to some extent on the reference standard. Given the retrospective design of the study, it should be considered that the diagnosis of CBDS is assessed with endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), which is mainly prompted by the presence of elevated LFTs; this may represent a source of bias. No systematic intra-operative cholangiography (IOC) was performed.

Are elevated LFTs or bilirubin sufficient for the diagnosis of CBDS in patients with ACC?

2.1 We recommend against the use of elevated LFTs or bilirubin as the only method to identify CBDS in patients with ACC, in which case we recommend performing further diagnostic tests. #QoE: moderate; SoR: strong#

Historically, LTFs have played a major role in determining the presence of CBDS. However, the majority of published studies did not consider patients with ACC and included asymptomatic gallstones. Normal LFTs have a NPV of 97%, whereas the PPV of any abnormal LFTs is only 15%. The elevation of LFTs is a poor tool for the prediction of CBDS, even in patients without ACC; the literature ranging from 25 to 50%. In patients with ACC, LFTs may be altered due to the acute inflammatory process of the gallbladder and the biliary tree, rather than direct biliary obstruction; a proportion ranging between 15 and 50% of patients with ACC show elevation in LFTs without CBDS. Song et al. demonstrated that 424 out of 1178 patients with ACC had increased LFTs, namely ALT and aspartate transaminase (AST) greater than twice reference levels. Of these, only 246 (58%) had CBDS. Chang et al. showed that 51% and 41% of patients with ACC without CBDS had elevated ALT and AST, respectively. However, increased bilirubin levels with leucocytosis may predict gangrenous cholecystitis. Padda et al. found that approximately 30% of patients with ACC without CBDS had abnormal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and/or bilirubin, and 50% had abnormal ALT. Among patients with ACC and CBDS, 77% had raised ALP, 60% had abnormal bilirubin and 90% had elevated ALT; multivariate analysis showed that increased common bile duct size and elevated ALT and ALP were predictors of CBDS. The diagnostic accuracy increases for cholestasis tests, such as serum bilirubin, with the duration and the severity of obstruction. Specificity of serum bilirubin levels for CBDS was 60% with a cut-off level of 1.7 mg/day and 75% with a cut-off level of 4 mg/dl; however, mean level of bilirubin in patients with CBDS is generally lower (1.5 to 1.9 mg/dl).

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113LJvTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^115Txxj6]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Jaundice is an indication of hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by derangements in bilirubin metabolism. It is typically apparent when serum bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dL and can indicate serious underlying disease of the liver or biliary tract. A comprehensive medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are essential for differentiating potential causes such as alcoholic liver disease, biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, drug-induced liver injury, hemolysis, or hepatitis. Initial laboratory evaluation should include assays for bilirubin (total and fractionated), a complete blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. Measuring fractionated bilirubin allows for determination of whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Ultrasonography of the abdomen, computed tomography with intravenous contrast media, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are first-line options for patients presenting with jaundice, depending on the suspected underlying etiology. If the etiology of jaundice is unclear despite laboratory testing and imaging, liver biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the disease.

Cholestasis can be extrahepatic or intrahepatic and is typically associated with biochemical abnormalities in the liver function tests. Once these abnormalities are identified, more extensive imaging tests can be performed to determine the nature, etiology, and level of obstruction. This information is essential for clinicians as they decide on management and treatment strategies.

Case presentation

A 75-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting for 3 days. She did not drink alcohol, and there was no clinical or biochemical evidence of primary liver disease or coagulopathy. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the right upper abdominal quadrant. Laboratory tests revealed that the percentage of neutrophils (N%) was 80.3% (50–70%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 192 U/L (< 64 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 66 U/L (< 64 U/L), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) was 197 U/L (< 47 U/L), and all other laboratory parameters were normal (e.g. haemoglobin and platelet counts, prothrombin time, and renal function). An abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan demonstrated dilatation of the extrahepatic bile duct with a stone at the lower CBD and sludge in the gallbladder. (Fig. 1) Bile duct cholangiopancreatography revealed a dilated CBD (10 mm in diameter) with a round filling defect (8 mm in diameter) (Fig. 2). Balloon dilation (10 mm in diameter) of terminal CBD after a 5-mm long sphincterotomy for extraction of the stone was uneventful. Unfortunately, she presented with cholangitis and a significant increase in the percentage of neutrophils (94%) and cholestatic parameters (total bilirubin 111.1 μmol/L (2–18 μmol/L), direct bilirubin 81.3 μmol/L (< 7 μmol/L), ALT 465 U/L, AST 538 U/L, and γ-GT 634 U/L) after 3 days.

### Management of gallstones [^113qrVME]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with gallstones can be managed expectantly. Generally, only persons with symptoms related to the presence of gallstones (e.g., steady, nonparoxysmal pain lasting four to six hours located in the upper abdomen) or complications (such as acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis) warrant surgical intervention. Biliary pain is alleviated by cholecystectomy in the majority of cases. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the most cost-effective management strategy in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. Medical management strategies are mostly palliative and are not widely supported. Patients with longer-lasting biliary pain, in combination with abdominal tenderness, fever, and/or leukocytosis, require an ultrasound evaluation to help establish a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Once a patient is diagnosed, having cholecystectomy early in the course of the disease can significantly reduce the hospital stay.

### Initial cholecystectomy vs sequential common duct endoscopic assessment and subsequent cholecystectomy for suspected gallstone migration: a randomized clinical trial [^115q7ugu]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The optimal management of treatment for patients at intermediate risk of a common duct stone (including increased liver function tests but bilirubin < 4 mg/dL and no cholangitis) is a matter of debate. Many stones migrate spontaneously into the duodenum, making preoperative common duct investigations unnecessary.

Objective

To compare strategies of cholecystectomy first vs a sequential endoscopic common duct assessment and cholecystectomy for the management of patients with an intermediate risk of a common duct stone. The main objective was to reduce the length of stay and the secondary objectives were to reduce the number of common duct investigations, morbidity, and costs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Interventional, randomized clinical trial with 2 parallel groups performed between June 2011 and February 2013, with a patient follow-up of 6 months. The trial comprised a random sample of 100 adult patients admitted to Geneva University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland, for acute gallstone-related conditions with an intermediate risk of a common duct stone. Fifty patients were randomized to each group.

Interventions

Cholecystectomy first with intraoperative cholangiogram for the study group and endoscopic common duct assessment and clearance followed by cholecystectomy for the control group.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Length of initial hospital stay (primary end point), number of common duct investigations and morbidity and mortality within 6 months after initial admission, and quality of life at 1 and 6 months after discharge (EQ-5D-5L [EuroQol Group, 5-level] questionnaire).

Results

Patients who underwent cholecystectomy as a first step had a significantly shorter length of hospital stay (median, 5 days [interquartile range {IQR}, 1–8] vs median, 8 days [IQR, 6–12]; P < .001), with fewer common duct investigations (25 vs 71; P < .001), no significant difference in morbidity or quality of life.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients at intermediate risk of a common duct stone, initial cholecystectomy compared with sequential common duct endoscopy assessment and subsequent surgery resulted in a shorter length of stay without increased morbidity. If these findings are confirmed, initial cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram may be a preferred approach.

### Liver injury caused by fenofibrate within 48 h after first administration: a case report [^1162mxUj]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 63 years old male with hypertriglyceridemia [triglyceride (TG) 12.82 mmol/L], started taking fenofibrate 200 mg/day for the first time. One day before taking fenofibrate, liver function tests were performed. The laboratory result showed alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (Alk P) were all in normal range. After taking fenofibrate for 2 days, the patient developed fatigue, body aches, anorexia and dark urine, fenofibrate was discontinued immediately. There was no change to the rest of the patient's medication. One day after withdrawal, liver function tests showed ALT 690 U/L, AST 521 U/L, the direct bilirubin (DBIL) 50.1 umol/L, the total bilirubin (TBIL) 75.8 umol/L, Alk P 202 U/L, γ-GGT 769 U/L, the International Normalized Ratio (INR) 0.93.

Patient's body mass index (BMI) was 27.76 kg/m 2 with a body surface area (BSA) of 2.21 m 2. He was jaundiced with yellow sclera and skin. He presented with right upper quadrant tenderness and hepatic percussion pain was elicited. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody were negative. Anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibodies, anti-liver and kidney microsome antibodies, anti-mitochondrial antibodies, anti-myocardial antibodies, anti-parietal cell antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-ENA antibody were all negative. The IgG was normal (933.31 mg/dL), and the IgM was slightly decreased (36.45 mg/dL). Abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged, fatty liver with enhanced liver parenchymal echogenicity (Fig. 1). Additionally the US showed a normal gallbladder size, normal gallbladder wall thickness, and multiple gallstones.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115wEbB4]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. But the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

Gallstone pancreatitis — role of early ERCP: In patients with gallstone pancreatitis without cholangitis or biliary obstruction/choledocholithiasis we recommend against urgent (within 48 hours) ERCP (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Five RCTs informed mortality and 7 RCTs informed systemic and local adverse events; early ERCP does not reduce mortality versus a conservative approach (risk ratio [RR], .74 [95% CI, .18–3.03], I² = 62%) and did not diminish local (RR, .85 [95% CI, .52–1.43], I² = 12%) or systemic adverse events (RR, .59 [95% CI, .31–1.11], I² = 14%). Conservative treatment included analgesics, intravenous fluids, selective ERCP for cholangitis, rising bilirubin, or clinical deterioration, and the meta-analysis did not show a reduction in mortality, systemic, or local adverse events for patients with predicted severe disease.

### National adherence to the ASGE-SAGES guidelines for managing suspected choledocholithiasis: an EAST multicenter study [^115HeZy2]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons provide guidelines for managing suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones. We sought to evaluate adherence to the guidelines among patients with choledocholithiasis and/or acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) and to evaluate the ability of these guidelines to predict choledocholithiasis.

Methods

We prospectively identified patients undergoing same-admission cholecystectomy for choledocholithiasis and/or ABP from 2016 to 2019 at 12 United States medical centers. Predictors of suspected CBD stones were very strong (CBD stone on ultrasound; bilirubin > 4 mg/dL), strong (CBD > 6 mm; bilirubin ≥ 1.8 to ≤ 4 mg/dL), or moderate (abnormal liver function tests other than bilirubin; age > 55 years; ABP). Patients were grouped by probability of CBD stones: high (any very strong or both strong predictors), low (no predictors), or intermediate (any other predictor combination). The management of each probability group was compared with the recommended management in the guidelines.

Results

The cohort was comprised of 844 patients. High-probability patients had 64.3% (n = 238/370) deviation from guidelines, intermediate-probability patients had 29% (n = 132/455) deviation, and low-probability patients had 78.9% (n = 15/19) deviation. Acute biliary pancreatitis increased the odds of deviation for the high- (odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–2.8; p = 0.03) and intermediate-probability groups (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.07–2.42; p = 0.02). Age older than 55 years (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.4–3.43; p < 0.001) also increased the odds of deviation for the intermediate group. A CBD greater than 6 mm predicted choledocholithiasis in the high (adjusted OR (aOR), 2.16; 95% CI, 1.17–3.97; p = 0.01) and intermediate group (aOR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.59–4.86; p < 0.001). Any very strong predictor (aOR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.76–3.37; p < 0.0001) and both strong predictors predicted choledocholithiasis (aOR, 2; 95% CI, 1.35–2.96; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Almost 45% of patients with suspected CBD stones were managed discordantly from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons guidelines. We believe these guidelines warrant revision to better reflect the ability of the clinical variables at predicting choledocholithiasis.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

Primary outcome measure

The primary endpoint of this study is symptomatic gallstone disease after 24 months, defined as hospital admission or hospital visit for symptomatic gallstone disease. Hospital visit is a condition, because all patients with noteworthy symptoms will eventually visit the hospital. Mild and self-limiting complaints are not a large burden to the health care system or to the patient, and usually gallstone involvement is not objectified in these patients. Symptomatic gallstone disease is defined as biliary pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, or biliary colics. Acute pancreatitis is diagnosed in the presence of two of the three following: upper abdominal pain; serum lipase or amylase levels above 3 times the upper level of normal; characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional abdominal imaging. Pancreatitis is regarded of biliary origin when imaging reveals gallstones, sludge or a dilated common bile duct, or when laboratory investigation reveals an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level > 2 times higher than normal values, with ALT > aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Acute cholecystitis and cholangitis are diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of the updated Tokyo Guidelines. Acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in the presence of at least one local sign of inflammation (either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass/pain/tenderness) and at least one systemic sign of inflammation (fever, elevated C-reactive protein, or elevated white blood cell count). Choledocholithiasis is defined as the presence of stones in the extrahepatic bile ducts as proven by clinical imaging, or clinical suspicion based on abnormal liver function tests in combination with upper abdominal pain for which an ERCP or PTC was indicated. Cholangitis is diagnosed when there is a sign of systemic inflammation (fever/shaking chills or laboratory evidence of inflammatory response) and either clinical or laboratory evidence of cholestasis (total bilirubin ≥ 34 μmol/L, or increased serum alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, ALT, or AST > 1.5× higher than the upper limit of normal value) or evidence of cholestasis on biliary imaging (biliary dilatation or evidence of the etiology on imaging). Biliary colics are defined as upper abdominal pain (either right upper quadrant or epigastric pain) lasting at least 30 min with gallstones visible on ultrasound, according to the Rome criteria. In case of doubt whether a participant has reached the primary endpoint, endpoint adjudication will be done by an independent blinded committee.

### Routine MRCP in the management of patients with gallbladder stones awaiting cholecystectomy: a single-centre experience [^114ks8kX]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the frequency of choledocolithiasis and the role of preoperative laboratory findings, ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) in the detection of choledocolithiasis in patients with gallbladder stones awaiting cholecystectomy.

Methods

A consecutive sample of 104 patients underwent MRCP prior to cholecystectomy. The patients were classified into different groups on the basis of the risk of choledocolithiasis. A specialised doctor with more 10 years of experience performed the US interpretation and a radiologist performed the MRCP interpretation blinded to US or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/alkaline phosphatase (ALP) results. A chi-square (χ²) test was performed to assess the statistical significance of differences in the frequency of choledocolithiasis based on laboratory findings, choledocal diameter on US and group risk.

Results

MRCP showed calculi in 7 out of 104 patients (6.7%), with no statistically significant differences between the high/moderate risk and low/no risk groups and between the patients with normal and altered laboratory findings or choledocal diameter on preoperative US. The sensitivity and specificity of AST/ALT [positive predictive value (PPV): 12%; negative predictive value (NPV): 94%], ALP (PPV: 7%; NPV: 94%), total serum bilirubin (PPV: 6%; NPV: 93%) and choledocal diameter (PPV: 20%; NPV: 94%) were, respectively, 28.6 and 94.8%, 85.7 and 17.5%, 14.3 and 93.8%, and 14.3 and 95.9%.

Conclusions

MRCP is a reliable evaluation for the detection of common bile duct (CBD) stones, reducing the misdiagnosis of retained choledocholithiasis with normal biochemical predictors and US examination.

Main messages

- MRCP is a non-invasive method for the detection of CBD stones.

- Preoperative MRCP reduces the misdiagnosis of retained choledocholithiasis.

- Detection of choledocholithiasis is mandatory prior to cholecystectomy to avoid surgical morbidity

Gallbladder pathologies caused by gallstones are commonly encountered in clinical practice, making accurate diagnosis critical for effective patient management. Radiologists play a key role in differentiating these conditions through imaging interpretation, ensuring that appropriate treatment is initiated. The imaging features of gallstone associated diseases are classified into various categories, such as inflammatory conditions, benign lesions, malignant tumors, and associated complications. A comprehensive understanding of these categories and their radiologic manifestations is essential for accurate diagnosis and management of gallbladder pathology. By integrating clinical knowledge with radiologic findings, clinicians and radiologists will be equipped with practical tools to identify and distinguish between different gallstone causing conditions.

If the evaluation is negative, then "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy" or "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", with persistence prompting "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy". Under "Elevated serum transaminases ± elevated bilirubin", perform "History and physical exam Check right upper quadrant ultrasound"; if "If ductal dilatation → ERCP, MRCP" and if "If no ductal dilatation → check AMA, ANA, SMA". Next, "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", whereas "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy or MRCP" or "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and persistent elevation leads to "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy or MRCP".

### Diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasonography in patients with intermediate or high likelihood of choledocholithiasis: a retrospective study from one university-based endoscopy center [^115uRB9S]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Choledocholithiasis is a common condition, which occurs in 10–20% of patients with cholelithiasis, 7–14% of patients who have undergone cholecystectomy, and 18–33% of patients with acute biliary pancreatitis. Management of patients with suspected choledocholithiasis requires confirmation of stones in the common bile duct (CBD).

Diagnosis of choledocholithiasis is based on clinical signs and symptoms, levels of serum markers of cholestasis, and imaging examination findings (transabdominal ultrasonography), but these factors are not highly sensitive or specific. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the gold standard method for diagnosis and treatment of choledocholithiasis. However, as indiscriminate use of ERCP increases the risk of procedure-related complications, ERCP is almost exclusively reserved for therapeutic purposes, and choledocholithiasis is usually diagnosed using non-invasive methods.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^113T9h7b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The problem representation is now: Acutely ill, possibly septic, 43-year-old woman with recent travel to Mexico, fever, diffuse abdominal pain, jaundice and hepatomegaly. The clinician recognizes the features consistent with SIRS and immediately makes recommendations for action, including empiric treatment for bacterial cholangitis. This is an example of pattern recognition. Other features of the case remain puzzling and are labeled discordant: LUQ pain with hepatomegaly and jaundice. Such discordant features require analytic reasoning, a process involving conscious hypothesis testing to direct further history, examination or diagnostic testing decisions. In all but the most straightforward clinical cases, clinicians use both pattern recognition and analytic reasoning simultaneously to establish and prioritize possible diagnoses, as illustrated here.

Initial laboratory studies were: WBC count 8,300/mm³ (66% PMN, 31% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes), hemoglobin 12.5 mg/dl, MCV 75 μm³, platelet count 88,000/mm³, alkaline phosphatase 301 U/l, AST 334 U/l, ALT 133 U/l, total bilirubin 5.1 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 3.4 mg/dl, albumin 2.3 g/dl and INR 1.2.

Introduction

Gallstones are crystalized particles composed mainly of cholesterol and sometimes bilirubin, typically developing in the gallbladder. Choledocholithiasis is the presence of those calculi (stones) in the common bile duct (CBD). It is the primary cause of non-malignant bile duct obstruction. The formation of gallstones is influenced by various clinical conditions and factors, including bile composition, gallbladder motility, genetics, obesity, female sex, and age. The most common etiological factor for choledocholithiasis is the migration of gallbladder stones to the CBD and intrahepatic ducts through the cystic duct. This occurs in approximately 3–15% of patients who undergo cholecystectomy. Another common cause of choledocholithiasis is inadequate bile drainage due to obstructions, such as postsurgical bile duct strictures, which can lead to acute cholangitis or other inflammatory conditions. Hepatolithiasis is the formation of stones in the intrahepatic biliary tract. This condition is often recurrent and requires multiple therapeutic interventions. Treatment for choledocholithiasis is necessary for symptomatic patients, and is recommended for asymptomatic patients given the risk of serious complications, such as cholangitis, obstructive jaundice (which can lead to secondary biliary cirrhosis), and pancreatitis.

Pediatric acute pancreatitis — diagnosis and initial evaluation — requires meeting INSPPIRE-based criteria with at least two features, including abdominal pain, enzyme elevation, or imaging findings, and initial imaging should be transabdominal ultrasonography with additional imaging reserved for complicated cases; first-attack testing should include liver enzymes, triglyceride, and calcium levels. Specifically, diagnosis "requires at least 2 of the following: (1) abdominal pain compatible with AP, (2) serum amylase and/or lipase values ≥ 3 times upper limits of normal, (3) imaging findings consistent with AP", and "Initial imaging may be accomplished via transabdominal ultrasonography, with other imaging (CT, MRI) reserved for more complicated cases ± tailored to suspected etiology", while "first attack of AP testing should include liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, bilirubin), triglyceride level, and calcium level".

### Choledocholithiasis presenting with very high transaminase level [^114eXui8]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

We present three cases of choledocholithiasis presenting with a rise in transaminase to levels normally associated with acute hepatitis (alanine aminotransferase in excess of 1000 IU/l). All three cases had repeated investigation for liver disease before identification of common bile duct stones with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram, and removal at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram. We discuss the existing literature and the potential mechanisms of hepatocyte injury in extrahepatic obstruction.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^113EquiN]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice in adults can be an indicator of significant underlying disease. It is caused by elevated serum bilirubin levels in the unconjugated or conjugated form. The evaluation of jaundice relies on the history and physical examination. The initial laboratory evaluation should include fractionated bilirubin, a complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, ?-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein. Imaging with ultrasonography or computed tomography can differentiate between extrahepatic obstructive and intrahepatic parenchymal disorders. Ultrasonography is the least invasive and least expensive imaging method. A more extensive evaluation may include additional cancer screening, biliary imaging, autoimmune antibody assays, and liver biopsy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with increased bilirubin production caused by red blood cell destruction, such as hemolytic disorders, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs in disorders of hepatocellular damage, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis, and cholestatic disorders, such as choledocholithiasis and neoplastic obstruction of the biliary tree.

Introduction — epidemiology and pathophysiology of gallstones are summarized, stating that "Bile duct stones (choledocholithiasis) most frequently result from the migration of gallstones from the gallbladder into the biliary tree" and that "Gallstones are the consequence of cholesterol supersaturation in bile, inadequate bile salt levels or function, and diminished contractility of the biliary epithelium because of the multifactorial effects of diet, hormones, and genetic predisposition". The introduction adds that "Prospective population data reveal that 10% of American adults will develop symptomatic gallstones over the course of a decade", and that "Greater than 700,000 will undergo outpatient cholecystectomy".

### Magnitude of AST and ALT… [^116jXV8o]. Wikipedia (2007). Low credibility.

In medicine, the presence of elevated transaminases, commonly the transaminases alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, may be an indicator of liver dysfunction. Other terms include transaminasemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Normal ranges for both ALT and AST vary by gender, age, and geography and are roughly 8–40 U/L. Mild transaminesemia refers to levels up to 250 U/L. Drug-induced increases such as that found with the use of anti-tuberculosis agents such as isoniazid are limited typically to below 100 U/L for either ALT or AST. Muscle sources of the enzymes, such as intense exercise, are unrelated to liver function and can markedly increase AST and ALT. Cirrhosis of the liver or fulminant liver failure secondary to hepatitis commonly reach values for both ALT and AST in the > 1000 U/L range; however, many people with liver disease have normal transaminases.

Elevated transaminases that persist less than six months are termed "acute" in nature, and those values that persist for six months or more are termed "chronic" in nature. Pathophysiology The liver has transaminases to synthesize and break down amino acids and to convert energy storage molecules. The concentrations of these transaminases in the serum are normally low. However, if the liver is damaged, the liver cell membrane becomes more permeable and some of the enzymes leak out into the blood circulation. The two transaminases commonly measured are alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase. These levels previously were called serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase and serum glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase. Elevated levels are sensitive for liver injury, meaning that they are likely to be present if there is injury.

However, they may also be elevated in other conditions such as thyroid disorders, celiac disease, and muscle disorders. ALT is usually found only in the liver. AST is most commonly found in the liver, but also in significant amounts in heart and skeletal muscle. Measurement of ALT and AST were used in diagnosing heart attacks, although they have been replaced by newer enzyme and protein tests that are more specific for cardiac damage. Possible causes for high ALT levels are liver inflammation, injury to muscles, and many toxins and drugs.

Role in diagnosis In general, any damage to the liver will cause medium elevations in these transaminases, but diagnosis requires synthesis of many pieces of information, including the patient's history, physical examination, and possibly imaging or other laboratory examinations. However, very high elevations of the transaminases suggests severe liver damage, such as viral hepatitis, liver injury from lack of blood flow, or injury from drugs or toxins. Most disease processes cause ALT to rise higher than AST; AST levels double or triple that of ALT are consistent with alcoholic liver disease. When the AST is higher than ALT, a muscle source of these enzymes should be considered. For example, muscle inflammation due to dermatomyositis may cause AST > ALT.

### Evaluating elevated liver chemistry test results… [^112LzhZW]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The widespread frequency of serum blood chemistry analyses in medicine requires an appropriate guideline for evaluating abnormal test results. Guidelines have been developed by the Clinical Practice Committee of the American Gastroenterological Association to interpret results and follow patients with abnormal liver chemistry test results. Because normal values for serum biochemical tests are defined by the mean of the distribution plus or minus two standard deviations among a healthy population, 2. 5 percent of healthy persons will have abnormal test elevations. In addition, because a normal value does not exclude the possibility of hepatic disease, test results must be interpreted in the context of the individual patient, and a detailed history, physical examination, and medication review are required.

Important factors in this evaluation include risk factors for liver disease, medications associated with liver chemistry abnormalities, comorbid conditions, alcohol consumption, and other evidence of liver disease. This information base may appropriately direct the examination toward establishing specific diagnoses. When no clues exist or a diagnosis cannot be confirmed, an algorithm for evaluation of liver test abnormalities can be useful. Elevated serum aminotransferase levels indicate the need to test for common hepatic diseases with noninvasive testing. If these results are negative, further testing should be based on the clinical situation. Clinical follow-up and serial serum liver chemistry testing is important. If aminotransferase elevations are persistent or marked, or if there is evidence of liver disease, a more complete diagnostic effort is required, which may include radiologic testing and liver biopsy.

Hyperbilirubinemia can be caused by hepatocellular, cholestatic, or metabolic diseases and requires further evaluation. Initial evaluation should identify whether hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia in an asymptomatic patient may indicate Gilbert's syndrome, hemolysis, or a medication adverse effect. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the presence of an elevated alkaline phosphatase level warrants evaluation for biliary obstruction with ultrasonography. An elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level in the presence of normal aminotransferase levels warrants testing of γ-glutamyl-transferase or 5-nucleotidase testing. If these results are negative, some other etiology should be sought for the elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level outside of the hepatobiliary tract. If these results are positive, further testing is necessary to look for biliary obstruction, medication adverse effects, or primary biliary cirrhosis.

The authors conclude that mild liver abnormalities found in patients who appear to be healthy can be followed up closely if initial testing for common liver disease is negative. Further evaluation is essential in patients who have significant symptoms, chronic or serious liver disease, and marked laboratory abnormalities.

### Reference ranges for blood tests… [^1155SBka]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Plasma or whole blood In this article, all values denote blood plasma concentration, which is approximately 60–100% larger than the actual blood concentration if the amount inside red blood cells is negligible. The precise factor depends on hematocrit as well as amount inside RBCs. Exceptions are mainly those values that denote total blood concentration, and in this article they are: Arterial or venous If not otherwise specified, a reference range for a blood test is generally the venous range, as the standard process of obtaining a sample is by venipuncture. An exception is for acid–base and blood gases, which are generally given for arterial blood. Still, the blood values are approximately equal between the arterial and venous sides for most substances, with the exception of acid–base, blood gases and drugs assays).

Arterial levels for drugs are generally higher than venous levels because of extraction while passing through tissues. Usual or optimal Reference ranges are usually given as what are the usual values found in the population, more specifically the prediction interval that 95% of the population fall into. This may also be called standard range. In contrast, optimal range or therapeutic target is a reference range or limit that is based on concentrations or levels that are associated with optimal health or minimal risk of related complications and diseases. For most substances presented, the optimal levels are the ones normally found in the population as well. More specifically, optimal levels are generally close to a central tendency of the values found in the population. However, usual and optimal levels may differ substantially, most notably among vitamins and blood lipids, so these tables give limits on both standard and optimal ranges.

In addition, some values, including troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide, are given as the estimated appropriate cutoffs to distinguish healthy people from people with specific conditions, which here are myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, respectively, for the aforementioned substances. Sorted by concentration By mass and molarity Smaller, narrower boxes indicate a more tight homeostatic regulation when measured as standard "usual" reference range. Hormones predominate at the left part of the scale, shown with a red at ng/L or pmol/L, being in very low concentration. There appears to be the greatest cluster of substances in the yellow part, becoming sparser in the green part. However, there is another cluster containing many metabolic substances like cholesterol and glucose at the limit with the blue part. Substances with a molar mass around 1000g/mol are almost vertically aligned in the mass and molar images. Adrenocorticotropic hormone, on the other hand, with a molar mass of 4540, is 0. 7 decades to the right in the mass image. Substances with molar mass below 1000g/mol would have "negative" distance, that is, masses deviating to the left. Many substances given in mass concentration are not given in molar amount because they haven't been added to the article. By units Units do not necessarily imply anything about molarity or mass. A few substances are below this main interval, e.g. thyroid stimulating hormone, being measured in mU/L, or above, like rheumatoid factor and CA19–9, being measured in U/mL. By enzyme activity White blood cells.
