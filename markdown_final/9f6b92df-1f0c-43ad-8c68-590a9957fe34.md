## Question

Well defined heterogenously hypoechoic lesion with spiculated margins casting posterior acoustic
shadowing and surrounding architectural distortion in right breast with right axillary lymphadenopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the interpretation and clinical implications of a suspicious right breast ultrasound showing a well-defined heterogeneously hypoechoic lesion with spiculated margins, posterior acoustic shadowing, surrounding architectural distortion, and right axillary lymphadenopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the sonographic descriptors and their malignancy risk. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and which entities best fit this pattern. Next, I will correlate with pathologic behaviors and prognostic implications. After that, I need to check the axillary findings and their significance. Finally, I will outline immediate management, staging, and multidisciplinary considerations, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the key sonographic descriptors and their implications: a well-defined but heterogeneously hypoechoic mass with spiculated margins, posterior acoustic shadowing, and surrounding architectural distortion, plus ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. These features, taken together, are highly suspicious for malignancy and would typically be categorized as BI-RADS 5 on ultrasound, given the strong association of spiculation, shadowing, and architectural distortion with cancer on prospective multicenter data and the high PPV of associated features like architectural distortion and skin changes, even though posterior shadowing alone can rarely occur in benign entities [^113CHoVD] [^113jWFvT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review the differential and weigh which entities most plausibly explain this constellation. Invasive ductal carcinoma, including invasive micropapillary variants, frequently presents as an irregular hypoechoic mass with spiculated margins and posterior acoustic shadowing, and carries a high propensity for axillary nodal metastases, which matches this case closely; invasive lobular carcinoma can also show irregular hypoechoic masses with shadowing and architectural distortion, and is notorious for subtle, sometimes non-mass-like presentations; tubular carcinoma typically shows a small spiculated mass with posterior shadowing; and pregnancy-associated breast cancer can mimic these features with aggressive biology, though the clinical context would guide that consideration; among benign mimics, fat necrosis and complex sclerosing lesions/radial scars can produce spiculation and shadowing, but the combination with suspicious axillary nodes lowers their likelihood here [^1131akC6] [^113XWFxf] [^111UiswV] [^116Yjbpt] [^115LYHhE] [^114PK85M] [^112YqW9q].

> Wait, let me verify the pathologic correlation for the ultrasound features. Spiculated margins reflect a desmoplastic reaction at the tumor–stroma interface, posterior acoustic shadowing correlates with fibrosis and collagen deposition, and architectural distortion indicates disruption of normal breast architecture by infiltrative growth. These are classic stromal responses seen in invasive carcinomas, particularly ER-positive, lower-grade tumors, and are less typical of high-grade, triple-negative cancers that more often show posterior enhancement rather than shadowing, reinforcing the likelihood of an invasive carcinoma with desmoplasia in this case [^114fdR6B] [^115UeqRS].

> I need to check the axillary findings carefully. Enlarged axillary nodes with cortical thickening greater than 3 mm, loss of the fatty hilum, round morphology, and non-hilar cortical vascularity are concerning for metastatic involvement. Ultrasound has good performance for nodal assessment, and in newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer, targeted axillary ultrasound with image-guided core biopsy of suspicious nodes is recommended to establish pathologic nodal status, which directly impacts surgical planning and systemic therapy decisions [^1177JCZd] [^112LzfpM] [^113XQ8Cu].

> Let me consider immediate management steps and ensure they align with guidelines. I should confirm that the patient undergoes diagnostic bilateral mammography and targeted breast and nodal ultrasound to document extent and correlate calcifications or additional lesions, followed by image-guided core needle biopsy of the breast mass and ultrasound-guided core biopsy of any abnormal axillary nodes; if the primary lesion is occult on mammography, MRI can be used for staging and to identify multifocal or multicentric disease, and in select scenarios such as dense breasts or equivocal conventional imaging, contrast-enhanced mammography can help characterize extent; all of this should proceed under multidisciplinary coordination to integrate imaging, pathology, and surgical planning [^111nBxK5] [^11116DAW] [^112iDMrs].

> But wait, what if the clinical context changes the pretest probabilities or imaging choices? In pregnancy or lactation, ultrasound remains the initial modality of choice, and mammography can be performed with shielding if suspicious findings are identified; MRI without gadolinium can be considered postpartum for staging; in patients with palpable nodes or larger primaries, axillary imaging and biopsy are prioritized; conversely, in clinically node-negative, early-stage disease under Z0011-era paradigms, some practices defer axillary ultrasound until after core biopsy and molecular subtype are known, though guidelines still support ultrasound-guided core biopsy for palpable nodes or clearly abnormal imaging [^115LYHhE] [^112LzfpM] [^116y66bD].

> I should double-check the prognostic implications tied to these imaging features. Posterior acoustic shadowing and spiculated margins are associated with ER positivity and lower histologic grade, which generally confer better response to endocrine therapy, though they also correlate with lymphovascular invasion and nodal spread; importantly, invasive micropapillary and other special-type invasive ductal carcinomas with these features have high rates of lymphovascular invasion and axillary metastasis, so the nodal disease suggested by the axillary ultrasound is biologically plausible and mandates pathologic confirmation and staging workup [^114fdR6B] [^115UeqRS] [^1131akC6] [^113XWFxf].

> Next, I should review how these imaging features influence surgical and systemic planning. Documenting nodal positivity preoperatively allows for sentinel lymph node biopsy planning or, in some algorithms, direct axillary management strategies, and it informs discussions of neoadjuvant therapy when axillary disease is significant; MRI or contrast-enhanced mammography can refine tumor extent and detect additional ipsilateral or contralateral disease, which may alter the surgical approach; multidisciplinary review ensures concordance between imaging and pathology and coordinates timing of axillary procedures with definitive breast surgery or neoadjuvant treatment [^112LzfpM] [^111nBxK5] [^115EWVyX] [^112iDMrs].

> In summary, I need to ensure the reasoning remains tightly anchored to the data: the combination of a spiculated, hypoechoic mass with posterior shadowing and architectural distortion, together with suspicious axillary nodes, is most consistent with invasive breast carcinoma, likely ER-positive and lower to intermediate grade, with a high probability of axillary metastasis. Urgent tissue diagnosis with ultrasound-guided core biopsies of the breast and nodes, comprehensive staging imaging, and multidisciplinary planning are the next critical steps to confirm diagnosis, stage disease, and guide curative-intent therapy [^113CHoVD] [^1131akC6] [^113XWFxf] [^112LzfpM] [^111nBxK5].

The described breast lesion is **highly suspicious for malignancy** — most likely invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma — given the spiculated margins, posterior acoustic shadowing, and architectural distortion, with axillary lymphadenopathy suggesting regional metastasis [^113CHoVD] [^111UiswV]. Immediate **core needle biopsy of the breast and axillary nodes** is required for definitive diagnosis and staging, followed by MRI for extent assessment and multidisciplinary planning [^114Pyzgf] [^112LzfpM] [^115EWVyX]. Differential includes fat necrosis, granulomatous mastitis, and lymphoma, but the imaging pattern strongly favors malignancy [^114PK85M] [^115jcVLB] [^111ssHoQ].

## Ultrasound features and their significance

- **Hypoechoic lesion**: Common in malignant breast lesions, reflecting increased cellularity and reduced acoustic impedance [^1169JLZL].

- **Spiculated margins**: Highly specific for malignancy, indicating infiltrative growth and desmoplastic reaction [^115qtgd2].

- **Posterior acoustic shadowing**: Suggests desmoplastic stromal reaction, commonly seen in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) [^111UiswV].

- **Architectural distortion**: Indicates disruption of normal breast architecture, often associated with malignancy [^1178RMzn].

- **Axillary lymphadenopathy**: Strongly suggests regional metastatic involvement, commonly seen in breast cancer [^1177JCZd].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Diagnosis** | **Clinical and imaging features** | **Likelihood** |
|-|-|-|
| Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) | - Spiculated margins <br/> - Posterior shadowing <br/> - Axillary lymphadenopathy <br/> - Most common breast cancer | High [^1169JLZL] |
| Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) | - Subtle architectural distortion <br/> - Posterior shadowing <br/> - Often mammographically occult <br/> - Frequent axillary involvement | High [^111UiswV] |
| Fat necrosis | - Irregular mass with spiculated margins <br/> - Posterior shadowing <br/> - History of trauma or surgery <br/> - Can mimic malignancy | Moderate [^114PK85M] |
| Granulomatous mastitis | - Irregular hypoechoic mass <br/> - Posterior shadowing <br/> - Axillary lymphadenopathy <br/> - Inflammatory features | Moderate [^115jcVLB] |
| Lymphoma | - Multiple hypoechoic masses <br/> - Axillary lymphadenopathy <br/> - Systemic symptoms | Low [^111ssHoQ] |

---

Given the combination of spiculated margins, posterior acoustic shadowing, architectural distortion, and axillary lymphadenopathy, **malignancy is the most likely diagnosis**, particularly IDC or ILC [^113CHoVD] [^111UiswV].

---

## Recommended next steps

- **Core needle biopsy**: Essential for definitive diagnosis, histological typing, and biomarker analysis (ER, PR, HER2) [^114Pyzgf].

- **Axillary ultrasound-guided biopsy**: To confirm nodal metastasis and guide surgical planning [^112LzfpM].

- **MRI**: Useful for assessing tumor extent, multifocality, and occult lesions, particularly in ILC [^115EWVyX].

- **Multidisciplinary team evaluation**: Involving radiology, surgery, oncology, and pathology for comprehensive management planning [^116y66bD].

---

## Prognostic implications

- **Axillary lymph node involvement**: Indicates advanced disease stage, associated with higher recurrence risk and poorer prognosis [^114Pyzgf].

- **Tumor characteristics**: Spiculated margins and posterior shadowing suggest invasive malignancy with desmoplastic reaction, correlating with aggressive biological behavior [^115UeqRS].

- **Early detection and treatment**: Critical for improving survival outcomes and reducing recurrence risk [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The described lesion is **highly suspicious for malignancy**, most likely IDC or ILC, with regional metastatic involvement. Immediate biopsy and comprehensive imaging are essential for definitive diagnosis, staging, and management planning [^111nBxK5].

Imaging of the axilla typically occurs when patients present with axillary symptoms or newly diagnosed breast cancer. An awareness of the axillary anatomy is essential in order to generate an accurate differential diagnosis and guide patient management. The purpose of this article is to review the indications for axillary imaging, discuss the logistics of the scanning technique and percutaneous interventions, and present the imaging findings and management of a variety of breast diseases involving the axilla. Teaching points
- Knowledge of normal axillary anatomy aids in determining the aetiology of an axillary mass.
- The differential diagnosis of an axillary mass is broad and can be subdivided by the location of the lesion.
- Imaging evaluation of the axilla usually entails diagnostic mammography and targeted ultrasound.
- FNA or core needle biopsies are safe and accurate methods for diagnosis and guiding management.

### US findings of bilateral primary breast cancer: retrospective study [^11168NP2]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

For women with breast cancer, the contralateral breast is at high risk. The bilateral cancers may be synchronous or metachronous. If the bilateral breast cancers have similar ultrasonography (US) appearances, the US findings of the first breast cancer (index cancer) might lead to early detection of the contralateral cancer. The purpose of this study was to identify the US characteristics of bilateral breast cancer and to determine whether bilateral breast cancers have similar US appearances and whether the US findings for one breast cancer might be predictive of the contralateral breast cancer.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the US manifestations of 58 patients with surgically proven bilateral primary breast cancer and compared the contralateral cancer with the index cancer by evaluation the margin, shape, inside echoes, posterior attenuation, calcification and color flow signals of 58 lesion pairs to investigate whether the bilateral breast cancers have similar US appearances.

Results

Bilateral primary breast cancers were more located in upper outer quadrant, frequently spiculation, taller than wide shape, with irregular margin, heterogeneous internal echo and acoustic shadowing, containing microcalcification and abundant color flow signals. The most common US appearances were taller than wide shape (75.0%, 87/116), irregular margins (79.3%, 92/116) and heterogeneous internal echo (86.2%, 100/116). Of the total 58 lesion pairs, 18 (31.0%) pairs had similar US characteristics, whereas 40 (69.0%) pairs had different US characteristics.

Conclusions

US signs of the index cancer do not indicate the most likely appearance of the second cancer in the contralateral breast. Evaluation of the contralateral cancer should be performed without regard for the US findings for the index cancer.

### Mammographic, sonographic and MR imaging features of invasive micropapillary breast cancer [^113XWFxf]. European Journal of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Describe mammographic, sonographic and MRI findings of invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) of the breast.

Materials and Methods

Review of the pathology database identified 43 patients (mean age, 59.3 years) with the diagnosis of breast IMPC. Three patients had no available imaging studies. Mammograms (40), breast ultrasounds (33) and MRIs (8) were retrospectively evaluated by two radiologists in consensus following the BI-RADS Lexicon. Clinical, histopathologic features, as well as hormone status were recorded.

Results

Twenty patients presented with palpable abnormality (20/40, 50%). Thirty-five patients had an abnormal mammogram (87.5%, 35/40) showing 39 lesions, 29 corresponding to masses (29/39, 74.4%), 11 associated with microcalcifications and two associated with architectural distortion. Sonography identified 41 masses (in 33 patients) displaying an irregular shape (30/41, 73.2%), appearing hypoechoic (39/41, 95%), with spiculated or angular margins (26/41, 63.4%), non-parallel orientation (26/41, 63.4%) and combined acoustic posterior pattern (18/41, 44%). MRI identified 13 lesions (in eight patients), 12 as masses (12/13, 92.3%) with irregular or spiculated margins (12/12, 100%), eight displaying an irregular or lobulated shape (8/12, 66.7%), six with homogeneous internal enhancement (6/12, 50%) and eight with type 3 enhancement curve (8/12, 61.5%). Associated non-mass like enhancement was noted in two patients. Twenty-nine patients had associated lymphovascular invasion (29/40, 72.5%) and axillary lymph node metastases were present in 22 of the 39 patients (22/39, 56%).

Conclusion

Invasive ductal carcinoma with IMPC features display imaging findings highly suspicious of malignant lesions. They are associated with high lymphovascular invasion and lymph node metastases rates.

Extra detection of breast cancers

The main analysis included 1692 breast cancers detected in 12 studies reporting detection of breast cancer in the entire screening population, of which 494 (29%) were detected only by supplemental ultrasound (a relative detection rate of 141%, with the increased detection calculated as 494/(1692–494), see Statistical Analysis and Table 2). The overall FE estimate of the proportion of total cancers detected by ultrasound was 0.29 (95% CI: 0.27–0.31); the estimate of an RE distribution mean was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.25–0.37). Both measures were very close despite substantial between-study variation (I 2 = 81% (95% CI: 68–89%); Fig. 2a). The results suggest that detection rates are on average increased by approximately 40% with supplemental ultrasound compared to mammography alone. In the only six studies reporting detection separately for DCIS and invasive cases, DCIS cases represented only a smaller proportion of the cases detected by ultrasound. The FE estimate, almost identical to the RE estimate, was 0.10 (95% CI: 0.05–0.16), consistent with an increase in the detection of 11%. The study by Brancato and colleagueswas not included as the total number of cancers in women undergoing supplemental ultrasound screening was unknown; a sensitivity analysis where it was included did not materially alter the results.

Proliferative breast conditions

Fat necrosis

Fat necrosis is a proliferative condition commonly seen as a result of breast surgery, infection, trauma, or radiation. Fat necrosis comprises 2.75% of breast lesions and is incited by the destruction of adipocytes, which causes an inflammatory process. Clinical features of fat necrosis include palpable masses, pain, and skin changes such as skin tethering, skin thickening, and dimpling. Fat necrosis has a wide spectrum of imaging features, some of which show the typical, classically benign findings, such as dystrophic calcifications or oil cysts. However, there are other imaging findings that can closely mimic malignancy: suspicious mammographic features of fat necrosis include irregular and spiculated masses, architectural distortion, asymmetries, coarse heterogeneous and even branching or pleomorphic calcifications. Ultrasound features of fat necrosis that mimic malignancy include irregular hypoechoic masses with posterior acoustic shadowing (Fig. 6). Characteristically benign features of fat necrosis on MRI include one or more fat-containing masses, which demonstrate T1 hyperintensity on non-fat supresed T1 sequences with corresponding drop in signal on fat-suppressed T1 and T2 sequences. Conversely, MRI features of fat necrosis that resemble malignancy are irregular enhancing masses, with or without a thick, irregular rim. Non-mass enhancement has also been reported. If a PET/CT is performed, these lesions can be hypermetabolic.

### Sonographic features of breast hamartomas [^113Ze7aQ]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the sonographic characteristics of breast hamartomas.

Methods

Data and sonographic images of 14 breast hamartomas were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

All patients had clinically palpable lumps. The median patient age was 39.5 years (range, 24–60 years). Eleven (78.6%) tumors occurred in the right breast, and 3 (21.4%) were in the left. The median tumor size measured by sonography was 2.8 cm (range, 1.2–4.9 cm). The median longest transverse dimension-anteroposterior diameter ratio of the tumors was 2.44 (range, 1.52–3.73). All tumors were oval and compressible with transducer pressure. Thirteen (92.9%) tumors were well circumscribed with smooth tumor margins, and 1 (7.1%) had indistinct margins. The internal echo texture was hyperechoic in 6 (42.9%), mixed (heterogeneous) echogenicity in 5 (35.7%), and isoechoic in 3 (21.4%). Four (28.6%) tumors had echogenic halos, and 2 (14.3%) had anechoic halos. Ten (71.4%) tumors had no retrotumor acoustic phenomena. Two (14.3%) had bilateral edge shadowing; 1 (7.1%) had posterior enhancement; and 1 (7.1%) had a mixture of enhancement and shadowing.

Conclusions

Breast hamartomas were well-circumscribed, solid, oval tumors without intratumor microcalcification. The internal echo texture of most hamartomas is either hyperechoic or composed of mixed echogenicity. Retrotumor acoustic phenomena were absent in most hamartomas.

### Evolving concepts in breast lobular neoplasia and invasive lobular carcinoma, and their impact on imaging methods [^111UiswV]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Ultrasound

Ultrasonography plays an essential role in the evaluation of ILC, with sensitivity ranging from 81 to 83%. It exhibits a higher accuracy than mammography for lesion measurements, detections of multifocality and multicentricity and lymph node assessments. It is the primary method for guiding biopsies of index lesions and adenopathy, as well as for the assessment of palpable lesions not seen on mammograms. Up to 73% of carcinomas not seen on mammograms may be detected through this method.

The sonographic findings of ILC may be similar to those of IDC. The most common finding is a hypoechoic, irregular mass with indistinct margins in approximately 85% of cases (Fig. 8). For the detection of small lesions (smaller than 1 cm), the use of high-frequency transducers coupled with harmonics may enhance the detection of microlobulations and spiculations, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy.

Fig. 8
A 73-year-old woman with ILC. a US image depicts an irregular, hypoechoic mass, with indistinct margins and distal attenuation of sound. b Magnified cranio-caudal view also shows an irregular mass associated to microcalcifications

A typical finding of ILC is the lower frequency of "taller than wider" lesions compared with those found in IDC. Cawson et al. attributed the preferential parallel orientation of ILC in the US images to the infiltrative growth pattern that follows the anatomical breast parenchymal planes.

Although atypical for a malignant mass, hyperechoic lesions are 10 times more common in ILC than in other types of breast malignancies. The posterior acoustic shadow without a definite mass may be a presentation of ILC.

Magnetic resonance imaging

MRI shows great sensitivity for ILC, ranging from 83 to 100%. The most common MRI finding associated with ILC is an irregular and spiculated mass-like lesion (Fig. 9), followed by a non-mass lesion in 20–40% of cases (Fig. 10).

### History… [^1124wnnS]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

2 A skin examination should be performed to rule out other lesions that would point to malignancy and to evaluate for erythematous lines along nodal tracts or any trauma that could lead to an infectious source of the lymphadenopathy. Finally, abdominal examination focused on splenomegaly, although rarely associated with lymphadenopathy, may be useful for detecting infectious mononucleosis, lymphocytic leukemias, lymphoma, or sarcoidosis. 2, 5. NODAL CHARACTER AND SIZE The quality and size of lymph nodes should be assessed. Lymph node qualities include warmth, overlying erythema, tenderness, mobility, fluctuance, and consistency. Shotty lymphadenopathy is the presence of multiple small lymph nodes that feel like "buck shots" under the skin. 8 This usually implies reactive lymphadenopathy from viral infection.

A painless, hard, irregular mass or a firm, rubbery lesion that is immobile or fixed may represent a malignancy, although in general, qualitative characteristics are unable to reliably predict malignancy. Painful or tender lymphadenopathy is nonspecific and may represent possible inflammation caused by infection, but it can also be the result of hemorrhage into a node or necrosis. 3 No specific nodal size is indicative of malignancy.
3. AXILLARY Infections or injuries of the upper extremities are a common cause of axillary lymphadenopathy. Common infectious etiologies are cat-scratch disease, tularemia, and sporotrichosis due to inoculation and lymphatic drainage. Absence of an infectious source or traumatic lesions is highly suspicious for a malignant etiology such as Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Breast, lung, thyroid, stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, kidney, and skin cancers can metastasize to the axilla.

Radiologic evaluation with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasonography may help to characterize lymphadenopathy. The American College of Radiology recommends ultrasonography as the initial imaging choice for cervical lymphadenopathy in children up to 14 years of age and computed tomography for persons older than 14 years. 15 Based on the location of the abnormal nodes, the sensitivity of these modalities for diagnosing metastatic lymph nodes varies; therefore, history and clinical examination must guide selection. 16 If the diagnosis is still uncertain, biopsy is recommended.

### A slow growing elastic papulonodular lesion [^112bXFYS]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following ultrasound findings is seen in this case?
A. Intralesional hyperechoic dots with posterior acoustic shadow
B. Intralesional hyperechoic dots without posterior acoustic shadow
C. Linear echogenic lines at right angles to the ultrasound beam
D. Posterior enhancement.
E. Side shadows

Answers:
A. Intralesional hyperechoic dots with posterior acoustic shadow – Incorrect. They are typically found in pilomatrixomas and correlate with intralesional calcifications. They are produced because of the collision of the ultrasound beams with a material that is highly reflective and attenuates more than adjacent tissue.
B. Intralesional hyperechoic dots without posterior acoustic shadow – Correct. They are considered a characteristic finding of BCC. The significance of these dots is unknown, and they don't correspond to calcifications or necrotic areas in histological preparations.
C. Linear echogenic lines at right angles to the ultrasound beam – Incorrect. It is a sign produced by internal reflections. It is often found when examining lipomas.
D. Posterior enhancement – Incorrect. Acoustic enhancement also called posterior enhancement is an ultrasound artifact seen when the ultrasound echoes pass almost completely through a watery material without reverberation, reaching the tissue behind the material and forming a hyperechogenic halo. On skin examination, it can be found in simple cysts.
E. Side shadows – Incorrect. It occurs when the beam hits curved surfaces that separate media with different acoustic impedances. They usually occur in epidermal inclusion cysts.

### Fibroadenoma in axillary ectopic breast [^116jBTup]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Axillary lumps are common clinical presentations in surgery, which have various differential diagnoses. We encountered an unusual case of an isolated axillary mass. The patient was a young woman in her 20s with a 2year history of right axillary swelling. Clinically, the lump measured 3 cm ×3cm, mobile, non-tender, and there was no associated breast lump or skin changes. Our initial impression was an isolated lymphadenopathy, and further workup for tuberculosis lymphadenopathy returned negative. Ultrasound demonstrated a well circumscribed oval lesion, and fine needle aspiration could only identify a benign proliferative breast tissue. As it was increasing in size and causing discomfort, we decided for an excision biopsy for both diagnostic and therapeutic reasons. Intraoperatively, the lump was noted to have well defined, smooth surface along with whitish-grey appearance. The tissue surrounding it was also removed and sent for histopathological assessment. Results confirmed our diagnosis of fibroadenoma in an ectopic breast tissue.

### Axillary imaging following a new invasive breast cancer diagnosis – A radiologist's dilemma [^1122M8kE]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, patients with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer underwent axillary US to assess for suspicious axillary lymph nodes (LNs), which were then targeted for image-guided needle biopsy to determine the presence of metastasis. Over the past decade, there has been a shift towards axillary preservation. For patients with palpable lymphadenopathy, the decision to perform axillary imaging with documentation of the number and location of abnormal LNs in preparation for image-guided LN sampling is straightforward. Since LN involvement correlates with cancer size, it is reasonable to image the axilla in patients with tumors larger than 5 cm; however, for tumors smaller than 5 cm, axillary imaging is often deferred until after the tumor molecular subtype and treatment plan are established. Over the last decade, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is increasingly used for smaller cancers with more aggressive molecular subtypes. In most cases, detecting axillary metastasis is critical when deciding whether the patient would benefit from NACT. There is increasing evidence that abnormal axillary US findings correlates with LN metastases and reliably establishes a baseline to monitor response to NACT. Depending on hormone receptor status, practices may choose to image the axilla in the setting of clinical stage T1 and T2 cancers to evaluate nodal status and help determine further steps in care. Radiologists should understand the nuances of axillary management and the scope and challenges of LN marking techniques that significantly increase the precision of limited axillary surgery.

### Incidental breast masses detected by computed tomography: are any imaging features predictive of malignancy? [^1148XnKG]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Aim

To review the outcome of further assessment of breast abnormalities detected incidentally by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and to determine whether any MDCT imaging features were predictive of malignancy.

Material and Methods

The outcome of 34 patients referred to the Primrose Breast Care Unit with breast abnormalities detected incidentally using MDCT was prospectively recorded. Women with a known diagnosis of breast cancer were excluded. CT imaging features and histological diagnoses were recorded and the correlation assessed using Fisher's exact test.

Results

Of the 34 referred patients a malignant diagnosis was noted in 11 (32%). There were 10 breast malignancies (seven invasive ductal carcinomas, one invasive lobular carcinoma, two metastatic lesions) and one axillary lymphoma. CT features suggestive of breast malignancy were spiculation [6/10 (60%) versus 0/24 (0%) p = 0.0002] and associated axillary lymphadenopathy [3/10 (33%) versus 0/20 (0%) p = 0.030]. Conversely, a well-defined mass was suggestive of benign disease [10/24 (42%) versus 0/10 (0%); p = 0.015]. Associated calcification, ill-definition, heterogeneity, size, and multiplicity of lesions were not useful discriminating CT features. There was a non-significant trend for lesions in involuted breasts to be more frequently malignant than in dense breasts [6/14 (43%) versus 4/20 (20%) p = 0.11].

Conclusion

In the present series there was a significant rate (32%) of malignancy in patients referred to the breast clinic with CT-detected incidental breast lesions. The CT features of spiculation or axillary lymphadenopathy are strongly suggestive of malignancy.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the malignant ultrasound features of triple-negative breast cancer [^114U1bX9]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The malignant ultrasound (US) features of breast cancer are known to include an irregular shape, a noncircumscribed margin, an echogenic halo, a nonparallel orientation, posterior acoustic attenuation, microcalcification, and others. However, these US features are uncertain and controversial for the diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This study aimed to analyze the diagnostic value of malignant US features for TNBC by a systematic review and meta-analysis, analyze the US characteristics of TNBC, and provide US evidence for clinical diagnosis.

Methods

A comprehensive search was performed to identify relevant English articles concerning the US diagnosis of TNBC (from the date of database establishment to November 2019). The pooled sensitivity, pooled specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio with 95% confidence interval, summary receiver operating characteristic curve, and area under the curve for the different malignant US features were calculated.

Results

Ten studies (620 patients) met the eligibility criteria. The sensitivity (range, 0.14–0.68) and specificity (range, 0.19–0.66) of the malignant US features were not high. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the area under the curve (range, 0.25–0.47) of the malignant US features was low, demonstrating that these features have poor diagnostic value for TNBC. The positive likelihood ratio (range, 0.4-to 0.9) of the malignant US features was low, and the negative likelihood ratio (range, 1.09–2.02) was not low, revealing that these features had a poor ability to confirm or exclude TNBC.

Conclusions

Triple-negative breast cancer lacks the typical malignant US features of breast cancer and has its own US features.

### BI-RADS 3 for magnetic resonance imaging [^117TYuc3]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

A BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) 3, or probably benign, assessment is given in approximately 7% to 12% of breast magnetic resonance (MR) images. However, the imaging features of probably benign lesions on MR imaging have not been well defined. As with mammography and ultrasonography, a BI-RADS 3 assessment should be used only when there is a less than 2% likelihood of malignancy. The use of BI-RADS 3 for classically benign findings should be avoided. Certain masses, foci, and areas of nonmass enhancement may be categorized as probably benign on baseline MR imaging.

### Evaluation of the effect of computer-aided classification of benign and malignant lesions on reader performance in automated three-dimensional breast ultrasound [^11155iHq]. Academic Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the effect of a newly developed computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system on reader interpretation of breast lesions in automated three-dimensional (3D) breast ultrasound.

Materials and Methods

A CAD system was developed to differentiate malignant lesions from benign lesions including automated lesion segmentation in three dimensions; extraction of lesion features such as spiculation, margin contrast, and posterior acoustic behavior; and a classification stage. Eighty-eight patients with breast lesions were included for an observer study: 47 lesions were malignant and 41 were benign. Eleven readers (seven radiologists and four residents) read the cases with and without CAD. We compared the performance of readers with and without CAD using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

Results

The CAD system had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.92 for discriminating benign and malignant lesions, whereas the unaided reader AUC ranged from 0.77 to 0.92. Mean performance of inexperienced readers improved when CAD was used (AUC = 0.85 versus 0.90; p = 0.007), whereas mean performance of experienced readers did not change with CAD (AUC = 0.89).

Conclusions

By using the CAD system for classification of lesions in automated 3D breast ultrasound, which on its own performed as good as the best readers, the performance of inexperienced readers improved while that of experienced readers remained unaffected.

Pulmonary nodule evaluation — chest computed tomography (CT) emphasizes that all previous CT scans should be reviewed when a nodule is first identified by CT scan; chest CT provides specific information about the location, shape, margins, and attenuation characteristics of nodules and can identify unsuspected lymphadenopathy, synchronous parenchymal lesions, or invasion of the chest wall or mediastinum; morphologic characteristics that suggest malignancy include spiculated margins and vascular convergence.

### Artificial intelligence system reduces false-positive findings in the interpretation of breast ultrasound exams [^112fNhXf]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Next, we evaluated the accuracy of readers and the AI system exclusively amongst breasts with pathology-confirmed cancers (97 malignant lesions across 73 breasts). As shown in Supplementary Table 5, we stratified malignant lesions by cancer subtype, histologic grade, and biomarker profile. This was done to further investigate the AI system's ability to discriminate between benign and malignant lesions. Certain types of breast cancers (such as high grade, triple biomarker negative cancers) may closely resemble benign masses (more likely to have oval/round shape and circumscribed margins, less likely to have posterior attenuation compared to other cancers) and are considered particularly difficult to characterize. Although the sample sizes in some subgroups are limited, this analysis demonstrated that the sensitivity of the AI system was similar to that of the readers across all stratification categories. There were no significant differences in sub-populations of patients where the AI system had inferior performance.

Diagnosis

The mammographic appearance of a RS/CSL typically consists of a radiolucent star-shaped lesion, which can be confused with a form of presentation of invasive carcinoma. Over the years, authors have reported certain findings that may be helpful in detecting RS/CSL at mammography, including the presence of radiolucent linear structures paralleling the radiopaque spicules and the "black stars" appearance over the "white stars" appearance of breast cancer. Other typical features are: changing distortion image on different mammographic projections, asymmetry, lack of a palpable mass, and thickening with attraction of the surrounding cutaneous planes. Calcifications are a common finding; in some cases, they may be the sole suspicious finding leading to biopsy (Fig. 6).

Fig. 6

Final histology confirmed a radial scar

Nowadays, the use of recently developed digital breast tomosynthesis techniques has gained momentum, due to their more accurate visualization, characterization, and identification of architectural distortion. Architectural distortion on diagnostic digital breast tomosynthesis has been reported to demonstrate malignancy in over one-third of cases at pathology and also to demonstrate a high-risk lesion at core biopsy in another one-third of cases, with RS being the frequently reported histology among high-risk lesions.

With the increasing use of ultrasound in both screening and diagnostic settings, an increasing number of mammographically occult RS/CSLs have been detected at ultrasound and diagnosed at subsequent ultrasound-guided CNB, ranging from approximately 15.7 to 39% among radial scars without atypia diagnosed at percutaneous biopsy. However, ultrasound findings pathognomonic for RS/CSL and for their differentiation from malignancies have not yet been discovered. The sonographic appearance of RS is variable, ranging from no clear correlate to a hypoechoic, irregular mass with indistinct margins, or a focal area of shadowing with no associated mass. In some cases, RS may show at elastography as inherent stiffness.

Lymphoma

Lymphoma involvement of male breast may be primary or secondary. Secondary cases mostly related to non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma involvement. Physical examination findings are enlarged axillary lymph nodes, single or multiple palpable breast masses. The history of lymphoma is an important clue for the diagnosis. Mammographic imaging findings are "single or multiple, circumscribed or ill-defined lesions" and "multiple, enlarged, circumscribed, oval or lobular, radiodense axillary lymph nodes without apparent radiolucent fatty hilus". Findings in US imaging are "circumscribed or irregular, hypoechoic, solid mass" or "masses accompanied by enlarged axillary lymph nodes with irregularly thickened cortex and without normal echogenic fatty hilus structure" (Fig. 12 f, g).

### Retrospective preoperative assessment of the axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer and literature review [^116pUsr7]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the accuracy of axillary ultrasound, compared with published literature, identify women at low risk for lymph node (LN) involvement, and to determine which clinical, pathological, and imaging findings best predict LN involvement.

Material and Methods

From June 2010 to April 2012, 288 women with breast lesions that were suspicious of malignancy (category 4) or malignant (category 5) underwent axillary ultrasound examination. A 3 mm LN cortical thickness was used as the threshold to prompt fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the LN. Data were gathered regarding size, site, and grade of the index breast lesion and cortical thickness of the LN.

Results

Using a cut-off point of < 3 mm versus ≥ 3 mm, abnormal cortical thickness had a sensitivity and specificity of 56.3% and 86.7%, respectively. Breast cancer size was significantly associated with the odds of LN metastasis (p < 0.001). There were 69 patients with breast cancers of ≤ 10 mm and 18% had positive axillary LNs. A much higher rate of malignancy was observed in breast cancers located in multiple sites and in a central location.

Conclusion

The likelihood of axillary LN metastasis increases with cortical thickness ≥ 3 mm and this concurs with the literature. A low-risk group of women was identified with screen-detected, low-grade small cancers with LNs with a cortical thickness of < 3 mm. Additional features other than cortical thickness > 3 mm (such as shape [rounding], echogenicity [markedly hypo-echoic cortex], and morphology [hilar compressional displacement, loss of echogenic outer capsule and angular margins]) should be used to indicate FNAB in patients with a palpable lump, multiple or central cancers, and cancers > 20 mm.

### Physical examination… [^112DCCiR]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Physical Examination The physical examination should be regionally directed by knowledge of the lymphatic drainage patterns and should include a complete lymphatic examination looking for generalized lymphadenopathy. Skin should be examined for unusual lesions that suggest malignancy and for traumatic lesions, which can be sites of infectious inoculation. Splenomegaly, while rarely associated with lymphadenopathy, focuses the differential on a limited number of disorders, most commonly infectious mononucleosis, 8 but also the lymphomas, the lymphocytic leukemias, and sarcoidosis. 8 and persistent lymphadenopathy is less commonly found in the axillary nodes than in the inguinal chain. Breast adenocarcinoma often metastasizes initially to the anterior and central axillary nodes, which may be palpable before discovery of the primary tumor. Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas rarely manifest solely or initially in the axillary nodes.

17 although this can be the first region discovered by the patient. Antecubital or epitrochlear lymphadenopathy can suggest lymphoma, or melanoma of the extremity, which first metastasizes to the ipsilateral regional lymph nodes. 18, 19. NODAL CHARACTER AND SIZE Lymph nodes that are hard and painless have increased significance for malignant or granulomatous disease and typically merit further investigation. For example, the nodes of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma are firm, fixed, circumscribed, and rubbery. This is in contrast to viral infection, which typically produces hyperplastic nodes that are bilateral, mobile, nontender, and clearly demarcated. Painful or tender lymphadenopathy is non-specific but typically represents nodal inflammation from an infection. In rare cases, painful or tender lymphadenopathy can result from hemorrhage into the necrotic center of a neoplastic node or from pressure on the nodal capsule caused by rapid tumor expansion.

Lymphadenopathy is classically described as a node larger than 1 cm, although this varies by lymphatic region. Palpable supraclavicular, iliac, or popliteal nodes of any size and epitrochlear nodes larger than 5 mm are considered abnormal. DIAGNOSIS Using the factors above as guidance, a thorough history and physical examination should allow physicians to categorize individual cases of lymphadenopathy according to the algorithm in.

### Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis: a diagnostic dilemma for the breast radiologist [^115WCcse]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Fig. 10
Ultrasound of the right breast from the same patient mentioned in Fig. 1 shows an ill-defined heterogenous lesion with increased vascularity (arrow) and tubular extension (arrowhead). Biopsy was done and histopathology was suggestive of granulomatous mastitis

Fig. 11
A 32-year-old woman presented with a lump in the left breast of 6-week duration with no history of associated fever. Ultrasound of the left breast showed an ill-defined heterogeneously hypoechoic collection/lesion (arrow) with overlying skin thickening (arrowhead), which was proven to be granulomatous mastitis on histopathology

In a study by Kiyak et al. parenchymal heterogeneity, irregular hypoechoic mass, and abscess formation were the most common findings. They opined that parenchymal heterogeneity with abscess formation and axillary lymphadenopathy favor an inflammatory process though histopathology is still essential to establish the diagnosis.

Lee et al. found other synchronous findings such as subcutaneous fat obliteration in almost all cases and skin thickening in 91.7% cases. Increased surrounding parenchymal vascularity on Doppler ultrasound has also been reported.

The real dilemma in diagnosis

Since the mammographic and ultrasound findings of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis are nonspecific and may often mimic carcinoma, a definitive histopathological diagnosis is essential before contemplating any surgical procedure.

When there is diffuse involvement of the breast, it is imperative to distinguish idiopathic granulomatous mastitis from inflammatory carcinoma. The most common mammographic finding in the latter is irregular densities with architectural distortion, skin thickening, trabecular prominence due to oedema, and nipple retraction (Fig. 12). Similar mammographic findings may be seen with idiopathic inflammatory mastitis (Fig. 13a and b), which can be confirmed on ultrasound (Fig. 13c, d).

Fig. 12

Associated areolar skin thickening (open arrow) and multiple enlarged axillary lymphnodes (arrowhead) are seen. The lesion was proven to be infiltrating ductal carcinoma on histopathology

### Ovarian cancer metastasis to the breast: radiologic-pathologic correlation [^114Jn9LS]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Ovarian metastasis to the breast is extremely rare. The clinical and radiologic presentation of metastasis to the breast is nonspecific and can mimic primary breast cancers. The most common mammographic findings of ovarian metastasis are superficial, circumscribed, high-density masses without architectural distortion. Compared with other malignancies that metastasize to the breast, ovarian cancer can more frequently show microcalcifications. On US, these masses can be hypoechoic or have heterogeneous echogenicity with posterior acoustic enhancement. Less commonly, ovarian metastasis can present similarly to inflammatory breast cancer, demonstrating diffuse skin thickening on mammography and US. Immunohistochemistry is useful in differentiating ovarian metastasis from primary breast lesions. Ovarian and breast markers, including Wilm's tumor, paired box 8, cancer antigen 125, GATA binding protein 3, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15, are particularly helpful. Overall, metastatic ovarian cancer to the breast provides a diagnostic challenge requiring close radiologic and pathologic correlation to reach the correct diagnosis.

### Society of nuclear medicine procedure guideline for breast scintigraphy [^1146Sr5e]. SNMMI (2024). High credibility.

Breast scintigraphy interpretation criteria — Focal increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in the breast or axilla (in the absence of radiopharmaceutical infiltration) is suspicious for malignancy, while mild homogeneous uptake in the breast or axilla is consistent with a normal study; patchy or diffuse increased radiopharmaceutical uptake in the breasts is probably not consistent with malignancy. Features more suspicious of breast malignancy include focal increased uptake, relatively well-delineated contours, with mid-to-intense radiopharmaceutical uptake and focal increased uptake (1 or more foci) in the ipsilateral axilla in the presence of a primary lesion in the breast, which is strongly suggestive of axillary lymph node metastatic involvement, whereas a linear and superficial axillary uptake on lateral thoracic views usually corresponds to uptake in skin folds. Findings more suggestive of benign disease include diffuse or patchy radiotracer uptake of mild to moderate intensity, often bilateral, with edges not usually well defined.

"In large nodules (diameter > 4 cm), accurate assessment of the profile and regularity of margins may be difficult". "The presence of ill-defined margins is suspicious for malignancy", but definition matters: "Nodule margins are ill-defined when they lack clear demarcation from the surrounding perinodular tissue for most (> 50%) of their perimeter". Notably, "ill-defined but round margins are often observed in benign nodules and should not be viewed as suspicious", whereas "spiculated margins — even when well-demarcated from surrounding thyroid parenchyma — are a highly specific sign of malignancy".

### Well-documented benign sonographic characteristics are rarely seen in malignant masses: is now the time to biopsy less? [^11547mrK]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To determine whether malignant breast masses demonstrate any of the eight well-documented benign criteria on ultrasound (US) to ascertain whether patients that display these characteristics can safely be discharged without intervention reducing the number of unnecessary benign biopsies.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective evaluation was performed of the US images of 816 histologically confirmed breast cancer cases diagnosed from 2016–2018. The malignant lesions were subdivided into seven age categories and compliance with the eight benign (Stavros) characteristics assessed.

Results

None of the 816 malignancies displayed all eight of the described benign Stavros characteristics. The combination of a smooth/well-circumscribed border and an ellipsoid shape with horizontal orientation in addition to being homogeneously isoechoic with three or less gentle lobulations was found in only 0.4% of cases (3/816).

Conclusions

This research adds to the body of literature supporting the robust nature of the Stavros criteria and supports the non-invasive management of lesions that display all of these associated benign features on US. The presence of established benign ultrasound characteristics are very uncommonly seen in malignancies as highlighted in this study, and it is proposed than no breast cancers will display all eight criteria combined. It is suggested that adherence to the well-documented benign characteristics when assessing solid breast lesions could safely obviate the need for biopsy in women of all ages.

### US of ductal carcinoma in situ [^113ivLdd]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Little is known about the ultrasonographic (US) features of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast because this entity usually manifests as pure mammographic calcifications and is rarely evaluated with US. US findings were recorded in 70 patients with DCIS and then analyzed and correlated with mammographic and histologic findings. A microlobulated mass with mild hypoechogenicity, ductal extension, and normal acoustic transmission was the most common US finding in DCIS. Spiculated margins, marked hypoechogenicity, a thick echogenic rim, and posterior acoustic shadowing at US often suggested the presence of invasion. US performed with a 10–13-MHz transducer and optimal technique can be used as a complement to mammography in detecting and evaluating DCIS of the breast, as it demonstrates breast lesions associated with malignant microcalcifications in most cases. The main benefit of identifying a US abnormality in women with mammographically detected DCIS is to allow the use of US to guide interventional procedures (eg, needle biopsy, needle localization). US may also be helpful in detecting DCIS without calcifications and in evaluating disease extent in women with dense breasts. Nevertheless, further research is needed to delineate the role of US in the evaluation of patients with DCIS.

### Breast lesions on chest computed tomography: pictorial review with mammography and ultrasound correlation [^115cxLhD]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

This pictorial review demonstrates computed tomography (CT) features with mammogram and, in some instances, ultrasound and positron emission tomography scan correlation of a wide spectrum of both malignant and benign findings on breast evaluation. Characterization of the margins, shape, pattern of enhancement, density, and associated findings is essential for accurate assessment of breast lesions during CT examination. Spiculated margins, irregular shape, and the presence of enhancement have a high predictive pattern for malignancy. The associated findings that could be seen include skin thickening, lymphadenopathy, architectural distortion, or chest wall or skin invasion. Nearly all detected breast calcifications on chest CT scans are benign. However, any breast masses and calcifications seen need further evaluation by other modalities, such as mammography or ultrasound or both.

### Sonographic appearance of lesions diagnosed as lobular neoplasia at sonographically guided biopsies [^112eFcwE]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of our study was to review the sonographic features of breast lesions yielding lobular neoplasia (LN) at sonographically guided biopsy, evaluate the surgical pathology outcome of these lesions, and determine if imaging findings or clinical features can be used to predict an upgrade to malignancy.

Materials and Methods

Of the 8205 sonographically guided breast biopsies (14-gauge cores) performed from 2007 through 2014, 22 yielded a diagnosis of LN, which means that LN was the most severe pathologic lesion. Imaging features were analyzed in consensus by two radiologists. Correlation of biopsy findings with definitive pathologic results was performed when available.

Results

Twenty-two LN lesions (20 patients [mean age ± SD, 52.05 ± 13.66 years]) were diagnosed at biopsy. Of the LN lesions that were seen on mammography (6/22, 27.3%), most lesions appeared as masses (3/6, 50%). On sonography, LN lesions (mean size, 8.10 mm) appeared as masses (15/22, 68.2%) with oval shape (10/15, 66.7%), well-circumscribed or microlobulated margins (11/15, 73.3%), hypoechoic echotexture (10/15, 66.7%), posterior enhancement (73.3%, 11/15), and parallel orientation (8/15, 53.3%). Most of the masses were categorized as BI-RADS category 4 (21/22, 95.5%). Seven lesions (7/22, 31.8%) appeared as areas of shadowing or distortion without discrete masses. Twenty (20/22, 90.9%) lesions were excised surgically, and pathology results led to an upgrade in five lesions (5/20, 25% [one nonmass lesion and four masses]). Neither mammographic nor sonographic features were associated with malignant outcome (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

LN diagnosed at sonographically guided 14-gauge core needle biopsy does not show any specific features according to the BI-RADS lexicon and is associated with a 25% underestimation rate. No clinical or imaging characteristic is predictive of malignancy.

### Sclerosing adenosis: mammographic and ultrasonographic findings with clinical and histopathological correlation [^11751sun]. European Journal of Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the mammographic and ultrasonographic findings of sclerosing adenosis, a relatively uncommon entity which may sometimes mimic carcinoma.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of the records of 33,700 women, who have undergone mammographic examination at our institution between January 1985 and July 2001 revealed 43 histopathologically proven sclerosing adenosis. The history, physical examination, mammographic and ultrasonographic findings were analyzed in all patients. In 30 patients, the nonpalpable lesions were preoperatively localized by the needle-hookwire system under the guidance of mammography (n = 22) or ultrasonography (US) (n = 8). Radiological features were correlated with histopathological findings.

Results

The age of the patients varied between 32 and 55 years (mean, 43.7 years). Only two patients had a family history of breast cancer. In six patients, the presenting complaint was mastalgia. A palpable mass was present in 13 cases. The mammographic findings were; microcalcifications in 24 (55.8%) (clustered in 22, diffuse in two), mass in five (11.6%), asymmetric focal density in three (6.9%), and focal architectural distortion in three (6.9%) patients. Four of the masses were irregularly contoured, while one was well-circumscribed. On US, focal acoustic shadowing without a mass configuration was noted in the three patients who showed asymmetrical focal density on mammography. In eight patients, who showed normal mammograms, a solid mass was detected on US. Two masses had discrete well-circumscribed oval or lobulated contours, while six showed microlobulation and irregularity. In one case, the irregularly contoured mass had marked posterior acoustic shadowing. Two of the three patients, who had focal architectural distortion on mammograms, had an irregularly contoured solid mass, while the third presented as focal acoustic shadowing without a mass configuration.

Conclusion

Sclerosing adenosis mostly presents as a nonpalpable lesion with different mammographic and sonographic appearances. The most common finding is microcalcifications on mammograms. Awareness of the possible imaging features will enable us to consider sclerosing adenosis in the differential diagnosis. The radiological features may sometimes mimic malignancy, so histopathologic examination is mandatory for definite diagnosis.

### Infiltrative pattern of metastatic invasive lobular breast carcinoma in the abdomen: a pictorial review [^115EWVyX]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Imaging of primary ILC of the breast

Due to its infiltrative pattern of growth, primary breast ILC is often challenging to diagnose on imaging. On mammography, it can manifest as a mass with ill-defined/spiculated margins, focal asymmetry (Fig. 2 a), or architectural distortion. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has been shown to improve the detection of ILC manifesting as asymmetric densities and distortions. On ultrasound, ILC typically appears as an irregular, hypoechoic mass, or ill-defined area of hypoechoic change with posterior acoustic shadowing (Fig. 2 b).

Fig. 2
Primary ILC of the breast in a 61-year-old female who presented with a left breast lump. a Mammogram of the left breast shows focal asymmetry in the inner left breast on CC view (arrowhead), which is not well seen on MLO view. This corresponds to the palpable lump. b Ultrasound of the lower inner left breast demonstrates a corresponding irregular hypoechoic 1.0 cm nodule with posterior acoustic shadowing. This was proven on biopsy to be invasive lobular carcinoma. c Subtracted CEDM of the left breast shows the known ILC is enhancing with spiculated margins (arrowheads), with a tiny adjacent nodule not seen on ultrasound. The tumor measured larger on CEDM (1.6 cm) than on ultrasound (1.0 cm). d Axial contrast-enhanced MRI image of the left breast shows the spiculated, enhancing ILC (arrow), similar in size compared with CEDM. No other suspicious nodules were seen in either breast on CEDM and MRI

Contrast-enhanced studies like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast-enhanced digital mammography (CEDM) visualize the enhancing neovascularity of tumors and greatly improve assessment of tumor extent (Fig. 2 c, d) and delineation of non-mass enhancement. Contrast-enhanced studies also improve detection of unsuspected multifocal, multicentric, and bilateral disease, which is important for surgical planning.

Primary ILC demonstrates lower standardized uptake values (SUV) and is less appreciable than primary NST on 18 F-FDG PET/CT.

### Imaging findings and classification of the common and uncommon male breast diseases [^1126sH1y]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Pilomatricoma

It is rare benign neoplastic skin tumor originating from piliferous follicles, which is also known as "calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe". The most accused etiological factor is repeated skin trauma. Physical examination findings are non-tender, firm, palpable breast mass. The inflammatory phenomena with or without skin ulceration may also be seen. Radiologically, pilomatrixoma is seen as nodular opacity with punctate or heterogeneous calcifications, in mammography and mostly well-defined, circumscribed, parallel-oriented, heterogeneous mass composed of solid-cystic areas and hyperechoic calcifications with acoustic shadowing in US. Internal vascularity in Doppler imaging may also be seen (Fig. 9 e, f).

Hemangioma

This rare vascular lesion of male breast is formed by proliferation of vascular channels lined by endothelial cells. It is located in either dermal or subcutaneous layers. Hemangioma may be asymptomatic or may present as palpable superficial breast mass, on physical examination. Imaging findings seen in mammography are well-defined, ovoid or lobulated, superficial mass with high density and internal coarse calcifications representing phleboliths. Sonographic findings are well-defined, ovoid or lobulated, superficial, non-hyperechoic lesion with an abrupt interface, with or without internal complex structure. Rarely, these vascular lesions could be seen as hyperechoic mass with indistinct margins.

Schwannoma

This rare neoplasm arising from Schwann cells are seen as smooth, painless, soft mass, on physical examination. NF-2 related types have higher malignity potential than sporadic types. The mammographic findings are well-defined, round or oval mass. Well-defined, hypoechoic, solid mass with acoustic enhancement are typical sonographic findings. The other sonographic findings are complex heterogeneous mass with central cystic component and internal vascularity.

Granular cell tumor

Granular cell tumor is a rare benign neoplastic tumor arising from perineural Schwann cells of the peripheral nerves. Physical examination findings are painless, solid, non-tender nodule in the upper inner quadrant of the breast. These nodules can be multifocal. Imaging findings are non-specific and variable with a wide-range spectrum from "circumscribed mass with posterior acoustic enhancement" to "ill-defined mass with posterior acoustic shadowing". They can mimic primary breast cancer.

Mucinous carcinoma

Mucinous carcinoma (or colloid carcinoma) is an uncommon entity, accounting for between 1 and 7% of all breast cancers, with an increasing prevalence with age. Mucinous carcinomas can be subdivided into two histological subtypes, pure or mixed, depending on the mucin content. On mammography, mucinous carcinoma usually presents in the form of a well-circumscribed, lobular or microlobular oval mass. Ultrasound classically reveals a hypoechoic or isoechoic, rarely hyperechoic, microlobular mass (Fig. 15).

Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)

ILC is the second most common form of breast carcinoma after invasive ductal carcinoma, characterised by tumour cells invading the breast parenchyma either separately or in chains. The most commonly observed mammographic appearance is that of a spiculated mass, but asymmetric density and architectural disorganisations are observed more frequently than in IDC (Fig. 16). As for IDC, ultrasound usually reveals a hypoechoic mass with spiculated margins and posterior attenuation. In contrast, ILC can present atypical characteristics such as the absence of a clearly defined mass or hyperechogenicity. Hyperechoic presentations are 10 times more frequent in ILC than in IDC.

### Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis: imaging update and review [^115jcVLB]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Mammography was available in 16 cases. IGM presented mammographically as unilateral focal or regional asymmetry in 12 patients (Fig. 1). There was associated architectural distortion and irregular mass in four cases. Interestingly, one case presented at screening mammography with segmental coarse heterogeneous calcifications (Fig. 5). Mammography failed to identify an abnormality in four patients (24%), presumably due to overlapping dense breast parenchyma obscuring potential findings.

Ultrasound (n = 15) demonstrated a hypoechoic mass(es) with indistinct, irregular or angular margins, hyperechoic rim and internal vascularity (Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 6). Posterior acoustic shadowing was noted in four cases (Fig. 4). Sonographically reactive appearing nodes were identified in the ipsilateral axilla of eight patients. Fine needle aspiration of axillary lymph nodes in three cases showed similar results: mixed lymphocytic population consistent with a reactive lymph node. Hypoechoic sinus tracts were noted to interleave between otherwise normal parenchyma, extending between masses or to the skin in seven cases (Fig. 2).

### Rare lymphoid malignancies of the breast: report of two cases illustrating potential diagnostic techniques [^11462Z9N]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Two cases of lymphoid malignancy involving the breast are herein presented. Both patients were admitted with a palpable breast mass. Ultrasound demonstrated hypoechoic, ill-defined lesions of the breast in both patients; mammogram also showed spiculated breast densities. Both patients underwent core biopsy, which revealed lymphomatous cells. Total-body evaluation was also performed by computed tomography and positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealing no other fluorodeoxyglucose-avid foci in the first case and supra and subdiaphragmatic disease in the second one.

Fig. 5
Normal lymph node: On ultrasound, lymph nodes typically are smooth, gently lobulated ovals with a hypoechoic cortex measuring less than 3 mm in thickness with a central echogenic hilum

Fig. 6
Abnormal lymph nodes: characteristics concerning for malignancy: a absence of the fatty hilum and b increased focal cortical thickness greater than 3 mm with colour Doppler US that shows hyperaemic blood flow in the hilum and central cortex or abnormal (non-hilar cortical) blood flow

A focal cortical bulge (Fig. 7) or thickening is considered the earliest detectable morphologic change in the presence of metastasis, but this criterion is difficult to apply and has a low positive predictive value because it is non-specific. This finding is therefore considered indeterminate. A true abnormal cortical bulge is seen as focal thickening of the cortex that does not follow the margin of the echogenic hilum and should be distinctly hypoechoic, and this sign is more accurate if associated with another finding such as the presence of cortical in addition to hilar blood flow. Diffuse cortical thickening can also be seen with metastasis, but this finding is even more non-specific, more often being associated with a reactive node. Eccentric cortical thickening is more suspicious than diffuse thickening, but both are non-specific and concerning enough to warrant intervention in most cases (Fig. 8). Findings seen in cases with more advanced nodal involvement, such as effacement of the fatty hilum or a rounded hypoechoic mass, have a higher positive predictive value in patients with invasive breast cancer. Replacement of the entire node or a portion of the node by an ill-defined mass is highly suspicious for malignant involvement. Occasionally, nodal microcalcifications can be seen on imaging (Fig. 7).

### High-risk lesions of the breast: concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^111ib5Ld]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Imaging findings are not specific, and ADH can be found in the peripheries of a papillary lesion and even inside a fibroadenoma. At mammography, ADH can be seen as microcalcifications, mainly amorphous with grouped, linear, or regional distribution. It can also arise as a mass with or without microcalcifications. Only seldom is ADH detected at ultrasound. According to Mesurolle et al. the sonographic appearance of ADH is non-specific but differs from invasive carcinoma; most ADH lesions appear as an irregular-shaped small hypoechoic non-mass or even mass lesion with micro-lobulated edges, no posterior acoustic features, and parallel orientation to breast parenchyma (Figs. 1, 2). Similarly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of ADH are non-specific; however, a non-mass enhancement is more frequent. In Table 3, the most frequent imaging findings of ADH as well as the other type of high-risk lesions have been reported.

### A practical approach to imaging the axilla [^1177JCZd]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Lymph nodes

Although the axilla is partially imaged on mammography, axillary lymph nodes can often be seen. Classically, benign axillary lymph nodes typically are smaller than 2 cm in maximal size and have a hilar radiolucent notch. Increased size and/or increased density of a node on mammography raises concern for pathology. However, ultrasonography provides the best means to assess the axillary nodes given its relatively sensitive and highly specific capabilities. A normal or benign-appearing axillary lymph node should have an oval or lobulated shape and a smooth, well-defined margin. The lobulated shape is because of concurrent constrictions and bulges of both the cortex and fatty hilum. The cortex should be slightly hypoechoic and uniformly thin, measuring 3 mm or less (Fig. 5). Nodes that meet this description have a very high negative predictive value for excluding metastases. The echogenic hilum should constitute the majority of the node. Arterial flow in the hilum can be demonstrated with colour Doppler imaging. Morphologic criteria, such as cortical thickening, hilar effacement and non-hilar cortical blood flow, are more important than size criteria in the identification of metastases. Characteristics of lymph nodes that are concerning for malignancy besides overall size include round shape, absence of the fatty hilum, and increased concentric or focal cortical thickness greater than 3 mm, all being predictors of malignancy (Fig. 6).

### Hyperechoic breast images: all that glitters is not gold! [^117Co6Bq]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Siliconoma

Siliconoma is an inflammatory resorption granuloma arising in contact with droplets of free silicone gel, related to capsular rupture or free silicone injections. On mammography, siliconoma presents as a mass isodense to prosthetic silicone. Ultrasound shows a hyperechoic mass containing fine echoes with marked attenuation of the ultrasound beam, with a "snowstorm" appearance masking all posterior structures (Fig. 11). The diagnosis is guided by the clinical context and the ultrasound features, without the need for biopsy.

Complex sclerosing lesion

Complex sclerosing lesions are benign breast lesions comprising a combination of sclerosing lesions with a variety of proliferative epithelial lesions. Radial scar is a sclerosing lesion with a fibro-elastotic centre surrounded by a radial crown composed of sometimes cystic lobules and ductules, sometimes presenting proliferative lesions. In 30% of cases, radial scar is associated with ductal carcinoma in situ or a tubular carcinoma. On ultrasound, it presents as a poorly circumscribed, round or lobular zone, inducing architectural distortion with variable echogenicity, more often hypoechoic, sometimes associated with posterior attenuation (Fig. 12). The diagnosis of these lesions must be based on histological examination of a percutaneous biopsy. When histological examination reveals a diagnosis of associated cancer, the tumour can be treated immediately (including sentinel node biopsy in the case of invasive cancer). When histological examination is negative for cancer, surgical exploration is indicated to avoid missing a focal malignant lesion not detected by percutaneous biopsy.

### Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis: a diagnostic dilemma for the breast radiologist [^113woVdo]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Ultrasound imaging

Ultrasound is done using a high frequency (7–10 MHz) linear probe and appearances of this entity are varied. Generally, a hypoechoic or heterogeneous mass(es) is noted, with characteristic tubular hypoechoic extensions connecting the dominant mass to smaller nearby masses (Fig. 7). Larsen et al. in their study of 54 cases, found an irregular hypoechoic lesion with tubular extension as the most frequent finding and an isolated ill-defined hypoechoic or heterogeneous lesion (Figs. 8 and 9) as the second most common finding. When a mass is detected, colour Doppler examination may be done to assess vascularity.

Parenchymal heterogeneity and distortion with or without acoustic shadowing may also be seen with absence of a definite mass.

Sometimes a well-defined collection with low level mobile internal echoes may be present with tubular hypoechoic extension to the subcutaneous tissues and skin (Fig. 10). Associated changes such as overlying skin thickening and nipple retraction can also be seen in a few cases (Fig. 11).

### A practical approach to imaging the axilla [^1166KQ6K]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Knowledge of the normal axillary anatomy aids in determining the underlying aetiology of an axillary mass. The differential diagnosis of an axillary mass is broad, including skin lesions, infections, haematoma, lymphadenopathy (hyperplastic, inflammatory, neoplastic or metastatic), accessory breast tissue, fibroadenoma, fibrocystic change, post-operative fluid collections, primary breast cancer and intramuscular neoplasms. For most cases, imaging evaluation entails diagnostic mammography and targeted ultrasound. If intervention is warranted, FNA or core needle biopsies are safe and accurate methods for diagnosis and for guiding the management of an axillary mass.

### Tubulolobular carcinoma of the breast: clinical, mammographic and sonographic findings [^1112sgR1]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine and quantitate radiologic characteristics of tubulolobular carcinoma of the breast and to report clinical and pathologic findings.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of records of 2872 women who received a diagnosis of breast carcinoma between January 1988 and January 2006 revealed 26 histopathologically proven tubulolobular carcinoma of the breast. Analysis included history; findings at physical examination, mammography, and sonography (US) at the time of diagnosis and in postoperative follow-up, and histopathological results.

Results

At physical examination, palpable mass was present in 85% (n = 22) of the patients. The mammographic findings were mass in 17 (65%), asymmetric focal density in 2 (8%), architectural distortion in 2 (8%) and negative mammograms in 5 (19%) of the 26 patients. US depicted 25 masses in 24 patients, all of which were hypoechoic, with spiculated (n = 13) or microlobulated (n = 12) margins. The cancer was clinically occult in 12% (n = 3), mammographically occult in 19% (n = 5), and radiologically occult in 4% (n = 1) of the patients. Histologically, the mean size of the tumor was 1.7cm and 18 (69%) patients were node negative.

Conclusion

Tubulolobular carcinoma of the breast usually manifests clinically as a firm, immobile mass and mammographically as a spiculated or ill-defined, irregular, isodense mass without microcalcifications. Common findings on sonography include a homogeneously hypoechoic, spiculated or microlobulated mass with posterior acoustic shadowing or normal acoustic transmission. Tubulolobular carcinoma should be included in the differential diagnosis for breast masses with these imaging features.

### Artificial intelligence system reduces false-positive findings in the interpretation of breast ultrasound exams [^112Q8Nko]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Given the limitations of mammography, ultrasound (US) plays an important role in breast cancer diagnosis. It often serves as a supplementary modality to mammography in screening settingsand as the primary imaging modality in many diagnostic settings, including the evaluation of palpable breast abnormalities. Moreover, US can help further evaluate and characterize breast masses and is therefore frequently used for performing image guided breast biopsies. Breast US has several advantages compared to other imaging modalities, including relatively lower cost, lack of ionizing radiation, and the ability to evaluate images in real time. In particular, US is especially effective at distinguishing solid breast masses from fluid-filled cystic lesions. In addition, breast US is able to detect cancers obscured on mammography, making it particularly useful in diagnosing cancers in women with mammographically dense breast tissue.

Despite these advantages, interpreting breast US is a challenging task. Radiologists evaluate US images using different features including lesion size, shape, margin, echogenicity, posterior acoustic features, and orientation, which vary significantly across patients. Ultimately, they determine if the imaged findings are benign, need short-term follow-up imaging, or require a biopsy based on their suspicion of malignancy. There is considerable intra-reader variability in these recommendations and breast US has been criticized for increasing the number of false-positive findings. Compared to mammography alone, the addition of US in breast cancer screening leads to an additional 5–15% of patients being recalled for further imaging and an additional 4–8% of patients undergoing biopsy –. However, only 7–8% of biopsies prompted by screening US are found to identify cancers.

### Pure lobular carcinoma of the breast presenting as a hyperechoic mass: incidence and imaging characteristics [^114tNT8C]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of invasive lobular carcinomas with increased sonographic echogenicity.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of mammographic and sonographic findings included cases of pure invasive lobular carcinoma with available images from January 1998 to June 2010. We assessed ultrasound images for the presence of a mass, internal echogenicity, margin characteristics, and attenuation effects. In hyperechoic tumors, more than 90% of the mass had increased echogenicity compared with surrounding fat. In heterogeneously echogenic tumors, the echogenic component constituted 20–90% of the tumor. Findings at mammography, MRI, and surgery were correlated with sonographic findings. A breast pathologist reviewed histologic findings and confirmed the diagnosis of pure invasive lobular carcinoma.

Results

Of 509 invasive lobular carcinomas, 27 (5%) were hyperechoic, of which 13 (48%) were associated with posterior acoustic shadowing. Heterogeneously echogenic cancer was seen in 57 (11%) cases. The most common sonographic finding was a hypoechoic, irregular mass with or without posterior shadowing (n = 323; 63%). In 66 (13%) lesions, focal shadowing was seen without a discrete mass. Fourteen (3%) lesions were isoechoic with respect to surrounding normal adipose tissue without acoustic shadowing. Twenty-two (4%) of the malignant tumors were not identified sonographically. Of these, 15 (68%) had mammographic abnormalities, one (5%) was seen at MRI, and six (27%) presented as palpable masses that were surgically excised.

Conclusion

Pure invasive lobular carcinomas can present as a hyperechoic mass or with substantial hyperechoic component. All sonographic lesion characteristics should be evaluated and biopsy recommended when there are suspicious features, even in a lesion that is predominantly hyperechoic.

### Ultrasound of superficial lymph nodes [^115nG6Ht]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

US is a powerful tool for characterization of superficial lymph nodes. Unlike other imaging techniques like CT and MRI, which mainly depend on size for differential diagnosis, US can evaluate important parameters such as shape, margins, internal structure and abnormal vascularization. It has the advantage of showing early subtle findings of neoplastic involvement like asymmetric thickening and focal lobulations in the cortex, as well as late findings such as diffuse cortical thickening and absence of hilum. It is possible to evaluate the heterogeneous inner structure due to necrosis, unsharp or irregular borders due to extracapsular spread and abnormal vascularization with multiple subcapsular feeding vessels due to tumor angiogenesis. The advances in US technology like high-resolution transducers, power Doppler function and contrast agents have all contributed to the well established role of US in the evaluation of lymph nodes. This article mainly focuses on the sonographic criteria for differential diagnosis of normal, reactive, inflammatous and neoplastic lymph nodes as well as examination techniques in the neck, axilla, internal mammary and inguinal regions and indications in various clinical settings.

### Granulomatous diseases of the breast and axilla: radiological findings with pathological correlation [^1175cRwV]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Mammography

Mammography shows variable features, ranging from normal-appearing in patients with dense breast tissue to discrete masses. There is often focal or regional asymmetry, solitary mass or masses, skin thickening, skin or nipple retraction and axillary lymphadenopathy. The affected breast is larger than the contralateral breast and calcifications are exceedingly rare. The mammographic appearance can be indistinguishable from invasive or inflammatory breast cancer.

Ultrasound

On ultrasonography, multiple contiguous hypoechoic masses have been considered suggestive of the disease with skin fistulae common in advanced cases. Posterior acoustic enhancement and shadowing have both been described. Doppler imaging demonstrates increased vascularity and in advanced cases fluid collections and cavities can be seen. Ultrasound is useful in documenting sinus tracts and in the evaluation of any enlarged axillary reactive lymph nodes.

MRI

MRI is indicated to assess the extent of disease and in assessment of the contralateral breast. It is best reserved for advanced, aggressive or refractory disease and can be used to assess disease progression or regression over time. The MRI findings are variable depending on the severity of the inflammation, with both heterogeneous ill-defined masses and non-mass enhancement being described. Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis demonstrates marked parenchymal enhancement most often with progressive or plateau kinetics. There are often areas of increase T2 signal representing fluid collections. The involved parenchyma demonstrates restricted diffusion with ADC valves consistently lower than seen in normal breast parenchyma.

Histology

On histopathologic examination, non-caseating granulomatous inflammation is centred on lobules. Common end-stage features of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis are fat necrosis, abscess formation and fibrosis.

Sarcoidosis

The aetiology of sarcoidosis is unknown, and usually the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, spleen, and liver are involved. Breast involvement is rare, occurring in less than 1% of patients with systemic sarcoidosis.

Clinical

Mammary lesions are usually detected after the diagnosis of sarcoidosis has already been well established, and only rarely does sarcoidosis present initially as a breast disease. Like sarcoidosis elsewhere, it usually affects women in their 20s and 30s and can manifest as a firm, hard mass mimicking breast cancer or lymphadenopathy. In 20% of reported cases of sarcoidosis of the breast, the initial presentation is a breast mass. The characteristic clinical finding is a non-tender, mobile breast mass with other organ involvement and an increased level of angiotensin-converting enzyme.

### Assessing the role of ultrasound in predicting the biological behavior of breast cancer [^114fdR6B]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to correlate various ultrasound features of breast cancer with tumor grade, and with estrogen, progesterone, and ERRB2 (formerly HER2) receptor status as well as to assess the predictive value of these features.

Materials and Methods

The features of breast cancers found by using ultrasound between January 2010 and June 2011 were reviewed for tumor size, margins, and posterior acoustic features. The tumor margins were classified into spiculated, angular, indistinct, lobulated or microlobulated, and circumscribed. The posterior acoustic features were classified into shadowing, enhancement, mixed pattern, and no change. The individual features were correlated with the estrogen receptor (ER)-progesterone receptor (PR) and ERRB2 receptor status and tumor grade.

Results

Among 160 patients with breast cancer, 102 (63.8%) were ER-positive/PR-positive, 32 (20.0%) were ER-positive/PR-negative, and 26 (16.3%) were ER-negative/PR-negative (22 were triple-negative). Tumors with posterior shadowing have greater than nine times the odds of having ER-positive findings (95% CI, 2.09–40.81; p = 0.011) and greater than 13 times the odds of having a lower-grade tumor (I or II vs III; 95% CI, 4.90–36.54; p < 0.001) than those without posterior shadowing. Tumors with posterior enhancement have greater than eight times the odds of having at least one negative receptor (95% CI, 3.97–18.11; p < 0.001) and 24 times the odds of having a high-grade tumor (95% CI, 9.91–58.14; p < 0.001) than those without posterior enhancement.

Conclusion

The presence of posterior shadowing is strongly associated with an ER-positive and low-grade tumor, whereas the presence of posterior enhancement is strongly associated with a high-grade tumor and with moderate risk of being receptor negative.

### Tumor proliferation and invasiveness derived from ultrasound appearances of invasive breast cancers: moving beyond the routine differential diagnosis [^115UeqRS]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the correlation between ultrasound (US) appearances of invasive breast cancers and tumor proliferation and invasiveness measured according to the histologic grade, Ki-67 expression, axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM), and lymphovascular invasion (LVI).

Methods

This study evaluated 676 patients who underwent primary surgical treatment of invasive breast cancers. The preoperative US reports and postoperative pathologic and immunohistochemical results of the patients were retrospectively reviewed. Ultrasound characteristics were evaluated according to the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictive US features that were correlated with tumor proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancers. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated.

Results

Posterior acoustic enhancement and calcifications on US images were independent predictive factors of a higher histologic grade and a higher Ki-67 level (OR, 1.69–6.54; P < .05). Meanwhile, a noncircumscribed margin (OR, 2.61; P < .05) and posterior acoustic shadow (OR, 1.62; P < .05) were independent predictors of ALNM. An irregular shape (OR, 2.13; P < .05) and calcifications (OR, 1.69; P < .05) were independent risk factors for LVI. Infiltrative breast cancers scored as BI-RADS category 5 had higher probability to be associated with ALNM (OR, 3.33; P < .0005) and LVI (OR, 2.87; P < .0005).

Conclusions

Ultrasound features of invasieve breast cancers might have a predictive value for tumor proliferation and invasiveness. The US features correlated with a high cellular proliferation rate were different from those associated with ALNM. The tumor shape, margin, posterior acoustic pattern, and calcifications at US are suggested to be considered by clinicians when making clinical decisions.

### Hyperechoic breast images: all that glitters is not gold! [^1131ZPgN]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Hyperechogenicity is a sign classically reported to be in favour of a benign lesion and can be observed in many types of benign breast lesions such as hamartoma, lipoma, angiolipoma, haemangioma, haematoma, fat necrosis, fibrosis and galactocele, among others. However, some rare malignant breast lesions can also present a hyperechoic appearance. Most of these hyperechoic malignant lesions present other characteristics that are more typically suggestive of malignancy such as posterior shadowing, a more vertical axis or irregular margins that help to guide the diagnosis. Post magnetic resonance imaging, second-look ultrasound may visualise hyperechoic malignant lesions that would not have been identified at first sight and radiologists must know how to recognise these lesions.

Teaching Points

- Some rare malignant breast lesions can present a hyperechoic appearance.

- Malignant lesions present other characteristics that are suggestive of malignancy.

- An echogenic mass with fat density on mammography does not require biopsy.

### Tubular carcinoma of the breast: mammographic, sonographic, clinical and pathologic findings [^116Yjbpt]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine and quantitate the radiological characteristics of tubular carcinoma of the breast, to report clinical and pathologic findings and to define findings at follow-up.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of records of 2872 women who received a diagnosis of breast carcinoma between January 1988 and January 2006 revealed 32 histopathologically proven pure tubular carcinoma of the breast. Analysis included history; findings at physical examination, mammography, and sonography (US) at the time of diagnosis and in postoperative follow-up and histopathological results.

Results

Fifty-nine percent of the patients (n = 19) presented with a palpable mass. The mammographic findings were a mass in 23 (72%), a mass with microcalcifications in 2 (6%), asymmetric focal density in 1 (3%), architectural distortion in 1 (3%) and negative in 5 (16%) of the 32 patients. Most (96%) masses had spiculated margins. US depicted 30 masses in 29 patients, all of which were hypoechoic, mostly (n = 27, 90%) with posterior acoustic shadowing. The cancer was clinically occult in 41% (n = 13), mammographically occult in 16% (n = 5), and sonographically occult in 6% (n = 2) of the patients. Histologically, the tumor was multifocal in 3% (n = 1) of the patients. Four (13%) patients developed contralateral breast carcinoma at follow-up.

Conclusion

Tubular carcinoma has a variety of presentations, but it is mostly seen on mammography as a small spiculated mass, and on sonography as an irregular mass with posterior acoustic shadowing. Although tubular carcinoma is known as a well-differentiated tumor with excellent prognosis, the mammographic follow-up of the contralateral breast is important.

### Granulomatous diseases of the breast and axilla: radiological findings with pathological correlation [^115LNV9s]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Mammography

On mammography, breast sarcoidosis can present as bilateral, irregular or spiculated masses (Fig. 9). Very small, well-defined round masses have also been described and may represent intramammary lymph node involvement. Calcifications are typically not seen.

Fig. 9
Sarcoidosis. A 72-year-old woman had a prior skin biopsy showing sarcoidosis. a Bilateral mediolateral-oblique views and magnification view show multiple spiculated masses in both breasts. These had been unchanged for 5 years. b Positron emission tomography showed multiple areas of increased uptake in mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes. Histopathological examination of left breast ultrasound-guided biopsy specimens showed non-caseating granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis (not shown)

Ultrasound

Irregular, hypoechoic masses with indistinct margins are the most common finding on ultrasonography.

MRI

Various appearances have also been observed. Inhomogeneous signal intensity masses with irregular contours, rapid enhancement and early "washout" are most common.

PET/CT

Increased uptake on positron emission tomography can cause sarcoidosis to be mistaken for metastatic breast carcinoma (Fig. 9). It is important for clinicians and radiologists to be aware that imaging findings and systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis can be confused with those of metastatic breast cancer.

Histology

Gross pathological findings consist of firm to hard, tan tissue that may have well-defined or indistinct borders and can measure up to 5 cm in diameter. Microscopic examination shows epithelioid granulomas with multinucleated giant cells. The lesions classically do not have caseous necrosis or calcification, and fat necrosis is not found in the surrounding breast. Associated lymphocytes and fibrosis are often present. Not all non-necrotising granulomas are sarcoidosis; however, other causes of non-necrotising granulomas need to be excluded. The diagnosis requires exclusion of these other causes and often clinical evidence of sarcoidosis elsewhere. Stains and cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungus should be negative. These studies are indicated even in patients with previously diagnosed sarcoidosis, because secondary infections can develop, especially in patients who have had corticosteroid treatment.

### Granulomatous diseases of the breast and axilla: radiological findings with pathological correlation [^113PHbtK]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical

Most cases of fat necrosis occur postoperatively or after radiation therapy. The condition is typically asymptomatic; however, when it is symptomatic, 97% of patients present with a palpable abnormality. This is usually within a periareolar or superficial location. In a few cases, bruising and tenderness (26%), skin tethering or dimpling (14%) or nipple retraction (9%) occur. Palpable breast abnormalities that are associated with fat necrosis may enlarge, remain unchanged, regress or resolve.

The increasing use of breast-conserving surgery and mammoplasty has given rise to a greater number of cases of fat necrosis. Middle-aged women with pendulous breasts are at the most risk.

Mammography

On mammography, the most common findings of fat necrosis are oil cysts, coarse calcifications, focal asymmetries or spiculated masses, but there is a wide spectrum of mammographic imaging findings, ranging from benign to indeterminate to malignant appearing masses and calcifications. Visualised masses may be radiolucent with a thin, well-defined capsule, both radiolucent and dense with encapsulation, dense and circumscribed, or may have indistinct or spiculated margins. Lipid cysts are pathognomonic of benign fat necrosis, although the fibrous rim of the cyst may collapse and produce an appearance that is mammographically suspicious (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Fat necrosis. A 48-year-old woman with prior bilateral prophylactic mastectomies and implant reconstruction presented with a palpable abnormality on the inner aspect of the right breast. a Mammography showed new grouping of pleomorphic-appearing calcifications with associated irregular mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast (red arrow). b Ultrasound showed a heterogeneous, complex, cystic and solid oval mass with no vascularity. c Post-contrast axial MRI showed mild peripheral enhancement with central, non-enhancing fat consistent with benign fat necrosis (red arrow). d Histological photomicrograph (original magnification ×10, haematoxylin-eosin) showed calcification (blue star), vacuolisation and saponification of the remnants of the necrotic fat (red arrow), epithelioid macrophages and lymphocytes (yellow arrow). Normal fat is also visualised (green arrow)

Ultrasound

On sonography, the appearance of fat necrosis ranges from a solid hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic shadowing to complex intracystic masses that evolve over time (Fig. 5). The other common sonographic finding is an area of increased echogenicity in the subcutaneous tissue with or without small cysts and architectural distortion.

Pitfalls and limitations

The lymph nodes can be considered the most challenging anatomical elements to sonographically assess in the axillary region; indeed, while matching multiple morphological parameters, several "gray zones" of differential diagnosis between benign and malignant lymphadenopathy are still the subject of debate. In this sense, we have reported some technical aspects aiming to avoid unnecessary misinterpretation of ultrasound images in clinical practice.

Axillary lymph nodes usually present a less bright hilum compared to other anatomical sites, and this site-related variation should not be misinterpreted as a pathological finding; moreover, in very small (normal) lymph nodes, it is not always clearly visible hyperechoic hilum.

In the advanced phases of infectious diseases, lymph nodes can develop focal necrosis and colliquative phenomena with marked disorganization of the histological architecture acquiring a globular shape similar to malignant lymphadenopathies. Moreover, calcific depositions within the lymphoid tissue, skin fistulizations and extracapsular abscesses can be related to specific infectious lymphadenopathy, further complicating the differential diagnosis.

Perfusion pattern of low-grade lymphomas can be quite similar to that of reactive lymphadenitis (lymphoid hyperplasia) with a saving of the cortical zone and hypertrophy of the vessels in the hilum (Additional file 19: Video 19); in this sense, all the sonographic parameters must be accurately coupled with a medical history and physical examination. Granulomatous lymphadenopathy can show a very poor vascularization on color/power Doppler — due to fibrotic/necrotic evolution of the lymphoid tissue — mimicking a malignant lymph node.

### Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis: imaging update and review [^111iaP8k]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Mammographic findings in IGM include focal or regional asymmetry, a solitary mass or masses, skin thickening, skin and nipple retraction and axillary lymphadenopathy. In our series, the most common mammographic finding was a moderate-sized focal asymmetry corresponding to a region of palpable concern (Fig. 1). Regional asymmetry, trabecular thickening or multifocal involvement may also be noted in the affected breast. Skin thickening may occur, particularly when findings are noted in the anterior depth tissue. Nevertheless, mammography can also be normal, particularly in patients with dense breasts and/or a mild inflammatory response (Fig. 4). In many cases, the affected breast may appear larger than the contralateral breast, a finding most apparent on the full field mediolateral oblique view. Calcifications are exceedingly rare, but have been reported in IGM (Fig. 5). Importantly, the mammographic appearance of IGM can be indistinguishable from invasive or inflammatory breast cancer prompting further imaging evaluation.

Ultrasound is helpful for evaluation of palpable abnormalities in patients with a normal mammogram (Fig. 4). Sonographic findings in IGM are variable and can include masses, architectural distortion, parenchymal edema, fluid collections, skin thickening and axillary lymphadenopathy. The most common ultrasound findings are of a mixed echogenicity but predominantly hypoechoic mass with angular, irregular or indistinct margins, with or without sinus tracts insinuating into adjacent parenchyma (Figs. 2, 4 and 6). There are variable degrees of posterior acoustic phenomena, including both enhancement and shadowing (Fig. 4). Doppler imaging demonstrates increased internal blood flow within lesions and the surrounding breast parenchyma (Figs. 6 and 8). In advanced cases, disease may present as fluid collections or abscess cavities, which can be aspirated for microbiological analysis. Ultrasound is useful for documentation of sinus tracts extending to the skin surface, a finding that can be seen with delay in diagnosis or history of prior intervention (Fig. 2). Ultrasound is also helpful in evaluation of enlarged axillary lymph nodes, which most often demonstrate smooth reactive cortical thickening.

### Invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast: clinical, mammographic, and sonographic findings with histopathologic correlation [^1131akC6]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to investigate the imaging features of invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast, which is a recently described, rare variant of infiltrating ductal carcinoma.

Conclusion

Invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast usually manifests as a firm, immobile mass. Findings on mammography are of a spiculated, irregular or round, high density mass with or without associated microcalcifications. On sonography, the common findings are of a homogeneously hypoechoic, irregular or microlobulated mass with posterior acoustic shadowing or normal sound transmission. Axillary lymph nodes are frequently involved. Although these findings are not specific and may be seen with other breast malignancies, invasive micropapillary carcinoma should be included in the differential diagnosis for breast masses with these imaging features. Also, radiologic findings may help in the histopathologic differentiation of cases that are difficult to diagnose, such as metastatic tumors.

Data and image analysis

Radiologic variables were collected by reviewing each image retrospectively in consensus by two radiologists (initials blinded) with nine and 14 years of experience in breast imaging who were blinded to the final pathologic outcome. The BI-RADS lexicon was used to describe the mammographic, US, and MRI features. In cases in which the lesion showed no imaging findings, the lesion characteristics were classified as non-visible. The lesion sizes were dichotomized to evaluate the effect of size on the upgrade to invasive cancer by setting a cutoff value of 2 cm, as reported previously. The following mammography features were evaluated: breast density, lesion characteristics (mass/focal asymmetry, calcifications, combined or non-visible), and lesion size. A mass detected on mammography was evaluated for its shape (oval/round or irregular) and margins (circumscribed/obscured or not circumscribed). Calcifications on mammography were assessed for their morphology (fine linear/branching, fine pleomorphic, coarse heterogeneous/amorphous, or benign appearance) and distribution (linear/segmental or grouped/regional/diffuse).

The following US features were also evaluated: lesion characteristics (mass, non-mass lesion [NML], or non-visible), lesion size, shape (oval/round or irregular), margin (circumscribed or not circumscribed), orientation (parallel or nonparallel), echo pattern (isoechoic, hypoechoic, hyperechoic, or complex/heterogeneous echoic), posterior acoustic features (no posterior feature, enhancement, shadowing, or combined), presence of suspicious axillary LNs, calcifications, and vascularity. An NML was defined as a focal hypoechoic area presenting as a confined asymmetry on two orthogonal planes that could not be characterized as a distinct mass owing to the lack of conspicuous margins or shape that also differed from the surrounding glandular tissue. In addition, the vascularity on color Doppler US was determined according to the number of vessels within or around the lesion and was categorized as low (no flow or only one vessel flow signal observed) or high (more than two vessel flow signals observed).

### Radiologic-pathologic correlation at breast MR imaging: what is the appropriate management for high-risk lesions? [^117HcdLb]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is increasingly performed for a variety of indications, most commonly with the goal of detecting breast cancer. Percutaneous biopsy (usually under MR guidance or ultrasound if there is a correlating finding) is commonly used to evaluate suspicious imaging findings detected on MR imaging with the goal of identifying malignancy. It is important to be familiar with the characteristics and management of high-risk lesions detected or biopsied under MR guidance. This review focuses on the appearance of a variety of breast lesions detected on MR imaging that require excision with focus on pathologic correlation.

Assessment of sonographic and mammographic images

US images were retrospectively collected from the institutional image archive servers. US was performed using Aixplorer (Supersonic Imaging), Logic E9 (GE Healthcare), XMATRIX and IU22 (Philips Medical Systems), Aplio 500 (Toshiba medical system), and Mylab90 and MylabTwice (Esaote). Each breast tumor mass was assessed with respect to size (maximum diameter), orientation, shape, margin, echo halo, echo pattern, posterior acoustic pattern, and calcification. For patients with multiple lesions, only the largest tumor mass was evaluated. Abnormal axillary lymph nodes on US were defined as those with irregular cortical thickness ≥ 3 mm, longest/shortest axis ratio < 2, or absence of fatty hilum. To avoid inter-observer variations in BI-RADS scores, all breast masses were reevaluated and classified into three subcategories based on the number of malignant features in US images: no malignant sonographic features; 1–2 malignant sonographic features, and ≥ 3 malignant sonographic features. Malignant sonographic features included vertical orientation, irregular shape, uncircumscribed angular and/or spiculated margin, presence of echo halo, posterior acoustic shadow, and presence of calcification. The sonographic features were evaluated by two US physicians, with at least 5 years' experience in breast imaging, according to the fifth edition of the ACR BIRADS® Atlas.

All mammograms were performed using digital MG units (Selenia Dimensions, HOLOGIC, and Inspiration, SIEMENS). Breast density was classified as non-dense (predominantly fatty or scattered fibroglandular) and dense (heterogeneously or extremely dense). Each lesion was described as a mass, calcification only, architectural distortion, asymmetry, and normal mammographic findings. The shapes and margins of the masses and the morphology and distribution of calcifications were then evaluated. All the breast lesions were also reevaluated and classified into three groups according to the number of malignant features in mammographic images: no malignant mammographic features; 1–2 mammographic malignant features; and ≥ 3 malignant mammographic features. The malignant mammographic features included irregular shape, uncircumscribed margin, calcification morphology (amorphous, coarse heterogeneous, fine pleomorphic, and fine branching), calcification distribution (grouped, segmental, and branching), architectural distortion, and asymmetry. All mammographic features were assessed by two radiologists with at least 5 years' working experience in MG.

### Hyperechoic breast images: all that glitters is not gold! [^1169JLZL]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Possibly hyperechoic malignant lesions

Breast cancers, regardless of their histology, are typically hypoechoic. Breast cancer can rarely be hyperechoic, but other ultrasound features are usually also present, suggesting the diagnosis, such as poorly circumscribed margins, irregular shape, posterior attenuation, a more vertical axis. Ultrasound characterisation must take the most pejorative parameter into account.

Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)

IDC accounts for 75% of all breast cancers. On mammography, IDC presents in the form of a spiculated mass, asymmetric density or architectural distortion. On ultrasound, IDC classically presents as a hypoechoic mass, although a hyperechoic or mixed echogenicity lesion may be observed (Fig. 14). In the series published by Skaane et al. 4/194 (2%) of IDCs were hyperechoic. The mechanisms responsible for hyperechogenicity have not been clearly elucidated, but may be related to tumour heterogeneity or the invasion-front-associating thick bands of collagen, adipose tissue and tumour cell proliferation.

### Interreader variability and predictive value of US descriptions of solid breast masses: pilot study [^115qtgd2]. Academic Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

This study evaluated the specificity of ultrasound (US) characteristics of solid breast lesions and the interreader variability in their interpretation.

Materials and Methods

In 61 patients, 70 sonographically visible solid masses, scheduled for biopsy because of findings from conventional imaging, were prospectively and sequentially accrued for evaluation. Three readers interpreted the sonograms and described the solid masses in terms of established US characteristics. The specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) for each characteristic were calculated by comparing US findings with biopsy findings, and interreader variability was evaluated. Five assessment categories were developed to guide recommendations for patient care. The relative performance of each reader was assessed by measuring the PPV for each assessment category and by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

Results

The specificity and PPV were calculated for all characteristics and for each reader. The average specificities of the three readers for the most frequently used six characteristics were as follows: spiculation, 97% ± 5 (standard deviation); taller than wide, 91% ± 4; central shadowing, 77% ± 1; markedly hypoechoic, 86% ± 5; duct extension, 95% ± 5; and microlobulation, 84% ± 3 (overall average specificity, 88.5%). The average PPVs for categories II-V were 5%, 10%, 63%, and 94%, respectively. The readers' interpretations were similar and correlated well.

Conclusion

The proposed US recommendation system is an accurate predictor of histologic findings. A sonographic classification lexicon should prove valuable.

### Hyperechoic breast images: all that glitters is not gold! [^111CzQkY]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The very great majority of hyperechoic masses of the breast are benign, and the diagnosis is often guided by the clinical setting. Most malignant lesions are hypoechoic compared to fat, especially when using the harmonic mode. However, malignant lesions can sometimes present in the form of hyperechoic or mixed echogenicity images, in which case other signs suggestive of malignancy are generally present: a more vertical axis, irregular shape, spiculated margins, posterior attenuation or hypervascularisation. Second-look post-MRI ultrasound may visualise hyperechoic malignant lesions that would not have been identified at first sight.

Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a hyperintense lesion on axial fat‐suppressed T2WI (C), homogeneously enhancing on axial postcontrast sequence (D), hyperintense on sagittal STIR (E), and contrast‐enhanced on sagittal postcontrast subtraction images (F), with a type 3 kinetic enhancement curve observed on the dynamic series (G, H). The mass lesion was irregularly shaped with spiculated borders (white arrows). Additionally, left axillary lymphadenopathy was observed on axial fat‐suppressed T2WI, contrast‐enhanced, and dynamic images. The histopathological diagnosis was confirmed as invasive ductal carcinoma.

### Ultrasound and MR imaging of diabetic mastopathy [^115br7ek]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Aim

To review the imaging findings of diabetic mastopathy, and document the colour flow ultrasound and MR imaging features in this benign condition.

Materials and Methods

Diabetic mastopathy was clinically and histologically diagnosed in eight lesions in six women. All six women underwent conventional mammography and high frequency grey-scale ultrasound. Colour flow ultrasound was performed additionally in six lesions in four women and MR imaging in four lesions in three women before biopsy. The imaging findings were reviewed and correlated with final histological diagnosis.

Results

Mammography showed regional asymmetric increased opacity with ill-defined margins in all lesions. A heterogeneously hypoechoic mass with ill-defined margins was identified on high frequency grey-scale ultrasound in all lesions. Marked posterior acoustic shadowing was present in seven of eight (88%) lesions. Six lesions interrogated with colour flow ultrasound showed absence of Doppler signal. MR imaging in three women revealed non-specific stromal enhancement.

Conclusion

Diabetic mastopathy shows absence of Doppler signal on colour flow ultrasound and non-specific stromal enhancement on MR imaging.

Ill-defined focal asymmetry noted on the right medio-lateral oblique screening mammogram (arrow). b Ultrasound shows an irregular principally hyperechoic mass (arrows) extending to involve the skin with central areas of hypoechogenicity

Ultrasound

The sonographic features of BL are variable. The most frequent appearance of BL at ultrasound is of a hypoechoic, irregular mass with indistinct margins (Fig. 1). Interestingly, in the series reported by Surov et al. approximately half of all cases demonstrated circumscribed margins. Heterogeneity of echo texture with hyperechoic regions, particularly a thick echogenic rim, may be also seen. This predominantly echogenic appearance was noted in approximately 23% of our cases (Figs. 2 and 4). Lesions mimicking cysts were seen in four of our cases demonstrating marked hypoechogenicity and posterior acoustic enhancement. BL masses may have no internal vascularity seen on colour Doppler evaluation in up to 55% of cases. However, Doppler analysis was helpful to differentiate BL from a cyst in a case of an anechoic mass (Fig. 3). No posterior acoustic phenomenon was seen sonographically in 64% of cases in the series of Yang et al; however, Liberman et al. found posterior acoustic enhancement in 71% (5/7) of cases. Posterior acoustic shadowing is not a feature of BL and this may be due to lack of desmoplastic reaction. Elastography was performed in one case from our series. The mass was soft and was smaller on the elastogram than on B-mode imaging suggestive of a benign lesion. This is most likely due to the highly cellular nature with lack of desmoplastic reaction in some types of lymphoma. Three patients only had axillary adenopathy identified sonographically in our series.

### Nonmass lesions on breast US: an international perspective on clinical use and outcomes [^11327yJ6]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Nonmass lesions (NMLs) on breast US are defined as discrete areas of altered echotexture compared to surrounding breast tissue and lack the 3-dimensionality of a mass. They are not a component of American College of Radiology BI-RADS, but they are a finding type included in the Japan Association of Breast and Thyroid Sonology lexicon. Use of the NML finding is routine in many Asian practices, including the Samsung Medical Center and Seoul National University Hospital, and their features and outcomes have been investigated in multiple studies. Nonmass lesions are most often observed when US is used to evaluate mammographic asymmetries, suspicious calcifications, and nonmass enhancement on MRI and contrast-enhanced mammography. Nonmass lesions can be described by their echogenicity, distribution, presence or absence of associated calcifications, abnormal duct changes, architectural distortion, posterior shadowing, small cysts, and hypervascularity. Malignant lesions, especially ductal carcinoma in situ, can manifest as NMLs on US. There is considerable overlap between the US features of benign and malignant NMLs, and they also must be distinguished from normal variants. The literature indicates that NMLs with linear or segmental distribution, associated calcifications, abnormal duct changes, posterior shadowing, and hypervascularity are suggestive of malignancy, whereas NMLs with only interspersed small cysts are usually benign fibrocystic changes. In this article, we introduce the concepts of NMLs, illustrate US features suggestive of benign and malignant etiologies, and discuss our institutional approach for evaluating NMLs and an algorithm that we use to guide interpretation in clinical practice.

### Imaging findings and classification of the common and uncommon male breast diseases [^1111RJd5]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papilloma

It is a benign neoplasm of the intraductal epithelium with fibrovascular core. It may present with nipple discharge or palpable, painless, mobile, subareolar mass, on physical examination. Intraductal papilloma is, also, one of the benign conditions associated with gynecomastia. Imaging findings are discrete, dense mass in subareolar region with or without gynecomastia in mammography and subareolar, eccentric, elongated, well-defined, hypoechoic mass within dilated cystic ducts in US. "Stalk" of internal vascularity can be seen in Doppler US imaging. The differentiation of intraductal papilloma from papillary carcinoma is not possible with imaging alone; that is why the pathologic correlation is needed (Fig. 9 a, b).

Myofibroblastoma

Myofibroblastoma is an uncommon benign mesenchymal neoplastic lesion of the breast. It is more frequent in males than females and it affects mostly adult male population. Myofibroblastoma is seen as a mobile, well-defined, solid lump, on physical examination. Imaging findings identified in mammography are well-defined, encapsulated, heterogeneous tumor without microcalcifications. Sonographic findings are well-demarcated tumor, mixed echo pattern, and acoustic attenuation, probably, due to fat component (Fig. 9 c, d).

Case 6: Management of benign lesions

A 46-year-old woman underwent a screening US, and a mass of difficult interpretation was detected (Fig. 7 a) with shadowy margins, although still well-defined, slightly inhomogeneous, and with poor vascularization on color Doppler. CEM was performed as a problem-solving technique.

Fig. 7
The absence of any suspicious findings is noted in both the RC and LE images corresponding to the location in the breast where a nodule was detected. The nodule presented challenges in interpretation through breast ultrasound

Structured report example

Indication: Problem-solving of nodules with difficult interpretation
Technique: Examination conducted after intravenous administration of iodine-based contrast medium (1.5 mL/kg). Two minutes after injection, DM projections (cranio-caudal and medio-lateral-oblique) were acquired at both LE (26–32 kVp) and HE (45–49 kVp). An RC image was then reconstructed to highlight any contrast medium uptake.
Observations Breast composition (LE Fig. 7 b–c): Heterogeneously dense (ACR C) BPE (RC): Moderate (Fig. 7 c–d) Findings LE image (Fig 7 b–c): No specific breast changes are evident. Associated features: No RC image (Fig. 7 c): No suspicious enhancement
Assessment category: BI-RADS 1
Management: The patient was scheduled for a US evaluation after 1 year. The nodule did not display significant changes on US after this period, confirming its benign nature. CEM can again be a problem-solving tool to prevent unnecessary biopsies in patients with benign lesions.

Tips: The absence of enhancement on CEM of a breast lesion holds significant predictive value for its benign nature. However, the presence of enhancement does not invariably indicate malignancy. The latest version of BI-RADS incorporates several descriptors enabling the assignment of a suspicion grade to the lesion, thereby optimizing biopsy requests for benign lesions. Among the newer descriptors is lesion conspicuity, defined as the enhancement intensity relative to the surrounding parenchyma. According to recent studies, high lesion conspicuity is most strongly correlated with lesion malignancy. An intriguing addition to the descriptors is "ground glass", denoting the ability to visualize the breast parenchyma underlying the lesion enhancement. Unpurified enhancement (lacking the ability to see the underlying parenchyma) appears most associated with lesion malignancy. Lastly, the controversial practice of acquiring late CEM projections (typically 7 min from the start of acquisition) is gaining popularity. Nonetheless, progressively increasing enhancement is often linked with benignity.

### Role of sonography in the differentiation of benign, high-risk, and malignant papillary lesions of the breast [^112NouNT]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess the sonographic features of benign, high-risk, and malignant papillary lesions of the breast.

Methods

We conducted a search of our institution's breast biopsy database for all papillary lesions with sonographic findings and final surgical pathologic diagnoses from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2009. We retrospectively reviewed the breast sonographic findings of 23 benign papillomas, 14 papillomas with associated atypical ductal hyperplasia, and 14 papillary carcinomas, all surgically proven. These 51 lesions in 50 patients comprised our data set. The imaging reports, pathologic records, and surgical records of these patients were reviewed, and statistical analysis was performed.

Results

The findings for 50 patients (age range, 26–92 years; mean, 55.2 years) with 51 lesions were reviewed. One patient had bilateral breast cancer. Size and margin features showed statistically significant differences (P < .05) between the lesions. Twelve (47.9%) benign papillomas, 10 (71.4%) high-risk lesions, and 13 (92.9%) malignant lesions were larger than 1 cm. Sixteen (69.6%) benign papillomas, 10 (71.4%) high-risk lesions, and only 4 (28.6%) malignant lesions had circumscribed margins. With regard to echo pattern, there was a statistically significant difference between the lesions (P < .01). Twenty (87.0%) benign papillomas, 4 (28.6%) high-risk lesions, and 10 (71.4%) malignant lesions were hypoechoic. Posterior sonographic features were also statistically significant (P < .05), with malignant and high-risk lesions being associated with posterior enhancement or shadowing. Another statistically significant difference (P < .01) was intralesional vascularity, which was seen more frequently with malignant lesions. Regardless of lesion type, the distance from the nipple, shape, orientation, surrounding tissue change, and associated calcifications were not significant.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that sonographic features that may potentially assist in differentiating papillary lesions include size, margin, echo pattern, posterior features, and intralesional vascularity.

South Korean ultrasound-based classification — category definitions — divides nodules into three categories: probably benign, indeterminate, and suspicious for malignancy; suspicious for malignancy is defined when at least one of the following is present: taller-than-wide shape, spiculated margins, marked hypoechogenicity, and micro- or macrocalcifications. Indeterminate nodules show US features without definite malignant or benign characteristics, including isoechogenicity, mild hypoechogenicity, or hyperechogenicity; an ovoid-to-round shape; a smooth or ill-defined margin; and presence of continuous rim calcification. Probably benign nodules include simple cysts, predominantly (> 50%) cystic nodules with reverberating artifacts, and isoechoic nodules with a spongiform appearance.

Mammography

BL may be identified incidentally on screening mammograms. Solitary non-calcified masses represent the most common reported mammographic finding in BL. Lesions may be bilateral in up to 28%. Margin analysis is less consistent. In a contemporary series reported by Surov et al. margins were circumscribed in 66% of cases, lobulated in 30% and indistinct in 3%. However, indistinct margins were noted in 72% of cases in a series reported by Yang et al. Spiculated margins are rarely demonstrated. BL presenting as architectural distortion is also rare. In our series, approximately half of all BL cases represented irregular masses with indistinct margins (Fig. 1), and one-third demonstrated circumscribed margins (Figs. 2 and 3). Four cases presented as a developing asymmetry (Fig. 4), and one case as architectural distortion. Diffuse infiltration by lymphomatous deposits may also occur but may be obscured at mammography in patients with dense breast tissue. Ipsilateral axillary nodal involvement has been shown to be present in more than 40% of patients with primary BL, although this was seen in only 3/19 (16%) of our cases. The size of primary BL lesions range from 1 to 5 cm in Yang et al.'s series with secondary BL tending to be smaller in size and more often multiple.

### Differential diagnosis of lung lesion in breast carcinoma: a metachronous neoplasm or metastasis? [^1178KmuN]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 34-year-old woman-a diagnosed case of pT1N1MO, stage IIa, estrogen and progesterone receptor positive (ER, PR) positive, Her2 negative carcinoma of the left breast-was managed with modified radical mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. While planning for radiotherapy, she was found to have a well-defined enhancing lesion with spiculated margins in the superior segment of the right lower lobe along with a heterogeneously enhancing right hilar lymph node on CT. Histopathological evaluation of the lesion was suggestive of adenocarcinoma. The lesion was negative for ER, PR receptors, mammoglobin and gross cystic disease fluid protein. Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) was positive, suggesting a primary lung adenocarcinoma rather than metastatic lesion from the breast. This case clearly signifies the importance of histopathological diagnosis of suspicious metastatic lesions in the setting of early breast cancer. We would also like to highlight the importance of TTF-1 in differentiating primary lung malignancy from metastasis.

### Breast disease in the pregnant and lactating patient: radiological-pathological correlation [^114C4NPY]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Normal imaging appearance of the breast in pregnancy and lactation

The imaging appearance on mammography, ultrasound and MRI is variable depending upon the duration of pregnancy and/or lactating state. An overall diffuse increase in breast density accompanied by breast enlargement is commonly seen on mammography (Fig. 1a, b). Given increased density of the breast the sensitivity of mammography is low (30% for dense breast compared with 80% for fatty breast), and cancer detection may be somewhat difficult. Murphy et al. evaluated patients with false-negative mammograms and symptomatic cancer, and found that 78% of the mammographically occult lesions were in women with heterogeneously or extremely dense tissue. The imaging features of breast cancer on the mammogram are identical to those seen in non-pregnant women These are spiculated or irregular masses, pleomorphic linear branching or grouped microcalcifications, focal asymmetries and architectural distortion. Detection is sometimes difficult as the overlying dense tissue may obscure the findings.

Fig. 1
Normal pregnancy and lactational change: a 39-year-old woman, lactating for 3 months. a Note the larger breast size and increased density of parenchyma in spite of pumping prior to imaging on right MLO view compared with b, reduced density of parenchyma on mammogram performed prior to pregnancy. c Pregnancy change: a 38-year-old woman, 24 weeks pregnant presents with breast pain. Note diffuse hypoechogenicity due to enlargement of non-fatty fibroglandular components during pregnancy. d Increased echogenicity with ductal prominence, which is typical appearance of a lactating breast on grey-scale ultrasound

Ultrasound has a better sensitivity in pregnant and lactating patients, ranging from 86.7 to 100%. On ultrasound, the breast predominantly appears diffusely hypoechoic during pregnancy due to enlargement of the non-fatty fibroglandular component (Fig. 1c), whereas during lactation there is diffuse hyperechogenicity with prominent ducts and vascularity during lactation (Fig. 1d). Typical imaging findings for breast cancer on ultrasound are hypoechoic to isoechoic irregular mass with or without associated posterior shadowing; occasionally there may be posterior acoustic enhancement due to central necrotic components. Colour Doppler helps assess vascularity of the mass lesion.

### The utility of the fifth edition of the BI-RADS ultrasound lexicon in category 4 breast lesions: a prospective multicenter study in China [^113CHoVD]. Academic Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of the fifth edition of the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) in clinical breast radiology by using prospective multicenter real-time analyses of ultrasound (US) images.

Materials and Methods

We prospectively studied 2049 female patients (age range, 19–86 years; mean age 46.88 years) with BI-RADS category 4 breast masses in 32 tertiary hospitals. All the patients underwent B-mode, color Doppler US, and US elastography examination. US features of the mass and associated features were described and categorized according to the fifth edition of the BI-RADS US lexicon. The pathological results were used as the reference standard. The positive predictive values (PPVs) of subcategories 4a-4c were calculated.

Results

A total of 2094 masses were obtained, including 1124 benign masses (54.9%) and 925 malignant masses (45.1%). For BI-RADS US features of mass shape, orientation, margin, posterior features, calcifications, architectural distortion, edema, skin changes, vascularity, and elasticity assessment were significantly different for benign and malignant masses (p < 0.05). Typical signs of malignancy were irregular shape (PPV, 57.2%), spiculated margin (PPV, 83.7%), nonparallel orientation (PPV, 63.9%), and combined pattern of posterior features (PPV, 60.6%). For the changed or newly added US features, the PPVs for intraductal calcifications were 80%, 56.4% for internal vascularity, and 80% for a hard pattern on elastography. The associated features such as architectural distortion (PPV, 89.3%), edema (PPV, 69.2%), and skin changes (PPV, 76.2%) displayed high predictive value for malignancy. The rate of malignant was 7.4% (72/975) in category 4a, 61.4% (283/461) in category 4b, and 93.0% (570/613) in category 4c. The PPV for category 4b was higher than the likelihood ranges specified in BI-RADS and the PPVs for categories 4a and 4c were within the acceptable performance ranges specified in the fifth edition of BI-RADS in our study.

Conclusion

Not only the US features of the breast mass, but also associated features, including vascularity and elasticity assessment, have become an indispensable part of the fifth edition of BI-RADS US lexicon to distinguish benign and malignant breast lesions. The subdivision of category 4 lesions into categories 4a, 4b, and 4c for US findings is helpful for further assessment of the likelihood of malignancy of breast lesions.

### To look or not to look? Axillary imaging: less may Be more [^116y66bD]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Axillary lymph node status in patients with breast cancer is an important prognostic indicator and often guides vital treatment decisions. Although in many cases imaging plays a crucial role in the assessment of the axilla, it is essential that targeted axillary US and/or image-guided biopsy of an axillary lymph node be performed by the radiologist only when clinically appropriate. This decision-making process requires multidisciplinary communication and collaboration among radiologists, surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists. Our goal is to review axillary imaging for patients with breast cancer in two distinct clinical settings, the patient with newly diagnosed breast cancer who meets American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 criteria and patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with a specific focus on potential reasons to not perform axillary US and/or image-guided biopsy in these settings.

Malignant entities

Pregnancy-Associated Breast Cancer (PABC)

Breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or within the first year after delivery is referred to as pregnancy-associated breast cancer. It accounts for 1–2% of all newly diagnosed breast cancers each year and affects one out of every 3,000 live births. Typically presenting as a painless palpable lump, diagnosis is often delayed as physical examination of the pregnant and lactating breast is challenging. Overall, PABC is biologically aggressive with the majority of these tumours being oestrogen and progesterone receptor negative and Her2-neu receptor positive. The biological nature of these tumours consequently bodes a poorer prognosis. During pregnancy, ultrasound remains the optimal tool for imaging. However, if a suspicious finding is seen on the ultrasound in a pregnant patient, mammography should be performed. Imaging findings on both mammography and ultrasound of PABC is identical to cancer presenting in a non-pregnant or non-lactating woman. Ultrasound may reveal a circumscribed to spiculated hypoechoic to complex mass with irregular shape, posterior shadowing and non-parallel orientation (Fig. 14). Though cancers usually show posterior acoustic shadowing, in one study of 22 cases, posterior acoustic enhancement was seen in 12 of the 22 patients, likely reflecting the necrotic/cystic degeneration seen in these aggressive tumours. Other associated findings include thickening of the Cooper's ligaments, oedema, skin thickening and axillary lymphadenopathy. Mammography permits evaluation of microcalcifications, multifocality and multicentricity. Typically, a mass with or without associated pleomorphic calcifications is seen (Fig. 14). Secondary findings might include architectural distortion, nipple or skin retraction and lymphadenopathy. MRI is not typically done in pregnant patients, but can be safely performed in lactating patients. MRI is done for staging and to evaluate extent of disease. MRI may reveal a circumscribed to irregular mass with type II or type III enhancement kinetics. Other findings include non-mass-like enhancement and ductal enhancement.

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS (FIGURE 1 AND FIGURE 2)

Diagnostic work-up of an abnormality in the breast

Clinical examination

Figure 1
Diagnosis–clinically detectable breast abnormality.

Figure 2
diagnosis–impalpable mammographic abnormality.

In patients with locally and regionally advanced disease, clinical examination is likely to be of greater diagnostic value than in patients with less advanced disease (standard). Tumours with the following characteristics are unlikely to be operable, and are associated with a poor short-term prognosis: inflammatory change, deep extension, lymphadenopathy, breast oedema and/or lymphoedema in the upper limbs. These factors also indicate an increased risk of locoregional and metastatic recurrence (standard). Thus, nonoperability is not always due to difficulties associated with the surgery itself. Surgery may still be appropriate, however, to achieve local control, despite a poor prognosis. Imaging can be used to confirm findings from clinical examination. In some cases, clinical examination will be normal, so that the diagnosis will only be possible following imaging (standard).

Diagnostic imaging

A standard bilateral mammogram with two views (front and external oblique), can be complemented by other views and by ultrasonography (standard). The equipment used for mammography should undergo regular quality control (standard). To confirm the diagnosis, additional views and enlargements may be necessary (option).

Specific imaging is not indicated in the examination of lymphadenopathy. Standard reporting of mammograms should be used in which the stated diagnosis is based on the mammographic features suspicious of malignancy using the American College of Radiology classification (recommendation).

The diagnostic findings should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team. When the level of suspicion from imaging justifies histological verification, this should be done using interventional breast diagnostic techniques in an outpatient setting under a local anaesthetic.

Pretreatment diagnosis

The diagnosis of malignancy can be obtained from cytology (fine-needle aspiration) or tissue sample (core biopsy), whereas the diagnosis of an invasive carcinoma can only be made from a biopsy sample (standard).

The histological diagnosis of impalpable lesions should be compared with the diagnostic hypotheses generated from diagnostic imaging (recommendation). The diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical hyperplasia from a needle biopsy sample should always be reconfirmed using a sample obtained by surgical excision (recommendation, level of evidence: B1). Regular assessment of the diagnostic performance of image-guided biopsy systems is recommended (recommendation, expert agreement).

### Sonographic findings of axillary masses: what can be imaged in this space? [^115Kts83]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of axillary masses can be challenging because various tumors can develop in parts of the axilla other than lymph nodes, even though we frequently encounter axillary masses in daily practice. These lesions include soft tissue masses associated with nontumorous conditions (accessory breast tissue and chronic granulomatous inflammation) and benign and malignant tumorous conditions (lipomas, epidermal inclusion cysts, lymphangiomas, fibroadenomas, schwannomas, malignant neuroendocrine tumors, and lymph node-associated diseases). In this pictorial essay, we display commonly encountered sonographic findings of various axillary lesions to assist in the differential diagnosis of axillary masses.

### Fibromatosis of the breast mimicking an abscess: case report of unusual sonographic features [^111x3yb5]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Fibromatosis of the breast, also known as a desmoid tumor, is extremely rare and most often appears as an aggressive lesion mimicking breast carcinoma. It lacks metastatic potential but can grow aggressively in a localized area. Ultrasonography often shows an irregular spiculated hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic shadowing. We discuss a case of breast fibromatosis that presented as a painful palpable breast mass in a 32-year-old woman and mimicked an abscess in the sonogram. We found that this lesion displayed atypical sonographic features such as a heterogeneous echoic mass with an internal anechoic area.

### Invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast: imaging features with clinical and pathologic correlation [^1173fGiQ]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to present imaging findings of invasive ductal carcinoma with micropapillary features with clinical and pathologic correlation.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively searched our institution's surgical pathology database for patients with pathologically proven invasive ductal carcinoma with micropapillary features. Forty-one patients with images available for review were included in the study. Mammographic, sonographic, and MRI findings were assessed using the American College of Radiology's BI-RADS lexicon. Molecular breast imaging findings were reviewed using a molecular breast imaging lexicon. Imaging findings were correlated with clinical presentation and pathologic findings.

Results

Mammographically, the most common finding was an irregular spiculated mass. Sonographically, the most common finding was an irregular hypoechoic mass with spiculated margins and posterior acoustic shadowing. With MRI, the most common finding was an irregular mass with washout kinetics, but we also observed diffuse heterogeneous nonmasslike enhancement throughout the breast. Molecular breast imaging was available for one patient and showed multicentric radiotracer uptake. Analysis of 39 pathologic specimens showed 27 (69%) with angiolymphatic invasion. Axillary nodal metastases were present in 23 patients (59%), nine (23%) with extranodal extension.

Conclusion

The imaging features of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast with micropapillary features typically were highly suggestive of malignancy. The malignancies were strongly associated with lymphovascular invasion and lymph node metastases. Radiologists should be aware of the imaging features of this unusual variant and should consider axillary sonography if this entity is found in a core needle biopsy specimen.

### Imaging findings of primary breast sarcoma: results of a first multicenter study [^114dTVwH]. European Journal of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate imaging findings in patients with primary breast sarcoma (PBS).

Materials and Methods

A retrospective search in the databases of 10 radiological departments in Germany from 2000 to 2011 was performed. Only histologically proven cases of PBS were included into the study. Mammography was available in 31 patients (33 lesions), ultrasound images in 24 patients (24 lesions), and for 10 patients (14 lesions) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast was performed. The breast findings were classified according to the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RADS) 5th edition categories. Collected data were evaluated by means of descriptive statistics.

Results

Forty-two female patients (mean age 62.0 years, range, 30–86 years) were included in the study. Clinically, all women had painless lumps. Irregular (53.3% [16/30]) or oval (30.0% [9/30]) mass with indistinct (73.3% [22/30]) or microlobulated (10% [3/30]) margins were common findings on mammograms. Ultrasound revealed typically an irregular (79.2% [19/24]), hypoechoic (62.5% [15/24]) mass, with indistinct margins (79.2% [19/24]), and posterior acoustic shadowing (79.2% [19/24]). MRI showed irregular masses (81.8% [9/11]) with irregular or spiculated margins, and a rapid initial signal increase with a delayed washout in kinetic analysis.

Conclusion

Overall, PBS has no pathognomonic imaging features and can mimic those of invasive mammary carcinoma. Breast sarcoma should be taken into the differential diagnosis of breast findings described above.

### Lymph node imaging in patients with primary breast cancer: concurrent diagnostic tools [^113diD6g]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Mammography and Tomosynthesis

MG is the standard imaging modality for screening for breast disease. On the mammogram, the normal axilla is seen as an area with almost fatty density, sometimes containing small normal or reactive lymph nodes and accessory breast tissue. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for mammography were 66.9%, 80.8%, 41.3%, 92.3%, and 78.4% 20. It is not considered reliable for the evaluation of lymph node involvement in the setting of a recent breast cancer diagnosis because of limited spatial resolution and because parts of the axillary area may not be visualized (Fig. 1) 21. Valente et al. conducted a retrospective study of 244 consecutive patients diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma and found that MG had the highest false‐negative rate in detecting lymph node involvement in patients with breast cancer 5. However, MG can raise the suspicion of malignancy by identifying enlarged nodes (lymphadenopathy) in specific cases such as lymphoma or carcinoma of unknown primary.

Figure 1
Female patient aged 40 years with an invasive ductal carcinoma in the left breast. (A): Left digital mammography, mediolateral‐oblique projection, demonstrates a high‐density lymph node in axilla and an irregular mass, spiculated, in the upper quadrants. (B): Ultrasonography confirmed the suspicious nature of the mass (Breast Imaging – Reporting and Data System [BI‐RADS] score 5) and a single enlarged lymph node in the axilla suspicious for metastatic involvement.

Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is also of limited value for assessing axillary nodes. The overall haziness of the axillary region on some mediolateral oblique or lateral images is a limitation from synthesizing multiple homogeneous images. The pectoral muscle has homogeneous soft‐tissue contrast without much variation; therefore, the soft‐tissue attenuation will dominate the axillary region. In addition, high‐attenuation materials in the axillary region (i.e. the shoulder) may cause more prominent artifacts compared with those at full‐field digital mammography, which are likely caused by the DBT image acquisition arc, which amplifies high‐attenuation artifacts 22.

### Breast MR imaging in a patient with unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy and unknown primary malignancy [^11116DAW]. European Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Bilateral invasive breast cancers were detected on MR imaging in a patient with left unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy and normal findings at physical examination, mammography, and ultrasound of both breasts. One spiculated and a second ill-defined enhancing lesion in the left breast as well as a superficial circumscribed lesion in the right breast were proven to be invasive malignancies. In patients with isolated axillary lymph nodes and occult primary malignancy, breast MRI can identify or exclude the breast as primary site, which proves the superiority and diagnostic benefit of this imaging method and also its contribution to the therapeutic approach.

### Imaging… [^115Tz9iD]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

15 With the patient supine and one arm raised, the physician thoroughly palpates breast tissue on the raised-arm side in the superficial, intermediate, and deep tissue planes; axilla; supraclavicular area; neck; and chest wall, assessing the size, texture, and location of any masses. Benign masses generally cause no skin change and are smooth, soft to firm, and mobile, with well-defined margins. Diffuse, symmetric thickening, which is common in the upper outer quadrants, may indicate fibro-cystic changes. Malignant masses generally are hard, immobile, and fixed to surrounding skin and soft tissue, with poorly defined or irregular margins.

The latter group includes patients who have had breast-conserving surgery; patients with known carcinoma in whom multifocal, ipsilateral, or contralateral disease must be ruled out; patients with axillary metastasis and an unknown primary; patients with extensive postoperative scarring; and patients with extremely dense parenchyma. Although MRI improves detection of early breast cancers in carriers of BRCA mutations, it has a lower specificity than mammography, which requires additional evaluations. It also has a limited sensitivity in detecting ductal carcinoma in situ. 34 FNA also is used with ultrasonography or stereotactic imaging to further assess poorly defined palpable masses. When sampling in patients with solid lesions is adequate, FNA is highly sensitive for malignancy and has a positive predictive value of 99 percent and a negative predictive value of 86 to 99 percent.

35 Sample adequacy is of some concern; one study 36 rated 28 percent of samples as inadequate and another 22 percent as less than optimal. The physician's training and experience may be a key factor in obtaining adequate samples.
36. If FNA is not feasible during the initial presentation, ultrasonography should be considered to rule out cystic disease and delineate lesion margins. 22, 48 Cystic lesions may be aspirated. Solid lesions should be evaluated with mammography, which often can be done during the same visit, to further delineate lesion margins and to screen for occult disease in the ipsilateral and contralateral breast, particularly in women older than 40 years. 49 Solid lesions will then require FNA or CNB 48 to complete the triple test. Further management should be implemented as described in Figure 2.

### Neuroendocrine differentiated breast carcinoma: imaging features correlated with clinical and histopathological findings [^113d7UAQ]. European Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe the imaging features of neuroendocrine differentiated breast carcinoma (NEDBC) and to correlate the radiological findings with the clinical and histopathological findings. A retrospective review of the mammograms of 1845 histopathologically proven breast cancer cases revealed five NEDBC. The clinical, imaging, and histopathological findings were analyzed. On mammography, a high-density mass was seen in all patients. The shape of the mass was round in 4 and irregular in 1 patient. The margins were spiculated in 2, indistinct in 1, microlobulated in 1, and partially obscured in 1 patient. On sonography, 4 patients had homogeneously hypoechoic masses with normal sound transmission. In 1 patient the mass was heterogeneously hypoechoic with mild posterior acoustic enhancement. The margins were microlobulated in 2, irregular in 2, and well-circumscribed in 1 patient. Neuroendocrine differentiated breast carcinoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of mammographically dense, round masses with predominantly spiculated or lobulated margins. Sonographically, they mostly present as irregular or microlobulated, homogeneously hypoechoic masses with normal sound transmission.

Ultrasound

Sonographically, breast leukaemia may present as single or multiple heterogeneous hypoechoic masses. Of the cases where margins were reported, the majority had indistinct or microlobulated margins. Breast lesions were sonographically visible in all six of our patients with CLL, with all cases demonstrating hypoechoic masses; half of which were circumscribed (Fig. 6) and the other half demonstrating irregular shape and angular margins (Fig. 5). Increased vascularity was noted on colour Doppler interrogation (Fig. 5). Breast elastography was performed in one case. The tumour was hard on strain elastogram and was larger than on the B-mode image, suspicious for malignancy (Fig. 5). Axillary adenopathy was noted in two cases. In both patients with acute leukaemia, masses demonstrated irregular shape and non-circumscribed margins and heterogeneous echogenicity with a significant echogenic component (Fig. 7). No axillary adenopathy was seen in either patient with acute leukaemia.

The other palpable mass had a similar sonographic appearance (not shown)

PET/CT

Ginat et al. noted that leukaemic deposits in the breast present as hypermetabolic breast masses on PET/CT. Hypermetabolic axillary adenopathy can also be appreciated as seen in our two patients (Fig. 6).

The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 53-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer who presented with abnormal axillary lymph nodes detected on surveillance imaging. Using history, physical examination, and diagnostic workup, an illness script for her presentation emerges. A differential diagnosis is developed and refined until a final diagnosis is confirmed.
