## Question

is the combination of estrogen and a bisphosphonate better than either alone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the combination of estrogen and a bisphosphonate is better than either alone for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical outcomes that matter most, namely bone mineral density changes and fracture risk reduction. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized controlled trial evidence for BMD gains with combination therapy. Next, I will check whether any trials are powered to show fracture differences and, if not, what that means clinically. After that, I need to review guideline positions and weigh benefits against risks, costs, and the concept of oversuppression of bone turnover. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with caveats about special populations and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and endpoints. The most relevant outcomes are lumbar spine and hip BMD changes and, more importantly, vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fracture risk reduction; BMD is a surrogate that correlates imperfectly with fracture benefit, so I should not overinterpret BMD gains without fracture data, even though they are directionally informative [^a82fb4a4] [^d9c53142].

> Now, I will examine the pivotal randomized trial. The JAMA RCT in 373 community-dwelling elderly women showed that after 3 years, combination therapy with conjugated equine estrogen plus alendronate increased total hip BMD by 5.9%, compared with 4.2% for alendronate alone and 3.0% for estrogen alone, and produced larger gains at the spine as well; importantly, the trial was not powered to detect fracture differences, so the BMD advantage is established but fracture benefit remains inferred rather than proven [^a0266c6f] [^aa526d40].

> Wait, let me verify consistency across agents and studies. Multiple FDA-labeled trials with alendronate and conjugated estrogen demonstrate that combination therapy yields greater lumbar spine BMD increases than monotherapy, typically on the order of about 8% at 2 years versus about 6% with either agent alone, reinforcing a modest but consistent BMD advantage for the combination; again, these studies did not evaluate fracture outcomes, so the clinical significance beyond BMD is uncertain [^50717001] [^ce9d2037] [^4faa9563] [^59c7b195].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fracture risk. I should confirm whether any head-to-head combination trials are powered for fractures. I need to check carefully, and the answer is no; contemporary network meta-analyses and guidelines consistently note that while BMD gains with combination antiresorptives are modest, there are no adequately powered trials demonstrating superior fracture risk reduction versus monotherapy, which is the decisive clinical question [^40111873] [^4161b04d] [^d9c53142].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with standards. Major guidelines advise against routine combination of two antiresorptives, including estrogen plus a bisphosphonate, because of increased cost, potential oversuppression of bone turnover, and lack of proven fracture benefit; instead, they recommend choosing a single agent with broad antifracture efficacy and reserving sequential strategies when appropriate, such as following an anabolic with an antiresorptive to consolidate gains [^40111873] [^4161b04d] [^48fcbbfe] [^11d7c532].

> I need to ensure I weigh risks and practicalities. Estrogen therapy carries increased risks of venous thromboembolism, stroke, and breast cancer with combined estrogen–progestin, and these risks rise with age and time since menopause; bisphosphonates add gastrointestinal intolerance and rare atypical femur fractures or osteonecrosis of the jaw with prolonged use, so combining two antiresorptives compounds exposure without proven incremental fracture benefit, which weakens the risk–benefit balance in typical patients [^29b97dbe] [^7a725714] [^5b0c74c9].

> But wait, what if there are special scenarios where combination is reasonable? Let me consider exceptions. In women with severe osteoporosis, multiple fragility fractures, or failure to achieve adequate BMD response on optimized monotherapy, a time-limited trial of combination therapy may be considered off-label, with close monitoring and a plan to de-escalate; conversely, in women with breast cancer on aromatase inhibitors, estrogen is contraindicated and bisphosphonates or denosumab are preferred for bone protection, illustrating that disease-specific contexts alter the calculus entirely [^40111873] [^71c44d14] [^3d2490f3].

> I should double-check the mechanistic rationale to avoid overpromising synergy. Both estrogen and bisphosphonates suppress bone resorption via overlapping pathways, so the BMD gains with combination are better characterized as additive rather than synergistic, and the degree of turnover suppression with combination is greater, which raises theoretical concerns about oversuppression and impaired bone quality over time, even though clinical consequences are not well defined in this specific pairing [^a0266c6f] [^50717001] [^cd5c2b20].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit. Yes, the combination of estrogen plus a bisphosphonate produces greater BMD gains than either alone, but no, this has not translated into proven superior fracture risk reduction in adequately powered trials; therefore, routine combination is not recommended, and the better-than question is answered as "better for BMD, not proven better for fractures", with guideline-concordant care favoring single-agent antiresorptive therapy tailored to risk, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^a0266c6f] [^40111873] [^d9c53142].

> Finally, I should confirm practical next steps. For most postmenopausal women at high fracture risk, start with a bisphosphonate or denosumab, ensure calcium and vitamin D sufficiency, and reassess risk after 3 to 5 years to consider a drug holiday if appropriate; reserve combination therapy for exceptional cases after discussing uncertain fracture benefit, added risks, and costs, and document shared decision-making if pursued [^3552c66e] [^5b0c74c9] [^924a644e].

---

The combination of estrogen and a bisphosphonate produces **greater increases in bone mineral density (BMD)** than either therapy alone, but **does not reduce fractures more than monotherapy** in randomized trials [^a0266c6f] [^40111873]. Combination therapy is not routinely recommended due to **lack of proven fracture benefit**, added costs, and potential harms; it may be considered only in select high-risk patients who do not respond to monotherapy, with careful monitoring [^40111873] [^4161b04d] [^25b18d02].

---

## Mechanisms of action and rationale for combination therapy

Estrogen reduces bone resorption by **suppressing osteoclast activity** via estrogen receptors, while bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated resorption by disrupting the mevalonate pathway. Together, they target different steps in the resorption cascade, providing a mechanistic rationale for additive BMD gains, though this does not guarantee superior fracture risk reduction [^7603c753] [^a0266c6f].

---

## Clinical evidence on bone mineral density (BMD)

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that **combination therapy increases BMD more than monotherapy**:

- **JAMA trial**: In elderly women, combination therapy (estrogen + alendronate) increased total hip BMD by 5.9% vs 4.2% with alendronate alone and 3.0% with estrogen alone over 3 years; spine BMD gains were also greater (10.4% vs 7.2% and 6.2%, respectively) [^a0266c6f].
- **FDA data**: Alendronate 10 mg + estrogen 0.625 mg increased lumbar spine BMD by 8.3% vs 6.0% with either alone at 2 years; adding alendronate to stable HRT increased spine BMD by 3.7% vs 1.1% with HRT alone at 1 year [^50717001] [^ce9d2037].
- **Risedronate trial**: Combination with estrogen produced modestly greater BMD gains at the femoral neck and midshaft radius than estrogen alone at 1 year [^e9c4e117].

---

## Clinical evidence on fracture risk

Despite BMD gains, **no RCT has demonstrated superior fracture risk reduction** with combination therapy versus monotherapy. The JAMA trial did not assess fractures, and FDA labeling notes that long-term fracture effects of combination therapy remain unstudied [^a0266c6f] [^50717001]. Observational and review data likewise fail to show added fracture benefit, limiting clinical justification for routine combination use [^40111873] [^cd5c2b20].

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

Combination therapy adds risks from both agents: estrogen increases venous thromboembolism, stroke, and breast cancer risk, while bisphosphonates carry risks of gastrointestinal upset, atypical femur fractures, and osteonecrosis of the jaw with prolonged use. Together, these risks may outweigh benefits in the absence of proven fracture reduction, reinforcing a conservative stance [^29b97dbe] [^7a725714].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Major guidelines **do not recommend routine combination therapy**:

- **AACE 2020**: Recommends against concomitant use of two antiresorptives, including estrogen plus bisphosphonate, until fracture effects are better defined [^40111873] [^4161b04d].
- **Endocrine Society 2019**: Recommends bisphosphonates as first-line for high-risk women; does not endorse combination therapy for osteoporosis treatment [^3552c66e] [^495aac61].
- **NAMS 2021**: Emphasizes sequential therapy rather than combination, reserving combination for select refractory cases [^notfound].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from combination therapy

Combination therapy may be considered in **select scenarios**, such as:

- **Severe osteoporosis**: Multiple fragility fractures or very low BMD despite optimized monotherapy.
- **Failure of monotherapy**: Inadequate BMD response or continued bone loss on a single agent.
- **High-risk patients**: Very high fracture risk where modest BMD gains may be clinically meaningful, albeit unproven for fracture reduction.

Even then, decisions should be individualized, with shared decision-making and close monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects [^25b18d02].

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

Combination therapy increases costs and complexity, and **cost-effectiveness analyses do not support routine use** in the absence of proven fracture benefit. This further limits its role outside of select, high-risk scenarios [^cd5c2b20].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Combination therapy vs monotherapy** |
|-|-|
| BMD | Greater increases with combination [^a0266c6f] [^50717001] |
| Fracture risk | No proven advantage [^40111873] [^cd5c2b20] |
| Safety | Higher adverse event burden [^29b97dbe] [^7a725714] |
| Guidelines | Not recommended routinely [^40111873] [^4161b04d] |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Routine use**: Not recommended due to lack of fracture benefit and added risks [^40111873] [^4161b04d].
- **Selective use**: Consider only in high-risk, refractory cases after monotherapy failure, with careful monitoring [^25b18d02].
- **First-line therapy**: Use bisphosphonates or estrogen (when appropriate) as monotherapy based on risk, comorbidities, and patient preference [^3552c66e] [^9c381e2d].
- **Monitoring**: Reassess BMD and fracture risk at 1–2 year intervals; discontinue combination if no meaningful benefit is observed [^notfound].

---

The combination of estrogen and a bisphosphonate yields **greater BMD gains than monotherapy**, but **does not improve fracture outcomes** in trials. It is not routinely recommended and should be reserved for select high-risk patients who fail monotherapy, with shared decision-making and close monitoring.

Context

Therapy with individual antiresorptive agents has been shown to be effective for prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, but whether combination antiresorptive therapy with hormones and bisphosphonates is safe or efficacious or how these agents compare in elderly women is unknown.

Objective

To determine whether hormone replacement and the bisphosphonate alendronate sodium in combination are efficacious and safe, and how they compare with monotherapy in community-dwelling elderly women.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.

Setting and Participants

Five hundred seventy-three community-dwelling women age 65 years or older were screened: 485 completed screening and 373 (aged 65 to 90 years) were randomized following a 3-month, open-label, run-in phase with hormone replacement and alendronate placebo. The trial was conducted at a single academic US medical center from January 1996 to May 2001.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned in a 2 x 2 factorial design to receive hormone replacement (conjugated equine estrogen, 0.625 mg/d, with or without medroxyprogesterone, 2.5 mg/d) and alendronate, 10 mg daily, both agents, or neither. All participants received calcium and vitamin D supplements.

Main Outcome Measures

Annualized change in bone mineral density of the hip and spine and occurrence of adverse events.

Results

Bone mineral density at 3 years was significantly greater at all femoral and vertebral sites in women treated with combination therapy than with monotherapy, with mean (SD) increases of 5.9% (3.8) at the total hip, 10.4% (5.4) at the posteroanterior lumbar spine, and 11.8% (6.8) at the lateral lumbar spine. Mean (SD) increases in bone mass at the hip in women treated with alendronate alone were significantly greater than in those treated with hormone replacement therapy alone (4.2% [3.8] vs 3.0% [4.9]; P < .05, respectively), and alendronate resulted in more responders to therapy. All therapies were well tolerated and participant retention was 90% at 3 years.

Conclusions

Combination therapy with hormone replacement and alendronate was efficacious and well tolerated in this cohort. Alendronate was superior to hormone replacement, and combination therapy was superior to either therapy alone. Combination therapy may represent an option for women with more severe disease or for those who have failed to achieve an adequate response to monotherapy.

### Treatment of osteoporosis with bisphosphonates [^941c39ae]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are safe and effective agents for treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Alendronate and risedronate are the best studied of all agents for osteoporosis in terms of efficacy and safety. They increase bone mass. In patients who have established osteoporosis, they reduce the risk of vertebral fractures. They are the only agents shown in prospective trials to reduce the risk of hip fractures and other nonvertebral fractures. They are approved by the US FDA for prevention of bone loss in recently menopausal women, for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and for management of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss. Other bisphosphonates (e.g., etidronate for oral use, pamidronate for intravenous infusion) are also available and can be used off-label for patients who cannot tolerate approved agents. Bisphosphonates combined with estrogen produce greater gains in bone mass compared with either agent used alone; whether there is a greater benefit of combination therapy on fracture risk is not clear. Combining a bisphosphonate with raloxifene or calcitonin is probably safe, although data on effectiveness are lacking.

### Combination therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis [^cd5c2b20]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

A number of agents have been shown to reduce the risk of fractures in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, the additional benefits of combination therapy as opposed to monotherapy are uncertain. We performed a MEDLINE search and reviewed the published randomized trials of agents used in combination. Combination therapy results in greater gains in bone mineral density than monotherapy and possibly greater effects on bone turnover. However, none of these studies are large enough or of sufficient duration to determine whether a greater reduction in fracture is achieved. Combination therapy has important cost implications and is likely to be associated with an increased prevalence of adverse events, reduced tolerability and a reduction in adherence. Furthermore, over-suppression of bone turnover as a result of combination antiresorptive therapy might have adverse effects on bone strength, particularly with long-term treatment. Thus, the use of combination therapy for treatment of osteoporosis cannot be recommended on the basis of currently available evidence.

### Significant differential effects of alendronate, estrogen, or combination therapy on the rate of bone loss after discontinuation of treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^22036bf1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Combination therapy with alendronate and estrogen for 2 years increases bone mineral density at the spine and hip more than does therapy with either agent alone. Changes in bone mineral density after discontinuation of therapy have not been compared directly.

Objective

To determine the rate of bone loss when therapy with alendronate, estrogen, or both agents is discontinued.

Design

Double-blind, placebo-controlled discontinuation trial.

Setting

18 U.S. centers.

Patients

244 postmenopausal, hysterectomized women 44 to 77 years of age.

Intervention

2 years of therapy with alendronate, 10 mg/d (n = 92); conjugated estrogen, 0.625 mg/d (n = 143); alendronate and conjugated estrogen (n = 140); or placebo (n = 50). At year 3, women were allocated into five groups: Twenty-eight women continued to take placebo and 44 women continued to take combination therapy, but 50 women taking alendronate, 81 taking conjugated estrogen, and 41 taking combination therapy were switched to placebo.

Measurements

Bone mineral density and biochemical markers of bone turnover.

Results

Women taking alendronate or combination therapy who were switched to placebo for year 3 of the study maintained bone mass. Bone mineral density in these women was 4.1% (CI, 2.6% to 5.7%) and 6.6% (CI, 5.0% to 8.2%) higher, respectively, at the spine (P < 0.001 for both treatment comparisons) and 3.5% (CI, 2.3% to 4.6%) and 3.0% (CI, 1.8% to 4.2%) higher, respectively, at the trochanter (P < 0.001 for both treatment comparisons) than that in women previously taking estrogen who were switched to placebo. In contrast, women who were taking estrogen and were switched to placebo during year 3 experienced a 4.5% decrease at the spine (95% CI, -5.0% to -4.0%) and a 2.4% decrease at the trochanter (CI, -2.7% to -2.1%) (P < 0.001 for both changes). Compared with women who took placebo for 3 years, women who took estrogen for 2 years and were then switched to placebo had a bone mineral density that was 2.9% higher (CI, 1.2% to 4.6%) at the spine (P < 0.05) and 2.9% higher (CI, 1.6% to 4.2%) at the trochanter (P < 0.001). Changes in biochemical markers during year 3 did not differ among the groups that discontinued active treatment.

Conclusions

Accelerated bone loss is seen after withdrawal of estrogen therapy but not after withdrawal of alendronate or combination therapy. The differential effects after withdrawal of therapy should be considered in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

### Combination therapy for treatment of osteoporosis: a review [^25b18d02]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Combination therapy for osteoporosis has been tested in small trials of short duration with various combinations. Pertinent human and animal randomized clinical trial data were identified through Medline and reviewed with a focus on the risks and benefits of different types of combination therapies. Improvements in bone density were found in some, but not all, combinations. There are no large trials of adequate length or numbers to determine fracture efficacy. Consider combination therapy if monotherapy is unsuccessful, if there is an added nonskeletal benefit to the proposed combination or as sequential treatment with an anabolic agent followed by an antiresorptive agent. Although combination therapy, in general, has limitations based on cost, concern about potential oversuppression of bone, and lack of long-term safety and fracture efficacy, selected patients may benefit.

### Combined pharmacologic therapy in postmenopausal osteoporosis [^3730a851]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Antiresorptive agents for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis include selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), bisphosphonates and denoumab. Teriparatide is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved anabolic agent. Synergistic effects of combining teriparatide with an antiresorptive agent have been proposed and studied. This article reviews the trial designs and the outcomes of combination therapies. Results of the combination therapy for teriparatide and bisphosphonates were mixed; while small increases of bone density were observed in the combination therapy of teriparatide and estrogen/SERM and that of teriparatide and denosumab. Those clinical studies were limited by small sample sizes and lack of fracture outcomes.

### Update of current therapeutic options for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis [^be0e20cb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is a common chronic condition in elderly women and is associated with decreased bone strength and an increased risk for fractures. As the incidence of osteoporotic fractures continues to rise, it is important to identify the most effective therapies for reducing patients' risk of fracture.

Objective

This article reviews the medication classes commonly used for treating osteoporosis and the efficacy, tolerability, and drug-interaction potential of specific medications. The evidence for the use of combination therapies is summarized, as are the agents under investigation.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified through a search of MEDLINE (August 1985-August 2005) using the terms osteoporosis, postmenopausal, fracture, and efficacy combined with drug therapy, calcium, vitamin D, estrogen, progesterone, selective estrogen modulators, calcitonin, strontium ranelate, bisphosphonates, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, pamidronate, parathyroid hormone, combination therapy, and zoledronic acid. The identified articles were reviewed for suitability, with priority given to meta-analyses.

Results

Among the therapeutic options for the treatment of osteoporosis, the bisphosphonates appear to provide the greatest antiresorptive efficacy, with some bisphosphonates providing 7% to 8% increases in bone mineral density and 60% to 70% decreases in markers of bone resorption. Bisphosphonates also may reduce the incidence of new vertebral fractures by 50% to 52%.

Conclusions

Bisphosphonates are currently the first choice for the treatment of osteoporosis. Use of intermittent regimens of the newer bisphosphonates appears to be a promising alternative to administration of daily or weekly treatment.

### Effect of combined risedronate and hormone replacement therapies on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women [^e9c4e117]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Both hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and bisphosphonates are efficacious in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Combined therapy with bisphosphonate and HRT is likely to be used in clinical practice, and limited data are available regarding its efficacy and safety. This was a 1-yr, double blind, placebo-controlled study in which 524 postmenopausal women received daily treatment with conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg) alone or in combination with risedronate (5 mg). Women who had not undergone hysterectomy received medroxyprogesterone acetate (up to 5 mg, daily or cyclically) at the discretion of the investigator. The primary efficacy end point was the percent change from baseline in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at 1 yr. Changes in BMD at the proximal femur and forearm, bone turnover markers, and histology and histomorphometry were also assessed. At 12 months, significant (P < 0.05) increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD were observed in both treatment groups (HRT-only, 4.6%; combined risedronate-HRT, 5.2%); the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. Both therapies led to significant increases in BMD at 12 months at the femoral neck (1.8% and 2.7%, respectively), femoral trochanter (3.2% and 3.7%), distal radius (1.7% and 1.6%), and midshaft radius (0.4% and 0.7%). The differences between groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05) at the femoral neck and midshaft radius. Both combined risedronate-HRT and HRT-only produced significant decreases in the biochemical markers of bone turnover, with somewhat greater decreases in the combined treatment group. Bone biopsy data showed normal bone structure and normal mineralization with either treatment. Expected decreases in bone turnover were observed and were greater in the combined treatment group (68–79% reduction relative to baseline values, P < 0.005). Overall, combined treatment had a safety profile similar to that of HRT-only, including bone and gastrointestinal safety profiles. In conclusion, the combined treatment with risedronate and HRT had a favorable effect on BMD similar to that of HRT alone at the lumbar spine and slightly, but significantly, greater than that of HRT alone at the femoral neck and midshaft radius. The combined treatment was well tolerated, and there were no adverse effects on the skeleton.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^48fcbbfe]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Pharmacotherapy to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women — overall principles state that the primary objective of treating women with osteoporosis is to reduce the risk of fracture and that all drugs approved for osteoporosis treatment have been shown in RCTs to reduce fracture risk. These drugs vary considerably in their mechanisms of action and effectiveness, and combining therapies is not generally recommended to treat osteoporosis, although sequential therapies may play a role in preventing loss after certain therapies.

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 2 [^29b97dbe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Hormone therapy for postmenopausal women without osteoporosis — Women's Health Initiative (WHI) results show reduced clinical and hip fractures with estrogen or estrogen–progestin but important harms and loss of benefit after stopping therapy. In WHI, estrogen alone or with progestin reduced overall clinical fractures and hip fractures (estrogen: hazard ratio [HR] at 7 years 0.71; 95% CI 0.64–0.80; hip HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.45–0.94; estrogen–progestin: HR at 5 years 0.76; 95% CI 0.69–0.83; hip HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.47–0.96). Reported harms included increased coronary artery disease in women older than 60 years or more than 10 years from menopause, increased risks of breast cancer, stroke, and venous thromboembolism, and increased invasive breast cancer with estrogen–progestin, with no increased all-cause mortality. Relatively rapid bone loss and loss of protection from fracture occur after discontinuation and can be prevented by switching to a bisphosphonate or another antiresorptive agent.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^5de28104]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Key points for prevention therapy selection in early postmenopause emphasize timing, preferred options, and when to use alternates: Intervening to prevent rapid bone loss and deterioration of skeletal structure is a unique opportunity to maintain bone health, and such intervention would be most appropriate in women with low BMD who are experiencing relatively rapid bone loss because of acute estrogen deficiency in the perimenopausal and early postmenopausal periods or on discontinuing ET. For younger, healthy postmenopausal women, particularly those with VMS, who are candidates for prevention of bone loss, estrogen alone (if no uterus) or combined with progestogen or BZA are the most appropriate therapies. A bisphosphonate should be initiated only if estrogen is contraindicated or on stopping ET. Raloxifene is an option for prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women with an elevated risk of breast cancer and a high intolerance of VMS. Bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss can be considered in postmenopausal women with low BMD (T-score < −1) and other risk factors for fracture (eg, family history) who do not meet criteria for osteoporosis treatment.

### Preventing osteoporosis in symptomatic postmenopausal women [^ea2090e0]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a common postmenopausal disease that has a substantial impact on the quality of life of older women and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There are various options for preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, and all are associated with differing benefit-risk profiles. Estrogen therapy (in hysterectomized women) and estrogen/progestogen therapy (in nonhysterectomized women) are the most effective treatments available for the relief of vasomotor and urogenital symptoms in postmenopausal women and provide significant protection against osteoporotic fractures. Selective estrogen receptor modulators reduce bone loss and prevent vertebral fractures without endometrial or breast stimulation. Raloxifene, the only selective estrogen receptor modulator approved for osteoporosis prevention and treatment, significantly reduces vertebral but not nonvertebral or hip fractures. Bisphosphonates prevent bone loss and vertebral fractures; however, not all bisphosphonates have been shown to prevent nonvertebral fractures. Selective estrogen receptor modulators and bisphosphonates are not effective for menopausal symptoms. Hormone therapy should be considered as first-line therapy for preventing bone loss and fractures in early postmenopausal women who are symptomatic; other options include selective estrogen receptor modulators and bisphosphonates, especially in older, nonsymptomatic women. Future therapies are likely to include newer selective estrogen receptor modulators, combinations of estrogen with selective estrogen receptor modulators, and denosumab.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^40111873]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — concomitant use of therapeutic agents: "There are no studies showing that combination treatment with two or more osteoporosis drugs has a greater effect on fracture reduction than treatment with single agent". Although "modest additive effects on BMD and bone turnover have been observed" and combinations such as "a single dose of IV zoledronate given at the same time as starting teriparatide" or "teriparatide and denosumab" can increase bone mineral density (BMD), "markers of bone formation are reduced with combination therapy, and no fracture data are available". Because combination therapy "substantially increases cost and probably increases the potential for side effects", "AACE does not recommend concomitant use" until fracture effects are better defined.

### Alendronate sodium [^50717001]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Concomitant Use with Estrogen/Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT): The effects on BMD of treatment with alendronate 10 mg once daily and conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg/day) either alone or in combination were assessed in a two-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of hysterectomized postmenopausal osteoporotic women (n = 425). At two years, the increases in lumbar spine BMD from baseline were significantly greater with the combination (8.3%) than with either estrogen or alendronate alone (both 6.0%).

The effects on BMD when alendronate was added to stable doses (for at least one year) of HRT (estrogen ± progestin) were assessed in a one-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in postmenopausal osteoporotic women (n = 428). The addition of alendronate 10 mg once daily to HRT produced, at one year, significantly greater increases in lumbar spine BMD (3.7%) vs. HRT alone (1.1%).

In these studies, significant increases or favorable trends in BMD for combined therapy compared with HRT alone were seen at the total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter. No significant effect was seen for total body BMD.

Histomorphometric studies of transiliac biopsies in 92 subjects showed normal bone architecture. Compared to placebo there was a 98% suppression of bone turnover (as assessed by mineralizing surface) after 18 months of combined treatment with alendronate and HRT, 94% on alendronate alone, and 78% on HRT alone. The long-term effects of combined alendronate and HRT on fracture occurrence and fracture healing have not been studied.

### Steroid-free medium discloses oestrogenic effects of the bisphosphonate clodronate on breast cancer cells [^d0382b5f]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Bisphosphonates, including clodronate, are widely used for the treatment of metastatic bone disease. In particular, they are administered to alleviate skeletal complications resulting from osteoclast-mediated tumour bone disease associated with breast and prostate cancers, and multiple myeloma. Although human data are still scarce, a double-blind trial involving more than 1000 breast cancer cases after surgery indicates that a 2-year treatment with clodronate can reduce the incidence of bone metastases by about one-half, and prolong patient survival.

Bisphosphonates are also currently evaluated in combination with third-generation AIs, which appear to be more efficient than tamoxifen as a first-line treatment of advanced breast cancer, as well as in the adjuvant setting. Thus, the administration of bisphosphonates, notably clodronate, in combination with AIs seems to be an attractive choice in order to prevent the risk of bone loss associated with complete oestrogen deprivation therapy, with the additional possibility of simultaneously decreasing the incidence of bone metastases.

### Alendronate and hormone therapy to prevent bone loss… [^d0dee6c4]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

No studies have had sufficient power to show that combination antiresorptive therapy — bisphosphonate and estrogen replacement — reduces fracture risk and increases bone mass. Greenspan and colleagues designed a study to determine the effect of combination therapy in a group of elderly, community-dwelling women. Patients in this randomized, double-blind study took alendronate, hormone therapy, both drugs, or neither drug. A run-in phase was completed by 373 women, aged 65 to 90 years. Outcomes included bone mineral density measurements of the hip, lumbar spine, and radius at baseline, randomization, and six-month intervals for three years. Weight, height, body mass index, and activity and mental status parameters were secondary outcomes. All groups were similar at baseline. After three years, hip BMD increased 5. 9 percent in the combination therapy group,
4.

3 percent in the alendronate group, and 3 percent in the hormone group, while patients in the placebo group maintained their BMD. Similar trends were found when measuring density at the femoral neck and greater trochanter. All treatment groups had increased BMD in the posteroanterior lumbar spine and the lumbar spine; women in the combination therapy group had the greatest increase in vertebral BMD and the greatest rate of change from baseline. Although the effects of combination therapy were superior to the effects of each agent when taken alone, the benefits were not additive. There was considerable variation in response rate among the active-treatment groups, with older participants generally responding less often than younger patients. Combination therapy with alendronate and hormone therapy improved BMD in community-dwelling elderly women better than therapy with either agent alone.

Although direct measurement of impact on fractures was not part of this study, the authors estimate that combination therapy would reduce fractures by an additional 10 percent compared with hormone therapy alone and by an additional 8 percent compared with alendronate alone. The risks of including estrogen replacement in the therapeutic regimen must be weighed against the benefits of potential fracture reduction, especially in women who do not respond to monotherapy.

### Alendronate sodium (alendronate) [^ce9d2037]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Concomitant Use with Estrogen/Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)

The effects on BMD of treatment with alendronate 10 mg once daily and conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg/day) either alone or in combination were assessed in a two-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of hysterectomized postmenopausal osteoporotic women (n = 425). At two years, the increases in lumbar spine BMD from baseline were significantly greater with the combination (8.3%) than with either estrogen or alendronate sodium alone (both 6.0%).

The effects on BMD when alendronate sodium was added to stable doses (for at least one year) of HRT (estrogen ± progestin) were assessed in a one-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in postmenopausal osteoporotic women (n = 428). The addition of alendronate 10 mg once daily to HRT produced, at one year, significantly greater increases in lumbar spine BMD (3.7%) vs. HRT alone (1.1%).

In these studies, significant increases or favorable trends in BMD for combined therapy compared with HRT alone were seen at the total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter. No significant effect was seen for total body BMD.

Histomorphometric studies of transiliac biopsies in 92 subjects showed normal bone architecture. Compared to placebo there was a 98% suppression of bone turnover (as assessed by mineralizing surface) after 18 months of combined treatment with alendronate sodium and HRT, 94% on alendronate sodium alone, and 78% on HRT alone. The long-term effects of combined alendronate sodium and HRT on fracture occurrence and fracture healing have not been studied.

### Parathyroid hormone update [^919fb0f1]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

PTH is an exciting new treatment option for postmenopausal women and hypogonadal men who have osteoporosis. As an anabolic agent that affects bone metabolism, it represents an entirely new class of medication for osteoporosis and a novel approach to reducing fracture risk. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated increases in trabecular and cortical BMD (trabecular more than cortical) in men and women, and reduction in vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women. Studies suggest that it is safe for use for up to 2 years, but further studies are needed to tes longer intervals of use. Although the combination of PTH and bisphosphonates does not seem to be additive, sequential therapy of PTH followed by bisphosphonate yields maximum gains in BMD compared with combined use or monotherapy with antiresorptive agents. As our knowledge of PTH grows, this is an exciting time for researchers, clinicians, and patients who study, treat, and live with the devastating consequences of progressive osteoporosis.

### Effects of the combination treatment of raloxifene and alendronate on the biomechanical properties of vertebral bone [^3822f73b]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

Johnell and colleagues investigated the additive effects of RAL and ALN on BMD and biochemical markers of bone turnover in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. They found that treatment with both RAL and ALN results in a greater BMD increment at the femoral neck than did monotherapy with either agent. Although BMD at the lumbar spine of the patients who were treated with RAL + ALN was different only from those treated with RAL alone, the authors concluded that the effects of RAL and ALN on BMD are independent and additive. However, the effects of RAL + ALN on the structural and material biomechanical properties of bone were not determined in that study.

The goal of this study was to investigate the additive effects of RAL and ALN on vertebral bone in an estrogen-deficient animal model. We hypothesized that the combination of RAL and ALN will improve bone's structural properties more than each agent alone by allowing the ALN-induced increase in bone volume but preventing the negative effects of this bisphosphonate on bone's derived material properties by cotreatment with RAL.

### Clinical review 123: anabolic therapy for osteoporosis [^b28ff101]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

All currently available, approved therapies for osteoporosis inhibit bone resorption. By acting at this site in the bone remodeling cycle, estrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators, calcitonin, and the bisphosphonates all have the capacity to increase bone mineral density and to reduce the risk of new fractures. There can be no doubt that these agents have had an enormous impact on our diagnostic and therapeutic approach to osteoporosis. Despite their great value, the antiresorptives are generally not associated with dramatic increases in bone mass, and their action to reduce fracture risk, although highly significant, is rarely more than 50% of the baseline risk. Another approach is anabolic therapy, in which bone formation is directly stimulated. In this review we will summarize the anabolic agents that have been studied and present a current view of their current standing. Fluoride, GH, insulin-like growth factor I, the statins, and PTH will be reviewed. Although still in development, approaches to combination therapy with antiresorptives and anabolic agents are also promising.

Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) meta-analysis — postmenopausal benefit signals are described, noting that although the EBCTCG meta-analysis found benefit for bisphosphonates in all subgroups of postmenopausal patients, the absolute benefit was small, while for the subgroup of premenopausal patients bisphosphonates had no significant effect on these outcomes. In postmenopausal patients, statistically significant benefits were reported for bone recurrence (6.6% v 8.8%), fracture rates (9.1% v 10.3%), breast cancer mortality (14.7% v 18.0%), and overall survival (any death 21.1% v 23.5%), and these differences did not vary as a function of treatment features (bisphosphonate class, treatment schedule, and dose).

### Use of adjuvant bisphosphonates and other bone-modifying agents in breast cancer: ASCO-OH (CCO) guideline update [^77e01585]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to management of early breast cancer, bone-modifying agents, ASCO/CCO 2022 guidelines recommend to discuss adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy with all postmenopausal patients with primary breast cancer eligible for adjuvant systemic therapy, regardless of hormone receptor and HER2 status. Recognize that the benefit of adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy will vary based on the underlying risk of recurrence and is linked to a modest improvement in overall survival. Use the National Health Service PREDICT tool to estimate the benefit of adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy and assist in shared decision-making. Take into consideration factors such as the patient's risk of recurrence, the risk of side effects, financial toxicity, drug availability, patient preferences, comorbidities, and life expectancy when deciding on adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy.

### Clinical review. comparative effectiveness of drug treatments to prevent fragility fractures: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^a66dcd89]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Osteoporosis and osteopenia are associated with increased fracture incidence.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the comparative effectiveness of different pharmacological agents in reducing the risk of fragility fractures.

Data Sources

We searched multiple databases through 12/9/2011.

Study Selection

Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials enrolling individuals at risk of developing fragility fractures and evaluating the efficacy of bisphosphonates, teriparatide, selective estrogen receptor modulators, denosumab, or calcium and vitamin D.

Data Extraction

Reviewers working independently and in duplicate determined study eligibility and collected descriptive, methodological quality, and outcome data.

Data Synthesis

This network meta-analysis included 116 trials (139,647 patients; median age, 64 yr; 86% females and 88% Caucasians; median follow-up, 24 months). Trials were at low to moderate risk of bias. Teriparatide had the highest risk reduction of fractures (odds ratios, 0.42, 0.30, and 0.50 for hip, vertebral, and nonvertebral fractures, respectively) and the highest probability of being ranked first for efficacy (probabilities of 42, 49, and 79% for hip, vertebral, and nonvertebral fractures, respectively). However, differences to denosumab, zoledronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and alendronate were not statistically significant. Raloxifene and bazedoxifene were likely less effective, although these data were limited. Calcium and vitamin D were ineffective given separately but reduced the risk of hip fractures if given in combination (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.96).

Conclusions

Teriparatide, bisphosphonates, and denosumab are most effective in reducing the risk of fragility fractures. Differences in efficacy across drugs are small; therefore, patients and clinicians need to consider their associated harms and costs.

### Teriparatide and denosumab, alone or combined, in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis: the DATA study randomised trial [^c6d6d04c]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis medications increase bone-mineral density (BMD) and lower but do not eliminate fracture risk. The combining of anabolic agents with bisphosphonates has not improved efficacy. We compared combined teriparatide and denosumab with both agents alone.

Methods

From September, 2009, to January, 2011, we enrolled postmenopausal women with osteoporosis into this randomised, controlled trial. Patients were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 20 μg teriparatide daily, 60 mg denosumab every 6 months, or both. BMD was measured at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months. Women who completed at least one study visit after baseline were assessed in a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00926380.

Findings

94 (94%) of 100 eligible women completed at least one study visit after baseline. At 12 months, posterior-anterior lumbar spine BMD increased more in the combination group (9·1%, [SD 3·9]) than in the teriparatide (6·2% [4·6], p = 0·0139) or denosumab (5·5% [3·3], p = 0·0005) groups. Femoral-neck BMD also increased more in the combination group (4·2% [3·0]) than in the teriparatide (0·8% [4·1], p = 0·0007) and denosumab (2·1% [3·8], p = 0·0238) groups, as did total-hip BMD (combination, 4·9% [2·9]; teriparatide, 0·7% [2·7], p < 0·0001; denosumab 2·5% [2·6], p = 0·0011).

Interpretation

Combined teriparatide and denosumab increased BMD more than either agent alone and more than has been reported with approved therapies. Combination treatment might, therefore, be useful to treat patients at high risk of fracture.

### Effect of daily hormone therapy and alendronate use on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women [^6c581ae2]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of daily oral and transdermal hormone therapy alone or in combination with alendronate on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women.

Design

Comparative prospective clinical study.

Setting

Outpatient clinic of a training and research hospital.

Patient(S)

One hundred seventy-three consecutive postmenopausal women with no previous hormone therapy and a bone mineral density T score < -1 SD were randomly enrolled.

Intervention(S)

Oral conjugated estrogen, alone or with alendronate, or transdermal estrogen, alone or with alendronate, given for 1 year. All patients also received medroxyprogesterone acetate and calcium.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Bone density measurement at L2 to 4 region by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

Results

At the end of 1 year, significant increase in bone density measurements were seen in all groups. Oral conjugated estrogen and transdermal estrogen have the same effect on bone mineral density loss. Hormone therapy alone stabilized the bone mineral density loss. Hormone therapy together with alendronate resulted in better values in all groups.

Conclusion

Hormone therapy is adequate in osteopenic women. However, hormone therapy plus alendronate is advantageous in women with considerable bone mineral density loss.

### Low-dose hormone replacement therapy and alendronate for… [^5f2c84b8]. ClinicalTrials (2000). Low credibility.

Clinical trials of estrogen/progestin replacement therapy and a bisphosphonate, alendronate, have demonstrated that both are effective in causing gains in bone mass and preventing bone loss and fractures in postmenopausal women. The FDA has approved both these drugs for prevention and treatment of fractures, and both are widely used in clinical practice. Because both are approved and effective, and they work by different mechanisms, many patients and their physicians ask whether both should be taken in combination, particularly in cases of severe disease. The question is asked frequently because of the high incidence of osteoporosis among women and the need for long-term prevention and treatments that often last decades. Indeed, physicians are using ALN and HRT together without adequate scientific support for the assumption that the combination is more effective than either given alone.

Clinical trials are now underway to test conventional doses of HRT given as conjugated equine estrogens, 0. 625 mg/day or its equivalent, combined with ALN, 10 mg/day. However, researchers are not studying the bone-sparing effectiveness of the combined administration of ALN and low-dose continuous HRT given as CEE, 0. 3 mg/d, along with medroxyprogesterone,
2. 5 mg/d. The long-term objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the combined therapy shows a greater bone effect than does either treatment given alone. Our specific aim is to conduct a 3. 5 year, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of low-dose, continuous HRT combined with alendronate, 10 mg/d, in three groups of estrogen-deprived postmenopausal women over age
60. The primary outcome measures will be spine bone mineral density and total hip bone mineral density measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.

Secondary outcome measures will be total body bone mineral content and forearm bone mineral content. In addition, we will perform studies to characterize the mechanism of the effects of these regimens.
- Treatment with bone active agents such as fluoride or bisphosphonates within the previous 2 years.
- Treatment with calcitonin, estrogen, or a selective estrogen receptor modulator within the previous 6 months.
- Systemic corticosteroid therapy at pharmacologic levels for more than 6 months duration.
- Any corticosteroid therapy within the previous 6 months.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^f69c4ae9]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Prevention versus treatment approvals and treatment effects — drugs are approved by North American regulatory agencies for either preventing or treating osteoporosis or both, and although North American guidelines since 2008 have focused on reducing fracture risk and do not recognize preventing osteoporosis by halting postmenopausal bone loss, various oral and transdermal estrogen preparations (alone or with progestogens or bazedoxifene [BZA]), raloxifene, tibolone (in Mexico only), and four bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, zoledronate) have government approval for prevention of osteoporosis; bone density benefits persist while therapy continues but abate when estrogen-like drugs are discontinued, markers of bone turnover return to pretreatment within a few months and BMD falls to pretreatment within 1 to 2 years after stopping therapy, an effect prevented by switching to a bisphosphonate; a strong clinical argument can be made for prevention particularly in women entering menopause with low bone mass because on average women lose about one T-score unit (10–12%) of bone mass across a normal menopause transition with significant and irreversible deterioration in trabecular architecture that is preventable with estrogen and bisphosphonates; additional support comes from women with AIs for nonmetastatic breast cancer in whom bisphosphonates and denosumab prevented bone loss and denosumab reduced vertebral fractures by 50% within the first year of treatment, including in women with normal BMD at baseline.

### Alendronate sodium (Fosamax) [^4faa9563]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Weekly Dosing

The therapeutic equivalence of once-weekly FOSAMAX 70 mg (n = 519) and FOSAMAX 10 mg daily (n = 370) was demonstrated in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. In the primary analysis of completers, the mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at one year were 5.1% (4.8, 5.4%; 95% CI) in the 70-mg once-weekly group (n = 440) and 5.4% (5.0, 5.8%; 95% CI) in the 10-mg daily group (n = 330). The two treatment groups were also similar with regard to BMD increases at other skeletal sites. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis were consistent with the primary analysis of completers.

Concomitant Use with Estrogen/Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)

The effects on BMD of treatment with FOSAMAX 10 mg once daily and conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg/day) either alone or in combination were assessed in a two-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of hysterectomized postmenopausal osteoporotic women (n = 425). At two years, the increases in lumbar spine BMD from baseline were significantly greater with the combination (8.3%) than with either estrogen or FOSAMAX alone (both 6.0%).

The effects on BMD when FOSAMAX was added to stable doses (for at least one year) of HRT (estrogen ± progestin) were assessed in a one-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in postmenopausal osteoporotic women (n = 428). The addition of FOSAMAX 10 mg once daily to HRT produced, at one year, significantly greater increases in lumbar spine BMD (3.7%) vs. HRT alone (1.1%).

In these studies, significant increases or favorable trends in BMD for combined therapy compared with HRT alone were seen at the total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter. No significant effect was seen for total body BMD.

Histomorphometric studies of transiliac biopsies in 92 subjects showed normal bone architecture. Compared to placebo there was a 98% suppression of bone turnover (as assessed by mineralizing surface) after 18 months of combined treatment with FOSAMAX and HRT, 94% on FOSAMAX alone, and 78% on HRT alone. The long-term effects of combined FOSAMAX and HRT on fracture occurrence and fracture healing have not been studied.

Optimal duration of therapy has not been established, and benefits of duration beyond 3 years is not known. There are case reports of spontaneous fractures after denosumab discontinuation, and patients treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab should undergo a dental exam with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of therapy, and should take supplemental calcium and vitamin D.

### Risedronate sodium [^67e7012f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Combined Administration with Hormone Replacement Therapy

The effects of combining risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily with conjugated estrogen 0.625 mg daily (N = 263) were compared to the effects of conjugated estrogen alone (N = 261) in a 1-year, randomized, double-blind study of women ages 37 to 82 years, who were on average 14 years postmenopausal. The BMD results for this study are presented in Table 5.

Histology/Histomorphometry Bone biopsies from 53 postmenopausal women were obtained at endpoint. Patients had received risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg plus estrogen or estrogen-alone once daily for 1 year. Histologic evaluation (N = 47) demonstrated that the bone of patients treated with risedronate sodium tablets plus estrogen was of normal lamellar structure and normal mineralization. The histomorphometric parameter mineralizing surface, a measure of bone turnover, was assessed based upon baseline and post-treatment biopsy samples from 12 patients treated with risedronate sodium tablets plus estrogen and 12 treated with estrogen-alone. Mineralizing surface decreased in both treatment groups (median percent change: risedronate sodium tablets plus estrogen, -79%; estrogen-alone, -50%), consistent with the known effects of these agents on bone turnover.

### Effects of alendronate and hormone replacement therapy, alone and in combination, on bone mass and markers of bone turnover in elderly women with osteoporosis [^5c61bbab]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to compare alendronate, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and their combination in treatment of osteoporosis in elderly postmenopausal women. Ninety patients, aged 65–80 yr (mean 71), with a T-score of bone mineral density (BMD) of 2.5 or less at either the lumbar spine or the femoral neck were randomized to receive daily 10 mg alendronate (n = 30), 2 mg estradiol plus 1 mg norethisterone acetate (n = 30) (HRT), or their combination (n = 30) for 2 yr. BMD of the lumbar spine and the upper femur was measured at baseline and after 1 and 2 yr of treatment. Urinary excretion of type I collagen aminoterminal telopeptide as related to creatinine and serum type I procollagen aminoterminal propeptide was assayed at baseline and at 6-month intervals thereafter. Increases of 9.1–11.2% in lumbar spine BMD at 2 yr were similar in the study groups. Only HRT increased femoral neck BMD statistically significantly (P < 0.0001 for a change from baseline) at both 1 (+4.9%; P = NS vs. the other groups) and 2 yr (+5.8%; P < 0.05 vs. the other groups). Total hip BMD increased similarly in all study groups. Percentage reductions in urinary type I collagen aminoterminal telopeptide in the HRT group (60.2–62.7%) were significantly smaller than those in the combination group (78.1–80.4%) (P < 0.0001–0.0069) and the alendronate-only group (72.4–76.1%) (P = 0.047 at 24 months). Serum type I procollagen aminoterminal propeptide decreased less in the HRT group (53.6–59.8%) than in the other groups [73.0–75.0% in the alendronate group (P < 0.001 at 12 months); 67.0–71.5% in the combination group (P < 0.0001 at 12 months, P = 0.013 at 24 months)]. We conclude that in elderly postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the combination of HRT and alendronate did not offer an extra gain of bone mass over either treatment alone. In terms of BMD changes, the single treatments were equally effective, but the reductions in bone markers were less with HRT than with alendronate.

### Combination therapy with hormone replacement and alendronate for prevention of bone loss in elderly women… [^aa526d40]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Therapy with individual antiresorptive agents has been shown to be effective for prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, but whether combination antiresorptive therapy with hormones and bisphosphonates is safe or efficacious or how these agents compare in elderly women is unknown. Objective To determine whether hormone replacement and the bisphosphonate alendronate. fractures. 6–8 Furthermore, Hochberg et al7 demonstrated that women taking the bisphosphonate alendronate who had the greatest improvement in vertebral BMD also had the greatest reduction in vertebral fractures. The rationale for combining 2 antiresorptive agents with different mechanisms of action is to induce greater increases in bone mass and, hopefully, greater. reduction in fractures than would be observed with a single antiresorptive agent.

A 2-year study by Bone et al9 demonstrated that BMD was greater in younger women taking combination therapy than it was in women taking either estrogen or alendronate alone. Fracture reduction was not a primary end point, and no study of combination antiresorptive therapy. in this group of older women, or if compliance will differ between groups. Finally, it is unknown whether results would be the same with hormone replacement plus bisphosphonates. Therefore, our study was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with hormone replacement and alendronate, compared with each agent alone in a group of community-dwelling, elderly women. with maintenance of vertebral BMD in the placebo group. At all time points after randomization, BMD was greater. falls, and clinical fractures was similar in all 4 groups. Participants in all groups lost height, but the differences between groups were not significant.

Raloxifene for postmenopausal osteoporosis — dosing, efficacy, combinations, and risks are as follows: The approved dose is 60 mg daily, and raloxifene is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential, those who have had venous thromboembolic disease, and those who are known to be hypersensitive to any component of raloxifene tablets. Raloxifene has been shown to reduce the risk of fractures of the spine, but neither nonvertebral nor hip fracture efficacy has been demonstrated, and in an osteoporosis trial a significant reduction in breast cancer was seen; however, raloxifene is not indicated for the treatment of invasive breast cancer, for reduction of the risk of recurrence of breast cancer, or for reduction of the risk of noninvasive breast cancer. Although we recommend against the use of two antiresorptive drugs in combination for treatment of osteoporosis, patients at high risk of hip fracture who are taking raloxifene with the main goal of reducing their risk of breast cancer can reasonably have a bisphosphonate or denosumab added for hip fracture risk reduction, though the risk-benefit ratio of combined treatment with raloxifene and bisphosphonate or denosumab is unclear as data on fracture risk reduction and adverse events, such as ONJ and AFF, are lacking. Raloxifene is associated with an approximately 3-fold increase in occurrence of venous thromboembolic disease, although the absolute risk is low, other side effects include menopausal symptoms and leg cramps, and when use is stopped the skeletal benefits appear to be lost relatively quickly during the following 1 or 2 years.

Combined Administration with Hormone Replacement Therapy

The effects of combining ACTONEL 5 mg daily with conjugated estrogen 0.625 mg daily (N = 263) were compared to the effects of conjugated estrogen alone (N = 261) in a 1-year, randomized, double-blind study of women ages 37 to 82 years, who were on average 14 years postmenopausal. The BMD results for this study are presented in Table 5.

Histology/Histomorphometry

Bone biopsies from 53 postmenopausal women were obtained at endpoint. Patients had received ACTONEL 5 mg plus estrogen or estrogen-alone once daily for 1 year. Histologic evaluation (N = 47) demonstrated that the bone of patients treated with ACTONEL plus estrogen was of normal lamellar structure and normal mineralization. The histomorphometric parameter mineralizing surface, a measure of bone turnover, was assessed based upon baseline and post-treatment biopsy samples from 12 patients treated with ACTONEL plus estrogen and 12 treated with estrogen-alone. Mineralizing surface decreased in both treatment groups (median percent change: ACTONEL plus estrogen, -79%; estrogen-alone, -50%), consistent with the known effects of these agents on bone turnover.

In conclusion, in an ovariectomized adult rat model, which is an established model for estrogen-deficiency osteoporosis, we showed that the combination of RAL and ALN has greater beneficial effects on bone volume and biomechanical properties of vertebral bone compared with either agent alone. The findings of this work provide new insight into the effects of combining two different osteoporosis treatment modalities on bone fragility. Further studies should be done in large animal models to ascertain the positive effects of the combination treatment of RAL and ALN on vertebral bone observed here.

### Effects of the combination treatment of raloxifene and alendronate on the biomechanical properties of vertebral bone [^4edc5e05]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Raloxifene (RAL), a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), and alendronate (ALN), a bisphosphonate, reduce vertebral fracture risk by nearly the same extent despite variable effects on bone mineral density (BMD). Compared with placebo, RAL treatment suppressed bone turnover and increased lumbar spine BMD by about half as much as ALN, but both agents produced similar reductions in vertebral fracture risk. The contribution of the increase in BMD accounts for only 4% of the vertebral fracture reduction with RAL compared with 17% with ALN. These data suggest that RAL and ALN improve the biomechanical properties of vertebral bone by different mechanisms.

Consistent with the clinical data, previous studies in an animal model have shown that the clinical dose of RAL alters the properties of canine vertebral bone in ways that differ from bisphosphonates.(,–) ALN has negative effects on the derived material properties (structural properties normalized by bone geometry and fractional bone volume), but these negative effects are counteracted by an increase in bone volume such that there is no deterioration of the biomechanical properties at the structural level. On the other hand, RAL does not increase bone volume as much as ALN but improves the biomechanical properties of bone by having positive effects on the derived material properties. Since treatment with ALN is extending beyond a decade in some patients, the potential negative effects of ALN on the material properties could override the beneficial effects of the increase in bone volume, leading to an impairment of the biomechanical properties at the structural level. Treatment with both RAL and ALN (RAL + ALN) could offset part or all of the deterioration in bone's material properties that may be associated with ALN and concomitantly increase BMD.

Bisphosphonates in young postmenopausal women — bone mineral density (BMD) effects and prevention-use parameters are described as follows: In young postmenopausal women, bisphosphonates increase BMD over 24 months by 3.1% to 6.0% in the LS and by 1.8% to 4.0% in the proximal femur, and doses of zoledronate and alendronate approved for prevention are 50% smaller than the doses approved for osteoporosis treatment. Bone mineral density decreases slowly on stopping alendronate or zoledronate. Bisphosphonates can be considered to prevent bone loss in early menopause if estrogen cannot be taken or when ET or raloxifene therapy is discontinued.

### The good and the bad about the 2017 American College of Physicians osteoporosis guidelines [^ce14cc1e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The American College of Physicians (ACP) published a set of guidelines on how to prevent fractures in men and women with low bone density or osteoporosis. As the population ages, the overall risk of fractures increases, thus burdening the health care system. These guidelines review current evidence for osteoporosis management, providing an update to the previous 2008 ACP's guidelines.

Methods

The ACP put forth 6 recommendations addressing the complexities in osteoporosis management based on evidence available through October 2016 with a focus on bisphosphonates, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen. Evidence was graded according to recommended strength by using the ACP standard methods.

Findings

The ACP recommends anti-osteoporosis therapy with 1 of 3 bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronic acid) or denosumab in patients with osteoporosis, while excluding anabolic therapies, and recommends against raloxifene. Although bisphosphonates are the mainstay of treatment, anabolic therapy and raloxifene may be used in specific situations. Pharmacologic therapy is recommended for 5 years, oversimplifying length of therapy and failing to promote an individualized patient-centered care approach. Moreover, abrupt discontinuation of denosumab is associated with a decline in bone mineral density (BMD), which must be addressed. Routine monitoring of BMD by dual x-ray absorptiometry is not endorsed during treatment, which leads to underrecognition of management issues. Pharmacologic treatment with bisphosphonates for male osteoporosis is recommended, although therapies such as denosumab and teriparatide are excluded. Finally, the ACP recommends treatment for women aged ≥ 65 years at high risk for fracture with osteopenia after a discussion of patient preferences, fracture risk profile, and medications.

Implications

Osteoporosis management is complex. The 2017 ACP guidelines address challenges faced by clinicians but oversimplify more complex issues. These are among a number of guidelines that are available for osteoporosis management, which may be used in combination with other sources to assist clinicians with diagnostic and management strategies.

Concomitant Use with Estrogen Hormone Replacement Therapy

The effects on BMD of treatment with FOSAMAX 10 mg once daily and conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg/day) either alone or in combination were assessed in a two-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of hysterectomized postmenopausal osteoporotic women (n = 425). At two years, the increases in lumbar spine BMD from baseline were significantly greater with the combination (8.3%) than with either estrogen or FOSAMAX alone (both 6.0%).

The effects on BMD when FOSAMAX was added to stable doses (for at least one year) of HRT (estrogen ± progestin) were assessed in a one-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in postmenopausal osteoporotic women (n = 428). The addition of FOSAMAX 10 mg once daily to HRT produced, at one year, significantly greater increases in lumbar spine BMD (3.7%) vs. HRT alone (1.1%).

In these studies, significant increases or favorable trends in BMD for combined therapy compared with HRT alone were seen at the total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter. No significant effect was seen for total body BMD.

Histomorphometric studies of transiliac biopsies in 92 subjects showed normal bone architecture. Compared to placebo there was a 98% suppression of bone turnover (as assessed by mineralizing surface) after 18 months of combined treatment with FOSAMAX and HRT, 94% on FOSAMAX alone, and 78% on HRT alone. The long-term effects of combined FOSAMAX and HRT on fracture occurrence and fracture healing have not been studied.

### Antiresorptive treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis: comparison of study designs and outcomes in large clinical trials with fracture as an endpoint [^a82fb4a4]. Endocrine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Antiresorptive treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis have been studied extensively, but due to the volume of published data and lack of head-to-head trials, it is difficult to evaluate and compare their fracture reduction efficacy. The objective of this review is to summarize the results from clinical trials that have fracture as an endpoint and to discuss the factors in study design and populations that can affect the interpretation of the results. Although there are numerous observational studies suggesting that estrogen and hormone replacement therapies may reduce the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, there is no large, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial demonstrating fracture efficacy. The effects of raloxifene, alendronate, risedronate, and salmon calcitonin on increasing bone mineral density (BMD) and decreasing fracture risk have been shown in randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Although the increases in lumbar spine BMD vary greatly in these trials, the decrease in relative risk of vertebral fractures is similar among therapies. However, nonvertebral fracture efficacy has not been consistently demonstrated. Combined administration of two antiresorptive therapies results in greater BMD increases, but the effects on fracture risk are unknown. Direct comparisons of clinical trial results should be considered carefully, given the differences in study design and populations. Differences in study design that may influence the efficacy of fracture risk reduction include calcium and vitamin D supplementation, primary fracture endpoints, definition of vertebral deformity or fracture, discontinuation rates, and statistical power. Factors in the study population that may influence fracture efficacy include the age of the population and the proportion of subjects with prevalent fractures. The use of surrogate endpoints such as BMD to predict fracture risk should be approached with caution, as the relationship between BMD changes and fracture risk reduction with antiresorptive therapies is uncertain. Consideration of these results from clinical trials can contribute to clinical judgment in selecting the best treatment option for postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — initial pharmacologic therapy selection: Agents with "broad-spectrum" antifracture efficacy should, in the absence of contraindications, be considered as initial options for most candidates; those with "high fracture risk" can be started on oral agents, while injectable agents (abaloparatide, denosumab, romosozumab, teriparatide, or zoledronate) can be considered for very high fracture risk or for patients with gastrointestinal (GI) problems or adherence challenges. Patients taking anabolic agents or denosumab are advised to transition to an oral bisphosphonate when therapy is complete, and anabolic/dual-action agents may be preferable for very high risk; raloxifene may be appropriate for high spine fracture risk and has a "side benefit" of reducing breast cancer risk.

Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

Daily Dosing

The safety of alendronate 5 mg/day in postmenopausal women 40–60 years of age has been evaluated in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies involving over 1,400 patients randomized to receive alendronate sodium for either two or three years. In these studies the overall safety profiles of alendronate 5 mg/day and placebo were similar.

Discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical adverse event occurred in 7.5% of 642 patients treated with alendronate 5 mg/day and 5.7% of 648 patients treated with placebo.

Weekly Dosing

The safety of alendronate 35 mg once weekly compared to alendronate 5 mg daily was evaluated in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study of 723 patients. The overall safety and tolerability profiles of once weekly alendronate 35 mg and alendronate 5 mg daily were similar.

The adverse reactions from these studies considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with either once weekly alendronate 35 mg, alendronate 5 mg/day or placebo are presented in Table 3.

Concomitant Use with Estrogen/Hormone Replacement Therapy

In two studies (of one and two years' duration) of postmenopausal osteoporotic women (total: n = 853), the safety and tolerability profile of combined treatment with alendronate 10 mg once daily and estrogen ± progestin (n = 354) was consistent with those of the individual treatments.

Osteoporosis in Men

In two placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies in men (a two-year study of alendronate 10 mg/day and a one-year study of once weekly alendronate 70 mg) the rates of discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical adverse event were 2.7% for alendronate 10 mg/day vs. 10.5% for placebo, and 6.4% for once weekly alendronate 70 mg vs. 8.6% for placebo. The adverse reactions considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with either alendronate or placebo are presented in Table 4.

### Postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment with antiresorptives: effects of discontinuation or long-term continuation on bone turnover and fracture risk – a perspective [^1cee5f79]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2012). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis may be a lifelong condition. Robust data regarding the efficacy and safety of both long-term osteoporosis therapy and therapy discontinuation are therefore important. A paucity of clinical trial data regarding the long-term antifracture efficacy of osteoporosis therapies necessitates the use of surrogate endpoints in discussions surrounding long-term use and/or discontinuation. Long-term treatment (beyond 3–4 years) may produce further increases in bone mineral density (BMD) or BMD stability, depending on the specific treatment and the skeletal site. Bisphosphonates, when discontinued, are associated with a prolonged reduction in bone turnover markers (BTMs), with a very gradual increase to pretreatment levels within 3 to 60 months of treatment cessation, depending on the bisphosphonate used and the prior duration of therapy. In contrast, with nonbisphosphonate antiresorptive agents, such as estrogen and denosumab, BTMs rebound to above pretreatment values within months of discontinuation. The pattern of BTM change is generally mirrored by a more or less rapid decrease in BMD. Although the prolonged effect of some bisphosphonates on BTMs and BMD may contribute to residual benefit on bone strength, it may also raise safety concerns. Adequately powered postdiscontinuation fracture studies and conclusive evidence on maintenance or loss of fracture benefit is lacking for bisphosphonates. Similarly, the effects of rapid reversal of bone turnover upon discontinuation of denosumab on fracture risk remain unknown. Ideally, studies evaluating the effects of long-term treatment and treatment discontinuation should be designed to provide head-to-head "offset" data between bisphosphonates and nonbisphosphonate antiresorptive agents. In the absence of this, a clinical recommendation for physicians may be to periodically assess the benefits/risks of continuation versus discontinuation versus alternative management strategies.

### Effects of risedronate and low-dose transdermal testosterone on bone mineral density in women with anorexia nervosa: a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^4af6103b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Anorexia nervosa is complicated by severe bone loss and clinical fractures. Mechanisms underlying bone loss in adults with anorexia nervosa include increased bone resorption and decreased formation. Estrogen administration has not been shown to prevent bone loss in this population, and to date, there are no approved, effective therapies for this comorbidity.

Objective

To determine whether antiresorptive therapy with a bisphosphonate alone or in combination with low-dose transdermal testosterone replacement would increase bone mineral density (BMD) in women with anorexia nervosa.

Design and Setting

We conducted a12-month, randomized, placebo-controlled study at a clinical research center.

Study Participants

Participants included 77 ambulatory women with anorexia nervosa.

Intervention

Subjects were randomized to risedronate 35 mg weekly, low-dose transdermal testosterone replacement therapy, combination therapy or double placebo.

Main Outcome Measures

BMD at the spine (primary endpoint), hip, and radius and body composition were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.

Results

Risedronate increased posteroanterior spine BMD 3%, lateral spine BMD 4%, and hip BMD 2% in women with anorexia nervosa compared with placebo in a 12-month clinical trial. Testosterone administration did not improve BMD but increased lean body mass. There were few side effects associated with either therapy.

Conclusions

Risedronate administration for 1 yr increased spinal BMD, the primary site of bone loss in women with anorexia nervosa. Low-dose testosterone did not change BMD but increased lean body mass.

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad? [^74caaf89]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent Cochrane review and 2 double-blind RCTs have demonstrated the effectiveness of bisphosphonates, teriparatide, and denosumab to treat GIOP. As a result of these and other studies, oral bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate) are recommended as first-line agents to prevent GC-related fractures, while intravenous bisphosphonates (zoledronate and ibandronate), subcutaneous teriparatide, and subcutaneous denosumab are recommended as second-line agents.

The use of newer osteoanabolic agents such as abaloparatide (a synthetic analogue PTH-related peptide) and romosozumab (a monoclonal antibody against sclerostin and acting on the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway) have not been evaluated in GIOP. Similarly, estrogen replacement therapy alone, combined hormone replacement therapy with progestins, or selective estrogen receptor modulators have not been thoroughly evaluated in the management of GIOP and their use is restricted to selected cases. A recent meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating the effects of testosterone replacement therapy on different bone parameters showed that testosterone improves BMD at the lumbar spine only in hypogonadal patients: the effect was greater in subjects with lower testosterone levels at baseline and increased as a function of treatment duration. These data endorse the use of testosterone to improve BMD only in patients with gonadal insufficiency.

Selective GR Agonists and Selective GR Modulators

The precedent for an approach to selectively modulate steroid hormone action in a tissue-specific manner has been set through the development and clinical use of selective estrogen receptor modulators. These drugs are able to act as estrogen agonists and antagonists, depending on the target tissue, and are now established in clinical practice for management of breast cancer, osteoporosis, and post-menopausal symptoms. Adopting a similar approach aiming to separate the anti-inflammatory action of GCs has been challenging, and progress into the clinic has been slow. This is a reflection of the complex nature of GC intercellular signaling, including an imperfect understanding of how to distinguish transactivation and transrepression.

Bisphosphonates — initial therapy and antifracture efficacy in postmenopausal osteoporosis: ACOG recommends bisphosphonates as initial therapy for most postmenopausal patients at increased risk of fracture (STRONG RECOMMENDATION, HIGH-QUALITY EVIDENCE). Four bisphosphonates are approved for use in the United States (alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronic acid), and a network meta-analysis found significant vertebral fracture risk reductions for zoledronic acid (relative risk [RR] 0.38; 95% CI 0.25–0.58), risedronate (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.48–0.78), alendronate (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.45–0.71), and ibandronate (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.48–0.93), with an overall 50% reduction in vertebral fractures reported. Alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid also significantly reduce nonvertebral and hip fractures, zoledronic acid and risedronate reduce vertebral and nonvertebral fragility fractures in postmenopausal women with osteopenia, and ibandronate improves bone density and reduces vertebral fractures but lacks evidence for prevention of hip and nonvertebral fractures.

### Fracture risk reduction and safety by osteoporosis treatment compared with placebo or active comparator in postmenopausal women: systematic review, network meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis of randomised clinical trials [^d9c53142]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

The current available evidence indicates that, despite the varying quality of the reported studies, most approved treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis are beneficial for all types of fractures, with head-to-head trials favouring bone anabolic treatments over bisphosphonates in the prevention of clinical and vertebral fractures, and romosozumab followed by alendronate over alendronate in the prevention of hip fractures in patients at high risk of fractures. Overall, the nominal certainty in the evidence was rated down based on the GRADE criteria because of the serious risk of bias across all treatment combinations and outcomes. For the bone anabolic treatments, a risk of imprecision also existed because only a few studies were available.

The results of the meta-regression analysis showed that treatments were beneficial in reducing the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women, and the effect was mostly independent of baseline risk indicators. Treatment with bone anabolic agents effectively reduced clinical and vertebral fractures, irrespective of mean age and baseline risk, whereas antiresorptive treatments seemed more effective in older patients. Because bone anabolic treatments were more effective than bisphosphonates, irrespective of the baseline risk, no evidence from clinical trials exists supporting the view that bone anabolic treatment should be limited to patients at very high risk of fractures because of efficacy.

Results

Mechanisms of action analysis results

In these analyses, we included 122 235 participants from 22 randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Table 1). In the antiresorptive-only analysis, we included 17 trials: 10 bisphosphonates; 2 hormone therapies — 1 conjugated equine estrogenand 1 conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate; 1 denosumab; and 4 selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM). In the "all placebo-controlled studies" analysis, 3 PTH receptor agonist trials, the first 12 mo of the romosozumab trial (when it was placebo-controlled)and 1 odanacatibtrial were added. We assessed the trial-level association between treatment-related differences in THBMD percent changes measured at 24 mo (primary analysis) and 12 mo (additional analysis) and fracture risk reduction. The number of trials included in each analysis ranged from 12 to 16 in the "antiresorptive only" analysis and from 14 to 21 in the "all placebo-controlled studies" analysis, depending on the specific fracture type and BMD measurement interval combination.

### Risks and benefits of bisphosphonates [^6c702662]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Outside the United States, the choice of available agents for use in oncology is considerable and includes both oral and intravenous formulations of ibandronate and clodronate, and intravenous zoledronic acid and pamidronate. The optimal type and route of administration for a bisphosphonate to prevent skeletal morbidity remains uncertain due to the lack of head-to-head comparisons between the intravenous and oral agents. Zoledronic acid, however, has proven effective across the range of solid tumours, whereas the efficacy benefits of the other agents are restricted to breast cancer and myeloma. Typically, in metastatic bone disease, intravenous formulations are administered every 3–4 weeks and oral agents given on a daily basis. With the latter, strategy compliance may be a significant problem.

Cancer treatment-induced bone loss may also be an indication for bisphosphonate use, especially if the subject has low bone mineral density or risk factors for the occurrence of a low trauma fracture. In this setting, the disturbance of bone turnover is more similar to that seen in postmenopausal bone loss and doses, and schedules of bisphosphonate treatment that are similar to those used in osteoporosis are sufficient. Intravenous zoledronic acid every 6 months, monthly oral ibandronate and weekly oral risedronate have all been shown to prevent bone loss associated with the use of aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal breast cancer. In the context of androgen-deprivation therapy, zoledronic acid every 3–12 months is able to prevent the bone loss associated with therapy.

### Can bisphosphonate therapy reduce overall mortality in patients with osteoporosis? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^5b3bf96f]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

For patients with osteoporosis, bisphosphonate therapy can reduce the risk of fractures, but its effect on reducing mortality remains unclear. Previous studies on this topic have produced conflicting results and generally have been too small to definitively answer the question of whether bisphosphonate therapy reduces mortality. Therefore, a meta-analysis may help us arrive at a more conclusive answer.

Questions/Purposes

In a large meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we asked: (1) Does bisphosphonate use reduce mortality? (2) Is there a subgroup effect based on whether different bisphosphonate drugs were used (zoledronate, alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate), different geographic regions where the study took place (Europe, the Americas, and Asia), whether the study was limited to postmenopausal female patients, or whether the trials lasted 3 years or longer?

Methods

We conducted a systematic review using multiple databases, including Embase, Web of Science, Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov, with each database searched up to November 20, 2023 (which also was the date of our last search), following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We included randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with participants diagnosed with osteoporosis and receiving bisphosphonate treatment. We excluded papers posted to preprint servers, other unpublished work, conference abstracts, and papers that were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov but were not yet published. We collected 2263 records. After excluding records due to study type, study content not meeting the inclusion criteria, and duplicates, our meta-analysis included 47 placebo-controlled RCTs involving 59,437 participants. Data extraction, quality assessment, and statistical analyses were performed. The evaluation of randomized trials for potential bias was conducted using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. This assessment encompassed factors such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, subject blinding, outcome assessor blinding, incomplete outcome data, and reporting bias. Some studies did not provide explicit details regarding random sequence generation, leading to a high risk of selection bias. A few studies, due to their open-label nature, were unable to achieve double-blind conditions for both the subjects and the researchers, resulting in intermediate performance bias. Nevertheless, the overall study quality was high. Due to the low heterogeneity among the studies, as evidenced by the low statistical heterogeneity (that is, a low I 2 statistic), we opted for a fixed-effects model, indicating that the effect size is consistent across the studies. In such cases, the fixed-effects model can provide more precise estimates. According to the results of the funnel plot, we did not find evidence of publication bias.

Results

The use of bisphosphonates did not reduce the overall risk of mortality in patients with osteoporosis (risk ratio 0.95 [95% CI 0.88 to 1.03]). Subgroup analyses involving different bisphosphonate drugs (zoledronate, alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate), regions (Europe, the Americas, and Asia), diverse populations (postmenopausal female patients and other patients), and trials lasting 3 years or longer revealed no associations with reduced overall mortality.

Conclusion

Based on our comprehensive meta-analysis, there is high-quality evidence suggesting that bisphosphonate therapy for patients with osteoporosis does not reduce the overall risk of mortality despite its effectiveness in reducing the risk of fractures. The primary consideration for prescribing bisphosphonates to individuals with osteoporosis should continue to be centered on reducing fracture risk, aligning with clinical guidelines. Long-term studies are needed to investigate potential effects on mortality during extended treatment periods.

### From latency to overt bone metastasis in breast cancer: potential for treatment and prevention [^4e5f12c7]. The Journal of Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Bone metastasis preventive treatments

Preventing metastasis in high‐risk patients would be far better than having to treat it. Bone microenvironment‐modifying agents (such as bisphosphonates or the anti‐RANK ligand antibody denosumab) have the theoretical potential to prevent bone metastasis, although data from clinical trials are as yet inconclusive in unselected patient populations 90, 91. Intravital multiphoton microscopy in mice now provides access to cellular and molecular mechanisms of bone metastasis. Specifically, miniaturized tissue‐engineered bone constructs have been used in nude mice with a skin window to non‐invasively and repetitively monitor prostate cancer lesions in three dimensions 92. After growing tumors inside these bone cavities and inducing niches of osteoclast activation, interventional bisphosphonate therapy reduced osteoclast kinetics and osteolysis, but unexpectedly did not perturb tumor growth 92. This report probes dissociation of the tumor–stroma axis from the tumor growth dynamics and highlights the need to therapeutically target both processes at the same time. Registration trials comparing adjuvant bisphosphonates (clodronate, ibandronate, palmidronate, or zoledronate) to placebo for women (both pre‐menopausal and post‐menopausal) with different stages of BCa have not confirmed clinical utility. To investigate the available evidence in a more robust and precise manner, the Early Breast Cancer Trials Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) conducted a formal individual patient data meta‐analysis of data from 18 766 women involved in 26 randomized trials of adjuvant bisphosphonates for early breast cancer. Strikingly, in post‐menopausal women (n = 11 767), bisphosphonates reduced not only recurrence in bone but also overall BCa recurrence and mortality, leading to recommendation for use in clinical practice 93, 94, 95. These reductions were similar irrespective of ER status or grade of the primary tumor, axillary lymph node involvement, and use/non‐use of chemotherapy, suggesting that menopause status should be the main criterion for patient selection for adjuvant bisphosphonates in prevention of metastases. How these tumor populations become sensitive to the treatment, and which are the contextual determinants that switch the drug response, is unclear. This can be partially explained by the fact that ER induces apoptosis in osteoclasts 96, therefore inhibiting bone resorption. This indicates that estrogen and bisphosphonates may act in redundant ways, suggesting that bisphosphonates are only effective in low‐estrogen patients (ovariectomized or post‐menopausal patients) 96, 97. Importantly, whether there are benefits for any subpopulations of pre‐menopausal BCa patients, for whom there are limited treatment options, remains to be addressed. Notably, the overall trials did not show any trend for outcome improvement, despite the potential benefits for post‐menopausal women. Thus, there is a high unmet medical need for a diagnostic tool to aid in identifying a patient population with a positive benefit–risk ratio for adjuvant bisphosphonates treatment (and as an extension, for denosumab), which could have immediate clinical application 20, 98. Moreover, developing new strategies to evaluate the bone resorptive activity of bisphosphonates and the subjacent mechanism in pre‐clinical models is critical for better understanding their therapeutic potential 92, 99.

### Development of selective bispecific wnt mimetics for bone loss and repair [^6924fa8f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We and others have shown that numerous Fzds are expressed in bone tissues or isolated cell lines. It remains to be determined, however, which specific Fzd(s) have the more profound functional impact on bone accrual. Our results from 18R5-DKK1c, FA-L5, FA-L6, FB-L5, and FB-L6 suggest that multiple Fzds and Fzd subfamilies can confer bone-building effects. To further understand Fzd and Lrp specificities, additional agonists with various binders of Fzd 1,2,7 or Fzd 5,8, or mono-specific Fzd, coupled with various binders to Lrp5 or Lrp6, need to be engineered and examined for their differential effects on bone-building and fracture repair. Similarly, the resulting bi-specific agonists with different activities in the Wnt signaling reporter assay and in vivo bone efficacy need to be thoroughly investigated to elucidate functional impacts of Fzd specificities. It is possible that other Fzd-Lrp combinations will yield even greater bone accrual. Furthermore, skeletal sites may differ in their sensitivity to particular Fzd-Lrp combinations, a possibility that would require additional studies. In addition, under certain skeletal disease conditions, there could be either an abundance or lack of a particular Fzd subfamily. These exciting possibilities could provide a therapeutic armamentarium for targeting a variety of skeletal diseases or fractures at different sites.

Current treatments for osteoporosis include antiresorptive therapies (bisphosphonates, estrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators, calcitonin, and monoclonal antibodies such as denosumab) and anabolic therapies (teriparatide, abaloparatide, and the anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody romosozumab, which indirectly activates Wnt signaling by blocking a negative regulator, sclerostin). Sclerostin acts as a direct antagonist to Wnt signaling through binding Lrp5 and Lrp6. Combination or sequential therapy has the potential to improve bone mass and bone strength compared to monotherapy. In our studies, we found that the combination of our Wnt agonist FB-L5, with bisphosphonate or anti-sclerostin antibody treatment induced greater improvements in BMD compared to monotherapy. These results suggest that Wnt mimetics in combination with current clinical treatments for osteoporosis may enhance bone repair and help maintain bone mass. Wnt mimetics may also provide a stimulus for rapidly improving bone mass in pre-optimization of patients preparing for skeletal surgery.

### Current and emerging pharmacologic therapies for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis [^9c11c2b4]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis is an asymptomatic skeletal disease that is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Osteoporotic fractures are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and impaired quality of life-socially, emotionally, and financially. Considering the growing burden of osteoporotic fractures worldwide, there remains an ongoing need for progress in the diagnosis of osteoporosis, identification of individuals at high fracture risk, and treatment to prevent fractures. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is recommended as baseline therapy for osteoporosis prevention and treatment. Available pharmacological agents for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis may not be appropriate for all women. Oral bisphosphonates are generally considered first-line therapy for patients with osteoporosis, but their use may be limited by gastrointestinal side effects. Other agents include hormone therapy, the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene, salmon calcitonin, teriparatide (human recombinant parathyroid hormone), and strontium ranelate (in some countries). Factors that may contribute to poor compliance and persistence with current osteoporosis therapies include drug intolerance, complexity of dosing regimens, and poor understanding of the relative benefit and risk with treatment. Emerging therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis include novel SERMs (bazedoxifene, lasofoxifene, ospemifene, arzoxifene) and denosumab. Because SERMs can display mixed functional estrogen receptor agonist or antagonist activity depending on the target tissue, they may confer beneficial effects on bone with limited stimulation of other tissues (e.g., breast, endometrium). Clinical investigation of these promising new agents is ongoing to evaluate efficacy and safety, with the goal of developing effective strategies to maximize long-term tolerance, compliance, and persistence with therapy.

### Indications and outcomes of osteoporosis and bone modulation therapies [^9b009a93]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a disorder of bone strength that leads to an increased risk of fractures. It is most commonly seen in patients aged 50 or older, although it can sometimes occur at a younger age if there are other comorbidities present. The most common cause of osteoporosis by far is menopause, although it also occurs in men, usually with higher morbidity rates than those seen in women. There are many treatment options available, such as anabolics and antiresorptives, with many more currently being developed. However, osteoporosis remains grossly unrecognized and untreated, resulting in a significant strain on the American economy.

### Effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy on bone health among breast cancer patients. does it require intervention? [^4e3b3312]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Although the burden and mechanisms of endocrine therapy-related bone loss are known, the evidence is scanty regarding the impact of cytotoxic chemotherapy on bone health. We have attempted to summarize the effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy on bone health in BC patients.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was performed via MEDLINE and Cochrane library databases to evaluate the effect of chemotherapy on bone health among women with BC. We included articles related to skeletal-related events, bone mineral density, bone turnover markers, osteoporosis-specific quality of life, bisphosphonate, and other bone-directed therapy. We excluded articles that included patients with metastatic breast cancer and patients receiving hormonal therapy.

Discussion

Bone microenvironment in cancer is directly or indirectly influenced by clinical, hormonal, nutritional, and treatment factors. Calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, calcitriol, and estrogen are the major hormonal regulators. Bone turnover markers, namely bone formation and resorption markers, have been used to predict bone loss, fracture risk, and monitoring treatment response. Chemotherapeutic drugs such as anthracyclines and taxanes synergistically affect BMD and quality of life. Calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonates, and denosumab are supplemented to prevent excess bone resorption. Bone-targeted anti-resorptive agents have been studied as potential anticancer agents in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.

Conclusion

This review summarizes the negative effect of chemotherapy on bone health of BC patients and the importance of preventing or treating bone loss.

### Combination teriparatide and raloxifene therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis: results from a 6-month double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^3a4e84b1]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

We compared combination treatment with teriparatide plus raloxifene with teriparatide alone in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis in a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that measured biochemical markers of bone turnover and BMD. Markers of bone formation and spine BMD increased similarly with teriparatide alone and combination therapy. However, combination therapy induced a significantly smaller increase in bone resorption versus teriparatide alone and significantly increased total hip BMD versus baseline.

Introduction

The effects of combining two approved treatments for osteoporosis with different modes of action were examined by comparing teriparatide [rhPTH(1–34)] monotherapy with combination teriparatide and raloxifene therapy.

Materials and Methods

A 6-month randomized, double-blind trial comparing teriparatide plus raloxifene (n = 69) versus teriparatide plus placebo (n = 68) was conducted in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

Results

Bone formation (N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen [PINP]) increased similarly in both treatment groups. However, the increase in bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CTx]) in the combination group was significantly smaller than in the teriparatide-alone group (p = 0.015). Lumbar spine BMD significantly increased 5.19 ± 0.67% from baseline in the teriparatide-alone group. In the combination group, lumbar spine (6.19 ± 0.65%), femoral neck (2.23 ± 0.64%), and total hip (2.31 ± 0.56%) BMD significantly increased from baseline to study endpoint, and the increase in total hip BMD was significantly greater than in the teriparatide-alone group (p = 0.04). In the teriparatide-alone group, mean serum calcium levels increased from baseline to endpoint (0.30 ± 0.06 mg/dl, p < 0.001), whereas mean serum phosphate remained unchanged. In the combination group, mean serum calcium was unchanged, and mean serum phosphate decreased (-0.20 ± 0.06 mg/dl, p < 0.001) from baseline to endpoint. Changes in serum calcium (p < 0.001) and phosphate (p < 0.004) were significantly different between treatment groups. The safety profile of combination therapy was similar to teriparatide alone.

Conclusions

Combination therapy increased bone formation to a similar degree as teriparatide alone. However, the increase in bone resorption was significantly less and total hip BMD significantly increased for combination therapy compared with teriparatide alone. Combination treatment with raloxifene may thus enhance the bone forming effects of teriparatide. Further studies over longer treatment duration that include fracture endpoints are necessary to fully ascertain the clinical significance of combination raloxifene plus teriparatide therapy in postmenopausal osteoporosis.

### Steroid-free medium discloses oestrogenic effects of the bisphosphonate clodronate on breast cancer cells [^6fc440d2]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

It should be possible to prevent bone demineralization associated with oestrogen deprivation therapy by combining the latter with the use of bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates are indeed potent inhibitors of osteoclasts and represent the reference therapy for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Moreover, many studies indicate that they prevent the development of metastatic bone diseases in animals. A few human trials have already been performed to evaluate oral clodronate in this setting. Although the clinical usefulness of this compound in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer remains somewhat controversial, the largest trial so far has shown that clodronate can decrease the incidence of bone metastasis and prolong survival. Several trials are currently in progress or planned to disclose possible combined effect of AIs and various bisphosphonates in the treatment of breast cancers, with the prospect of preventing bone mineral loss and reducing the incidence of bone metastasis.

Bisphosphonates are also able to inhibit breast cancer cell growth in vitro (for a review, see). However, all studies reported so far were performed in steroid-containing medium. The present work has investigated the effects of clodronate on the growth of the ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cell line cultured in steroid-free medium (SFM) in order to mimic the effect of AIs in vivo. We have also analysed the effect of clodronate in combination with ER agonist and antagonists, with particular emphasis on ER expression and activity.

Results

In the current analyses, we included data from 122 235 participants from 22 randomized, placebo-controlled trials for whom we had information on both THBMD change and incident fractures (Table S1). Data came from the following trials of osteoporosis medications: 10 bisphosphonate, 1 odanacatib,2 hormone therapy — 1 conjugated equine oestrogenand 1 conjugated equine oestrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate,3 parathyroid hormone -PTH receptor agonists, 1 denosumab,4 selective estrogen receptor modulator, and 1 romosozumab. The median study follow-up ranged from 12 to 100 mo. The number of trials used in each analysis ranged from 14 to 21, depending on the specific fracture type and BMD measurement interval combination (Table 1).

Optimal duration of treatment and drug holidays — "treatment of 3 to 5 years" with osteoporosis therapies is "highly beneficial with only minimal risk", but long-term decisions depend on medication type. For bisphosphonates, evidence "includes two randomized trials (one of alendronate and one of zoledronic acid)" and data "beyond 5 years", and "These studies support a residual effect of bisphosphonates after stopping, which support bisphosphonate holidays". In contrast, "for all other therapies… after discontinuation, benefits are quickly lost", so "these therapies must be continued indefinitely or followed with bisphosphonates or another type of therapy to retain the gains achieved".

### Comparing therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis prevention and treatment [^ae943378]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature concerning the efficacy of calcium, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and calcitonin in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Data Sources

Articles were identified through searches of the MEDLINE (1966-July 2002), EMBASE (1980-July 2002), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-July 2002) databases using the key words osteoporosis, postmenopausal, fracture, calcium, vitamin D, hormone replacement therapy, bisphosphonates, alendronate, risedronate, raloxifene, and calcitonin. Additional references were located through review of the bibliographies of the articles cited. Searches were not limited by time restriction, language, or human subject.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Experimental and observational studies of the use of calcium and antiresorptive therapies for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis were selected. Articles evaluating bone mineral density (BMD) or fracture efficacy were included in this review.

Data Synthesis

HRT, bisphosphonates, raloxifene, and calcitonin have demonstrated stabilization of and improvement in BMD. Randomized clinical trials have shown fracture risk reduction with bisphosphonates, raloxifene, HRT, calcium, and calcitonin. The largest risk reductions have been reported with use of bisphosphonates in several trials.

Conclusions

Several therapeutic options with well-documented improvements in BMD and reductions in fracture risk are available to women for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

### Bisphosphonates and HRT for postmenopausal… [^97b00e31]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy is currently accepted as treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis, with a 50 percent reduction in fractures, especially of the hip, related to this condition. Bisphosphonates are also known to increase bone mass. Wimalawansa conducted this randomized controlled trial to determine if there was a synergistic effect on bone mineral density when hormone replacement therapy and etidronate, a bisphosphonate, were used together in women with established postmenopausal osteoporosis. Patients were excluded from the study if they had surgically-induced menopause or secondary osteoporosis, or if they had previously used medications that affect calcium metabolism. All 72 patients were encouraged to engage in mild exercise and to make lifestyle modifications as needed. All patients received 1 g of elemental calcium and 400 units of vitamin D daily. Three treatment groups and a control group were included in the study. The hormone replacement therapy group received 0.

625 mg of premarin and 150 mg of norgestrel daily for 12 days each month; the etidronate group received 400 mg of etidronate daily for 14 days every 12 weeks; and the combined therapy group received hormone replacement therapy and etidronate in the above dosages. To determine bone mineral density, patients had radiograph absorptiometric measurements of the spine and hip at baseline and at two and four years after beginning treatment. Lateral radiographs of the spine were also taken at baseline and at four years, to determine the occurrence of new vertebral fractures. Patients in the control group lost 0. 9 percent of spinal bone mineral density at two years and
2. 5 percent at four years. Patients in the hormone replacement therapy group and the etidronate group experienced no significant increases in spinal bone mineral density. In contrast, the combined therapy group showed a significant increase in spinal bone mineral density at year two and year four.

Similarly, the patients in the combined treatment group had significant increases in hip bone mineral density at four years over the control and treatment groups. The combined treatment group also had a much lower fracture rate when compared with the control group. The author concludes that the combination of hormone replacement therapy plus etidronate can increase spinal and hip bone mineral density and prevent vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with known osteoporosis. A long-term study is necessary to assess the impact on fracture rates.

### Clinical review: effect of endocrine therapies on bone in breast cancer patients [^ca3d4b73]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Two common strategies are used to treat estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in women: tamoxifen to inhibit estrogen action, and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) to block estrogen biosynthesis. Recent data suggest that AIs are more effective than tamoxifen in the adjuvant and advanced disease settings and are now being more commonly used. Tamoxifen, as a selective estrogen receptor modulator, exerts estrogenic effects to preserve bone, whereas the AIs profoundly lower estrogen levels and cause bone loss. Recent comparative studies of these agents provide extensive data on fracture rates, bone mineral density, and markers of bone formation and resorption.

Objective

The aim of the study was to review the mechanistic effects of estrogen on bone and clinical data regarding bone density, bone turnover markers, and fracture rates in women with breast cancer taking tamoxifen or AIs.

Evidence Acquisition and Synthesis

Data presented reflect a review of the literature and data integration from the perspective of the author's knowledge of the field.

Results

Tamoxifen increases bone density and reduces fractures in postmenopausal women with breast cancer, whereas AIs increase rate of fracture, accelerate loss of bone mineral density, and enhance levels of markers of bone formation and resorption. Bisphosphonates and denosumab counteract the effects of the AIs on bone. Guidelines for management of AI-induced bone loss are available from several sources, but a simple algorithm guides decision making most effectively.

Conclusions

Endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with breast cancer exerts substantial effects on bone, and guidelines are available to assist in the management of bone-related problems.

### Management of osteoporosis in survivors of adult cancers with nonmetastatic disease: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^6cdd6d01]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline — pharmacologic management states that for patients with nonmetastatic cancer with osteoporosis (T scores of −2.5 or less in the femoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine) or who are at increased risk by clinical assessment or risk tools (10-year probability of ≥ 20% for major osteoporotic fractures or ≥ 3% for hip fracture based on the US-adapted FRAX tool), bone-modifying agents such as oral bisphosphonates, intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates or subcutaneous denosumab at the osteoporosis-indicated dosage may be offered to reduce the risk of fracture. Hormonal therapies for osteoporosis management (eg, estrogens) are generally avoided in patients with hormonally-responsive cancers, and for patients without hormonally responsive cancers, estrogens may be offered along with other bone-modifying agents when clinically appropriate (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). Current evidence suggests that oral bisphosphonates, IV bisphosphonates, and subcutaneous denosumab are each efficacious options.

### Monitoring treatment for osteoporosis by using bone densitometry [^ab42f19f]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

In recent years, the range of treatments available for patients with osteoporosis has greatly increased. A decade ago, the only proven therapy was estrogen, but today the choices include bisphosphonates, selective estrogen-receptor modulators, calcitonin, and parathyroid hormone. Clinical trials involving bone mineral density (BMD) scans of the spine and femur have had an important role in the evaluation of these new therapies. In particular, the efficacy of treatments has now been verified in large studies powered to show reductions in fracture risk. In contrast with the use of BMD scans in research studies, their value for monitoring response to treatment in individual patients is less certain. In many cases, the increases in BMD are too small to reliably distinguish between true changes and measurement error. However, experience with estrogen and bisphosphonates suggests that these treatments have a beneficial effect on bone in most patients. Follow-up scans for patients taking these agents are therefore of limited value, apart from offering reassurance to the patient and the doctor. However, when new therapies are first introduced, follow-up scans have a useful role in building up the physician's experience and confidence.

Osteoporosis incidence during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer — bisphosphonate and denosumab trials — show mixed effects: A systematic review reported four osteoporosis‑indicated dose bisphosphonate trials; one risedronate plus estrogen trial showed no difference in the incidence of osteoporosis at 6 or 12 months across four arms, and similarly there was no significant difference with alendronate at 24 months or ZA at 12 months. In contrast, one study comparing clodronate or ZA with control after 12 months reported lower occurrence of osteoporosis with clodronate or ZA (18% v 58%; P < .05; and 21% v 58%; P < .001, respectively). In trials of men receiving ADT, rates between denosumab and placebo were similar for total adverse effects, grade 3 or greater effects, serious adverse effects, and cardiovascular events.

### Efficacy of pharmacological therapies for the prevention of fractures in postmenopausal women: a network meta-analysis [^f5829e34]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis and osteopenia are associated with increased fracture incidence in postmenopausal women. We aimed to determine the comparative effectiveness of various available pharmacological therapies.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus for randomized controlled trials that enrolled postmenopausal women with primary osteoporosis and evaluated the risk of hip, vertebral, or nonvertebral fractures. A network meta-analysis was conducted using the multivariate random effects method.

Results

We included 107 trials (193,987 postmenopausal women; mean age, 66 years; 55% white; median follow-up, 28 months). A significant reduction in hip fractures was observed with romosozumab, alendronate, zoledronate, risedronate, denosumab, estrogen with progesterone, and calcium in combination with vitamin D. A significant reduction in nonvertebral fractures was observed with abaloparatide, romosozumab, denosumab, teriparatide, alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate, lasofoxifene, tibolone, estrogen with progesterone, and vitamin D. A significant reduction in vertebral fractures was observed with abaloparatide, teriparatide, parathyroid hormone 1–84, romosozumab, strontium ranelate, denosumab, zoledronate, risedronate, alendronate, ibandronate, raloxifene, bazedoxifene, lasofoxifene, estrogen with progesterone, tibolone, and calcitonin. Teriparatide, abaloparatide, denosumab, and romosozumab were associated with the highest relative risk reductions, whereas ibandronate and selective estrogen receptor modulators had lower efficacy. The evidence for the treatment of fractures with vitamin D and calcium remains limited despite numerous large trials.

Conclusions

This network meta-analysis provides comparative effective estimates for the various available treatments to reduce the risk of fragility fractures in postmenopausal women.

### The role of bisphosphonates in preventing skeletal complications of hormonal therapy [^cf5a5e01]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is associated with a significant decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), and continued exposure seems to increase the risk of osteoporotic fracture in men who have prostate cancer treated with this strategy. Men who have prostate cancer may have low BMD before initiation of ADT. Bisphosphonates are pyrophosphate analogs that decrease bone resorption primarily through direct inhibition of osteoclast activity and proliferation. Several bisphosphonates have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials, and the cumulative data show that these medications increase or maintain BMD in men receiving ADT for prostate cancer. The effect on clinical fractures has not been assessed adequately, but bisphosphonates offer an important potential treatment modality to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fracture in this population of men.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^d76b7aff]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

GRADE classification — Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline on osteoporosis in postmenopausal women — defines two recommendation strengths and four evidence-quality levels: Strong (1) labeled "We recommend" with "Benefits clearly outweigh harms and burdens, or vice versa", and Conditional (2) labeled "We suggest" with "Benefits closely balanced with harms and burdens". Evidence quality categories are High Quality (well-performed randomized controlled trials or very strong evidence from unbiased observational studies), Moderate Quality (randomized controlled trials with some limitations), Low Quality (randomized controlled trials with serious flaws or some evidence from observational studies), and Very Low Quality (unsystematic clinical observations or very indirect evidence from observational studies).

### Bisphosphonates and other bone agents for breast cancer [^4ebcc2d4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bone is the most common site of metastatic disease associated with breast cancer (BC). Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and novel targeted therapies such as denosumab inhibit other key bone metabolism pathways. We have studied these agents in both early breast cancer and advanced breast cancer settings. This is an update of the review originally published in 2002 and subsequently updated in 2005 and 2012.

Objectives

To assess the effects of bisphosphonates and other bone agents in addition to anti-cancer treatment: (i) in women with early breast cancer (EBC); (ii) in women with advanced breast cancer without bone metastases (ABC); and (iii) in women with metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases (BCBM).

Search Methods

In this review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 September 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: (a) one treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent with the same treatment without a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent; (b) treatment with one bisphosphonate versus treatment with a different bisphosphonate; (c) treatment with a bisphosphonate versus another bone-acting agent of a different mechanism of action (e.g. denosumab); and (d) immediate treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent versus delayed treatment of the same bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was bone metastases for EBC and ABC, and a skeletal-related event (SRE) for BCBM. We derived risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and the meta-analyses used random-effects models. Secondary outcomes included overall survival and disease-free survival for EBC; we derived hazard ratios (HRs) for these time-to-event outcomes where possible. We collected toxicity and quality-of-life information. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes in each treatment setting.

Main Results

We included 44 RCTs involving 37,302 women. In women with EBC, bisphosphonates were associated with a reduced risk of bone metastases compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03, 11 studies; 15,005 women; moderate-quality evidence with no significant heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates provided an overall survival benefit with time-to-event data (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; P = 0.04; 9 studies; 13,949 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity). Subgroup analysis by menopausal status showed a survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90; P = 0.001; 4 studies; 6048 women; high-quality evidence with no evidence of heterogeneity) but no survival benefit for premenopausal women (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; P = 0.78; 2 studies; 3501 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). There was evidence of no effect of bisphosphonates on disease-free survival (HR 0.94, 95% 0.87 to 1.02; P = 0.13; 7 studies; 12,578 women; high-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity present) however subgroup analyses showed a disease-free survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women only (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; P < 0.001; 7 studies; 8314 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates did not significantly reduce the incidence of fractures when compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.08, P = 0.13, 6 studies, 7602 women; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence intervals). We await mature overall survival and disease-free survival results for denosumab trials. In women with ABC without clinically evident bone metastases, there was no evidence of an effect of bisphosphonates on bone metastases (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43; P = 0.86; 3 studies; 330 women; moderate-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) or overall survival (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; P = 0.28; 3 studies; 330 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates however the confidence intervals were wide. One study reported a trend towards an extended period of time without a SRE with bisphosphonate compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). One study reported quality of life and there was no apparent difference in scores between bisphosphonate and placebo (moderate-quality evidence). In women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduced the SRE risk by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003; 9 studies; 2810 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity) compared with placebo/no bisphosphonates. This benefit persisted when administering either intravenous or oral bisphosphonates versus placebo. Bisphosphonates delayed the median time to a SRE with a median ratio of 1.43 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.58; P < 0.00001; 9 studies; 2891 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) and reduced bone pain (in 6 out of 11 studies; moderate-quality evidence) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate. Treatment with bisphosphonates did not appear to affect overall survival (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; P = 0.85; 7 studies; 1935 women; moderate-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity). Quality-of-life scores were slightly better with bisphosphonates than placebo at comparable time points (in three out of five studies; moderate-quality evidence) however scores decreased during the course of the studies. Denosumab reduced the risk of developing a SRE compared with bisphosphonates by 22% (RR 0.78, 0.72 to 0.85; P < 0.001; 3 studies, 2345 women). One study reported data on overall survival and observed no difference in survival between denosumab and bisphosphonate. Reported toxicities across all settings were generally mild. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was rare, occurring less than 0.5% in the adjuvant setting (high-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

For women with EBC, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastases and provide an overall survival benefit compared to placebo or no bisphosphonates. There is preliminary evidence suggestive that bisphosphonates provide an overall survival and disease-free survival benefit in postmenopausal women only when compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate. This was not a planned subgroup for these early trials, and we await the completion of new large clinical trials assessing benefit for postmenopausal women. For women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of developing SREs, delay the median time to an SRE, and appear to reduce bone pain compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate.

### Challenges in preventing bone loss induced by aromatase inhibitors [^39a95013]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Aromatase inhibitors have become a mainstay in the adjuvant treatment regimen in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. While many of these patients have an excellent long-term prognosis, adverse effects on bone represent an emerging complication of aromatase inhibitor treatment, resulting in substantial bone loss and fragility fractures. Treatment approaches to prevent aromatase inhibitor-induced bone loss typically consist of an antiresorptive approach with bisphosphonates or the RANKL antibody denosumab. However, different guidelines vary with respect to treatment thresholds, duration, and dosing. The choice of antiresorptive regime is further complicated by comorbidities and potential disease-modifying effects of individual agents.

Objective

This review summarizes the evidence of how aromatase inhibitors affect bone health and provides an update of clinical approaches to preserve bone strength in affected women. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab XX: 0–0, 2020).

### Risks and benefits of bisphosphonates [^7603c753]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

In addition to the effects of spread of cancer to bone, there are also important effects of cancer treatments on bone health. This is largely mediated through endocrine effects of treatment, including ovarian suppression, androgen deprivation therapy and the use of aromatase inhibitors that block oestrogen synthesis in postmenopausal women. With the improved survival that has emerged over the past 30 years through improved diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the long-term effects of treatment on the skeleton have become an important clinical problem and a specific rationale for the use of bone-specific treatments.

Over the past two decades, the bisphosphonates have become established as an important component of treatment in metastatic disease and the management of osteoporosis. All bisphosphonates are pyrophosphate analogues, characterized by a P-C-P containing central structure rather than the P-O-P of pyrophosphate, and a variable side chain. The P-C-P backbone renders bisphosphonates resistant to phosphatase activity and promotes their binding to the mineralised bone matrix.

After intravenous administration of a bisphosphonate, approximately 50–75% of the injected dose binds avidly to exposed bone mineral, where it is internalised by the osteoclast during bone esorption and the remainder is excreted by the kidney. All bisphosphonates suffer from poor bioavailability, when given by mouth (< 5%), and must be taken on an empty stomach, as they bind to calcium in the diet. Once a bisphosphonate is taken up by an osteoclast, it causes the disruption of a number of biochemical processes involved in osteoclast function, typically resulting in apoptosis of the cell.

The molecular mechanism of action is now established, with nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates inhibiting farnesyl diphosphatase and other enzymes of the mevalonate pathway. Non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, such as clodronate, have a different mode of action and induce osteoclast apoptosis through the generation of cytotoxic ATP analogues. Recent studies also suggest that bisphosphonates have direct effects on tumour cells and may enhance the antitumour activities of cytotoxic agents.

### Early changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover are associated with long-term changes in bone mineral density in elderly women on alendronate, hormone replacement therapy, or combination therapy: a three-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^5e1e810b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Elderly women on combination therapy with alendronate and hormone replacement for osteoporosis have greater gains in bone mass than those on monotherapy. It is not known whether early changes in markers can predict the long-term changes in bone density with therapy. We assessed bone density and biochemical markers of bone turnover [urine N-telopeptide cross-linked collagen type 1 (NTx), serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin] every 6 months for 3 yr in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. After a 3-month run-in phase, 373 community-dwelling, elderly women were randomized to 1) alendronate, 2) hormone replacement therapy, 3) combination therapy with alendronate and hormone replacement therapy, or 4) placebo. Women on active treatment with the greatest decrease in markers of bone turnover at 6 months had the greatest increases in spine and hip bone density at 3 yr. The response to alendronate was generally associated with greater reductions in markers than the response to hormone replacement and was associated with greater increases in bone density at the spine and hip. Those in the tertile with the greatest decrease in urinary NTx had a 10.1% increase in spine bone density and a 6.1% increase in hip bone density compared with those in the lowest tertile, who had a 5.9% increase in spine bone density and a 2.1% increase in hip bone density. In women on active treatment, the area under the receiver operator curve for a 6-month change in markers to predict a response in bone mineral density at 3 yr was highest for urine NTx (range, 75–78%) and lowest for osteocalcin (range, 60–66%). We conclude that short-term changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover at 6 months predict bone density changes at the spine and hip at 3 yr in elderly women on alendronate, hormone replacement therapy, or combination therapy.

### Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^99cab30e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass in adults — this ACP guideline presents a focused update on clinical recommendations for pharmacologic treatments to prevent fractures in adults, based on the best available evidence of the benefits and harms of treatments and consideration of patient values, preferences, and costs. The population is adults (premenopausal and postmenopausal females and males) with low bone mass or primary osteoporosis as diagnosed in primary studies, and baseline risk assessment considers diagnosis of osteoporosis, history of osteoporotic fractures (clinical or incidental), multiple risk factors for fractures, or failure or intolerability of osteoporosis medications rather than scores from available tools. The recommendations are based on biological sex assigned at birth because most studies reported sex rather than gender and the majority enrolled only older females. Evaluated therapies include an analogue of human parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) (abaloparatide), bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, zoledronate), a receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) ligand inhibitor (denosumab), recombinant human parathyroid hormone (recombinant PTH) (teriparatide), a sclerostin inhibitor (romosozumab), and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (bazedoxifene, raloxifene), with focus on effectiveness and harms of active drugs compared with placebo or bisphosphonates. The intended audience is all clinicians, and management of secondary osteoporosis in people with cancer and other serious illnesses is outside the scope. The Clinical Guidelines Committee developed this guideline according to ACP's guideline development process, used Evidence-to-Decision tables, and graded recommendations using the GRADE approach; it is planning to maintain this topic as a living guideline with quarterly literature surveillance and periodic updating, and may retire living status if it is no longer a priority, if conclusions are unlikely to change with new evidence, or if new evidence is unlikely to emerge. The guideline is based on an accompanying systematic review and network meta-analysis completed by the ACP Center for Evidence Reviews, and the accompanying review and Supplement Appendixes provide appraised evidence of benefits and harms of evaluated pharmacologic interventions.
