## Question

mesalamine oral dosing ulcerative colitis flare

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to dose oral mesalamine for a flare of ulcerative colitis and when to escalate or modify therapy if response is suboptimal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the target clinical scenario and confirm disease severity. Then, I should define the standard adult induction dose range. Next, I will determine when to choose standard versus high-dose therapy and the optimal dosing frequency. After that, I need to set an evidence-based induction duration and response assessment timeline, with clear escalation rules. Finally, I should review key safety monitoring and special populations, and synthesize a practical algorithm that aligns with guideline recommendations [^111mU1Eg] [^1169438b].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: a "UC flare" implies active disease and an induction-of-remission strategy, typically mild-to-moderate activity for which oral 5-ASA is first-line; I initially wondered if the request might also include severe UC, but wait, mesalamine monotherapy is not adequate for severe disease, so the relevant scope here is mild-to-moderately active UC where oral mesalamine is appropriate and guideline-concordant [^111mU1Eg] [^1169438b].

> I should define the evidence-based adult induction dose range before getting into nuances; across high-credibility sources the effective oral mesalamine range for induction is 2.4–4.8 g/day, with 2.4 g/day as a minimum effective dose and 4.8 g/day as the upper evidence-supported dose, and labeling typically evaluates 6–8 weeks of therapy for induction [^116SCadc] [^113X8U6j] [^111mU1Eg] [^1169438b].

> Next, I will now examine dose selection within that range; in moderately active disease or in partial responders, higher-dose 4.8 g/day achieves superior outcomes versus 2.4 g/day in ASCEND II, supporting escalation when clinical context warrants it, and this aligns with clinical experience that more extensive or refractory mild-to-moderate disease benefits from the upper range of 5-ASA dosing; hold on, I should verify that I am not overgeneralizing to pediatrics — FDA pediatric data did not show superiority of a "high" dose over a "low" dose in a small 6-week study, so my adult dosing recommendations should not be naively extrapolated to children without weight-based considerations [^117SzL6Y] [^111YKJTY] [^112sJxLi].

> Let me consider dosing frequency because adherence affects real-world effectiveness; once-daily dosing of oral mesalamine is noninferior to multiple-daily schedules for induction and maintenance, and several trials and meta-analyses show equivalent efficacy and safety with a potential adherence advantage for once-daily regimens, so favoring once-daily administration is reasonable unless patient-specific factors dictate otherwise [^1169438b] [^111h9cAk] [^1115eMpa] [^115MXXQV].

> I should confirm the induction duration and assessment windows; labeling and pivotal trials evaluate efficacy at 6–8 weeks, with ASCEND II using a 6-week primary endpoint, so an induction course of 6–8 weeks is standard before declaring failure, although I need to check early symptom trends to guide timely dose escalation within that window [^116SCadc] [^112oYiVk] [^113X8U6j] [^117SzL6Y].

> Now, I need to ensure clear response assessment and escalation criteria; practically, I reassess at 2–3 weeks for trajectory, consider dose escalation to 4.8 g/day for partial response, and by 6–8 weeks determine whether to add rectal mesalamine for suboptimal response before switching classes; if oral plus rectal mesalamine at appropriate doses fail, guidelines advise against switching to another 5-ASA formulation and instead moving to a different class such as budesonide MMX for left-sided disease or systemic corticosteroids, keeping pediatric timelines shorter for early adjustment [^111mU1Eg] [^111mgEWX] [^1151hj4T] [^111JUFyw].

> Wait, let me verify safety and monitoring before finalizing the plan; I should obtain baseline and periodic renal function given risks of interstitial nephritis and nephrolithiasis, maintain vigilance for mesalamine-induced acute intolerance syndrome that can mimic a flare, and consider rare systemic hypersensitivity involving myocarditis or pericarditis; I also need to address pregnancy and lactation counseling, where mesalamine and its metabolite appear in breast milk at low levels and risk–benefit should be individualized with caution [^112WTRMZ] [^113YkKcX] [^112r17Tk] [^113MtqLq] [^116m1BaW].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or adolescent; in pediatrics, I should confirm weight-based oral dosing of 50–70 mg/kg/day, up to 100 mg/kg/day or a 4.8 g/day ceiling, recognize that most children will not achieve remission with oral monotherapy alone, and plan early addition of rectal mesalamine if response is not meaningful within 2–3 weeks, while noting that a pediatric RCT did not show the "high" dose outperforming the "low" dose over 6 weeks, which tempers assumptions about simple dose–response in that population [^111mgEWX] [^112sJxLi].

> Let me synthesize the practical algorithm and double-check alignment with guidelines: for a mild-to-moderate UC flare in adults, start oral mesalamine 2.4 g once daily and treat for 6–8 weeks, reassess at 2–3 weeks to escalate to 4.8 g/day for partial response or for moderate disease at baseline, add rectal mesalamine if response remains suboptimal, and if appropriately dosed oral plus rectal 5-ASA fail, avoid switching 5-ASA formulations and move to budesonide MMX for left-sided disease or a short course of systemic steroids as indicated, all while monitoring renal function and intolerance syndromes and, upon response, transitioning to maintenance dosing per labeling and patient course with a preference for once-daily schedules to support adherence [^116SCadc] [^111h9cAk] [^111mU1Eg] [^1151hj4T].

---

For induction of remission in a UC flare, **oral mesalamine 2.4–4.8 g/day** [^116SCadc] is recommended, with **once-daily or divided dosing** based on patient preference to optimize adherence [^1169438b] [^111h9cAk]. Higher doses (**4.8 g/day**) are appropriate for moderate disease or if initial response is inadequate [^111mU1Eg] [^117SzL6Y]. Combine with **rectal mesalamine** [^111CFgxe] for left-sided or extensive disease, and treat for 6–8 weeks. If remission is not achieved after 8 weeks, escalate therapy to budesonide MMX or systemic corticosteroids [^1151hj4T] [^114tJoXQ]. Monitor renal function at baseline and periodically; common adverse effects include headache, nausea, and abdominal pain [^113YkKcX] [^112WTRMZ].

## Recommended oral mesalamine dosing for UC flare

- **Standard induction dose**: 2.4–4.8 g/day [^115KJAHc] for mild-to-moderate UC [^1169438b].
- **Dosing frequency**: once daily [^1169438b] or divided doses per patient preference to optimize adherence [^111h9cAk].
- **Higher doses**: 4.8 g/day for moderate disease or inadequate initial response [^111mU1Eg] [^117SzL6Y].
- **Duration**: 6–8 weeks for induction of remission [^116SCadc] [^1169438b].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing recommendations

In the ASCEND II trial [^117SzL6Y], **4.8 g/day was superior** to 2.4 g/day in moderate UC (72% vs 59% treatment success at 6 weeks; p = 0.036). Once-daily MMX mesalamine 2.4–4.8 g/day was effective for induction [^114yiur5]. Once-daily dosing was non-inferior to divided dosing for induction and maintenance [^111h9cAk] [^1115eMpa] [^113ye8vp].

---

## Combination therapy with rectal mesalamine

- **Left-sided or extensive disease**: add rectal mesalamine to oral therapy [^111CFgxe] [^1169438b].
- **Rectal dosing**: enemas 1–4 g nightly [^1127JvbR] or suppositories 1 g daily [^1169438b].
- **Combination therapy**: superior to oral alone for distal disease [^1171rpa2] [^1169438b].

---

## Duration of therapy and monitoring

The **induction duration** is 6–8 weeks [^116SCadc] [^1169438b], and **monitoring** should include renal function at baseline and periodically during treatment [^113YkKcX] [^112r17Tk].

---

## Adverse effects and safety considerations

- **Common adverse effects**: headache [^113YkKcX], nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, fatigue [^116kgRU4].
- **Serious adverse effects**: renal impairment, acute intolerance syndrome, hypersensitivity reactions, hepatic failure, severe cutaneous reactions, photosensitivity, nephrolithiasis [^113YkKcX] [^112WTRMZ].
- **Precautions**: caution in renal or hepatic impairment; monitor renal function regularly [^113YkKcX] [^112r17Tk].

---

## Management of inadequate response

If response is inadequate, **escalate to 4.8 g/day** if not already at maximum [^111mU1Eg] [^117SzL6Y]. If response remains inadequate, use alternative therapies such as budesonide MMX 9 mg/day or systemic corticosteroids, and for refractory cases consider immunomodulators or biologics [^1151hj4T] [^114vvtpN].

---

Oral mesalamine is effective for UC flares, with **2.4–4.8 g/day** recommended; dosing can be once daily or divided, and higher doses are used for moderate disease or inadequate response [^115KJAHc] [^114yiur5].

### Mesalamine [^113YkKcX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The most serious adverse reactions observed in mesalamine delayed-release capsules clinical trials, or with other products containing or metabolizing to mesalamine, are:

- **Renal impairment**: Refer to warnings and precautions (5.1).
- **Mesalamine-induced acute intolerance syndrome**: Refer to warnings and precautions (5.2).
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Refer to warnings and precautions (5.3).
- **Hepatic failure**: Refer to warnings and precautions (5.4).
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: Refer to warnings and precautions (5.5).
- **Photosensitivity**: Refer to warnings and precautions (5.6).
- **Nephrolithiasis**: Refer to warnings and precautions (5.7).

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of mesalamine delayed-release capsules has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets have been evaluated in 2,690 patients with ulcerative colitis in controlled and open-label trials. Below is a description of the adverse reactions of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in these studies.

Clinical studies supporting mesalamine delayed-release tablets use for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis included two 6-week, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies in adults with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis.

### Mesalamine [^112t7rve]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood but appears to involve a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. In patients with ulcerative colitis, there is an increased mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites through both the cyclooxygenase pathways (resulting in prostanoids) and lipoxygenase pathways (resulting in leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids). It is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking the production of these arachidonic acid metabolites.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:
	- **Absorption**: The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. During the multiple-dose period, each subject received 1.5 g of mesalamine (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for seven consecutive days. Steady state was achieved on Day 6 based on trough concentrations.

	- After both single and multiple doses of mesalamine, peak plasma concentrations were observed approximately 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, there were moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC0–24) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA compared with a single dose of mesalamine.

Pharmacokinetic parameters following a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting conditions were outlined; however, a table containing detailed results was not included in this text.

- **Clinical and endoscopic disease activity**: Definitions related to disease activity are outlined in Box 1. The Mayo Score for ulcerative colitis (UC) is widely used in clinical trials and may be applied to clinical practice as a composite clinical and endoscopic tool. The score of 0–12 includes a measure of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, a physician's global assessment, and a measure of mucosal inflammation at endoscopy. The partial Mayo score uses the non-invasive components of the full score and correlates well with patient perceptions of response to therapy.

- **Definitions in IBD management**:

- **Steroid dependency**: Inability to wean systemic steroids below 10 mg of prednisolone within three months without reactive disease, or symptomatic relapse of IBD within three months of stopping steroids.
- **Steroid refractory**: Inability to induce symptomatic remission with systemic steroids.
- **Mucosal healing**: Typically refers to the absence of macroscopic mucosal inflammation or ulceration, although precise definitions vary between studies. While usually defined endoscopically, there has been recent interest in 'histological healing'.
- **Treat to target**: The goal is more than symptomatic remission, with the intention of reducing the risk of future relapse or complications (e.g. ileal strictures or colon cancer) resulting from uncontrolled but asymptomatic inflammation. Future studies are needed to define targets, assess the practicality of achieving them, and examine the balance of benefit versus risk and cost.

- **Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)**: The text may have additional conceptual notes or examples that were not fully included due to truncation, but TDM generally involves optimizing medication dosages based on measured drug concentrations in the blood to improve therapeutic outcomes and minimize toxicity.

### Inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis: Role of high-dose, extended-release mesalamine [^112yKQpH]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

In mild-to-moderate inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) remains a cornerstone of therapy. Sulfasalazine, originally synthesized in 1940 as an arthritis treatment for Sweden's King Gustaf V, is an azo-linked compound between 5-ASA and sulfapyridine. This medication was soon discovered to be effective in treating ulcerative colitis. However, dose-related side effects of the sulfapyridine moiety led to considerable efforts in developing medications to deliver 5-ASA to the desired parts of the intestine. The newest generation of 5-ASA medications allows high-dose medication delivery with decreased pill burden, thereby improving patient compliance.

This review will describe the pharmacokinetics of various 5-ASA preparations, particularly focusing on high-dose formulations and their role in therapy; it will examine scientific literature and review clinical outcomes and safety profiles.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: Ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^114sj389]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

Thiopurines (azathioprine and mercaptopurine) are a mainstay of paediatric UC maintenance management. Meta-analyses of placebo-controlled RCTs affirm that azathioprine is more effective than placebo in preventing relapse but not in inducing remission.

Paediatric data support the efficacy of thiopurines in maintaining remission and reducing the need for corticosteroids. The median time to achieve steady thiopurine levels is 55 days. A prospective dose optimization study including 33 patients with UC reported 1-year corticosteroid-free remission in 39%, with corticosteroid-free remission plus normal CRP and ESR in 27%. A retrospective study from the 'biologic-era' reported a 56% 1-year corticosteroid-free remission in children on thiopurines without previous or concomitant biologic therapy, with a probability of not requiring rescue therapy of 83% at 1 year, 62% at 2 years, 45% at 3 years, and 37% at 4 years. However, earlier introduction of thiopurines neither benefits clinical nor endoscopic outcomes, nor reduces the ultimate risk of colectomy in children.

Despite a single negative small-scale study in adults, combining 5-ASA with thiopurines may be considered due to the excellent safety profile of the former and potential additive effects, including chemoprotection. 5-ASA may partially inhibit TPMT activity, increasing 6-TGN levels. A decision to add 5-ASA should balance the additive efficacy and chemoprevention with maintaining mesalamine while on thiopurines and the better expected adherence profile when the patient is on monotherapy.

### Mesalamine [^113MtqLq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Lactation**: Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk. In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily doses for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine delayed-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or the underlying maternal condition. Caution should be exercised when mesalamine delayed-release capsules are administered to a nursing woman.

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release capsules for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years have been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies using mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets. Use of mesalamine delayed-release capsules in these pediatric age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets in adults and a single 6-week study in 82 pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years.

### Efficacy and safety of oral beclomethasone dipropionate and budesonide MMX5-aminosalicylates or placebo in ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114vvtpN]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

A recent network meta-analysis comparing oral sulfasalazine, 5-ASA [low dose (3 g/day)], controlled ileal-release budesonide, or budesonide MMX — alone or in combination with rectal 5-ASA therapy — and compared to each other or placebo in patients with UC demonstrated that budesonide MMX was not more effective than combined oral and rectal 5-ASA or high-dose mesalamine and has inferior tolerability. Another meta-analysis by Manguso et al, published in 2016 and including five RCTs, showed that BDP 5 mg was superior to 5-ASA in achieving clinical remission or clinical improvement considered separately. The authors included one trial comparing BDP versus 5-ASA as add-on therapy with prednisone (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.76–2.23, and OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.03–1.93, respectively).

However, in clinical practice, if a patient does not respond to induction treatment with 5-ASA, oral steroids are usually the next step. Papi et al. conducted a study administering oral BDP 10 mg/day for 4 weeks, followed by a 4-week administration of 5 mg/day in 64 mild-to-moderate UC patients with a previous 5-ASA treatment failure. They found a remission rate of 75%, with most patients achieving 1-year maintenance of remission with no need for further steroid treatment. These data support the crucial role of oral BDP as an alternative therapy to systemic steroids in patients with a mild-to-moderate flare of the disease that is not responsive to 5-ASA. Moreover, these evidences suggest that further larger randomized studies comparing low bioavailability steroids with 5-ASA are warranted.

### Methotrexate for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis [^114YeSiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylates are the most commonly used therapies; however, many patients require immunosuppressive therapy for steroid-refractory and steroid-dependent disease. Methotrexate is a medication that is effective for treating a variety of inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease. This review was performed to determine the effectiveness of methotrexate treatment in UC patients. Notably, this review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for the induction of remission in patients with UC.

- **Search methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD/FBD group specialized trials register were searched from inception to June 26, 2014. Study references and review papers were also searched for additional trials. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research published in abstract form only.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing methotrexate with placebo or an active comparator in patients with active ulcerative colitis were considered for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission and withdrawal from steroids, as defined by the studies, and expressed as a percentage of the total number of patients randomized (intention-to-treat analysis).

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

- **Oral corticosteroids: Recommendations**
	1. Oral corticosteroids should be used as a second-line induction treatment for mild-to-moderate UC not responding to 5-ASA (oral and/or rectal). Corticosteroids may be considered as first-line induction treatment for moderate-to-severe disease based on clinical and endoscopic characteristics [EL3, adults EL1] (Agreement 100%).
	2. Second-generation oral corticosteroids with lower systemic effect, such as beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) [EL2, adults EL1] and budesonide-MMX [EL5, adults EL2], may be considered in patients with mild-to-moderate disease refractory to 5-ASA (Agreement 100%).
	3. Corticosteroids should not be used for maintaining remission, and the need for repeated courses should prompt a change in therapy; corticosteroid-sparing strategies should be applied [EL5, adults EL4] (Agreement 100%).

- **Oral corticosteroids: Practice points**
	1. The recommended daily dose for oral prednisolone/prednisone is 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 40 mg) once daily in the morning for 1–2 weeks (in any case not > 4 weeks), followed by a tapering period of up to 7 weeks (Agreement 100%).
	2. In patients > 30 kg, the dosing schedule of BDP is 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks, and for budesonide-MMX 9 mg for 8 weeks. Dosing for children < 30 kg has not been established. No liquid formulation is available. There is no evidence to support whether and how to taper either drug. While abrupt discontinuation has been practiced in RCTs, alternate day tapering over 2–4 weeks may be considered (Agreement 100%).
	3. The term 'corticosteroid-dependency' applies to patients who are unable to…

### ECCO guidelines on therapeutics in Crohn's disease: Medical treatment [^112riLqa]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Crohn's disease, particularly concerning maintenance therapy, more specifically medically induced remission with aminosalicylates, the ECCO 2024 guidelines recommend not using oral mesalamine for maintenance therapy in patients with CD.

### Best practice in the management of mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis and achieving maintenance of remission using mesalazine [^111Tjz4Y]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Optimizing treatment goals in ulcerative colitis requires recognizing the needs of patients. It is increasingly recognized that adapting treatment strategies aligned with patient needs can improve patient compliance and consequently minimize relapse rates. Tailoring treatment strategies can improve not only patient quality of life and decrease the number harmed by adverse events from more potent drugs but can also save valuable healthcare costs by avoiding high-cost treatment interventions associated with acute ulcerative colitis. This review will consider several elements of mesalazine management from the patient perspective based on a range of clinical and patient-focused evidence. By highlighting patient preferences in disease management, it is envisaged that this review will aid physicians to optimize treatment decisions with the different mesalazine preparations available.

### British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^117Wox8q]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Oral methotrexate has reduced and extremely variable bioavailability (not corrected by use of folic acid) compared with parenteral administration, particularly at doses above 15 mg. Because bioavailability and pharmacokinetics are very similar for subcutaneous and intramuscular methotrexate, the subcutaneous route should be preferred to intramuscular as it is easier and less painful.

Induction therapy should be given by the subcutaneous route. If patients prefer, this can be switched to oral during the maintenance phase, with the option to switch back to subcutaneous if effectiveness is lost. Whatever the route of administration, methotrexate should be given with folic acid to reduce gastrointestinal and liver toxicity: 5 mg weekly (traditionally 1–2 days after the methotrexate dose) or 1 mg daily.

- **Mesalazine**: We recommend that mesalazine is not used for induction or maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; agreement: 97.7%). UK data from 1990 to 2010 show over half of patients with Crohn's disease were prescribed 5-ASA, and Swiss data show it is more often given for Crohn's colitis. A Cochrane systematic literature review showed that oral 5-ASA has no efficacy in maintaining clinical remission in Crohn's disease, with similar negative findings in meta-analyses for induction or maintenance. A recent review of colonic Crohn's disease showed that there was no benefit for 5-ASA in colonic Crohn's disease, but two studies have shown possible benefit for sulphasalazine in remission induction.

### Delzicol [^113X8U6j]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis involves distinct approaches for adults and pediatric patients.

- **Adults**: In a 6-week placebo-controlled clinical study (Study 1) involving 105 patients, 53 patients were randomized to receive mesalamine delayed-release tablets at a dosage of 2.4 grams per day [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. There was a 4% discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions in the mesalamine-treated group, compared to 0% in the placebo group. The average age of patients was 41 years, with 49% being male. Adverse reactions leading to withdrawal from mesalamine treatment included diarrhea, colitis flare, dizziness, nausea, joint pain, and headache.

	- The most common adverse reactions experienced by the 2.4 grams per day mesalamine group are listed in the table below.

	- **At least 2% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablets group and at a rate greater than placebo**:

- **Pediatric patients 5 to 17 years old**: A randomized, double-blind, 6-week study (Study 3) was conducted in 82 pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Patients were categorized by body weight (17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg) and randomly assigned to receive either a low dosage (1.2, 2, and 2.4 grams per day for the respective weight categories) or a high dosage (2.0, 3.6, and 4.8 grams per day).

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological agents for management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis: A systematic review and network meta-analyses [^1171rpa2]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with ulcerative colitis have mildly to moderately active disease. To inform the management of patients with left-sided or extensive mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis, we assessed the comparative efficacy and tolerability of different therapies.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched Epub, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to Dec 14, 2015, and updated on MEDLINE on March 1, 2018, for randomized controlled trials in adults (age ≥ 17 years) with left-sided or extensive mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Studies were included if patients were treated with oral sulfasalazine, diazo-bonded 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), mesalazine (low dose 3 g/day), controlled ileal-release budesonide, or budesonide multimatrix, alone or in combination with rectal 5-ASA therapy, and were compared with each other or placebo for induction or maintenance of clinical remission. The minimum duration of therapy was 4 weeks for trials of induction and 24 weeks for trials of maintenance therapy. We did pairwise and random-effects network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach and calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs); agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to appraise.

### Delayed-release oral mesalamine at 4.8 g/day (800 mg tablet) for the treatment of moderately active ulcerative colitis: the ASCEND II trial [^117SzL6Y]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Preliminary data have shown that delayed-release oral mesalamine (Asacol) dosed at 4.8 g/day provided additional efficacy benefits compared to 1.6 g/day in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Additionally, Asacol at 2.4 g/day has been proven to be more effective than at 1.6 g/day. Whether 4.8 g/day of mesalamine (dosed with an investigational 800 mg tablet) is more effective than Asacol 2.4 g/day (dosed with a 400 mg tablet) in patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis is unknown.

- **Methods**: A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial (ASCEND II) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 4.8 g/day of mesalamine in adults with active ulcerative colitis. Three hundred eighty-six patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis were randomized for treatment with mesalamine 2.4 g/day (400 mg tablet) or 4.8 g/day (800 mg tablet) for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy population was 268 patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis treated with 2.4 g/day (n = 139) or 4.8 g/day (n = 129). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in each treatment group that achieved overall improvement ("treatment success", defined as either complete remission or a clinical response to therapy) from baseline at week 6.

- **Results**: Seventy-two percent of patients receiving 4.8 g/day of mesalamine for moderate ulcerative colitis (89/124 patients) achieved treatment success at week 6, compared with 59% of those who received 2.4 g/day (77/130 patients) (p = 0.036). Both regimens were well tolerated. Adverse events and clinically significant details were not included in the summary.

### SPL drug information for mesalamine DR [^112WTRMZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of mesalamine DR PO (also known as Lialda, Delzicol):

- **Acute liver failure (ALF)**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing liver disease.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine may cause hypersensitivity reactions involving internal organs, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Use caution in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfasalazine.

- **Mesalamine-induced acute intolerance syndrome**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine may cause acute intolerance syndrome, presented with symptoms such as cramping, acute abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, and rash, which may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis.

- **Minimal change disease, interstitial nephritis, renal failure**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Assess renal function at baseline and periodically during treatment.

- **Nephrolithiasis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine has been associated with an increased risk of nephrolithiasis, including mesalamine-containing stones. Advise adequate fluid intake during treatment.

- **Photosensitivity of skin**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and apply sunscreen while outdoors.

- **Positive urine normetanephrine test**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine has been rep.

### Efficacy of dose escalation of oral 5-aminosalicylic acid for ulcerative colitis with a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 1: An open label randomized controlled trial [^1163eNxo]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Eligible patients were randomly assigned, using a computer-generated, stratified randomization procedure, to either the group with or without therapeutic intervention. Patients assigned to the group without intervention were defined as the control group. Patients were randomized within 30 days from the confirmation of an MES of 1. The stratified factor in the randomization procedure was the concomitant use of immunomodulators at the time of randomization. Neither patients nor healthcare providers were masked in the randomization.

- **Endoscopic severity scoring**: Endoscopists inspected the entire colon using conventional white-light imaging. All endoscopists were experts in inflammatory bowel disease and were well trained in scoring MES. Endoscopic scores were assessed at colonoscopy. An MES of 0 was defined as normal or inactive disease, and an MES of 1 was defined as mild disease, such as erythema, decreased vascular pattern, or mild friability. The MES and the ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity (UCEIS) were used to assess endoscopic severity. When collecting data for this study, two or more trained monitors reviewed the pictures of endoscopic examination independently and confirmed again as MES of 1 before enrollment.

- **Primary end point**: The primary end point was relapse within 1 year. Patients were followed up to 1 year or until the time of relapse if it was within 1 year. Relapse was defined as meeting both of the following two criteria: (1) a partial Mayo score ≥ 3 or a rectal bleeding subscore ≥ 1; and (2) addition of any induction treatment.

### New lessons: classic treatments, expanding options in ulcerative colitis [^111YKJTY]. Colorectal Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) of moderate severity is a common presentation in gastroenterological practice, and a number of treatment options exist to rapidly and effectively induce remission. This review highlights how novel formulations and dosing regimens can ensure treatment success with greater convenience for the patient, with no increased risk of adverse effects.

- **5-Aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA)**: 5-ASA is well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse effects, and plays a significant role in the management of UC. Different formulations of oral 5-ASA are now available, allowing targeted treatment to inflammatory areas of the small bowel and ascending colon. 5-ASA is often initiated at a low dose for patients with mild to moderately active UC and with increasing doses for those who fail or have a poor response. High doses of 5-ASA are increasingly used as induction therapy for active UC, particularly in patients with refractory or extensive disease.

The recent ASCEND studies show that an induction dose of 5-ASA of 4.8 g daily in patients with moderate UC is significantly more effective and resolves symptoms faster compared with a daily dose of 2.4 g. The evidence provided by the ASCEND studies supports the rationale for a 'top-down' dosing strategy for UC, where more potent therapies are introduced at an earlier stage of moderately severe disease.

### Zeposiastarter kit [^113tuDMa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In UC Study 1, a total of 645 patients were randomized 2:1 to either ZEPOSIA 0.92 mg given orally once daily or placebo for 10 weeks, beginning with a dosage titration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The trial included adult patients with moderately to severely active UC who had an inadequate response or were intolerant to any of the following treatments: oral aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators (e.g. 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine), or biologics (e.g. TNF blockers and/or vedolizumab). Patients were required to be on stable doses of oral aminosalicylates and/or corticosteroids (prednisone daily dose up to 20 mg equivalent or budesonide extended-release tablets) prior to enrollment.

Seventy-one percent of patients were receiving mesalamine, 13% were on sulfasalazine, and 33% on oral corticosteroids. Additionally, 30% of patients had previously failed or were intolerant to TNF blockers; of these, 63% received at least two biologics including TNF blockers.

The disease activity was assessed by the Mayo score (ranging from 0 to 12), which consists of four subscores (0 to 3 for each): stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on centrally-read endoscopy, and physician global assessment. An endoscopy subscore of 2 was defined by marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, and erosions, while a score of 3 was defined by spontaneous bleeding and ulceration. Enrolled patients had Mayo scores between 6 and 12. At baseline, patients had a median Mayo score of 9, with 86% of patients having moderate disease (Mayo score 6–10), and 14% having severe disease.

### Andrographis paniculata extract (HMPL-004) for active ulcerative colitis [^111sMvSo]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

A previous pilot study demonstrated that treatment with A. paniculata at a dosage of 1,200 mg daily for 8 weeks resulted in a similar reduction from baseline in disease activity to that observed with oral mesalamine in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. We also found preliminary evidence of efficacy for A. paniculata 1,200 mg daily for 8 weeks as compared with placebo in patients with mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease. In the study, we demonstrated dose response with A. paniculata 1,200 mg and 1,800 mg daily and no dose-dependent toxicity. Additional clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of even higher doses of A. paniculata extract (HMPL-004) should be undertaken in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

Subgroup analysis showed a larger therapeutic effect for A. paniculata extract (HMPL-004) relative to placebo in patients who were currently failing oral mesalamine, and a smaller and non-significant effect relative to placebo among patients not receiving mesalamine. This latter result appears largely due to a greater rate of placebo response among patients not receiving mesalamine. This subgroup of patients was relatively small, and the study lacked sufficient statistical power to draw any meaningful conclusions regarding the efficacy of A. paniculata in this patient population. Additional adequately powered studies to assess the efficacy of A. paniculata extract (HMPL-004) as monotherapy in patients with ulcerative colitis are warranted.

### Mesalamine [^112oYiVk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release capsules have been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Below is a description of the results of these studies for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in adults and pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years, as well as for the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults.

- **Treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis**:

	**Adults**: Two placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) have demonstrated the efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis.

	- In one randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 weeks' duration involving 158 patients (Study 1), participants received mesalamine delayed release dosages of 1.6 grams per day (800 mg twice a day; n = 53) and 2.4 grams per day (800 mg three times a day; n = 53), compared to placebo (n = 52). The scoring system for determining treatment efficacy included assessments of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, sigmoidoscopic findings, patient's functional assessment, and physician's global assessment. At the dosage of 2.4 grams per day, 21 of 43 (49%) patients using mesalamine delayed-release tablets showed an improvement in the sigmoidoscopic appearance of the bowel compared to 12 of 44 (27%) patients using placebo (p = 0.048). In addition, significantly more patients in the mesalamine delayed release tablets 2.4 grams group…

### Once-daily, high-concentration MMX mesalamine in active ulcerative colitis [^114yiur5]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Aims: SPD476 (LIALDA in the US; MEZAVANT in the EU; otherwise known as MMX mesalamine; Shire Pharmaceuticals Inc, Wayne, PA, under license from Giuliani SpA, Milan, Italy) is a novel, once-daily, high-strength (1.2 g/tablet) formulation of mesalamine. It utilizes MMX Multi Matrix System (MMX) technology designed to deliver the active drug throughout the colon. We performed a double-blind, multicenter study, comparing MMX mesalamine vs. placebo for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. A delayed-release oral mesalamine (ASACOL; Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, OH) reference arm was included.

Methods: Three hundred forty-three patients with active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis received MMX mesalamine 2.4 g/day or 4.8 g/day given once daily, ASACOL 2.4 g/day given in 3 divided doses, or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in clinical and endoscopic remission (modified ulcerative colitis disease activity index of ≥ 1-point reduction in sigmoidoscopy score from baseline).

Results: A significantly greater proportion of patients receiving MMX mesalamine 2.4 g/day given once daily (40.5%; p = 0.01) and 4.8 g/day given once daily (41.2%; p = 0.007) achieved clinical and endoscopic remission at week 8, vs. placebo (22.1%). The clinical and endoscopic remission rate for ASACOL (32.6%; p = 0.124) was not significantly superior to placebo. All active treatments were well-tolerated.

Conclusions: Once-daily MMX mesalamine was efficacious.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

- **Practice points**:
	1. No mesalamine delivery system has proven clearly superior for induction or maintenance of remission. There is no efficacy difference between once daily and twice daily dosing of mesalamine. Only sulfasalazine is available in liquid formulation and may also be effective for arthritis, but it is associated with more adverse events (Agreement 96%).

	2. Suggested dosing: oral mesalamine usually 50–70 mg/kg/day (up to 100 mg/kg/day or 4.8 g daily); rectal mesalamine 25 mg/kg up to 1 g daily; sulfasalazine 40–70 mg/kg/day up to 4 g daily. Higher rectal mesalamine doses up to 4 g are being used, but evidence suggests that it is no more effective than 1 g (Agreement 96%).

	3. Suppositories are useful for limited proctitis, while foam and liquid mesalamine enemas are suitable for more extensive colitis (Agreement 100%).

	4. Gradual sulfasalazine dose augmentation over 7–14 days may mitigate dose-dependent side effects. If evidence of sulfasalazine hypersensitivity (fever, rash) occurs, the sulfasalazine should be stopped immediately (Agreement 100%).

	5. The effective induction dose should also be continued as the maintenance dose. After several months of sustained biochemical remission, a dose reduction within the suggested dose range may be considered (Agreement 96%).

	6. Treatment modification should be considered in patients who do not show an initial meaningful response to mesalamine within 2–3 weeks of therapy, as most children with mild-to-moderate UC will not achieve remission with oral mesalamine monotherapy alone. Addition of mesalamine enemas should be considered.

### Delzicol [^116m1BaW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk. In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily doses for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Delzicol and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. Caution should be exercised when Delzicol is administered to a nursing woman.

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of Delzicol for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies using mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets. Use of Delzicol in these pediatric age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets in adults and a single 6-week study in 82 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Tofacitinib for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ZYVy1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

The search process is summarized using a PRISMA diagram in Figure 1. Our search identified 221 records. After de-duplication, we screened 192 titles and abstracts, rejecting 155 records. We assessed the full text of the remaining 37 reports. Eleven citations, corresponding to one phase 2 and two phase 3 (OCTAVE Induction 1 and OCTAVE Induction 2) multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, met the inclusion criteria and were finally included in the meta-analysis.

- **Study characteristics and baseline data**: The studies and the participants' baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The studies recruited 1,220 patients with active moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC), with a Mayo score of 6–12, an endoscopic subscore of at least 2, and previous treatment with mesalamine, corticosteroids, azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, or anti-TNF regimens. The patients' mean age ranged from 40.4 to 43.2 years, and the proportion of men ranged from 48% to 64%. All studies included patients with prior exposure to anti-TNF-α therapy (29% to 46.7%). Oral mesalamine and oral corticosteroids at a stable dose were allowed as concomitant treatment. In the phase 2 trial, participants were randomly assigned to tofacitinib at a dose of 0.5 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg, or placebo twice daily for 8 weeks. In the phase 3 studies, patients were allocated to tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily or placebo for eight weeks. All studies used the Mayo Clinic activity index to define disease severity and efficacy outcomes. Definitions of outcomes were consistent across trials.

### Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis [^1137awo2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

The newer 5-ASA preparations were intended to avoid the adverse effects of SASP while maintaining its therapeutic benefits. The efficacy and safety of 5-ASA preparations have been evaluated in numerous clinical trials that often lacked sufficient statistical power to arrive at definitive conclusions. Previously, it was found that newer 5-ASA drugs were more effective than placebo but no more effective than SASP in inducing remission in ulcerative colitis. This updated review includes more recent studies and evaluates the effectiveness, dose-responsiveness, and safety of 5-ASA preparations in terms of more precise outcome measures.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy, dose-responsiveness, and safety of the newer release formulations of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) compared to placebo or sulfasalazine (SASP) in the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.

- **Search strategy**: A computer-assisted literature search for relevant studies (1981–2002) was performed using MEDLINE, BIOS, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Trials Register, and the Science Citation Index, followed by a manual search of reference lists from previously retrieved articles, review articles, symposia proceedings, and abstracts from major gastrointestinal conferences.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were accepted for analysis if they were prospective, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo- or SASP-controlled clinical trials of parallel design with a treatment duration of at least six months.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Based on an intention to treat.

### Methotrexate for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis [^111yy78m]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Methotrexate, a folate antagonist, is an immunosuppressant drug effective for treating several inflammatory disorders, including Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis, a related chronic inflammatory bowel disease, can be challenging to treat. This updated systematic review summarizes the evidence on the use of methotrexate for the induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.

- **Objectives**: The objectives of this review were to assess the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group specialized trials register from inception to June 26, 2014. Study references and review papers were also searched for additional trials. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research published in abstract form only.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials in which methotrexate was compared to a placebo or an active comparator in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis were considered for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each study. The primary outcome was the occurrence of clinical or endoscopic relapse as defined by the primary studies. Secondary outcomes included the frequency and nature of adverse events, change in disease activity score, and steroid-sparing effect. We calculated the risk ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval for dichotomous outcomes. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.

### SPL drug information for mesalamine ER [^112r17Tk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of mesalamine ER PO (also known as Apriso, Pentasa):

- **ALF**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing liver disease.

- **Exacerbation of phenylketonuria**: Use caution in patients with phenylketonuria, as extended-release mesalamine tablets contain phenylalanine.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine may cause hypersensitivity reactions involving internal organs, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Use caution in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfasalazine.

- **Mesalamine-induced acute intolerance syndrome**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine may cause acute intolerance syndrome. It presents with symptoms such as cramping, acute abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, and rash, which may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis.

- **Minimal change disease, interstitial nephritis, renal failure**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Assess renal function at baseline and periodically during treatment.

- **Nephrolithiasis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine has been associated with an increased risk of nephrolithiasis, including mesalamine-containing stones. Advise adequate fluid intake during treatment.

- **Photosensitivity of skin**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure and wear protective clothing.

### Mesalamine [^116kgRU4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis among adults, a 6-week placebo-controlled clinical study (Study 1) involved 105 patients, with 53 of them randomized to receive mesalamine delayed-release tablets at a dose of 2.4 grams per day [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In this group, 4% of patients discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions compared to 0% from the placebo-treated group. The average age of patients was 41 years, and 49% were male. Adverse reactions that led to withdrawal from mesalamine included diarrhea and colitis flare; dizziness, nausea, joint pain, and headache. The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with mesalamine delayed-release tablets at 2.4 grams per day in Study 1 are listed in Table 2 below.

- **At least 2% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablets group and at a rate greater than placebo**:

In pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years, a randomized, double-blind, 6-week study of two dosage levels of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets (Study 3) was conducted in 82 patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. All patients were categorized by body weight (17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg) and randomly assigned to receive a low dosage (1.2, 2, and 2.4 grams per day for the respective body weight categories) or a high dosage (2.0, 3.6, and 4.8 grams per day).

### Exposure-response characterization of tofacitinib efficacy in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: Results from phase II and Phase III induction and maintenance studies [^112Szrni]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). High credibility.

These post hoc analyses included data from a Phase II dose‐ranging induction study, two Phase III induction studies (OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2), and a Phase III maintenance study (OCTAVE Sustain). These studies were approved by the institutional review boards or independent ethics committees for each center.

The Phase II induction study was an 8-week, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, multicenter study involving patients with moderate to severe UC. Disease activity was assessed using the Mayo score (range 0–12 points; higher scores indicate higher disease activity; a full description of the Mayo score is provided in the supplementary information). Moderate to severe UC was defined as a total Mayo score ≥ 6. Patients were randomized to receive tofacitinib 0.5, 3, 10, or 15 mg b.i.d. or placebo. Local read of endoscopy was used for efficacy assessments.

Patients enrolled in OCTAVE Induction 1 or 2 had moderate to severe UC (defined as a total Mayo score ≥ 6, a rectal bleeding subscore ≥ 1, and an endoscopic subscore ≥ 2), and had failed or were intolerant to ≥ 1 prior UC treatments (oral or intravenous corticosteroids, azathioprine/mercaptopurine, or TNFi). Patients were randomized 4:1 to receive tofacitinib 10 mg b.i.d. or placebo. A total of 22 patients in OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 received tofacitinib 15 mg b.i.d. Stable doses of concomitant oral 5-ASA and oral corticosteroids (≤ 25 mg/day prednisone equivalent) were permitted. Concomitant therapy with TNFi, azathioprine, methotrexate, or 6-mercaptopurine was prohibited.

### Delzicol [^1159mkDB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Absorbed mesalamine is primarily excreted by the kidneys as N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid, while unabsorbed mesalamine is excreted in feces. After intravenous administration, the elimination half-life of mesalamine is reported to be approximately 40 minutes. After oral dosing, the median terminal half-life (t1/2) values for mesalamine are usually about 25 hours, but they can vary considerably, ranging from 1.5 to 296 hours. There is significant inter-subject and intra-subject variability in the plasma concentrations of mesalamine and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid, as well as in their terminal half-lives following the administration of Delzicol.

- **Specific populations**:
	- **Pediatric patients**: In a dose-ranging pharmacokinetic study evaluating 30, 60, and 90 mg/kg per day doses of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets administered twice daily for four weeks, the mean C_avg values of mesalamine in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients ranged from approximately 400 ng/mL to 2100 ng/mL based on data from all dose levels. In a study evaluating mesalamine delayed-release tablets in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients (Study 3), mean plasma concentrations of mesalamine (based on sparse sampling) were 820 to 988 ng/mL at the low dose level. This corresponds to daily doses of 1.2, 2, or 2.4 grams based on body weight strata of 17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg, respectively.

### Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis [^115qNy3R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). High credibility.

The newer 5-ASA preparations were intended to avoid the adverse effects of SASP while maintaining its therapeutic benefits. The efficacy and safety of 5-ASA preparations have been evaluated in numerous clinical trials that have often lacked sufficient statistical power to arrive at definitive conclusions. Previously, it was found that newer 5-ASA drugs were more effective than placebo but no more effective than SASP in inducing remission in ulcerative colitis. This updated review includes more recent studies and evaluates the effectiveness, dose-responsiveness, and safety of 5-ASA preparations in terms of more precise outcome measures.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy, dose-responsiveness, and safety of the newer release formulations of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) compared to placebo or sulfasalazine (SASP) in the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.

- **Search strategy**: A computer-assisted literature search for relevant studies (1981–2005) was performed using MEDLINE, BIOS, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialized Trials Register, and the Science Citation Index, followed by a manual search of reference lists from previously retrieved articles, review articles, symposia proceedings, and abstracts from major gastrointestinal conferences.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were accepted for analysis if they were prospective, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo- or SASP-controlled clinical trials of parallel design with a treatment duration of at least six months.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Based on an intention to

### Real-world effectiveness of advanced therapies among patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in the United States [^1118ADXm]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease of the colon characterized by intermittent periods of disease flaring and remission. It affects approximately 900,000 people in the United States. Although the primary clinical symptom is the presence of bloody diarrhea, patients can also experience a range of additional symptoms including urgency and abdominal pain. Individuals may also experience systemic symptoms such as fever and weight loss.

The goal of treatment in UC is to induce and maintain remission of symptoms and allow for healing of inflammation. For patients with mild to moderate disease severity, conventional treatment typically consists of oral or topical aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) or topical steroids for induction of remission, and oral and/or topical 5-ASAs for maintenance. For patients who are refractory to 5-ASA therapy or topical steroids, oral steroids can be used to induce remission. However, steroids are not indicated for maintenance therapy in UC. Despite this, 22% of patients develop steroid dependency, and only half achieve steroid-free remission within a year of their first course of systemic steroids. Inability to taper off steroids is suggestive of a need to switch to advanced therapies.

Approximately half of newly diagnosed patients progress to moderate or severe disease, either continuously or intermittently. Additionally, many patients with UC do not respond to conventional therapies, either failing to respond to induction therapy (primary nonresponse) or initially achieving remission but not maintaining it with long-term treatment.

### Once-daily dosing of delayed-release oral mesalamine (400-mg tablet) is as effective as twice-daily dosing for maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis [^1115eMpa]. Gastroenterology (2010). High credibility.

The practice of dosing mesalamines in divided doses for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) began with sulfasalazine and was driven by sulfapyridine toxicity. This convention and the assumption that dosing multiple times a day is necessary to treat UC had not been challenged until recently. This study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of once-daily dosing of delayed-release mesalamine (Asacol 400-mg tablets) compared with twice-daily dosing for maintaining remission in UC patients.

- **Methods**: A multicenter, randomized, investigator-blinded, 12-month, active-control trial was conducted to assess the noninferiority of delayed-release mesalamine 1.6–2.4 g/day administered once daily compared with twice daily in patients with mild-to-moderate UC currently in clinical remission. The primary endpoint was the maintenance of clinical remission at month 6.

- **Results**: A total of 1023 patients were randomized and dosed. The primary objective of noninferiority was met. At month 6, 90.5% of patients receiving once-daily dosing had maintained clinical remission, compared with 91.8% of patients receiving twice-daily dosing. The 95% confidence interval for the difference (twice daily - once daily) was -2.3 to 4.9. At month 12, 85.4% of patients receiving once-daily dosing maintained clinical remission, compared with 85.4% of patients receiving twice-daily dosing (95% confidence interval for twice daily - once daily, -4.6 to 4.7). Both regimens had low rates of withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events.

- **Conclusions**: Once-daily dosing of delayed-release mesalamine is effective for maintaining remission in UC patients.

### Curcumin use in ulcerative colitis: Is it ready for prime time? A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^1122CA1G]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition that presents with watery and/or hemorrhagic diarrhea associated with rectal urgency. Symptoms can be debilitating and severely affect a person's quality of life. At diagnosis, 30–50% of patients have disease confined to the rectum or the sigmoid colon (distal colitis), 20–30% have left-sided colitis, and about 20% have pancolitis. Of the patients with distal colitis, 25–50% progress to more extensive forms of the disease over time.

In early 2019, the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) released clinical guidelines for the management of mild to moderate UC. The recommendation is to start standard dose mesalamine (2–3 g/day) or diazo-bonded 5-amino-salicylic acid (5-ASA), rather than low dose mesalamine, sulfasalazine, or no treatment, in patients with extensive mild-to-moderate UC. The addition of rectal mesalamine to oral 5-ASA is recommended for patients with extensive or left-sided mild-to-moderate UC.

There have been reports regarding the efficacy of curcumin, a natural phenol found in the large-leafed herb Curcuma longa L. (common names turmeric, Indian saffron) in the treatment of various diseases, such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as UC. However, the AGA made no recommendations on its use in mild-to-moderate UC patients already on a 5-ASA agent. The reason for this was stated to be a "knowledge gap", probably from the lack of large randomized placebo-controlled studies (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of curcumin and its side effects.

### Mesalamine once daily is more effective than twice daily in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis [^115MXXQV]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Oral mesalamine (5-aminosalicylate) is the standard of care for mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. This study investigates the efficacy and safety of once-daily administration of prolonged-release mesalamine granules in maintaining remission in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis, compared with the well-established twice-daily dosing regimen.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter, randomized, single-blind, noninferiority trial, 362 patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral mesalamine 2 g once daily or 1 g twice daily, for 12 months. The primary objective was to compare remission rates at 1 year, based on the ulcerative colitis disease activity index score, using Kaplan-Meier methodology.

- **Results**: At 1 year, 70.9% of the group given 2 g mesalamine once daily remained in remission vs. 58.9% of the group given 1 g mesalamine twice daily; this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.024), indicating the increased efficacy of once-daily dosing compared with twice-daily dosing. Self-reported adherence to therapy, measured by visual analog scale score after 4, 8, and 12 months, was significantly greater in the group given 2 g mesalamine once daily, compared with twice daily, at all but one study visit (P < .05). Compliance measured by medication taken was not significantly different between the groups. The difference in the overall incidence of adverse events between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.23).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with ulcerative colitis given prolonged-release oral mesalamine once daily show higher remission rates compared to those receiving the twice-daily regimen.

### Once daily versus three times daily mesalazine granules in active ulcerative colitis: a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^113ye8vp]. Gut (2009). Low credibility.

There were no differences between the OD and TID groups regarding the influence of remission rates by the duration of ulcerative colitis and baseline disease severity, although patients with mild ulcerative colitis showed better remission rates than those with moderate disease. Of interest is the significantly greater therapeutic effect of the OD dosing in proctosigmoiditis patients. Consequently, it may be hypothesized that OD dosing leads to higher luminal peak concentrations, particularly in the distal colon, suggesting that an OD dosing of mesalazine granules is well suited for oral treatment of distal disease and might also enhance a patient's compliance to treatment, as most patients prefer the oral over the rectal route of administration.

Endoscopy and histology revealed no statistically significant differences between the two dosing regimens. Mucosal healing rates, defined as a modified DAI mucosal ≤ 1 at week 8 (LOCF), were comparable in both mesalazine granules OD and TID groups (75% and 73%, respectively) to those observed under treatment with 2.4 g/day (58/84 patients (69%)) and 4.8 g/day (66/85 patients (78%)) MMX mesalazine, indicating similar therapeutic efficacy between both formulations.

In this study, as in many others involving mesalazine, treatment with the study medication was well tolerated, with no significant differences in the occurrence of adverse events between the two dosing regimens. Most adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity, and no unexpected side effects occurred, including no adverse effects on renal function.

### Constrictive pericarditis in chronic ulcerative colitis [^115V2hJV]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Acute pericarditis has been described as an extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as well as a consequence of IBD treatment, specifically sulfasalazine and mesalamine. Until now, there have been no reported cases of constrictive pericarditis associated with IBD or its treatment. A 37-year-old woman with a 24-year history of chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) presented with a 3-month history of fevers, palpitations, dyspnea, syncope, and retrosternal chest pain. Two weeks before symptoms, she had initiated oral mesalamine for an ongoing CUC flare.

Physical examination suggested constrictive pericarditis. An echocardiogram revealed a thickened pericardium with a nearly circumferential fibrinous effusion, with Doppler confirming diastolic compromise. The patient proceeded to radical pericardectomy. Pathological examination showed grossly hemorrhagic acute and chronic pericarditis, with cultures and cytology negative.

At the time of writing, only 104 cases of IBD with acute pericarditis have been reported, with fewer than 10 cases of mesalamine-induced acute pericarditis reported. This is the first reported case of constrictive pericarditis related to IBD or its treatment. Although our patient may have had IBD-associated constrictive pericarditis, her mesalamine use raises the possibility of a drug-induced constrictive pericarditis.

### Oral budesonide for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis [^114tJoXQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. Although corticosteroids may improve symptoms, they have significant adverse effects. Steroids that act topically, with fewer systemic side effects, may be more desirable. Budesonide is a topically acting corticosteroid with extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. There are currently three formulations of budesonide: two standard formulations including a controlled-ileal release capsule and a pH-dependent capsule both designed to release the drug in the distal small intestine and right colon, and the newer Budesonide-MMX® capsule designed to release the drug throughout the entire colon.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialised Register from inception to April 2015. We also searched reference lists of articles, conference proceedings, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing oral budesonide to placebo or another active therapy for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis were considered eligible. There were no exclusions based on patient age or the type, dose, duration, or formulation of budesonide therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed study quality. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

### Cost utility of inflammation-targeted therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis [^111N2gZA]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Oral mesalamine drugs are frequently used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). However, these drugs are costly, and long-term adherence is poor. We compared the cost utility of inflammation-targeted, intermittent therapy with that of universal, continuous maintenance therapy with mesalamine agents for patients with mild-to-moderate UC.

- **Methods**: We developed a Markov cohort model that simulated a population of adult patients with newly diagnosed, quiescent UC after induction of remission with mesalamine agents. We obtained model inputs from the literature. The perspective taken was that of a short-term payer (health insurance provider) during a 5-year time period. We modeled three treatment strategies: symptom-targeted treatment (treatment for symptomatic disease flares only, SYMPT), continuous mesalamine maintenance for all patients (CONT, the standard of care), and inflammation-targeted treatment (mesalamine therapy for only patients with a stool sample positive for an inflammatory marker, INFLAM). We measured disease flares, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs (2009 U.S. dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.

- **Results**: INFLAM was the least costly strategy (cumulative per-patient cost of $22,798), compared with $24,378 for the SYMPT and $25,621 for the CONT strategies. Despite the lower cost, INFLAM was comparable to SYMPT and CONT in effectiveness (4.4986 vs. 4.5014 QALYs, respectively), making INFLAM the optimal strategy. Several variables were found to be important in sensitivity analysis.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: Ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^117Jv1hG]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Oral mesalamine may be better tolerated than sulfasalazine (relative risk [RR] of adverse effects: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.36–0.63), but the latter is cheaper, as effective, and remains the only 5‐ASA available in liquid formulation, making it attractive for young children. Sulfasalazine also has a direct effect on nuclear factor kappa B, which may add to its mode of action. Sulfasalazine suspension was safe and effective in a retrospective study of 57 children with UC (mean [standard deviation (SD)] age 5.3 ± 3.3 years) with the inability to swallow tablets. Moreover, except for the uncommon allergic reaction (< 0.1%), the vast majority of adverse events are mild (e.g. headache and gastrointestinal symptoms) and uncommon. Serious adverse events with 5‐ASA treatment are rare and include renal, pancreatic, pulmonary, and cardiac complications.

- **Adverse effects and intolerance**: Sulfasalazine hypersensitivity presents with fever, rash, and eosinophilia, which should trigger immediate treatment cessation. Folic acid deficiency has been reported with sulfasalazine. In adult studies, withdrawal due to intolerance ranges from 2% to 5%. Intolerance to 5‐ASA medications may mimic a UC flare, and when clinically proven by rechallenge, it precludes further use of 5‐ASA compounds. Regular laboratory monitoring of CBC, renal function, and urinalysis remains the practice of many clinicians, though not supported by evidence. Poor adherence is always a possible cause of nonresponse to therapy.

### Mesalamine [^1175f7MV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a placebo-controlled, international, multicenter trial involving 153 patients with active distal ulcerative colitis, proctosigmoiditis, or proctitis, Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema significantly reduced both the overall disease activity index (DAI) and its individual components. Each component is rated on a 4-point scale: 0 representing normal, 1 for mild, 2 for moderate, and 3 for severe, resulting in a maximum possible overall DAI of 12.

- **Percent change for overall DAI**: Calculated by averaging the change across individual patients.

	- † Indicates a significant difference between Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema and placebo with p < 0.01.
	- ‡ Indicates a significant difference with p < 0.001.
	- § Indicates a significant difference with p < 0.05.

Significant differences favoring Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema over placebo were observed in patient subgroups receiving concomitant sulfasalazine and those with an upper disease boundary between 5 and 20 cm or 20 and 40 cm. However, significant differences were not achieved in subgroups using concomitant prednisone or those with an upper disease boundary between 40 and 50 cm.

### Mesalamine [^112sJxLi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

There were 41 patients in the low dosage group and 41 patients in the high dosage group who received at least one dose of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets; 36 patients in each dosage group completed the study. Patients were considered treatment failures if they did not achieve success or dropped out due to adverse reactions or lack of efficacy.

At Week 6, 73% of the patients in the low dosage group, and 70% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved success based on the TM-Mayo; 34% of the patients in the low dosage group and 43% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved a complete response. At Week 6, 56% of the patients in the low dosage group, and 55% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved success based on the PUCAI; 46% of the patients in the low dosage group and 43% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved a complete response.

The high dosage regimen is not recommended because it was not more effective than the low dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### AGA technical review on the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^111CFgxe]. Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Most patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have mild-to-moderate disease activity, with a low risk of colectomy, and are managed by primary care physicians or gastroenterologists. Optimal management of these patients decreases the risk of relapse and proximal disease extension and may prevent disease progression, complications, and the need for immunosuppressive therapy. With several medications (e.g. sulfasalazine, diazo-bonded 5-aminosalicylates [ASA], mesalamines, and corticosteroids, including budesonide) and complex dosing formulations, regimens, and routes to treat a disease with variable anatomic extent, there is considerable practice variability in the management of patients with mild-to-moderate UC. Hence, the American Gastroenterological Association prioritized clinical guidelines on this topic.

To inform clinical guidelines, this technical review was developed in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework for interventional studies. Focused questions included the following:

- **Comparative effectiveness and tolerability of different oral 5-ASA therapies**: Sulfasalazine vs. diazo-bonded 5-ASAs vs. mesalamine; low-dose (3 g/d) mesalamine.
- **Comparison of different dosing regimens**: Once-daily vs. multiple times per day dosing and routes (oral vs. rectal vs. both oral and rectal).
- **Role of oral budesonide in patients with mild-to-moderate UC**.
- **Comparative effectiveness and tolerability of rectal 5-ASA and corticosteroid formulations in patients with distal colitis**.
- **Role of alternative therapies and approaches for managing mild-to-moderate UC**.

### Mesalamine [^117LrXfc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Excretion**: Absorbed mesalamine is excreted mainly by the kidney as N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Unabsorbed mesalamine is excreted in feces. After intravenous administration, the elimination half-life of mesalamine is reported to be approximately 40 minutes. After oral dosing, the median terminal t1/2 values for mesalamine are usually about 25 hours, but these are variable, ranging from 1.5 to 296 hours. There is a large inter-subject and intra-subject variability in the plasma concentrations of mesalamine and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid and in their terminal half-lives following the administration of mesalamine delayed-release capsules.

- **Specific populations - Pediatric patients**: In a dose-ranging pharmacokinetic study evaluating 30, 60, and 90 mg/kg per day doses of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets administered twice daily for four weeks, the mean Cavg values of mesalamine in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients ranged from approximately 400 ng/mL to 2100 ng/mL based on data from all dose levels.

	- In a study evaluating mesalamine delayed-release tablets in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients (Study 3), mean plasma concentrations of mesalamine (based on sparse sampling) were 820 to 988 ng/mL at the low dose level, which is 1.2, 2, or 2.4 grams/day based on body weight strata of 17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg, respectively.

### Once daily vs multiple daily mesalamine therapy for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis: a meta-analysis [^111h9cAk]. Colorectal Disease (2016). High credibility.

5-Aminosalicylic acid is the first-line drug for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). The most commonly used form is mesalamine. Several systematic reviews have demonstrated that mesalamine is effective in inducing and maintaining remission. The efficacy, safety, and adherence to once daily (OD) and multiple daily (MD) dosing of mesalamine for the induction and maintenance of remission in mild to moderate UC were systematically reviewed and compared.

The study involved a search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to November 2014. Only randomized controlled trials were considered eligible. STATA software (version 12.0) was used to calculate the pooled risk ratios with a 95% confidence interval.

Seventeen randomized studies containing 5,439 patients were identified. No significant differences were noted in comparisons between OD and MD dosing for maintenance and induction of remission. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in rates of medication adherence or adverse events between OD and MD dosing. Regarding mesalamine suppository, no significant differences were found between dosing regimens and adverse events for induction of remission.

In conclusion, an OD dose of mesalamine is as effective and safe as MD doses for the induction and maintenance treatment of mild to moderate UC. An OD mesalamine suppository can attain the same effect and safety as MD mesalamine in inducing remission of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.
