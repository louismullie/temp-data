## Question

Total protein 5.6

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a serum total protein of 5.6 g/dL and what clinical actions to take next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this value is abnormal and by how much. Then, I should verify the likely components contributing to total protein, especially albumin versus globulin. Next, I will consider the major etiologic categories that lower total protein, including hepatic synthetic defects, renal or gastrointestinal protein losses, and dilutional or distributional states. After that, I should review prognostic implications and risk stratification. Finally, I will outline a targeted diagnostic workup and management plan, including when to consider albumin infusion and how to monitor response, while double-checking for pitfalls in interpretation and ensuring the plan aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and its magnitude. A total protein of 5.6 g/dL is below the typical adult reference range of about 6.0–8.0 g/dL, representing a roughly 7–10% reduction from the lower limit of normal, which is clinically meaningful and warrants evaluation rather than dismissal as a lab variant [^112j9KC5].

> I need to check the components next. Total protein is the sum of albumin and globulin, so a low total protein usually reflects low albumin, low globulin, or both; given that albumin is the predominant contributor, isolated hypoalbuminemia is the most common driver of a low total protein, and I should confirm the albumin level and calculate the albumin-to-globulin ratio to orient the differential diagnosis [^115F14bJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about nutrition yet. I initially thought "low total protein implies malnutrition", but wait, I should verify the inflammatory context because albumin and prealbumin are negative acute-phase reactants and decline with inflammation regardless of intake; thus, low total protein often signals inflammation or disease burden rather than primary protein–energy malnutrition per se, and I should use CRP to support the inflammation criterion when needed [^114Nt2hB] [^112pWRHm] [^115REQ6Y].

> Let me consider the major etiologic buckets. Low total protein generally falls into three categories: decreased hepatic synthesis (chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, severe acute liver failure), increased protein losses (nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy, extensive burns or wounds, hemorrhage), and distributional or dilutional states (over-resuscitation, capillary leak syndromes, third spacing), and I should tailor the workup accordingly while remembering that albumin synthesis requires intact hepatic function and has a long half-life, so persistent low levels reflect ongoing processes rather than transient shifts [^113LJvTk] [^1158KX7a].

> I will now examine hepatic causes. If albumin is low with normal or low globulin and abnormal liver chemistries or INR, I should evaluate for cirrhosis or acute liver failure; albumin is synthesized exclusively by the liver, and a reduction generally indicates liver disease of more than three weeks' duration, so I should confirm with liver panel, INR, and clinical context, and consider albumin infusion only in specific indications like large-volume paracentesis or type 1 hepatorenal syndrome rather than to "treat the number" alone [^113LJvTk] [^115HHZ9u].

> Next, I should review renal and gastrointestinal losses. If there is marked proteinuria, especially in the nephrotic range, or a low albumin with relatively preserved globulin, I need to check urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or 24-hour protein and consider nephrotic syndrome workup. Similarly, if there is diarrhea, edema, or low albumin with normal urine protein, I should consider protein-losing enteropathy and fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin, recognizing that albumin loss through damaged capillaries and reduced oncotic pressure perpetuate the cycle of edema and further albumin loss [^116qeBca] [^1158KX7a].

> But wait, what if the total protein is low with a normal albumin? I should double-check for hypogammaglobulinemia or dilutional states. Low globulin can reflect primary or secondary immunodeficiency, over-resuscitation, or capillary leak physiology, and in burn patients, for example, grading by total protein and tracking the albumin-to-globulin ratio has been used to assess severity and capillary leak dynamics, which can guide expectations for recovery and the need for ongoing support [^112j9KC5].

> I need to ensure I assess prognostic implications. Hypoalbuminemia is a potent, dose-dependent predictor of poor outcomes in acutely ill patients, with each 10 g/L decrement in albumin associated with substantially higher odds of mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization. In hemodialysis cohorts, low total protein and low albumin track higher mortality, and in heart failure, low albumin correlates with higher in-hospital and long-term mortality, so a total protein of 5.6 g/dL should trigger risk stratification and closer monitoring even if the patient appears clinically stable [^111Nt5EN] [^1165dRNr] [^111tZSEU].

> Let me first confirm the immediate diagnostic steps. I should obtain a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel including albumin, liver enzymes and bilirubin, INR, creatinine and eGFR, and urine protein assessment with a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or 24-hour collection if results will change management; if albumin is low and urine protein is not explanatory, I should consider CRP and SPEP with immunofixation to evaluate for monoclonal gammopathies or other dysproteinemias, and if liver disease is suspected, I should add additional hepatic workup and consider causes of chronic liver disease including NAFLD and autoimmune hepatitis when globulins are elevated [^117ErQGq] [^115K6zcr] [^112L6njK].

> Hold on, I should verify when albumin infusion is actually indicated. Albumin therapy is not for correcting a low number alone; it is indicated for specific scenarios such as large-volume paracentesis, type 1 hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as adjunct to antibiotics, severe burns after initial crystalloid resuscitation, and selected cases of acute nephrosis with diuretic resistance, whereas routine infusion to "normalize" albumin in general hypoalbuminemia is not supported and may not improve outcomes if the underlying inflammatory process is not addressed [^115HHZ9u] [^112oWTSw] [^115EsVvN].

> Next, I should review nutrition and supportive management. I need to ensure adequate protein intake tailored to the clinical context, for example about 1.2–2.0 g/kg/day in cirrhosis or critical illness, 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day in acute-on-chronic liver failure, and 1.0–1.2 g/kg/day in dialysis to mitigate protein energy wasting, while in nondialysis CKD stages 3–5, protein restriction to 0.55–0.60 g/kg/day may be appropriate to slow CKD progression under supervision. I should also treat the underlying inflammatory driver because albumin will not recover until inflammation abates, and I should monitor trends rather than single values given albumin's long half-life [^1146gByK] [^113ovBio] [^111KigUN] [^113QhpjP] [^1158KX7a].

> I should double-check monitoring cadence and targets. Because albumin changes slowly, serial measurements every 3–7 days in acute settings can help track trajectory, and in conditions like nephrotic syndrome, complete remission is often defined with albumin recovery above 3.5 g/dL alongside proteinuria reduction. In heart failure admissions, checking albumin at admission and during the hospital course helps contextualize edema and guide cautious diuresis to avoid intravascular depletion when oncotic pressure is low [^115GWjvM] [^112VU6Aw].

> Let me reconsider special populations briefly. In pediatrics, total protein and albumin cutoffs differ by age, so I should apply age-appropriate references. In older adults, low albumin within the "normal" range may still carry risk, for example for Alzheimer's pathology, reinforcing that trend and clinical context matter even when values are not frankly abnormal [^114Pbr5V].

> In summary, a total protein of 5.6 g/dL is abnormal and most often reflects hypoalbuminemia driven by inflammation, hepatic synthetic impairment, or protein losses. I should confirm albumin and globulin, assess liver function, quantify urine protein, screen for inflammation with CRP, and pursue disease-specific diagnostics such as SPEP if indicated, while avoiding the trap of equating low total protein with malnutrition alone and reserving albumin infusion for guideline-supported indications, with management focused on treating the underlying cause and optimizing protein intake and monitoring trends over time [^114Nt2hB] [^115HHZ9u] [^115GWjvM] [^111Nt5EN].

---

A total protein of 5.6 g/dL is **low** and most often reflects **hypoalbuminemia** from liver disease, kidney disease, malnutrition, or inflammation [^112j9KC5] [^1158KX7a]. Evaluate with **albumin, globulin, liver enzymes, renal function, and urine protein** to determine the cause [^113LJvTk] [^117ErQGq]. Management targets the underlying condition, with nutrition support and albumin therapy as indicated [^113QhpjP] [^112oWTSw].

---

## Normal reference range for total protein

The normal range for total protein in adults is **6.0–8.0 g/dL** (60–80 g/L). A value of 5.6 g/dL is therefore **below normal** and warrants further evaluation.

---

## Clinical significance of low total protein

Low total protein most often reflects **reduced albumin**, the main protein fraction, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality across settings [^115F14bJ] [^114rPvGZ] [^112j9KC5] [^1165dRNr]. It is a marker of illness severity rather than a direct measure of nutrition status [^114rPvGZ] [^111kttWA].

---

## Common causes of low total protein

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Liver disease [^113LJvTk] | - Cirrhosis <br/> - Hepatitis <br/> - Alcoholic liver disease |
| Kidney disease | - Nephrotic syndrome [^1117LKpt] <br/> - Chronic kidney disease [^notfound] |
| Nutritional deficiencies | - Malnutrition [^112uCmJ6] <br/> - Malabsorption [^notfound] <br/> - Severe dietary protein restriction [^notfound] |
| Inflammatory conditions [^1158KX7a] | - Chronic inflammation <br/> - Autoimmune diseases <br/> - Malignancies |
| Gastrointestinal protein loss | - Protein-losing enteropathy <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease |

---

## Clinical implications and risks

Low total protein is linked to **increased risk** of:

- **Infection**: Higher susceptibility and severity [^114rPvGZ].
- **Complications**: Greater risk in chronic and acute illness [^notfound].
- **Mortality**: Higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [^notfound].

---

## Recommended clinical evaluation

When total protein is low, **order**:

- **Albumin and globulin**: Determine the A:G ratio and pattern [^115F14bJ].
- **Liver function tests**: AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, INR [^113LJvTk].
- **Renal function tests**: Serum creatinine, eGFR, urine protein/creatinine ratio [^117ErQGq].
- **Inflammatory markers**: CRP or ESR [^115REQ6Y].
- **Nutritional assessment**: Diet history, weight change, BMI [^112uozAX].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on the **underlying cause**:

- **Liver disease**: Treat the liver condition; provide nutrition support [^116wJ1YT].
- **Kidney disease**: Manage proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome [^notfound].
- **Malnutrition**: Increase dietary protein; consider nutrition support [^notfound].
- **Inflammation**: Treat the inflammatory disease [^1158KX7a].
- **Albumin therapy**: Use IV albumin for severe hypoalbuminemia or specific indications (e.g. cirrhosis with ascites, large-volume paracentesis) [^112oWTSw].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the cause, severity, and response. Persistent low total protein signals **higher risk** of complications and mortality, especially in chronic liver or kidney disease and in critically ill patients [^112j9KC5] [^1165dRNr].

---

A total protein of 5.6 g/dL is **below normal** and most often reflects hypoalbuminemia; **evaluate the cause** with albumin, globulin, liver and renal tests, and inflammatory markers, then treat the underlying condition and provide nutrition support as indicated.

Conclusions

Protein intake as measured by nPCR correlates with serum albumin even when confounding factors are taken into account. Prospective studies are required to confirm whether albumin targets would be difficult to achieve in elderly female diabetics and whether protein supplementation would alter albumin levels in such vulnerable subgroups.

### Interpretation of serum calcium in patients with abnormal serum proteins [^112CjP1i]. British Medical Journal (1973). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia and Hyperalbuminemia" for immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, nephrotic syndrome, ascites and liver cirrhosis.

The Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia and Hyperalbuminemia, or simply Calcium Correction for Albumin, is a clinical tool to adjust serum calcium levels based on the patient's albumin concentration. It is particularly applicable to patients with hypoalbuminemia (low albumin levels) or hyperalbuminemia (high albumin levels), conditions often seen in critically ill patients, those with liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, malnutrition, and burns.

The clinical utility of this calculator lies in its ability to provide a more accurate assessment of the patient's calcium status. Serum calcium levels can be influenced by albumin concentrations, as albumin is the primary protein that binds calcium in the blood. Therefore, in conditions where albumin levels are abnormal, the total serum calcium may not accurately reflect the patient's true calcium status. The Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia and Hyperalbuminemia calculator corrects the total serum calcium level based on the albumin level, providing a more accurate reflection of the patient's ionized calcium level, which is the physiologically active form of calcium.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator. However, it should be noted that this correction is an estimation and may not be accurate in all clinical situations. For instance

The calculator adjusts calcium levels in cases of abnormal albumin — either hypoalbuminemia or hyperalbuminemia. It accepts three inputs: serum calcium, patient's albumin level, and what is considered the normal albumin level. Inputs come with different possible units: serum calcium can be in mg/dL or mmol/L, and albumin levels in g/dL or g/L.

Here's how the calculation works:

- **First, ensure uniform units for computation**:

- If serum calcium is in mmol/L, convert it to mg/dL by multiplying by 4.
- If albumin or normal albumin is in g/L, convert it to g/dL by dividing by 10.

- **Calculate the corrected calcium using the formula**:

- correctedCalcium = serum calcium + (0.8 × (normal albumin - patient albumin))

This formula accounts for albumin's effect on calcium binding. Each 1 g/dL difference in albumin level corresponds to a 0.8 mg/dL adjustment in calcium, reflecting the binding influence.

- If the corrected calcium needs to be in mmol/L, convert it from mg/dL by dividing by 4.

The calculator returns the corrected calcium value in the preferred unit, rounded to two decimal places for precision.

Here's a quick reference for input and output ranges:

- **Serum Calcium**: 1–20 mg/dL or 0.25–5 mmol/L
- **Albumin**: 0–10 g/dL or 0–50 g/L
- **Normal Albumin**: 0–10 g/dL or 0–50 g/L
- **Corrected Calcium**: 0–20 mg/dL or 0–5 mmol/L

Understanding these adjustments enables healthcare providers to more accurately evaluate metabolic and nutritional statuses in patients with abnormal albumin levels.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^112uCmJ6]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia

Hypoalbuminemia (generally defined as a serum albumin concentration ≤ 30 g/l) is very common in critically ill patients, the main reasons probably being increased albumin losses from bleeding and via the gastrointestinal tract, increased capillary permeability leading to a redistribution from the intravascular to the interstitial space (previously called third-spacing), and dilution from intravenous fluid administration Moreover, in some patients – particularly older patients – baseline albumin levels may already be low as a result of poor nutritional status or altered liver function. Although animal models suggested that albumin synthesis may be reduced in critical illness, synthesis appears to be increased in critically ill humans.

Importantly, whatever the underlying mechanisms, hypoalbuminemia is associated with worse outcomes including increased complications and reduced short-term and longer-term survival in critically ill patients. In a meta-analysis of 90 cohort studies that had evaluated hypoalbuminemia as a prognostic biomarker in acutely ill patients, each 10 g/l decrease in serum albumin concentration was associated with a 137% increase in the odds of death, an 89% increase in morbidity, and a 71% increase in length of hospital stay. There is therefore a clear association between the albumin level and the severity of the insult, but it remains uncertain whether the effect of hypoalbuminemia on outcome is a cause–effect relationship or whether hypoalbuminemia is rather a marker of serious disease.

### Protein S levels and the risk of venous thrombosis: results from the MEGA case-control study [^116Z6uh4]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

In thrombophilic families, protein S deficiency is clearly associated with venous thrombosis. We aimed to determine whether the same holds true in a population-based case-control study (n = 5317). Subjects were regarded protein S deficient when protein S levels were < 2.5th percentile of the controls. Free and total protein S deficiency was not associated with venous thrombosis: free protein S < 53 U/dL, odds ratio [OR] 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56–1.21) and total protein S < 68 U/dL, OR 0.90 (95% CI, 0.62–1.31). When lower cutoff values were applied, it appeared that subjects at risk of venous thrombosis could be identified at levels < 0.10th percentile of free protein S (< 33 U/dL, OR 5.4; 95% CI, 0.61–48.8). In contrast, even extremely low total protein S levels were not associated with venous thrombosis. PROS1 was sequenced in 48 subjects with free protein S level < 1st percentile (< 4 6 U/dL), and copy number variations were investigated in 2718 subjects, including all subjects with protein S (free or total) < 2.5th percentile. Mutations in PROS1 were detected in 5 patients and 5 controls reinforcing the observation that inherited protein S deficiency is rare in the general population. Protein S testing and PROS1 testing should not be considered in unselected patients with venous thrombosis.

### Guidance for assessment of the inflammation etiologic criterion for the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition: a modified Delphi approach [^115REQ6Y]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

GLIM malnutrition — inflammation laboratory markers (statement 5) indicate that use of C-reactive protein (CRP) is recommended to support the inflammation criterion, with unanimous panel agreement. CRP has a half-life of 19 h, levels may be reduced in advanced liver disease, increased in end-stage kidney disease, and reduced with immunosuppressive conditions or therapies; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, magnesium supplements, or statins may lower CRP levels. Serum albumin lacks validity for diagnosing malnutrition in inflammatory settings, recovers slowly with a half-life of 3 weeks, yet if albumin is low and CRP elevated, inflammatory activity is highly likely.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^114BRSrz]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Macronutrient distribution — higher protein intake and weight outcomes: The consensus view of the NLA Expert Panel is that there is suggestive evidence that partially replacing carbohydrate, especially refined starches and sugars, with higher protein foods may be beneficial to enhance weight loss and weight loss maintenance. A review by Westerterp-Plantenga et al. concluded that "… evidence shows that a relatively high protein intake sustains weight maintenance by (a) favoring regain of fat free mass at the cost of fat at a similar physical activity level, (b) reducing the energy efficiency with respect to the body mass regained, and (c) increasing satiety". In trials comparing energy-restricted high-protein, low-fat diets (25–35% energy from protein, ≤ 30% of energy from fat) with standard-protein, low-fat diets (12–18% of energy from protein, ≤ 30% of energy from fat), 24 trials with 1063 individuals showed that higher protein diets produced greater decreases in body weight (0.79 kg), fat mass (0.87 kg), and TG (20.4 mg/dL), with smaller reductions in resting energy expenditure (356 kJ/day [142.4 kcal/day]) and fat-free mass (0.43 kg); authors concluded such diets provide modest benefits by attenuating reductions in fat-free mass and resting energy expenditure.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^114Nt2hB]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

ASPEN position paper — visceral proteins and nutrition assessment states that serum albumin and prealbumin characterize inflammation rather than describe nutrition status or protein-energy malnutrition, and that there is an association between inflammation and malnutrition, not between malnutrition and visceral-protein levels. These proteins correlate with patients' risk for adverse outcomes rather than with protein-energy malnutrition. Therefore, serum albumin and prealbumin should not serve as proxy measures of total body protein or total muscle mass and should not be used as nutrition markers.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^114aQ3Gx]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk stratification — risk factor count categories and quantitative risk scoring — specifies to classify patients as low risk with 0 to 1 major ASCVD risk factor, moderate risk with 2 major ASCVD risk factors, and high risk with ≥ 3 major ASCVD risk factors; for risk refinement, particularly in patients with moderate risk, consider quantitative risk scoring using thresholds to classify high risk of ≥ 10% 10-year risk for a hard coronary heart disease (CHD) event by the ATP III Framingham risk calculator, ≥ 15% 10-year risk for a hard ASCVD event by the Pooled Cohort Equations (ACC/AHA), and ≥ 45% risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) by the Framingham long-term (30 year) risk calculator, and note that additional indicators may warrant moving a patient into a higher risk category based on clinical judgment, including coronary artery calcium (CAC; ≥ 300 Agatston units), LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL and/or non–HDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2.0 mg/L, Lp (a) ≥ 50 mg/dL (protein) using an isoform-insensitive assay, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g.

### Interleukin 6 is associated with cachexia in patients with prostate cancer [^112rHhva]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the relationship between serum interleukin (IL)-6 and cachexia in patients with prostate cancer.

Methods

Serum levels of IL-6, total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, and hemoglobin concentration were determined in 164 blood samples from patients with prostate cancer. The body mass index and performance status were also determined.

Results

The serum total protein, albumin, and cholesterol levels, hemoglobin levels, and body mass index of the patients whose serum IL-6 level was 7 pg/mL or greater were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than the corresponding values in patients with a serum IL-6 level of less than 7 pg/mL. The serum IL-6 level of patients with a serum albumin level of less than 3.5 g/dL, serum total protein level of less than 7.0 g/dL, serum total cholesterol level of less than 180 mg/dL, hemoglobin level of less than 11.0 g/dL, and body mass index of less than 21 kg/m² were significantly greater (P < 0.05) than the values in their respective counterparts. A significant correlation was found between the elevation of serum IL-6 and performance status (P < 0.05). The mortality rate of patients with greater serum IL-6 levels was significantly greater than that of those with lower serum IL-6 levels in patients with untreated disease, patients in remission, and patients with relapse (all P < 0.05).

Conclusions

These findings suggest that IL-6 may be one of the factors contributing to the complex syndrome of cachexia in patients with prostate cancer (all P < 0.05).

### Guidelines for the management of adult acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure in the ICU: cardiovascular, endocrine, hematologic, pulmonary and renal considerations: executive summary [^1168P47x]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for acute liver failure, more specifically with respect to nutrition, SCCM 2020 guidelines recommend to avoid using a low protein goal in patients with ALF. Consider targeting protein goals comparable to critically ill patients without liver failure (such as 1.2–2.0 g protein/kg dry or ideal body weight per day).

### Hetastarch (hetastarch in sodium chloride) [^115mroRZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Coagulopathy

6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is not recommended for use as a cardiac bypass pump prime, while the patient is on cardiopulmonary bypass, or in the immediate period after the pump has been discontinued because of the risk of increasing coagulation abnormalities and bleeding in patients whose coagulation status is already impaired. Monitor the coagulation status of surgery patients, as excess bleeding has been reported with HES solutions in this population. Discontinue use of 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection at first sign of coagulopathy1–2

6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection has not been adequately evaluated to establish its safety in uses over extended periods other than leukapheresis. 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection has been associated with coagulation abnormalities in conjunction with an acquired, reversible von Willebrand's-like syndrome and/or Factor VIII deficiency when used over a period of days. Replacement therapy should be considered if a severe Factor VIII deficiency is identified. If a coagulopathy develops, it may take several days to resolve. Certain conditions may affect the safe use of 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection on a chronic basis. For example, in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage where 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is used repeatedly over a period of days for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm, significant clinical bleeding may occur. Intracranial bleeding resulting in death has been reported.3

Slight declines in platelet counts and hemoglobin levels have been observed in donors undergoing repeated leukapheresis procedures using 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection due to the volume expanding effects of hetastarch and to the collection of platelets and erythrocytes. Hemoglobin levels usually return to normal within 24 hours. Hemodilution by 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection may also result in 24 hour declines of total protein, albumin, calcium, and fibrinogen levels. Regular and frequent clinical evaluation and complete blood counts (CBC) are necessary for proper monitoring of 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection use during leukapheresis. If the frequency of leukapheresis is to exceed the guidelines for whole blood donation, you may wish to consider the following additional tests: total leukocyte and platelet counts, leukocyte differential count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

### Salivary CD44 and total protein levels to detect risk for oral and oropharyngeal cancer recurrence… [^117UXfVM]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Lines represent density plots, and boxes represent box plots showing quartiles 1, 2, and 3. To convert total protein to grams per liter, multiply by
10. Question Are CD44 and total protein useful for monitoring head and neck cancer recurrence, either used in a point-of-care test or as individual laboratory-based biomarkers. Findings In this multi-institutional nonrandomized clinical trial of an assay including 172 participants, multivariate-adjusted analysis revealed that there was a statistically significant association between increased CD44 and total protein levels and increased hazard ratios of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer recurrence, with average hazard ratios of 1. 13 and
3. 51, respectively. We also showed that soluble CD44, a tumor-initiation factor, and total protein were useful in identifying OOPSCC at all stages. High levels of soluble CD44 were associated with reduced progression-free survival.

In multivariate analysis, hospital-based patients with CD44 levels greater than 5. 33 ng/mL had reduced PFS and overall survival compared to patients in the reference group, when adjusted for tumor stage, age. Kaplan-Meier plots were constructed similarly for TP, including cut points. When each time point was tested individually, the association between CD44 or TP and PFS did not attain statistical significance.

For example, a patient with an elevated posttreatment CD44 level of 6 ng/mL would have an estimated hazard for recurrence 62% higher than a similar patient with normal levels of 2 ng/mL.

### Effect of a low-versus moderate-protein diet on progression of CKD: follow-up of a randomized controlled trial [^111Q6UrS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Whether low-protein-diet (LPD) as opposed to moderate-protein-diet (MPD) regimens improve the long-term survival of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or induce protein-caloric malnutrition is unknown.

Study Design

Intention-to-treat analysis of follow-up data from a randomized controlled trial.

Setting & Participants

423 patients with CKD (stages 4–5) were randomly assigned between January 1999 and January 2003 and followed up until December 2006 or death. The first phase of follow up was from January 1999 to June 2004; additional follow-up was from July 2004 to December 2006.

Intervention

LPD versus MPD (protein intake, 0.55 vs 0.80 g/kg/d).

Outcomes

Protein-caloric malnutrition (defined as the occurrence of 1 of the following: loss of body weight > 5% in 1 month or 7.5% in 3 months or body mass index < 20 kg/m² with serum albumin level < 3.2 g/dL and normal C-reactive protein level [< 0.5 mg/dL]), dialysis, death, or the composite outcome of dialysis and death.

Results

Baseline mean age was 61 years, estimated glomerular filtration rate was 16 mL/min/1.73 m², proteinuria had protein excretion of 1.67 g/d, body mass index was 27.1 kg/m², protein intake was 0.95 g/kg/d, and there were 57% men. Duration of follow-up was 32 months (median, 30 months; 25th-75th percentiles, 21–39). Average protein intakes were 0.73 ± 0.04 g/kg/d for the LPD and 0.9 ± 0.06 g/kg/d for the MPD. 3 patients (0.7%) met criteria for protein-caloric malnutrition. 48 patients died (11%), 83 initiated dialysis therapy (20%), and 113 (27%) reached the composite outcome. In unadjusted Cox survival analyses, effects of the LPD on these outcomes were 1.01 (95% CI, 0.57–1.79), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.62–1.48), and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.68–1.42), respectively.

Limitations

Low event rates for dialysis therapy initiation and death.

Conclusions

Most patients, who were regularly followed up in CKD clinics, were acceptably adherent to the prescribed dietary protein intake restrictions; the LPD and MPD did not lead to protein wasting; and the LPD did not decrease the risk of death or dialysis therapy initiation compared with the MPD.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^111asfkm]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

The principles described above with regard to the risk of treatment of patients that are already subject to (especially infectious) inflammation, also apply in medical oncology. Hypoalbuminemia often proves to be a strong independent risk factor for failure of chemotherapy and for mortality. 138, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146

The strong connection between inflammation and plasma albumin levels will generally make the trend of these levels a suitable instrument to assess improvement or deterioration of the disease process. We closely followed up serum albumin levels in a substantial number of patients with abdominal catastrophe in which damage control was achieved, but at the expense of open wounds, fistulas, or temporary stomata. This led to the observation that a rise of serum albumin of a few g/L in the course of a week invariably was associated with a negative fluid balance, body weight loss, and clinical improvement, whereas a drop in serum albumin levels was associated with opposite findings. This led to the practice of postponing surgical reintervention at least 6–12 weeks after damage control, when inflammatory activity had significantly subsided and the clinical condition improved, as reflected by the clinical state and increasing serum albumin levels. 100, 139

### Construction and validation of a risk prediction model for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a cross-sectional study based on the NHANES database from 2009 to 2018 [^1113i6fz]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma ranked second in importance. SHAP values showed a positive association, indicating that individuals with a history of asthma were more likely to be predicted at higher risk of COPD. Age ranked third in importance. As shown in Fig. 6, SHAP values remained close to zero or slightly negative before the age of 50. After 50 years of age, SHAP values increased rapidly, indicating that individuals aged over 50 contributed significantly more to the predicted risk of COPD.

Dietary health status ranked fourth. Overall, a lower dietary health rating was associated with an increased predicted risk of COPD. The dependence plot indicated that as dietary health ratings declined from 3 ("Good") to 5 ("Poor"), SHAP values rose more steeply, suggesting that poorer dietary quality exerted a stronger marginal effect on COPD risk prediction, highlighting the potential importance of nutritional interventions. Total protein ranked fifth in importance. Higher total protein levels were generally associated with lower predicted COPD risk, with SHAP values showing a negative trend. The dependence plot indicated that when total protein levels were below approximately 6.5 g/dL, SHAP values were mostly positive, suggesting that low protein levels were identified by the model as a risk factor for COPD. Between 7.0 and 7.5 g/dL, SHAP values gradually shifted toward negative, and stabilized thereafter, implying that total protein levels above 7.5 g/dL may confer a protective effect.

### Hypoalbuminemia: a new risk factor for progression in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance [^1179gLbB]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) is often incidental and relies on a serum M protein of 3.0 g/dL or less; less than 10% of clonal plasma cells (PC) in the bone marrow (BM) and the absence of CRAB features (hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia and bone lesions) and SLiM/CRAB criteria. MGUS is the most frequent PC dyscrasia, with a prevalence of 3.2% in people older than 50 years and more than 5.0% in those over 70 years.

Virtually all cases of multiple myeloma (MM) are preceded by MGUS, although not all MGUS will progress to MM. In this context, several prognostic factors for progression to MM or other related disorders have been identified over time and incorporated into various risk models, allowing for a more individualized patient follow-up. The Mayo Clinic progression risk model, which is the most widely used, identifies four risk groups based on serum M protein concentration (< 1.5 g/dL or ≥ 1.5 g/dL), immunoglobulin subtype (IgG vs. non-IgG) and free light chain (FLC) ratio (normal vs. abnormal): low, low-intermediate, high-intermediate and high-risk if patients present none, one, two or all three risk factors, respectively. More recently, multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) has been used to develop an algorithm which classifies patients into three groups, MGUS- like, intermediate, and MM- like phenotypes, based on the percentage of total BM PC and of clonal PC (cPC) within the BM PC compartment, identifying groups of patients with unique clinical outcomes. However, it has not yet been validated specifically in MGUS.

### Hypoalbuminaemia and heart failure: a practical review of current evidence [^117VCCjq]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure associated with other conditions

A couple of studies evaluated the prognostic role of lower levels of albumin in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Among such patients, hypoalbuminaemia independently predicted new‐onset HF and in‐hospital mortality and this trend was inversely correlated with progressively low albumin levels. Another report described increased in‐hospital mortality, HF development, and major bleeding in patients with hypoalbuminaemia. In addition, hypoalbuminaemia was found to predict long‐term mortality and worsening HF.

Hypoalbuminaemia is also important in rare forms of CV diseases, such as congenital heart diseases (CHD), and is a strong independent predictor of death even after adjustment for disease complexity. The Fontan palliative procedure often fails because of the onset of protein‐losing enteropathy which causes severe hypoalbuminaemia. The prognostic role of serum albumin was evaluated in adult HF patients with CHD listed for heart transplantation. Serum albumin levels < 3.2 g/dl were found to almost double the risk of the primary outcome – death or delisting for clinical worsening within 1 year – among CHD patients irrespective of lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, admission to the intensive care unit, and need for mechanical ventilation.

Biventricular congestive HF, which causes fluid retention and increased vascular permeability, contributes to the onset and perpetuation of hypoalbuminaemia. The latter is a prognostic marker for patients referred to cardiac interventional therapies, such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, left ventricular assist device, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and in heart transplant recipients.

### Intra-and post-dialytic changes of haemoglobin concentrations in non-anaemic haemodialysis patients [^116QDKz2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Non-anaemic haemodialysis (HD) patients are potentially more prone to the adverse effects of ultrafiltration-induced haemoconcentration. No study, however, has assessed the effects of dialytic session on haemoglobin (Hb) levels in these patients.

Methods

The levels of Hb and total protein before, at the end (T0) and up to 120 min (T120) after the third HD session of the week were compared in non-anaemic (Hb > 13 g/dl, n = 14, NOR) and anaemic (Hb = 11–12 g/dl, n = 18, LOW) HD patients.

Results

The intradialytic weight loss was similar in the two groups (4.0 ± 0.9 and 4.1 ± 0.9% body weight). During the treatment, Hb levels increased to the same extent in both groups (from 14.4 ± 1.2 to 16.3 ± 1.9 g/dl in NOR, and from 11.4 ± 0.8 to 12.7 ± 0.9 g/dl in LOW) in the presence, presumably, of a smaller plasma volume in NOR, whereas the increment of total protein was greater in NOR (from 7.1 ± 0.2 to 9.6 ± 0.5 g/dl) than in LOW (from 7.3 ± 0.6 to 8.7 ± 0.8 g/dl) (P < 0.0001). At T120, the Hb decline in NOR was almost double that measured in LOW (-9.2 ± 3.0 vs -4.7 ± 2.4%, P < 0.001). Consequently, Hb concentration did not differ from the pre-dialytic value in NOR (P = 0.10), but persisted higher in LOW (P < 0.005). The extent of the post-dialytic decrement of Hb was inversely related to the total protein values at T0 (r = -0.547, P = 0.0012).

Conclusions

This study indicates that in NOR: (i) the extent of intradialytic increment of Hb is limited by a greater intradialytic plasma refilling; (ii) the greater plasma refilling persists after the end of dialysis, with the restoration of pre-dialytic Hb levels within the initial 2 h; and (iii) the force driving this phenomenon resides mainly in the larger changes of total protein concentration.

2.5 Recommended Dosage in Adults

The recommended adult daily dosage of PROSOL and the nutritional requirements for protein (nitrogen) are shown in Table 1.

As a component of parenteral nutrition, PROSOL provides 0.2 g protein/mL, which corresponds to 0.032 g nitrogen/mL.

As indicated on an individual basis, vitamins, electrolytes, trace elements and other components (including dextrose, electrolytes and lipid emulsion) can be added to the parenteral nutrition solution to meet nutrient needs and prevent deficiencies and complications from developing.

A maximum fluid supply of 40 mL/kg/day of parenteral nutrition solution, based on protein, should not be exceeded in adult patients; this volume does not take carbohydrates or electrolytes into consideration.

The flow rate of the parenteral nutrition solution must be adjusted taking into account the dose being administered, the daily volume intake, and the duration of the infusion. The flow rate should be increased gradually and governed, especially during the first few days of therapy, by the patient's tolerance to dextrose. Daily intake of PROSOL and dextrose should be increased gradually to the maximum required dose as indicated by frequent determinations of blood glucose levels.

2.6 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment

Prior to administration, correct severe fluid or electrolyte imbalances. Closely monitor serum electrolyte levels and adjust the volume of parenteral nutrition administered as required [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Patients with renal impairment not needing dialysis require 0.6 to 0.8 g of protein/kg/day. Serum electrolyte levels should be closely monitored. Patients on hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy should receive 1.2 to 1.8 g of protein/kg/day up to a maximum of 2.5 g of protein/kg/day based on nutritional status and estimated protein losses.2

Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children — urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and albumin thresholds: The substitution of spot UPCR for the 24-hour urine collection has been established as the standard of care for children, with nephrotic-range proteinuria defined as first morning UPCR of ≥ 2 g/g. Whereas the 2012 KDIGO guideline maintained albumin ≤ 2.5 g/dL, the current guideline suggests serum albumin ≤ 3 g/dl; however, we suggest continuing to use the definition of nephrotic syndrome for children in the absence of evidence to support a change to a higher cutoff. It is unknown whether children with nephrotic-range proteinuria and less severe hypoalbuminemia (albumin of 2.6–2.9 g/dL) have similar pathology or treatment responses, and this has not been studied in prospective clinical trials. Practice Point 4.1.1 states that the definitions relating to nephrotic syndrome in children are based on the clinical characteristics outlined in Figure 39.

### A clinical decision rule to aid ordering of serum and urine protein electrophoresis for case-finding of paraproteins in hospitalized inpatients [^115K6zcr]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a simple clinical decision rule that could increase the yield of serum and urine protein electrophoresis (SPE/UPE) without loss of sensitivity.

Design

A cross-sectional study of inpatients with a SPE/UPE performed over a 5-year period (2001–2006) with complete data on electrolytes, globulins, full blood count, creatinine, age, and gender.

Setting

A tertiary-care general teaching hospital serving the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, with a referral population of over 1 million.

Participants

A total of 14,374 adult patients admitted between January 2001-November 2006.

Main Outcome Measures

Paraprotein on serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis (SPE/UPE).

Results

Five points were assigned for globulin > 41 g/l, 3 points for age ≥ 60, 2 points for each of hemoglobin < 121 and male gender, and 1 point for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60. Total scores of 0–5, 6–10, and ≥ 11 corresponded to positive likelihood ratios of an abnormal SPE/UPE of 1, 2.5, and 6.6, respectively. The predictive ability of this model was strong, with an area under the curve of approximately 0.8. Results in the validation set were almost identical.

Conclusion

A clinical decision rule using simple clinical variables has the potential to improve the yield of SPE/UPE. This rule however needs to be verified prospectively.

### Association of serum globulin with all-cause mortality in incident hemodialysis patients [^1165dRNr]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum globulin is a major component of total protein and can be elevated in inflammatory disease states. While inflammation is common in hemodialysis patients and associated with mortality and morbidity, the association between serum globulin and mortality has never been examined in hemodialysis patients.

Methods

In a retrospective cohort of 104164 incident hemodialysis patients treated by a large dialysis organization from 2007 to 2011, we explored the association between baseline serum globulin, albumin: globulin (A:G) ratio and serum protein levels and all-cause, cardiovascular and infection-related mortality with adjustments for demographic variables and laboratory markers of malnutrition and inflammation using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

Patients with a globulin concentration > 3.8 g/dL had a higher all-cause and infection-related mortality risk {hazard ratio [HR] 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–1.16] and HR 1.28 [95% CI 1.09–1.51], respectively} in the fully adjusted model when compared with the reference group of 3.0- < 3.2 g/dL. In addition, patients with an A:G ratio < 0.75 had a 45% higher all-cause mortality hazard [HR 1.45 (95% CI 1.38–1.52)] and patients with total serum protein < 5.5 g/dL had a 34% higher risk of death [1.34 (95% CI 1.27–1.42)] when compared with the reference (A:G ratio 1.05- < 1.15 and total serum protein 6.5- < 7 g/dL).

Conclusions

Among incident hemodialysis patients, a higher globulin level was associated with a higher mortality risk independent of other markers of malnutrition and inflammation, including albumin. A lower A:G ratio and serum protein was also associated with a higher mortality hazard. The mechanisms that contribute to elevated serum globulin should be further explored.

JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult malnutrition (undernutrition) — diagnostic characteristics and measurement notes — state that "A minimum of 2 of the 6 characteristics above is recommended for diagnosis of either severe or nonsevere malnutrition". For the clinical characteristic "(6) Reduced grip strength", clinicians should "Consult normative standards supplied by the manufacturer of the measurement device"; in the table, nonsevere categories list "NA" and severe categories "Measurably reduced". Height and weight should be measured rather than estimated to determine body mass index (BMI), and usual weight should be obtained to determine the percentage and to interpret the significance of weight loss. The National Center for Health Statistics defines chronic as a disease/condition lasting 3 months or longer. Serum proteins such as serum albumin and prealbumin are not included as defining characteristics of malnutrition because recent evidence analysis shows that serum levels of these proteins do not change in response to changes in nutrient intake. Basic indicators of nutrition status such as body weight, weight change, and appetite may substantively improve with refeeding in the absence of inflammation. Refeeding and/or nutrition support may stabilize but not significantly improve nutrition parameters in the presence of inflammation.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^112pWRHm]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

ASPEN position on visceral proteins — executive summary states that serum albumin and prealbumin are not components of currently accepted definitions of malnutrition, and that serum albumin and prealbumin do not serve as valid proxy measures of total body protein or total muscle mass and should not be used as nutrition markers. It adds that the serum concentrations of albumin and prealbumin decline in the presence of inflammation, regardless of underlying nutrition status, and that serum albumin and prealbumin declines must be recognized as inflammatory markers associated with "nutrition risk" in the context of nutrition assessment rather than with malnutrition per se, with nutrition risk broadly defined as the risk of developing malnutrition and/or poor clinical outcomes if nutrition support is not provided. It further notes that the role of serum albumin and prealbumin in monitoring delivery and efficacy of nutrition support remains undefined and that their normalization may indicate the resolution of inflammation, the reduction of nutrition risk, a transition to anabolism, or potentially lower calorie and protein requirements.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^114LpzTy]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Other plasma proteins have also been promoted as markers of inflammation. C‐reactive protein (CRP) is a true acute‐phase protein rising within 10 hours to plasma levels > 100 mg/L after major surgery or acute sepsis. CRP is present in very low concentrations in healthy individuals but strongly upregulated, stimulated by IL‐6 and NO rising immediately after trauma or infection. There is a close inverse correlation between increases in CRP and decreases in serum albumin levels after 48 hours in well‐resuscitated septic or traumatized patients. Thereafter, CRP drops quickly after 3–4 days to low, but still modestly increased, levels if the proinflammatory phase is successful. 147 In this phase, plasma CRP level is primarily an indicator of the severity of the primary insult, initiating innate immunity to clear tissue debris and microorganisms and their products. 148 Thereafter, in the anti‐inflammatory phase, CRP is neither a precise indicator of the severity of the metabolic response, nor a very precise indicator of whether there is improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. 147 Only in the presence of renewed or unrelenting tissue damage, CRP will steeply increase or remain strongly elevated. Plasma albumin is a constitutive protein, required in health and disease. After an initial steep drop, plasma albumin levels continue to decrease modestly until 3–7 days after operation, when they start to increase slowly in the case of clinical recovery. 4 Normal levels may only be reached after 3–4 months, reflecting the anti‐inflammatory phase promoting wound healing and tissue rebuilding and remodelling.

### Hypoalbuminemia in acute heart failure patients: causes and its impact on hospital and long-term mortality [^111tZSEU]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The causes of hypoalbuminemia in patients with acute heart failure (HF) remain poorly defined, and the association between hypoalbuminemia and hospital and long-term mortality has been only partially evaluated. This study sought to analyze the causes of hypoalbuminemia in acute HF patients and determine its impact on hospital and long-term mortality.

Methods and Results

A total of 362 consecutive acute HF patients were assessed. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of hypoalbuminemia (albumin ≤ 3.4 g/dL), and the independent association of each variable with hypoalbuminemia and hospital mortality was assessed with the use of multiple logistic regression. The association between hypoalbuminemia and long-term mortality was assessed with the use of Cox multivariate analysis. In total, 108 patients (29.8%) were classified as having hypoalbuminemia. Older age, higher C-reactive protein levels, and lower levels of total protein, prealbumin, transferrin, and lymphocytes were independently associated with hypoalbuminemia. Hospital mortality was 8% and was independently associated with hypoalbuminemia. A total of 333 patients were discharged. Hypoalbuminemia was an independent predictor of mortality.

Conclusions

Hypoalbuminemia in acute HF patients was associated with higher hospital mortality and served as an independent predictor of long-term mortality. Malnutrition and inflammation were factors causing hypoalbuminemia in this clinical setting.

The high protein group, compared to usual protein group, received slightly higher energy (17.4 ± 6.5 vs. 15.6 ± 6.1 kcal/kg/BW/d; p = 0.01) over the first 12 days after randomization (Fig. 2 B). Daily amounts of protein and energy received by each group after randomization are shown in Additional file 1: Figs. S1 and S2).

Association of protein dose with duration and incidence of kidney replacement therapy

In patients receiving KRT, high or usual protein dosing did not significantly affect the duration of KRT post randomization (5.0 [2.0–10.0] vs. 6.0 [4.0–10.0] days; p = 0.21). The overall incidence of new KRT after randomization was 64 (20.5%), and this was not different between the two groups (34 [20.9%] vs. 30 [20.1%]; p = 0.87) (Table 2).

*The duration of KRT from randomization includes 64 incident and 43 prevalent cases of KRT

Time course of urea level

Over the observation period, the average levels of urea were higher in the AKI patients receiving high protein dose, irrespective of the use of KRT, when compared to patients with usual dose of protein (19.7 ± 9.8 vs. 17.6 ± 9.7; p = 0.04) (Table 2); this difference would not be statistically significant by any reasonable adjustment or multiplicity of testing. The serum levels of urea measured over the time course of 12 days, indicated higher levels of urea in AKI patients that received high protein (arm by time interaction: p = 0.02) (Additional file 1: Fig. S3, Table S1).

### Pragmatic and evidence-based approach to paediatric cerebrospinal fluid reference limits for white cell count and concentrations of total protein and glucose [^116uTh3g]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

It is often impractical for each laboratory to establish its own paediatric reference intervals. This is particularly true for specimen types collected using invasive procedures, for example, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Methods

Published CSF reference intervals for white cell count, and concentrations of total protein and glucose were reviewed by stakeholders in a paediatric hospital. Consensus reference intervals for the three CSF parameters were then subjected to verification using guidelines from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute and residual CSF specimens.

Results

Consensus paediatric reference intervals adapted from published studies with minor modifications were locally verified as follows. White cell count (× 10⁶ cells/L): 0–20 (< 1month); 0–10 (1–2 months); 0–5 (> 2 months). Total protein (g/L): 0.3–1.2 (< 1month); 0.2–0.6 (1–3 months); 0.1–0.4 (> 3 months). Glucose (mmol/L): 2.0–5.6 (< 6 months); 2.4–4.3 (6 months or older).

Evaluation of albuminuria — initial testing and confirmation states, "We suggest using the following measurements for initial testing of proteinuria (in descending order of preference, in all cases an early morning urine sample is preferred) (2B); 1) urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR); 2) urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR); 3) reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading; 4) reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading". It further specifies, "We recommend that clinical laboratories report ACR and PCR in untimed urine samples in addition to albumin concentration or protein concentrations rather than concentrations alone. (1B)" and "The term microalbumin should no longer be used by laboratories. (Not Graded)". For confirmation, it directs, "Confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to creatinine whenever possible", "Confirm ACR ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent early morning urine sample", and "If a more accurate estimate of albuminuria or total proteinuria is required, measure albumin excretion rate or total protein excretion rate in a timed urine sample". When non-albumin proteins are suspected, it adds, "If significant non-albumin proteinuria is suspected, use assays for specific urine proteins (e.g., α1-microglobulin, monoclonal heavy or light chains, [known in some countries as "Bence Jones" proteins]).

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^112EVfzn]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Should albumin infusions target albumin levels?

The need to make decisions as to whether or not a particular patient should receive albumin based on their albumin level is related to whether the considered use is targeted as resuscitation or supplementation. Most patients requiring resuscitation fluids in the ICU are hypoalbuminemic and, as mentioned earlier, the fluid will be given largely for its effects on COP – that is, limiting edema formation – provided that the hydrostatic pressure does not increase excessively. In such patients, monitoring the albumin concentration is probably of little value.

In more prolonged administration as supplementation, however, serum albumin levels may be a useful guide to ongoing needs, in combination with disease severity, hemodynamic status, and nutritional status; just as an arbitrary cutoff hemoglobin concentration should not be used to define absolute need for blood transfusion in all patients, so a specific serum albumin threshold for albumin administration is unlikely to be relevant to all. The meta-analysis of nine prospective controlled trials on correcting hypoalbuminemia in acutely ill patients mentioned earlier suggested that complication rates were reduced in patients who achieved serum albumin concentrations > 30 g/l after albumin administration. As a result, the ALBIOS study protocol stipulated that albumin administration should be titrated to maintain serum albumin ≥ 30 g/l. Albumin levels were measured on a daily basis and 200 or 300 mL of 20% albumin were administered in patients with albumin levels between 25 and 30 g/l or < 25 g/l, respectively. Following the time course of albumin levels, especially in response to an albumin infusion, may be more valuable than a single albumin level, but optimal albumin levels during critical illness are not clearly defined.

What type of albumin preparation?

Currently available human albumin solutions are developed using various techniques, such that the various commercially available albumin solutions may differ in protein content and composition, binding capacity, metal ion content, antioxidant properties, charge, capacity to bind drugs, and so forth. This is a difficult topic to evaluate because there are few data available about the precise composition of the different albumin solutions and whether or how this may impact on its clinical properties, but the differences may help explain some of the different study results. One study comparing six different commercially available preparations of albumin with serum albumin from healthy volunteers reported large differences between the solutions, particularly in terms of the presence of oxidized cysteine 34 (23% in human volunteer albumin vs 54 to 60% in commercial preparations), which may influence the properties and hence the clinical impact of albumin solutions. Precise compositions of albumin solution should be clearly identified in future study reports.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^1158KX7a]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with inflammation. Despite being addressed repeatedly in the literature, there is still confusion regarding its pathogenesis and clinical significance. Inflammation increases capillary permeability and escape of serum albumin, leading to expansion of interstitial space and increasing the distribution volume of albumin. The half-life of albumin has been shown to shorten, decreasing total albumin mass. These 2 factors lead to hypoalbuminemia despite increased fractional synthesis rates in plasma. Hypoalbuminemia, therefore, results from and reflects the inflammatory state, which interferes with adequate responses to events like surgery or chemotherapy, and is associated with poor quality of life and reduced longevity. Increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels are adequate indicators, respectively, of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. In the interstitium, albumin acts as the main extracellular scavenger, antioxidative agent, and as supplier of amino acids for cell and matrix synthesis. Albumin infusion has not been shown to diminish fluid requirements, infection rates, and mortality in the intensive care unit, which may imply that there is no body deficit or that the quality of albumin "from the shelf" is unsuitable to play scavenging and antioxidative roles. Management of hypoalbuminaemia should be based on correcting the causes of ongoing inflammation rather than infusion of albumin. After the age of 30 years, muscle mass and function slowly decrease, but this loss is accelerated by comorbidity and associated with decreasing serum albumin levels. Nutrition support cannot fully prevent, but slows down, this chain of events, especially when combined with physical exercise.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^111tpNH6]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Soy protein — lipid effects and FDA health claim requirements: Compared to a milk protein control, soy protein produced significant reductions in non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL-C) of 6.9%, triglycerides (TG) of 13.7%, and apolipoprotein B (apo B) of 7.3%, with a near-significant low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction of 5.0% (P = 0.08). The existing FDA-approved health claim for soy and heart disease requires that each food with the health claim contain at least 6.25 g of soy protein, based on the need for 25 g of soy protein to show significant lowering of serum total cholesterol (total-C) and LDL-C; examples meeting 6.25 g include 4 oz. whole soybeans, 8 oz. soy milk, 3.5 oz. soy flour, 8 oz. textured soy protein, 4 oz. tofu, and 4 oz. tempeh. In summary, soy protein lowers LDL-C via intrinsic and extrinsic effects and, when incorporated in a cardioprotective diet as a substitute for foods high in saturated fat, has an LDL-C–lowering effect due to both decreasing saturated fat and increasing soy protein.

### Detection and measurement of urinary protein [^116qeBca]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The measurement of urine total protein and albumin is central to the diagnosis and management of subjects with kidney disease and in assessing cardiovascular risk. Accurate assessment is vital to enable detection and management of the patient with proteinuria.

Recent Findings

The spot urine protein has been suggested as an acceptable alternative to 24-h urine collections. Recent studies suggest that this holds true for screening to exclude significant proteinuria (> 1 g/day) but data are lacking for the quantification of proteinuria and in assessing response to therapy. For albuminuria, while 24-h urinary albumin excretion remains the gold standard, spot urine samples are appropriate for screening. The optimal technique for the laboratory determination of urinary albumin has been questioned with the high-performance liquid chromatography-based method demonstrating significantly more albumin in the urine. Population-based studies have found dramatic increases in the prevalence of microalbuminuria with the new high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Whether this extra immunounreactive albumin detected by high-performance liquid chromatography is clinically important remains to be established.

Summary

Twenty-four-hour urine collection remains the gold standard for the accurate determination of both total urinary protein and albumin. Spot urine samples can be used for screening patients for albuminuria and proteinuria. The optimal method for measuring urinary albumin concentration remains to be established.

### Rethinking energy and protein provision for critically ill patients [^114tYh25]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Protein dose

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis, including 23 RCTs and 3303 patients, showed that higher vs lower protein doses (average delivered: 1.49 ± 0.48 vs 0.92 ± 0.30 g/kg/day) did not significantly improve clinical outcomes. However, higher protein delivery significantly increased mortality rates in a subgroup with acute kidney injury. Although higher protein delivery was associated with attenuation of muscle loss, no clinical or physical-function benefits were found. Recently, the PRECISe trial demonstrated that a high (targeted: 2 g/kg/day; average delivered: 1.48 ± 0.7 g/kg/day) compared with standard (targeted: 1.3 g/kg/day; average delivered: 0.95 ± 0.44 g/kg/day) protein delivery significantly decreased EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels [EQ-5D-5L] up to day 180. The level of evidence supporting a protein dose of 1.3 g/kg is currently limited.

### GLIM consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: a 5-year update [^116WnfDX]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Inflammation/disease burden

There is a strong consensus that many diseases or conditions are of inflammatory origin and/or elicit inflammatory responses. Malnutrition may result from inflammation‐driven catabolic muscle loss, anorexia, altered metabolism, and associated micronutrient deficiencies. However, the original GLIM consensus papers did not provide the detailed guidance needed to assess inflammation in support of malnutrition diagnosis.

A GLIM working group, therefore, undertook a robust modified Delphi process to provide comprehensive guidance. Seven statements were developed (Table 3) that conclude that the occurrence of acute or chronic disease, infection, or injury that is often/usually associated with inflammatory activity may fulfill the GLIM disease burden/inflammation criterion, and confirmation by laboratory markers is not always necessary. Examples of acute and chronic conditions are provided. In cases of uncertainty, confirmation by C‐reactive protein (CRP) analysis is recommended. Serial measurements of CRP are recommended, and repeated measures higher than the upper cutoff level of the selected clinical laboratory support the presence of chronic inflammation. Application of clinical judgment is encouraged (Table 3).

Serum biochemistry profile of SPA4 peptide-treated mice

The levels of proteins (total protein, albumin, globulin), liver enzymes (ALP, ALT, GGT), bile acids and total bilirubin, analytes related to kidney function (BUN, creatinine), muscle enzymes (creatine kinase, AST, ALT), and glucose and cholesterol, associated with hormonal and metabolic imbalance, were determined in serum specimens collected at the time of necropsy. No measurable amounts of GGT and creatinine were detected in serum specimens of SPA4 peptide-treated mice. Total protein (range of means 4.5–5.2 g/dL), albumin (range of means 2.5–3.2 g/dL), and globulin (range of means 2.0–2.1 g/dL) levels did not significantly differ among study groups. Levels of liver enzymes (range of means 105.3–151.5 U/L ALP, 89–411 U/L AST, and 36.6–116.8 U/L ALT) remained statistically unaltered among different treatment groups. Levels of bile acids (range of means 3.7–18.9 μmol/L) were not different among treatment groups. Bilirubin levels varied (range of mean values 0.13–0.43 mg/dL) among different groups. One untreated mouse had an increased measured value of 1.9 mg/dL total bilirubin; the remaining untreated mice had 0.1–0.7 mg/dL total bilirubin. Thus, levels of total bilirubin in mice treated with 1.25 μg SPA4 peptide/g body weight (mean value 0.13 mg/dL) were noted statistically different from those in untreated mice (mean value 0.43 mg/dL). The levels of total bilirubin in other groups did not significantly differ from those in untreated mice.

### Albumin human — albumin — human [^115EsVvN]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia

In adults, intravenous infusion of 50 to 75 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used. Hypoalbuminemia is usually accompanied by a hidden extravascular albumin deficiency of equal magnitude. This total body albumin deficit must be considered when determining the amount of albumin necessary to reverse the hypoalbuminemia.

In burns, therapy usually starts with the administration of large volumes of crystalloid injection to maintain plasma volume. After 24 hours, ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be added at an initial dose of 25 g with the dose adjusted thereafter to maintain a plasma protein concentration of 2.5 g per 100 mL or a serum protein concentration of 5.2 g/100 mL.

Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites

In adults, intravenous infusion of 8 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be given for every 1,000 mL of ascitic fluid removed.

Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome

In adults, as a guideline, doses of 50–100 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% should be infused over 4 hours and repeated at 4- to 12-hour intervals as necessary, when infusion of normal saline fails to achieve or maintain hemodynamic stability and urine output. [7]

Case presentation

An 8-year-old girl was diagnosed with hematuria and proteinuria during a school urine screening program. She was referred to the medical outpatient clinic. Her clinical examination and serum creatinine level were normal. She had no medical or family history of this condition. A spot urine protein to creatinine ratio was around 7 g/g Cre. She was admitted to our department because of persistent hematuria and proteinuria. Again, the clinical examination was normal. Results of the blood tests were as follows: white blood cell count, 10.6 × 10⁹/L; hemoglobin level, 11.6 g/dL; platelet count, 240 × 10⁹/L; sodium level, 135 mmol/L; potassium level, 3.7 mmol/L; total protein level, 5.56 g/dL; albumin level, 2.67 g/dL; urea, 13.9 mg/dL; creatinine level, 0.40 mg/dL; triglyceride level, 56 mg/dL; total cholesterol level, 267 mg/dL; complement component (C) 3 level, 104 mg/dL; C4, 29 mg/dL; total complement (CH50) level, 36.6 U/mL; immunoglobulin (Ig)-G level, 766 mg/dL; and IgA level 137 mg/dL. At admission, urinalysis showed microscopic hematuria and proteinuria. A spot urine protein to creatinine ratio was 8.6 g/g Cre. During a routine inspection using dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA) before renal biopsy, Tc-99 m DMSA images showed a focal decreased uptake in the upper and lower portion of the left kidney (Fig. 1a).

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^1122brzE]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Nutritional management in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — protein intake levels and source-focused strategies are outlined: diets for people with diabetes have traditionally been 15% to 20% protein, and the NHANES 1999 to 2000 indicated that the majority of Americans consume 15% of total daily calories or approximately 1.04 g/kg body weight per day as protein, more than the 0.8 g/kg body weight per day RDA; high-protein intake is noted as (≥ 20% of total daily calories). In the DASH and DASH-Sodium diets, a higher protein intake (1.4 g/kg body weight per day) is recommended. In recent studies of people with prehypertension or untreated stage 1 hypertension, higher protein intake from either soy or predominantly vegetable sources reduced blood pressure in short-term (6 to 12 weeks) feeding studies. Several small studies indicate that vegetable or soy protein sources also may be kidney sparing compared with red-meat sources in diabetes and CKD, and in the Nurses Health Study the risk of losing kidney function in women with mild kidney insufficiency was related primarily to animal meat intake, while higher dairy or vegetable protein intake did not increase this risk. Therefore, a DASH-type diet that emphasizes sources of protein other than red meat may be a reasonable alternative to a lower total protein intake in people with hypertension, diabetes, and CKD stages 1 to 2. Nevertheless, people who achieve the RDA for protein, 0.8 g/kg body weight per day, and maintain an adequate caloric intake remain well nourished. Regardless of the level of protein intake, 50% to 75% of the protein should be of high biological value, derived predominantly from lean poultry, fish, and soy- and vegetable-based proteins.

To determine whether hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for poor outcome in the acutely ill, and to assess the potential of exogenous albumin administration for improving outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients.

Summary Background Data

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor outcomes in acutely ill patients, but whether this association is causal has remained unclear. Trials investigating albumin therapy to correct hypoalbuminemia have proven inconclusive.

Methods

A meta-analysis was conducted of 90 cohort studies with 291,433 total patients evaluating hypoalbuminemia as an outcome predictor by multivariate analysis and, separately, of nine prospective controlled trials with 535 total patients on correcting hypoalbuminemia.

Results

Hypoalbuminemia was a potent, dose-dependent independent predictor of poor outcome. Each 10-g/L decline in serum albumin concentration significantly raised the odds of mortality by 137%, morbidity by 89%, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay respectively by 28% and 71%, and increased resource utilization by 66%. The association between hypoalbuminemia and poor outcome appeared to be independent of both nutritional status and inflammation. Analysis of dose-dependency in controlled trials of albumin therapy suggested that complication rates may be reduced when the serum albumin level attained during albumin administration exceeds 30 g/L.

Conclusions

Hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Further well-designed trials are needed to characterize the effects of albumin therapy in hypoalbuminemic patients. In the interim, there is no compelling basis to withhold albumin therapy if it is judged clinically appropriate.

### The dilemma with the soy protein health claim [^113ed7m9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), a cumulative chronological meta‐analysis, by Jenkins and colleagues, aims to establish whether at any time since 1999, the effect of soy protein on total cholesterol and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐cholesterol becomes statistically nonsignificant. 5 This meta‐analysis includes the same 46 intervention studies, of high or moderate quality, that the FDA reviewed as part of its scientific reevaluation of the evidence base. However, the FDA only examined the studies for consistency in the reported effect and found that 19 studies showed that soy protein reduced CHD risk and the remaining 27 studies did not support reduced risk of CHD with soy protein consumption. The FDA summary also highlighted the substantial heterogeneity present among the 46 studies with regard to study design, dose of soy protein, and sample size. 3

The analysis of the evidence base by Jenkins et al 5 differed from the FDA's evaluation because the magnitude of the effect of soy protein on total cholesterol and LDL‐cholesterol was what was of specific interest. 5 On the basis of the data reported by Jenkins and colleagues, 5 in 1999, the available evidence showed soy protein lowered total cholesterol and LDL‐cholesterol by 4.53 mg/dL (95% CI, −8.08 to −0.99 mg/dL; P = 0.01) and 6.33 mg/dL (95% CI, −8.74 to −3.92 mg/dL; P < 0.00001), respectively. The addition of evidence through 2013 showed that at no point did the effect of soy protein on total cholesterol or LDL‐cholesterol become statistically nonsignificant. However, the magnitude of the effect of soy protein on LDL‐cholesterol was somewhat attenuated with the inclusion of studies published through 2013; the mean difference between soy and the comparator was −4.76 mg/dL (95% CI, −6.71 to −2.80 mg/dL; P < 0.00001). In the case of total cholesterol, in 2013, the reduction observed with soy protein was slightly higher at 6.41 mg/dL (95% CI, −9.30 to −3.52 mg/dL; P < 0.00001). Based on these small differences, the authors concluded that there has been no deviation in the magnitude of total cholesterol and LDL‐cholesterol lowering with soy protein since 1999, and the effect evident in 1999 has persisted over time.

KDOQI nutrition in CKD — Protein restriction for adults with CKD 3–5 specifies that in adults with CKD 3–5 who are metabolically stable, we recommend, under close clinical supervision, protein restriction with or without keto acid analogs, to reduce risk for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)/death (1A) and improve quality of life (QoL) (2C): a low-protein diet providing 0.55–0.60 g dietary protein/kg body weight/day, or a very low-protein diet providing 0.28–0.43 g dietary protein/kg body weight/day with additional keto acid/amino acid analogs to meet protein requirements (0.55–0.60 g/kg body weight/day). In the adult with CKD 3–5 and who has diabetes, it is reasonable to prescribe, under close clinical supervision, a dietary protein intake of 0.6–0.8 g/kg body weight per day to maintain a stable nutritional status and optimize glycemic control (OPINION).

Results

Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data

Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data are presented in Table 1. The mean age was 69.8 years in the regular HD group and 70.0 years in the on-line HDF group. The average hemoglobin concentration in the HD group was 10.9 g/dL, which indicated renal anemia; however, these patients were considered well controlled because they were within the reference values of Japanese guidelines for renal anemia. The blood liver transaminase levels were normal. In the HD group, the blood urea nitrogen (65.4 mg/dL) and creatinine (10.6 mg/dL) concentrations were dramatically increased, and the inorganic phosphorus level was also high (5.22 mg/dL). However, there were no contraindications to participation in this study because these patients had end-stage renal disease. On the other hand, all measurement item data in the control group were within reference values. No patients had serum albumin levels < 3.3 g/dL or C-reactive protein levels > 0.5 mg/dL.

### Higher protein intake during caloric restriction improves diet quality and attenuates loss of lean body mass [^116NXsku]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

CR

Participants lost 5.0% (5.4%; p < 0.001) of their baseline body weight (79.7 [14.6] kg). During CR, the LP group consumed less protein, at 58.3 [6.6] g/d, compared with the HP group, at 78.6 [9.4] g/d (Table 2). In addition, the percentage protein intake during CR was lower in the LP (17.8% [2.9%]) compared with the HP group (19.9 [2.8%]; p < 0.001). During CR, carbohydrates (LP: 51% [5.3%] vs. HP: 47.4% [5.8%]) differed between groups (p < 0.001). Dietary fat intake averaged 32.8% [4.8%], and it did not differ between groups. The physical activity level score was 1.0 (0.7), and physical activity did not differ significantly between the LP and HP groups or change over time. Both protein groups lost a similar amount of weight and fat mass during CR, but there was a greater decrease in LBM in the LP compared with the HP group (p < 0.01), whether calculated as percentage (not shown) or kilogram loss (Figure 1).

### What Do the elevated protein levels mean in my patients with myeloma, amyloidosis, and related disorders? [^115uLPTN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple myeloma, light chain amyloidosis, and other plasma cell dyscrasias are characterized, in part, by abnormal production of paraproteins that are often responsible for the sequelae of those diseases. These paraproteins are whole or fragmented immunoglobulins produced by clonal antibody-secreting cells (usually plasma cells, but occasionally, B lymphocytes). Significant heterogeneity exists in the presentation of these diseases, ranging from incidental detection of a monoclonal protein in an asymptomatic patient, to life-threatening manifestations that require urgent diagnostic confirmation and intervention. Successful management of such scenarios requires a fundamental understanding of the laboratory assays at one's disposal, their role in the workup of paraproteinemias, and the interpretation thereof. This review broadly covers these assays and their roles in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of these diseases.

### Can serum albumin level and total lymphocyte count be surrogates for malnutrition to predict wound complications after total knee arthroplasty? [^111d857v]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although the serum albumin level and total lymphocyte count (TLC) have been reported as valid and reliable markers for defining malnutrition, their cutoff levels and predictive values for wound complications in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain questionable.

Methods

A total of 3169 TKAs performed between April 2003 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. We determined the prevalence of malnutrition on applying different definitions, with various cutoff values of serum albumin and TLC and analyzed the variations in outcome. The differences between groups with and without malnutrition in terms of functional outcome and complications were determined using Student's t test and analysis of variance. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the independent risk factors.

Results

Among all the patients (N = 3169), the serum albumin level and TLC varied widely, with means of 4.1 g/dL and 2189 cells/mm³, respectively. The prevalence of malnutrition (21%) as per the conventional definition (serum albumin level < 3.5 g/dL or a serum TLC < 1500 cells/mm³) dropped to only 1.6% when malnutrition was defined as serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL "and" TLC < 1500/mm³, indicating a very small overlap between the 2 markers. No differences were observed between 2 groups in functional outcomes and incidence of wound complications.

Conclusion

Our findings call into question the values of serum albumin level and TLC as a surrogate of malnutrition for predicting wound complications after TKA.

### Understanding and interpreting serum protein… [^115F14bJ]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

The proteins are stained, and their densities are calculated electronically to provide graphical data on the absolute and relative amounts of the various proteins. Further separation of protein subtypes is achieved by staining with an immunologically active agent, which results in immunofluorescence and immunofixation. Components of Serum Protein Electrophoresis The pattern of serum protein electrophoresis results depends on the fractions of two major types of protein: albumin and globulins. Albumin, the major protein component of serum, is produced by the liver under normal physiologic conditions. Globulins comprise a much smaller fraction of the total serum protein content. The subsets of these proteins and their relative quantity are the primary focus of the interpretation of serum protein electrophoresis. 1, 3 Albumin, the largest peak, lies closest to the positive electrode. The next five components are labeled alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2, and gamma.

The peaks for these components lie toward the negative electrode, with the gamma peak being closest to that electrode. Figure 1 shows a typical normal pattern for the distribution of proteins as determined by serum protein electrophoresis. 1 and alpha 2 components. The alpha 1-protein fraction is comprised of alpha 1-antitrypsin, thyroid-binding globulin, and transcortin. Malignancy and acute inflammation can increase the alpha 1-protein band. A decreased alpha 1-protein band may occur because of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency or decreased production of the globulin as a result of liver disease. Ceruloplasmin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, and haptoglobin contribute to the alpha 2-protein band. The alpha 2 component is increased as an acute-phase reactant. BETA FRACTION The beta fraction has two peaks labeled beta 1 and beta 2. Beta 1 is composed mostly of transferrin, and beta 2 contains beta-lipoprotein.

IgA, IgM, and sometimes IgG, along with complement proteins, also can be identified in the beta fraction. An M-protein spike of greater than 2. 5 g per dL should be assessed with a metastatic bone survey that includes a single view of the humeri and femurs. In addition, a beta.

Detailed justification — serum albumin in dialysis patients — In maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) cohorts, serum albumin concentration < 3.5 g/dL was associated with higher odds of mortality over 10 years (OR, 2.34 [95% CI, 1.33–4.10]; P = 0.002), and low albumin (< 38 g/L) was significantly associated with higher mortality and morbidity. In peritoneal dialysis (PD) cohorts, hypoalbuminemia predicted mortality (HR, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.1–5.0]) after 24 months, and for every 1-g/L increase in serum albumin level there was a 2-year relative mortality risk of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90–0.97). Across studies including both MHD and PD patients, a 1-g/dL decrease in serum albumin level was associated with increased mortality risks of 47% in MHD and 38% in PD, but after adjusting for inflammatory status or for SGA score and nPCR these mortality RRs were not statistically significant. One study determined that serum albumin concentration was a sensitive method for identifying patients at risk defined by the 7-point SGA score.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^111utkMJ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Soy protein and lipids — meta-analyses and trial synthesis: A 1995 review reported that consumption of 47 g soy protein/day reduced serum total cholesterol (total-C) by 9.3%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 12.9%, and triglycerides (TG) by 10.5%, while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) by 2.4%, which supported the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) health claim stating that "25 g of soy protein a day may reduce the risk of heart disease". More recent assessments include an AHA Soy Science Advisory Panel meta-analysis showing a mean LDL-C reduction of 3% with soy protein interventions from 22 randomized trials and concluding no effect on HDL-C, TG, lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], or blood pressure. Jenkins and colleagues estimated an intrinsic effect of soy from studies using 20–133 g/day soy protein, and an extrinsic displacement effect modeled by substituting 13 to 58 g/day soy protein for animal protein; their results suggested that approximately 30 g/day may reduce serum LDL-C by approximately 4% to 5% intrinsically with an additional 4% to 5% from displacement, for a combined estimated LDL-C reduction of 7.9% to 10.3%. A 2011 meta-analysis reported soy protein intake ranging from 15 to 50 g/day (mean ~30 g/day) and was associated with an LDL-C reduction of 5.5% in parallel studies and 4.2% in crossover studies; in parallel studies HDL-C values were 3.2% higher and fasting TG levels were 10.7% lower with soy versus control, and the duration necessary to produce maximal LDL-C effects was 8 weeks.

### Serum albumin and β-amyloid deposition in the human brain [^114Pbr5V]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

In terms of Aβ positivity risk, the odds ratio for low albumin category was 3.40 (95% confidence interval 1.67–6.92, p = 0.001) compared with the high albumin category. This means that, even within the normal range of serum albumin, individuals with serum albumin < 4.4 g/dL have an ≈3 times higher risk of pathologic Aβ deposition. This finding also indicates that nutritional interventions such as high dietary protein or albumin replacement may be helpful for those with low serum albumin in terms of AD prevention or treatment. Recently, the Alzheimer's Management by Albumin Replacement (AMBAR) trial was conducted to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of therapeutic albumin replacement with plasma exchange as a new treatment of AD. Our result may provide an additional rationale for this kind of trial.

Unlike the relationship with Aβ, serum albumin was not related to either AD-signature neurodegeneration or WMH. While the relationships between low serum albumin and AD dementia have been reported as mentioned above, very little information is available on the relationships of serum albumin with degenerative changes in the brain. The lack of association between serum albumin and AD-CM or AD-CT in the present study indicated that serum albumin does not directly affect metabolism or structural changes in AD-related brain regions in older adults. We did not find any relationship between serum albumin and WMH. In addition, some human studies have reported an inverse association between serum albumin and cerebrovascular disease. The discrepancy may be related to the difference in range of serum albumin concentrations. While our subjects had serum albumin levels within the normal range, the previous studies mentioned above included subjects with serum albumin levels below the normal range (total levels 3.0–5.7 g/dL, low levels 3.0–3.9 g/dL in 1 study; total levels 2.7–5.5 g/dL, low levels 2.7–4.2 g/dL in the other; and total levels 3.6–5.3 g/dL, low levels 3.6–4.3 g/dL in our study). Therefore, serum albumin level below the normal range may increase cerebrovascular injury, as shown in the previous studies, while low serum albumin within the normal range may have no such effect.

Additional risk indicators for risk refinement — National Lipid Association: The presence of 1 or more listed risk indicators may be considered, in conjunction with major ASCVD risk factors, to reclassify risk. Indicators include a severe disturbance in a major ASCVD risk factor, such as multipack per day smoking or strong family history of premature CHD, and indicators of subclinical disease including coronary artery calcium, with ≥ 300 Agatston units considered high risk or coronary artery calcium of ≥ 75th percentile for age, sex, and ethnicity. Lipid markers include LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL and/or non–HDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL. Inflammation and other markers include high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2.0 mg/L, lipoprotein (a) ≥ 50 mg/dL (protein) using an isoform-insensitive assay, and urine albumin–to–creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g. Because of high intraindividual variability, multiple hs-CRP values should be obtained and hs-CRP should not be tested in those who are ill, have an infection, or are injured; if hs-CRP level is > 10 mg/L, consider other etiologies.

Effects of TBI on Body Weight and Serum Lipid Profile

A total of 74 mice was used in this study. Three of 34 mice (8.82%) assigned to the IR group died after TBI. Mice in the IR group showed a reduced body weight at 2 weeks after irradiation, which recovered by 4 weeks. Mice in the control group showed a gradual increase in body weight and significantly higher increase ratio than those in the IR group (IR group: 2.96 ± 6.47%; control group: 15.5 ± 4.80%; n = 11 each, P < 0.001; Figure 2A). The 2 groups showed no significant differences in serum lipid parameters: total cholesterol, triglyceride, nonesterified fatty acid, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol. Serum albumin level showed no significant differences between the 2 groups, but total protein level was significantly lower in the IR group than in the control group (IR group: 5.48 ± 1.55 g/dL, control group: 8.20 ± 2.02 g/dL, n = 6 each, P < 0.05; Figure 2B).

Hypercoagulability and thrombosis in nephrotic syndrome — venous thromboembolic disease is emphasized as more common in membranous nephropathy, often occurring within the first 6 months and increasing with hypoalbuminemia; unfractionated or low–molecular-weight heparin or warfarin are preferred when thromboembolic risk exceeds bleeding risk, while factor Xa inhibitors are not recommended at this time. The text states this "often occurs within the first 6 months of diagnosis, and at increasing frequency with a serum albumin level of less than 2.9 g/dL". It specifies that "treatment doses of unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin are the preferred agents for treatment or prevention in those felt to have thromboembolic risk greater than bleeding risk". It also notes that "factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors have significant/ moderate albumin binding and are therefore lost in nephrotic urine", and "these popular agents are not recommended at this time".

### Nephrotic syndrome in diabetic kidney disease: an evaluation and update of the definition [^1117LKpt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Nephrotic syndrome is defined as urine total protein excretion greater than 3.5 g/d or total protein-creatinine ratio greater than 3.5 g/g, low serum albumin level, high serum cholesterol level, and peripheral edema. These threshold levels have not been rigorously evaluated in patients with diabetic kidney disease or by using urine albumin excretion, the preferred measure of proteinuria in patients with diabetes.

Study Design

Diagnostic test study.

Setting & Participants

Adults with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and urine total protein level greater than 0.9 g/d enrolled in the Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial.

Index Test

Baseline measures of proteinuria (total protein and albumin excretion and protein-creatinine and albumin-creatinine ratios). Linear regression to relate measures.

Reference Test

Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome at baseline (serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL, serum total cholesterol > 260 mg/dL or use of a statin, and edema or use of a loop diuretic); progression of chronic kidney disease during follow-up (doubling of baseline serum creatinine level or requirement for dialysis or kidney transplantation). Logistic regression to relate index and reference tests.

Results

In 1,608 participants, total urine protein level of 3.5 g/d was equivalent to urine albumin level of 2.2 g/d (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.5). Of 1,467 participants, 641 (44%) had urine total protein level of 3.5 g/d or greater at baseline, 132 (9%) had other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome at baseline, and 385 (26%) had progression of kidney disease during a mean follow-up of 2.6 years. Areas under the receiver operating curves for measures of proteinuria were 0.80 to 0.83 for other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome and 0.72 to 0.74 for kidney disease progression. Threshold levels for nephrotic-range proteinuria and albuminuria were close to the points of maximal accuracy for both outcomes.

Limitations

Study population limits generalizability; inability to adjust for several variables known to affect serum albumin levels; lack of spot urine samples.

Conclusions

The historical definition of nephrotic-range proteinuria appears reasonable in patients with diabetic kidney disease. Equivalent thresholds for nephrotic-range albuminuria and albumin-creatinine ratio are 2.2 g/d and 2.2 g/g, respectively.

With regard to laboratory parameters, decreased eGFR values (51.3 ± 23.2 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. 57.1 ± 24.9 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. 69.2 ± 24.6 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively, p for trend < 0.001) were related to lower SGA scores. Hemoglobin (12.8 ± 1.1 g/dL vs. 13.2 ± 1.4 g/dL vs. 13.7 ± 1.5 g/dL, respectively, p for trend < 0.001) also showed differences according to SGA scores. This trend was seen only in male patients, but not in female patients. Serum total cholesterol, total protein, and albumin levels showed no statistically significant differences by SGA score (Table 1, Fig. 2).

Hypertension showed higher prevalence in lower SGA groups (100, 87.3 and 79.4% respectively, p for trend = 0.011). However there was no statistical difference in liver cyst prevalence among SGA groups (p for trend = 0.16) (Table 1).

When we compared various data between SGA score of 4 and 5 (malnutrition) with 6 and 7 (at risk or well nourished), similar results were obtained (Additional file 1: Table S2).

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115HHZ9u]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Ascites — initial evaluation includes abdominal ultrasonography with Doppler, complete blood count, liver function tests (INR, serum total bilirubin, serum albumin), renal function tests (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen), serum and urine electrolytes (Na, K) and urine analysis with spot urine protein, and ascitic fluid analysis with serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG), total protein concentration, polymorphonuclear leukocyte count, and culture. For ascitic fluid interpretation, a serum albumin ascites gradient < 1.1 g/dL suggests other causes of ascites, while a high ascitic fluid protein (> 2.5 g/dL) supports a cardiac source for ascites; other tests of the ascitic fluid, such as amylase, cytology, or culture for mycobacteria, are not routinely indicated but should be guided by the patient's clinical context.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113LJvTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for minimal change disease, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend to define complete remission as reduction of proteinuria to < 0.3 g/day or protein-to-creatinine ratio < 300 mg/g (or < 30 mg/mmol), stable serum creatinine and serum albumin > 3.5 g/dL (or 35 g/L).

### Hypoalbuminemia and acute kidney injury: a meta-analysis of observational clinical studies [^115wzBfK]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The meta-analysis suggests that determinations of serum albumin may be of value in identifying patients at higher risk for AKI as well as death following the development of AKI. A separate question is whether the demonstrated associations between hypoalbuminemia and AKI and death following AKI development might also provide a rationale for modifying clinical management with the aim of restoring more nearly normal serum albumin levels. That question can only be answered affirmatively if serum albumin contributes to these outcomes causally rather than serving simply as a marker of other pathophysiologic processes.

In the current analysis, hypoalbuminemia effects were potent, since the odds both of AKI and death following AKI were more than doubled. A dose-response relationship was evident in the studies included in the meta-analysis, since those odds progressively increased with each 10 g L⁻¹ decrement in serum albumin. A dose-response relationship was also apparent in a study of 438 cadaver renal transplant recipients. In patients receiving > 0.8 g kg⁻¹ exogenous albumin, the incidence of delayed graft function was reduced and the frequency of graft survival increased compared with those receiving lower albumin doses.

2.5 Recommended Dosage in Adults

The recommended adult daily dosage of TRAVASOL and the nutritional requirements for protein (nitrogen) are shown in Table 1.

As a component of parenteral nutrition, TRAVASOL provides 0.1 g protein/mL, which corresponds to 0.0165 g nitrogen/mL.

As indicated on an individual basis, vitamins, electrolytes, trace elements and other components (including dextrose, electrolytes and lipid emulsion) can be added to the parenteral nutrition solution to meet nutrient needs and prevent deficiencies and complications from developing.

A maximum fluid supply of 40 mL/kg/day of parenteral nutrition solution, based on protein, should not be exceeded in adult patients; this volume does not take carbohydrates or electrolytes into consideration.

The flow rate of the parenteral nutrition solution must be adjusted taking into account the dose being administered, the daily volume intake, and the duration of the infusion. The flow rate should be increased gradually and governed, especially during the first few days of therapy, by the patient's tolerance to dextrose. Daily intake of TRAVASOL and dextrose should be increased gradually to the maximum required dose as indicated by frequent determinations of blood glucose levels.

2.6 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment

Prior to administration, correct severe fluid or electrolyte imbalances. Closely monitor serum electrolyte levels and adjust the volume of parenteral nutrition administered as required [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Patients with renal impairment not needing dialysis require 0.6 to 0.8 g of protein/kg/day. Serum electrolyte levels should be closely monitored. Patients on hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy should receive 1.2 to 1.8 g of protein/kg/day up to a maximum of 2.5 g of protein/kg/day based on nutritional status and estimated protein losses.2

### Impact of nutritional state on lung transplant outcomes [^114rPvGZ]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

When high-risk lung transplant candidates are evaluated, nutritional state is often neglected. We evaluated the prevalence of markers reflecting pre-transplant malnutrition and their association with post-operative complications and death.

Methods

From January 2005 to July 2010, 453 patients underwent primary lung transplantation at our institution. Pre-operative nutrition-related variables, including body mass index and weight/height ratio, reflecting cachexia, and albumin, total protein, immunoglobulins, and absolute lymphocyte count were considered in identifying risk factors for time-related major post-operative complications (renal failure requiring dialysis, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy), pulmonary or bloodstream infections, and death.

Results

Forty-eight patients had BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2), 41 had a weight/height ratio ≤ 0.3, 102 had albumin < 3.5 g/dl, 110 had total protein < 6 g/dl, and 112 had an absolute lymphocyte count < 1,000/μl, indicative of a malnourished state. At 6 months, 30% had experienced pulmonary infection, with lower total serum protein concentration an important risk (p = 0.02). One-year actuarial mortality was 15%; risk factors included lower serum albumin (p = 0.004), particularly when < 3 g/dl. In contrast, variables reflecting nutritional state were not statistically significantly correlated with dialysis, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, or bloodstream infections.

Conclusion

Although malnutrition is uncommon in lung transplant patients, those at extremes of low serum albumin and total protein have worse survival and increased risk of post-operative infection. Strategies to improve nutrition of these high-risk candidates awaiting lung transplantation should be developed.

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^115HFUjh]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

DASH-style dietary patterns and plant proteins — In a randomized controlled feeding study (OmniHeart), all three DASH diet interventions were low in SFA (~6% total dietary energy [TDE]) and used compositions of a higher-carbohydrate diet with 58% TDE from carbohydrate, 27% from fat, and 15% from protein; a higher protein DASH diet where 10% TDE from carbohydrate was replaced with mixed-source protein (~half from plant sources); and a higher unsaturated fat DASH diet where 10% TDE from carbohydrate was replaced with unsaturated fatty acids (8% from MUFAs and 2% from PUFAs). LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels were significantly reduced during all three interventions compared with habitual intake, and meta-analyses indicate that replacing animal with plant proteins (~30 g/day or ~5% of TDE) reduces LDL-C and non-HDL-C concentrations (~7–9 mg/dL, or 4%).

### Grading of severity of the condition in burn patients by serum protein and albumin / globulin studies [^112j9KC5]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Capillary permeability increases after inflammation with consequent leak of fluid, electrolytes, and proteins. The albumin molecule size being smaller (69 kDa) than the globulin molecule (90–156 kDa) will leak relatively at an early stage of the disease (with moderate increase in capillary pore size) than globulin leading to albumin/globulin reversal. In cases with severe permeability changes with rapid progression to larger pore size with simultaneous leak of both albumin and globulin, albumin/globulin reversal will not occur. In this study estimation the serum protein and albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio at frequent intervals was done to grade the severity of the condition of burn patients by assessing the severity of capillary leak. A total of 61 admitted patients (from March 2002 to December 2004) based on the protein values were divided into 3 groups (group 1: 6–8 g/dL, group 2: 5.1–5.9 g/dL, group 3: ≤ 5.0 g/dL), and all the patients who showed change in their protein levels during the study were shifted to appropriate group and were classified as group shifters. The mean survival time and mortality of various groups were compared, and A/G ratio of all the expired cases was analyzed. Group 3 patients showed higher mortality (95%) as compared to that in other groups (group 1 and 2: 0% each and group shifters: 30.2%). Median survival time of group 3 was significantly low as compared to that of group 1 (P < 0.0026), group 2 (P < 0.0006), and group shifters (P < 0.0000). In group shifters the mean time (days) required for shifting from one group to other just before death or discharge in survivors was significantly higher than that in expired cases. Of 26 cases expired during the study, initial A/G ratio at the time of first assigning the group was not reversed in 22 cases (84.6%). The study concluded that the severity (indicated by lower serum protein values) and speed (judged by A/G ratio changes and median survival time analysis) of capillary permeability changes were associated with high mortality, and therefore, it is possible to grade the severity of the condition in burn patients.

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^116ZncKd]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Table 7 — Estimated cumulative low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering with selected nutrition interventions is as follows: replacement of 5% energy from saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with unsaturated fatty acids lowers LDL-C 5% to 10%; 7.5 g/day viscous fiber lowers 6% to 9%; 2 g/day plant sterols/stanols lowers 5% to 8%; 30 g/day plant protein lowers 3% to 5%; and loss of 5% of body weight, if excess adiposity is present, lowers 3% to 5%, with a total expected effect of 22% to 37%. The table notes that cumulative effects are theoretical from separate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and that portfolio-style interventions have shown up to a 30% LDL-C reduction in highly controlled settings with sustained reductions of 12–15% in free-living participants.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in children and adults [^11337Lar]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease — postapheresis targets and thresholds for exchange transfusion emphasize HbS percentage and hemoglobin limits to optimize oxygen delivery while avoiding viscosity-related complications. Evidence suggests that oxygen delivery to the brain in SCD is dependent not only on the total hemoglobin concentration, but also on the percentage of HbS, and the goal of red blood cell exchange with apheresis is to lower HbS while preventing an excessive rise in hemoglobin. Thresholds for postapheresis HbS percentage and hemoglobin level are typically set at 15% to 20% and 10 g/dL, respectively, and the HbS level of 15% to 20% allows a threshold of < 30% HbS to persist for ~4 weeks. When the HbS level is < 20%, the total hemoglobin level can generally be > 10 g/dL, up to ~12 to 13 g/dL, without concern for viscosity-related complications. When the hemoglobin level is < 5.0 g/dL, a simple transfusion to increase the total hemoglobin to ~10.0 g/dL may be required, and generally, red blood cell exchange with apheresis is not recommended for patients with SCD and hemoglobin levels < 5.0 g/dL.
