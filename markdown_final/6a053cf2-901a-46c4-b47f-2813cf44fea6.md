## Question

first line for conjunctivitis in patient wearing contacts

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about first-line management of conjunctivitis in a contact-lens wearer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage for sight-threatening conditions like microbial keratitis, uveitis, or acute glaucoma. Then, I should verify contact lens–specific risks and the need to stop lens wear. Next, I will consider the likely etiologies and whether empiric topical antibiotics are indicated in a contact-lens wearer. After that, I should outline red flags that mandate urgent ophthalmology referral and special pathogens such as gonococcus. Finally, I will review supportive care, hygiene to reduce transmission, contact lens safety counseling, and follow-up intervals, while checking each step against high-credibility guidance.

> Let me first confirm triage priorities because contact-lens wear increases the risk of microbial keratitis, and I need to ensure we are not missing corneal involvement or serious disease features like true photophobia, decreased vision, or severe pain, which should prompt same-day ophthalmology referral and fluorescein staining to look for an epithelial defect or infiltrate [^1128PMbG] [^111pVTYY] [^111qJZ58].

> I should double-check immediate actions for any presumed infectious conjunctivitis in a contact-lens wearer: stop contact lens wear right away, have the patient retain the lenses and case in case cultures are needed, and counsel strictly on hygiene while symptomatic, because contaminated lenses/cases can seed keratitis and perpetuate infection [^112tmSQa] [^1119vtNx] [^1121cnvP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology — most acute conjunctivitis overall is viral, but contact lens wearers have a higher baseline risk for bacterial keratitis and contact lens–related complications, making careful differentiation essential and antibiotic stewardship more nuanced in this group; still, clinical signs alone poorly distinguish viral from bacterial disease, so the history and exam must be systematic and risk-based [^1138Wf4y] [^116ZAFRG] [^112GUufK].

> Now, regarding first-line pharmacotherapy, I initially thought I should delay antibiotics for most mild cases to support stewardship because many cases resolve spontaneously, but wait, in contact-lens wearers the threshold for empiric topical antibiotics is lower due to the risk of Pseudomonas and progression to keratitis; a topical fluoroquinolone is a reasonable first-line choice to shorten illness and reduce bacterial load, while strictly avoiding contact lens use during treatment as per labeling and counseling guidance [^1138Wf4y] [^116vUc9B] [^1119vtNx].

> Let me verify when to escalate care: if there is any corneal staining with an infiltrate, marked photophobia, vision change, a large or central epithelial defect, or worsening symptoms within 24–48 hours, I should arrange urgent ophthalmology evaluation for possible microbial keratitis, culture of lenses/case if indicated, and intensive topical antibiotics per keratitis protocols rather than simple conjunctivitis therapy [^111qJZ58] [^112tmSQa].

> I need to check for hyperacute clues such as copious purulent discharge or concurrent urethritis/cervicitis because gonococcal conjunctivitis requires systemic therapy; if suspected, treat immediately with ceftriaxone 1 g IM and consider inpatient care for severe cases while coordinating ophthalmology follow-up and partner management [^113WmGbR] [^113sQpo8].

> Next, I should review viral conjunctivitis management and transmission counseling; supportive care with hygiene measures to limit spread is key, and I should avoid unnecessary antibiotics because they do not prevent transmission and evidence suggests school or daycare exclusion policies tied to antibiotic use do not reduce spread, so patient education about hand hygiene, avoiding face-touching, and not sharing towels or makeup is essential [^114LJtjF] [^116ReYNy] [^117BvgFT].

> Let me consider allergic or lens-associated papillary disease mimicking conjunctivitis; prominent itching favors allergy, and first-line therapy is a topical antihistamine with mast-cell stabilizing activity, plus cold compresses and lubricants, with cessation of contact lenses during active inflammation and reassessment of lens type/fit once controlled, recognizing lens wear can drive giant papillary changes on the tarsal conjunctiva [^1154NSKo] [^117YCyuQ] [^1112uF8z].

> For symptomatic relief, I should confirm the role of preservative-free artificial tears and cold compresses, and I must remind the patient to remove lenses before any drops and wait before reinsertion because preservatives can bind to soft lenses and irritate the ocular surface, reinforcing the general instruction not to wear lenses during active conjunctivitis [^1152kdUE] [^113PcwuP].

> I will now examine contact-lens hygiene counseling because preventing recurrence and keratitis matters: emphasize no sleeping or napping in lenses, no water exposure (no showering, swimming, or rinsing lenses/cases with tap water), regular case replacement, and adherence to replacement schedules, as poor behaviors dramatically raise infection risk in the lens-wearing population [^117CCeMD] [^11712j4s] [^1121cnvP].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up: for uncomplicated conjunctivitis in a contact-lens wearer started on appropriate therapy, reassess within 24–48 hours to ensure improvement and to promptly detect any evolution toward keratitis; most conjunctivitis can be managed outpatient with robust safety-netting, but systems-level data suggest CL wearers are higher risk and benefit from clear follow-up pathways [^112Gf3Bg] [^115Sj2TW] [^1111wvCj].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic testing approach: routine cultures are not needed in mild cases, but a careful history and exam are mandatory, and I should culture or refer when severe, recurrent, hyperacute, immunocompromised, or unresponsive to initial therapy; in suspected keratitis, detailed lens-wear and hygiene histories are critical to guide management and prevention [^116ZAFRG] [^111qJZ58].

> In summary, first-line management for a contact-lens wearer with conjunctivitis is to stop lens wear immediately, screen for red flags and corneal involvement, initiate a topical fluoroquinolone if bacterial disease is suspected or if risk is high due to lens wear, provide strict hygiene and supportive care, avoid unnecessary antibiotics in clear viral cases, treat gonococcal disease systemically when suspected, and arrange close follow-up with low thresholds for ophthalmology referral while reinforcing evidence-based contact lens safety behaviors to prevent keratitis and recurrence [^1128PMbG] [^1138Wf4y] [^116vUc9B] [^1119vtNx] [^113WmGbR] [^1121cnvP].

First-line management for conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers is **immediate cessation of lens use** [^112tmSQa] and **initiation of a topical fluoroquinolone (e.g. moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin)** due to the higher risk of Pseudomonas and keratitis [^111qJZ58] [^1138Wf4y]. Contact lenses and cases should be **retained for culture**, and patients must be **reassessed within 24–48 hours**. If there is corneal involvement, severe pain, vision changes, or no improvement, **urgent ophthalmology referral is required** [^1128PMbG] [^115y7vo5].

---

## Clinical evaluation and initial management

### Clinical evaluation

During clinical evaluation, **history and examination** should include a detailed contact lens history (type, wear schedule, hygiene, water exposure) [^111qJZ58] and a focused eye exam to distinguish bacterial from viral conjunctivitis [^116ZAFRG] [^1138Wf4y]. Also assess for **red flags** — pain with pupillary constriction, vision changes, or anisocoria — which indicate serious disease and require immediate referral [^1128PMbG] [^111pVTYY].

---

### Initial management steps

Initial management includes **immediate cessation of contact lens wear** [^1119vtNx] to reduce infection risk and allow ocular surface healing [^112tmSQa], and **retention of lenses and cases for culture** [^112tmSQa] for possible microbiological analysis if infection worsens or does not improve.

---

## First-line pharmacological treatment

### Topical fluoroquinolone antibiotics

- **Rationale**: Contact lens wearers are at higher risk for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative pathogens; fluoroquinolones provide broad coverage and penetrate the cornea well.

- **Recommended agents**: Moxifloxacin 0.5% or ciprofloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic drops are first-line due to efficacy against Pseudomonas and common pathogens.

- **Dosage**: Instill one to two drops every 2 hours while awake for the first 24–48 hours, then reduce to four times daily as symptoms improve.

---

### Alternative antibiotics (if fluoroquinolones contraindicated)

When fluoroquinolones are contraindicated, **aminoglycosides** (e.g. tobramycin or gentamicin) are an alternative, though less preferred due to lower corneal penetration and higher toxicity.

---

## Adjunctive and supportive care

- **Lubricating eye drops**: Preservative-free artificial tears can relieve discomfort and dryness [^1152kdUE].

- **Cold compresses**: Apply to reduce inflammation and discomfort [^1112uF8z].

- **Strict hygiene measures**: Emphasize hand hygiene and avoidance of eye rubbing to prevent spread [^114LJtjF] [^116ReYNy].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Arrange **re-evaluation within 24–48 hours** [^1111wvCj] to assess response and check for corneal involvement or keratitis. Apply **criteria for urgent ophthalmology referral** — including corneal involvement, severe pain, vision changes, or lack of improvement — to trigger immediate referral [^1128PMbG].

---

## Patient education and prevention of recurrence

- **Proper contact lens hygiene**: Educate on handwashing, avoiding water exposure, and regular lens/case replacement [^117CCeMD] [^11712j4s].

- **Avoidance of risky behaviors**: Emphasize not sleeping in lenses, not topping off solutions, and not exposing lenses to water [^112GUufK] [^115FVBKt].

- **Regular eye examinations**: Encourage routine eye care to detect and prevent complications [^115PEH7C].

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: Implications for treatment and management [^114DrM7v]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Guidelines and criteria for diagnosing and treating acute infectious conjunctivitis based on natural history and etiology are available. However, greater awareness of and adherence to differential diagnosis should be kept in mind to improve outcomes in patients presenting with suspected acute infectious conjunctivitis.

- **Epidemiology and clinical presentation**: Discriminating features of viral, bacterial, and allergic acute conjunctivitis are summarized in Table 1.

- **Discriminating Clinical Features of Suspected Acute Conjunctivitis**:

	- Adenoviruses are the cause of most (65–90%) cases of viral conjunctivitis, while the herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the cause of 1.3–4.8% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis. Other viruses associated with conjunctivitis include varicella (herpes) zoster virus (VZV) and Molluscum contagiosum.

	- Adenoviruses are nonenveloped viruses that are relatively resistant to disinfection. Adenoviral conjunctivitis is highly contagious, due in part to the capacity of the virus to survive in a desiccated state at room temperature for several weeks. Transmission risk is 10–50%, and the infection may spread via personal contact or indirectly through shared items. Adenoviral conjunctivitis is self-limiting, with improvement of signs and symptoms within 5–14 days. Often, the condition presents as unilateral in early phases and eventually spreads to both eyes.

	- Adenovirus serotypes are associated with different types of ocular infection, including pharyngoconjunctival fever and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), among others.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: Implications for treatment and management [^115HvnCi]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Clinical examination is essential to exclude any potentially serious causes of acute red eye. Historical features for evaluation include pain or photophobia, which can indicate bacterial keratitis, anterior uveitis, or acute angle-closure glaucoma. Associated symptoms, such as upper respiratory tract infection or known exposure to individuals with similar symptoms, suggest a viral form of conjunctivitis. Patient history of ocular trauma should be considered as a potential alternative cause of inflammation. For example, a corneal abrasion resulting from a foreign body or exposure to the sun or ultraviolet light can present as red eye.

Red, painful, and watery eyes due to corneal or conjunctival foreign bodies can mimic both acute and chronic forms of conjunctivitis. The presence of a foreign body is often revealed through patient history and careful biomicroscopic examination. Individuals who wear contact lenses are at an increased risk for corneal involvement and bacterial keratitis; thus, they should be referred to an eye care provider.

Some signs and symptoms of acute infectious conjunctivitis, such as hyperemia, grittiness, and stinging, are mimicked by dry eye disease. Adhering to the triage questions and risk factor analysis recommended by the Tear Film & Ocular Surface Society Dry Eye Workshop II (TFOS DEWS II) aids in excluding dry eye disease, though it may coexist with acute infectious conjunctivitis due to the high prevalence of both conditions. Among the immune-mediated forms of conjunctivitis (e.g. ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid, graft-versus-host disease, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome), thorough evaluation is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management.

### Conjunctivitis: A systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^1138Wf4y]. JAMA (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infectious conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Infectious conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.

- **Pathophysiology**: Viruses account for 80% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis, with most caused by adenoviruses. Other viral causes include HSV, VZV, EBV, influenza, enterovirus, and coxsackievirus. Bacterial conjunctivitis is commonly caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Ophthalmia neonatorum is typically caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. Fungal conjunctivitis is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients.

- **Epidemiology**: It is estimated that approximately 6 million cases of acute conjunctivitis occur annually in the US.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include close contact with infected individuals, poor hand hygiene, use of contaminated contact lenses, and exposure to contaminated water.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, infectious conjunctivitis presents with redness, itching, tearing, discharge, and crusting. Bacterial conjunctivitis often presents with purulent discharge, while viral conjunctivitis usually has a watery discharge and may be associated with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Fungal conjunctivitis may present with chronic, indolent symptoms.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most cases of infectious conjunctivitis are self-limiting, lasting 1–2 weeks. Mild bacterial conjunctivitis typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis [^116vUc9B]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva. Both the palpebral and bulbar ocular conjunctival surfaces are usually affected, resulting in redness and inflammation. Antibiotic therapy is widely used for its treatment. This Cochrane Review was initially published in The Cochrane Library in 1999 and updated in 2006 and 2012.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy in managing acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (including the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) in The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7; MEDLINE (from January 1950 to July 2012); EMBASE (from January 1980 to July 2012); OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe); the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). No date or language restrictions were applied to the electronic searches. The last search of electronic databases was conducted on 18 July 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: We included double-masked randomized controlled trials (RCTs) where any form of antibiotic treatment was compared with placebo/vehicle in managing acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical, systemic, and combination treatments (such as antibiotics and steroids).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors (UN and SM) independently checked and reviewed the data.

### Risk behaviors for contact lens-related eye infections among adults and adolescents - United States, 2016 [^117Ag3mu]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Engaging in risky contact lens behaviors can lead to potentially serious eye infections. Substantial percentages of adults and adolescents reported noncompliance with recommended contact lens storage case and lens replacement schedules. Infrequent contact lens storage case replacement has been associated with microbial keratitis, and lens wearers who do not replace their lenses as often as recommended report more complications and eye discomfort. Not replacing contact lenses and contact lens storage cases as often as recommended increases the risk for contact lens-related eye infections because handling of the contact lenses and storage cases presents the opportunity to introduce microorganisms; in addition, the moist surfaces of the lens and storage case provide an environment favorable to microbial growth.

Exposing contact lenses to water through swimming or showering increases the risk for infection because microorganisms living in water can be transferred to the eye. Even household tap water, although safe for drinking, contains microorganisms that can contaminate lens cases and contact lenses and cause eye infections, especially when not replaced at recommended intervals. Sleeping in contact lenses was another commonly reported risk behavior. Although some soft and rigid contact lenses have Food and Drug Administration approval for overnight wear, sleeping in any type of contact lens increases the risk for eye infections.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, respondents were part of a larger survey that was not specific to contact lens use.

### Over the counter (OTC) artificial tear drops for dry eye syndrome [^1152kdUE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Over the counter (OTC) artificial tears have historically been the first line of treatment for dry eye syndrome and related conditions such as contact lens discomfort. However, little is known about the overall efficacy of individual, commercially available artificial tears. This review provides a much-needed meta-analytical perspective on all randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials that have conducted head-to-head comparisons of OTC artificial tears.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of OTC artificial tear applications in the treatment of dry eye syndrome compared with another class of OTC artificial tears, no treatment, or placebo.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2015, Issue 12), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to December 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to December 2015), and the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch).

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: Implications for treatment and management [^113eJ6MH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Conjunctivitis is a collective term for a diverse group of diseases characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva. The most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis is viral infection (approximately 80% of cases), followed by bacterial infection. Noninfectious forms include allergic, mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic types. Of the noninfectious types, the allergic form is the most common, affecting approximately 40% of the US population. Conjunctivitis can also be classified as acute, chronic, or recurrent, according to the mode of onset and severity of the clinical response. Most cases of viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are considered acute, and less frequently, hyperacute. The mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic forms are typically associated with chronic inflammation. The toxic form can have an acute onset. Allergic conjunctivitis can be chronic, possibly beginning in childhood, and may present with acute exacerbations related to seasonal factors or contact lens use, for example.

Conjunctivitis is a highly common presentation in the primary care setting. It is responsible for approximately 2% of all medical consultations in the United States and countless self-referrals to community pharmacies. Accurately capturing the true epidemiology of conjunctivitis is challenging due to the high numbers of patients who may self-medicate, delay, or decline to seek medical care, and due to inaccurate diagnoses in the primary medical care setting. Approximately 70% of all patients with acute red eye present to primary care and urgent

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: Implications for treatment and management [^117E7fSP]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Challenges of acute infectious conjunctivitis management and diagnosis: Eye care professionals tend to evaluate acute infectious conjunctivitis cases at secondary care visits. Patients with infectious conjunctivitis are suboptimally managed in primary care due to an underappreciation of the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis, as well as frequent antibiotic prescriptions (approximately 80%) for infectious conjunctivitis despite guidelines that discourage antibiotic use for minor self-limiting illnesses. Antibiotic prescription is a measure of presumed diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis, but the rate of clinical accuracy in diagnosing viral conjunctivitis may be less than 50%. Observational evidence indicates that laboratory confirmation isolates bacterial pathogens in just 30–50% of suspected cases.

Misdiagnoses expose patients to unnecessary and ineffective antibiotic treatment. In the Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring in Ocular Microorganisms (ARMOR) surveillance study of 3,237 ocular isolates collected from patients with bacterial eye infections (from 72 US centers from 2009 to 2013), nearly one-half had methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Although the contribution of topical antibiotics to antibiotic resistance is not easily confirmed, resistance trends should be considered before treating common eye infections with antibiotics. Furthermore, prescribing antibiotics in cases of unconfirmed bacterial infection is not compliant with Antibiotic Stewardship initiatives, which are part of primary care and pediatric practice protocols. In addition to the risk of antibiotic resistance, misdiagnoses can lead to ineffective treatment strategies.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: Implications for treatment and management [^112Hw1t1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Approximately 32% of acute infectious conjunctivitis cases are caused by bacteria, according to an evaluation of the prevalence of positive bacterial culture in adult patients who presented to their general practitioner with a red eye and either (muco)purulent discharge or glued eyelids. Bacterial conjunctivitis is typically unilateral but can sometimes affect both eyes. The staphylococcal species are the most common pathogens for bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. In children, the bacterial disease is responsible for 50–75% of conjunctivitis cases, often caused by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. The hyperacute form of bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis.

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by a rapid onset of conjunctival redness and mucopurulent discharge. Symptoms may also include burning and itching, though these are less common. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is self-limiting, resolving within 7–10 days. Use of broad-spectrum topical antibiotics should be delayed, and no evidence demonstrates the superiority of any topical antibiotic agent. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) conjunctivitis is the cause of an estimated 3–64% of ocular staphylococcal infections and requires management by an ophthalmologist with antibiotics that are active against MRSA, such as besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension.

### Conjunctivitis (bacterial) [^116E3SJr]. COP (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for infectious conjunctivitis, specifically in relation to topical antibiotics, the CO 2023 guidelines recommend considering the offer of topical antibiotics. This approach may modestly improve short-term clinical remission and reduce the patient's infectiousness to others. It is important, however, to balance the potential benefit of antibiotics against the risk of antibiotic resistance.

### Evaluation of perfluorohexyloctane eyedrops in habitual contact lens wearers [^11454pSj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

- **Study design**: This open-label, double-arm, 4-week trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT06176651) involved no control and no randomization. Conducted at a single site in La Jolla, CA, from October 2023 to March 2024, the study comprised three visits: a screening and two follow-up visits at weeks 1 and 4. It included 47 adjusted contact lens wearers with a best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better at distance. All participants were healthy contact lens wearers with no dry eye symptoms and were divided into two groups based on their contact lenses being either daily disposables or reusable. Participants were instructed to instill one drop of PFHO into each eye four times a day, ensuring lenses were removed before each installation. They waited at least 30 minutes before reinserting contact lenses after instilling PFHO.

- **Study guidelines and approvals**: The trial was conducted following the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial protocol received approval from the Salus Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided written informed consent before any trial-related procedures were initiated.

- **Patients**: Participants were ≥ 18 years old with a history of soft contact lens usage for at least 60 days and a best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better in both eyes. Exclusion criteria included non-contact lens wearers, previous use or known allergy to PFHO, and any corneal abnormality.

### Contact lens wearer demographics and risk behaviors for contact lens-related eye infections — United States, 2014 [^117TAK4r]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Daily disposable contact lens wearers might have a lower risk for infection if they dispose of their lenses daily as recommended. Although 40% of daily disposable contact lens wearers did not use a case, thereby avoiding potential contamination associated with the case, a large proportion did use a case improperly, such as using tap water to store their lenses.

The number of contact lens wearers in the United States presented here is higher than previous estimates. Another study estimated 38 million contact lens wearers, although the data collection methods were not described. A more recent study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and estimated that 18.6 million persons aged ≥ 12 years wore contact lenses. However, the NHANES protocol used a more restrictive definition for contact lens wearers, which might have underestimated the total number of contact lens wearers in the United States. The demographic patterns observed in the population used for the estimate reported here were similar to the NHANES population. However, the estimate reported here, based on self-reported contact lens use, is a more inclusive estimate. Contact lens wearers are younger on average than non-contact lens wearers. Teens and college-age persons (those aged 15–25 years) have been associated with lower contact lens compliance and higher risk for corneal inflammatory events, a category of eye problems that includes serious eye infections.

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First…

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern® [^112Gf3Bg]. Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of infectious conjunctivitis, particularly in the context of the setting of care, AAO 2019 guidelines recommend managing most patients with conjunctivitis in an outpatient setting.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern® [^111qJZ58]. Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bacterial keratitis, specifically with respect to history and physical examination, the AAO 2019 guidelines recommend eliciting a detailed history in patients with suspected bacterial keratitis, including:

- **Ocular symptoms**: Degree of pain, redness, discharge, blurred vision, and photophobia. Duration of symptoms. Circumstances surrounding the onset of symptoms.

- **Contact lens history**: Wearing schedule, overnight wear. Type of contact lens, contact lens solution. Contact lens hygiene protocol, tap-water rinsing of contact lenses. Swimming, using a hot tub, or showering while wearing contact lenses. Method of purchase, such as over the Internet. Decorative contact lens use.

- **Review of ocular history**: HSV keratitis. VZV keratitis. Previous bacterial keratitis. Eye trauma. Dry eye. Previous ocular surgery, including refractive and facial (including laser cosmetic) surgery.

- **Review of other medical issues**: Immune status. Systemic medications. History of MRSA or other multidrug-resistant infections.

- **Medication history**: Recently used ocular medications. Medication allergies.

### Bacterial conjunctivitis [^116sHGce]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

What is the best treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis? Topical antibiotics expedite recovery from bacterial conjunctivitis. The choice of antibiotic usually does not affect the outcome.

- **Implementation**: Recognition of key distinguishing features of bacterial conjunctivitis can be crucial. Pitfalls can be recognized in the history and physical examination, guiding the choice of antibiotic and determining when to refer for specialist treatment.

### Topical corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy for bacterial keratitis [^115gRY47]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular infectious disease that can lead to severe visual disability. Risk factors for bacterial corneal infection include contact lens wear, ocular surface disease, corneal trauma, and previous ocular or eyelid surgery. Topical antibiotics constitute the mainstay of treatment in cases of bacterial keratitis, whereas the use of topical corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy to antibiotics remains controversial. Topical corticosteroids are usually used to control inflammation using the smallest amount of the drug. Their use requires optimal timing, concomitant antibiotics, and careful follow-up.

- **Objectives**: The objective of the review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy for bacterial keratitis. Secondary objectives included evaluation of health economic outcomes and quality of life outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to July 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com).

### Prolonging contact lens wear and making contact lens wear safer [^113V7tBq]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to summarize the present status of safety and efficacy of contact lens wear.

- **Design**: The research involves a literature review.

- **Methods**: Ovid Medline searches were performed on records from 1966 through 2005 using keywords such as keratitis, contact lens complications, extended-wear contact lenses, and silicone-hydrogel contact lenses.

- **Results**: Patients desire comfort, clarity of vision, and prolonged contact lens wear when contact lenses are used to correct refractive error. Practitioners seek patient satisfaction but also require maintenance of the integrity of the eye and prevention of complications that could jeopardize vision or the eye's health. Improvements in the oxygen permeability of contact lens materials, design, surface, and maintenance solutions have reduced but not eliminated the risks of infection, inflammation, and conjunctival papillary reaction associated with contact lens wear. Historical lessons suggest that patient education and practitioner involvement in managing contact lens wear remain critical for patient satisfaction and safety in extended contact lens wear.

- **Conclusions**: The availability of highly oxygen-permeable contact lenses has increased the tolerance and safety of extended contact lens wear. Nonetheless, patient instruction and education in the proper use and care of lenses are required, and caution is advised.

### Improving the management of patients with acute red eyes in a large London emergency department [^115Sj2TW]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A search in BMJ Quality Improvement Reports for "contact lens" or "conjunctivitis" revealed no results, suggesting that this is a poorly researched area. Similarly, there were no corresponding quality improvement projects found when searched via PubMed or Google.

Our aims were two-fold. Firstly, we wanted to improve the safety of patients presenting to the ED with "red eye(s)", especially CL wearers, by improving the quality of the medical assessment they receive, along with their initial management and safety net or follow-up plans. Secondly, we hoped to improve patient flow within the ED by creating easier access to ophthalmology specialists throughout the day and by devising guidance about when to refer, saving time in clinical decision-making by not needing to seek senior ED advice before making referrals.

### Bimatoprost [^113PcwuP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Advise patients to seek physician advice immediately if they develop a new ocular condition, such as trauma or infection, experience a sudden decrease in visual acuity, undergo ocular surgery, or develop any ocular reactions, particularly conjunctivitis and eyelid reactions, concerning the continued use of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution. Patients using IOP-lowering medications should consult their physician before using bimatoprost ophthalmic solution.

Inform patients that bimatoprost ophthalmic solution contains benzalkonium chloride, which may be absorbed by and cause discoloration of soft contact lenses. Contact lenses should be removed prior to applying bimatoprost ophthalmic solution and may be reinserted 15 minutes after administration.

Read the patient information leaflet that comes with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution before starting use and each time you refill your prescription to check for any new information. This leaflet does not replace discussions with your physician about your treatment.

### Evaluation of perfluorohexyloctane eyedrops in habitual contact lens wearers [^114Kw89N]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye disease is one of the most common disorders encountered in practice today. Perfluorohexyloctane (PFHO) ophthalmic solution (MIEBO®) (©Bausch + Lomb) is a novel, non-aqueous, single entity, preservative-free ophthalmic drop recently approved by the FDA for treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.

- **Purpose**: While the safety and efficacy of PFHO have been demonstrated in non-contact lens wearers, its safety and potential benefits in habitual contact lens wearers have not been explored. This report presents the results of a trial designed to evaluate the safety of PFHO and its effect on contact lens comfort, specifically in established contact lens wearers.

- **Patients and methods**: The study included 47 patients who were adjusted contact lens wearers with a best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better at distance. All the patients were healthy contact lens wearers with no dry eye symptoms.

- **Results**: A significant improvement in comfort scoring was observed without any significant changes in osmolarity, meibography scores, and total fluorescein staining.

- **Conclusion**: These findings suggest that PFHO is safe for contact lens wearers to use and shows promise to reduce contact lens dropout.

### Safety and efficacy of lifitegrast 5% ophthalmic solution in contact lens discomfort [^1153uHqR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Symptoms of dryness remain a problem for contact lens wearers, and the management of contact lens discomfort (CLD) remains a challenge in the contact lens industry and for practitioners involved in clinical contact lens practice alike. A report by the International Workshop on CLD, organized by the Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society (TFOS) and published in Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science, volume 54, No. 11, October 2013, defined and extensively discussed the multiple aspects of this topic. The paper noted the role of inflammation as one of the many probable causes of CLD.

Research studies on silicone hydrogel contact lens (SHCL) design, polymer technology, and SHCL products aim to develop a combination of properties that minimize the impact on eye health and maximize wearing comfort. Modifications in design, polymers, cleaning and disinfecting products, and coatings aim to extend lens wear and comfort to improve user contact lens wearing experience (CLWE). The product design adjusts and accounts for the interaction of the lens and ocular surface, balancing both mechanical and physiological effects on the eye. Despite all this knowledge and developments in contact lens technology, the symptom of dryness-related discomfort has still been shown to be the predominant reason for discontinuation of contact lens wear and frustration in both patients and clinicians.

### Lubricating drops for contact lens discomfort in adults [^111XYtE5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Contact lens discomfort is a symptom-based clinical diagnosis that affects 13% to 75% of contact lens wearers. The Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society defines contact lens discomfort as "a condition characterized by episodic or persistent adverse ocular sensations related to lens wear either with or without visual disturbance, resulting from reduced compatibility between the lens and ocular environment, which can lead to decreased wearing time and discontinuation from lens wear". Signs of the condition include conjunctival hyperemia, corneal and conjunctival staining, altered blinking patterns, lid wiper epitheliopathy, and meibomian gland dysfunction. Eye care specialists often treat contact lens discomfort with lubricating drops, including saline, although there is no clear evidence showing this treatment is effective and safe.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lubricating drops for ocular discomfort associated with contact lens wear in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register), MEDLINE, Embase.com, two other databases, and two trials registries to May 2024, without date or language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated lubricating drops, including saline, versus no treatment, or that evaluated lubricating drops versus saline, in adult contact lens wearers. We included studies regardless of publication status, language, or year of publication.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We applied standard Cochrane methods for data collection and analysis.

### Contact lens wearer demographics and risk behaviors for contact lens-related eye infections — United States, 2014 [^117CCeMD]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Contact lenses provide safe and effective vision correction for many Americans. However, contact lens wearers risk infection if they fail to wear, clean, disinfect, and store their contact lenses as directed. Over the past decade, the CDC has investigated several multistate outbreaks of serious eye infections among contact lens wearers, including Acanthamoeba keratitis. Each investigation identified frequent contact lens hygiene-related risk behaviors among patients.

To guide prevention efforts, a population-based survey was used to estimate the number of contact lens wearers aged ≥ 18 years in the United States. A separate online survey of contact lens wearers assessed the prevalence of contact lens hygiene-related risk behaviors. Approximately 99% of wearers reported at least one contact lens hygiene risk behavior. Nearly one-third of contact lens wearers reported having experienced a previous contact lens-related red or painful eye requiring a doctor's visit. An estimated 40.9 million U.S. adults wear contact lenses, and many could be at risk for serious eye infections because of poor contact lens wear and care behaviors.

These findings have informed the creation of targeted prevention messages aimed at contact lens wearers, such as keeping all water away from contact lenses, discarding used disinfecting solution from the case, cleaning with fresh solution each day, and replacing their contact lens case every 3 months.

### Determining the information needs of contact lens wearers for better education and more support: a qualitative study [^114v5nSm]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

Use of contact lenses (CL) has increased tremendously over the years for a wide range of applications, including vision correction, management of corneal disorders, and cosmetics. Approximately 150 million people worldwide use CLs to correct refractive errors such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism as an alternative to spectacles. They are also a main therapeutic option in cases such as aphakia, keratoconus, irregular cornea, and high anisometropia, which glasses cannot help, or conditions such as ocular surface problems that need specialized lenses for their management.

Despite the advantages of using CLs, adverse reactions of varying severities may occur, ranging from clinically inconsequential to potentially vision-threatening. Discomfort, corneal staining, dryness, microbial keratitis, corneal neovascularization, allergic conjunctivitis, and corneal infection are the main complications limiting the success of CLs, which may eventually lead to discontinuation. One study showed that 6% of contact lens wearers (CLWs) experience a complication each year, and another study in the U.S. reported that one-third of CLWs had a CL-related condition requiring a physician's visit.

Most CL-related complications occur due to noncompliance with recommendations and CL care, including improper cleaning and disinfection, using the CL for more than the recommended period, incorrect use of cleaning solution, and inadequate handwashing. To ensure proper CL care and maintenance, CLWs need adequate knowledge and awareness to minimize or prevent complications.

### Management of ocular allergy itch with an antihistamine-releasing contact lens [^115eNYPN]. Cornea (2019). Low credibility.

Ocular allergy is a pervasive condition that affects up to 20% of the US population, with a similar prevalence worldwide. Allergic conjunctivitis (AC), the most common type of ocular allergy, is clinically defined as an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity response to the exposure of the ocular surface to one or more allergens, including tree or grass pollens, pet dander, or dust mite dander. The impact of AC on overall health and quality of life is consistently underestimated, and although not typically sight-threatening, AC and related conditions underlie significant loss in patient productivity and quality of life.

Patients who wear contact lenses (CLs) are particularly impacted by AC. For daily wear CL users, it creates a higher threshold for effective hygiene to minimize allergen accumulation on lenses. Furthermore, because the primary symptom of AC is itch, patients who naturally (and often, unconsciously) respond to ocular itch with eye-rubbing cause an exacerbation of their allergic symptoms and risk damage to both their ocular surface and their lenses. Often, patients who prefer CL use for refractive correction revert to spectacle use during allergy season to avoid these complications.

Currently available antiallergic medications are generally compatible with CL use but require that lenses be removed before topical drug application. This is in part because of concerns regarding interactions between lenses and drop preservatives and also because clinical studies of allergy drops have typically excluded CL users from study populations.

### Treatment of dry eye disease [^116sEVJe]. The Consultant Pharmacist (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dry eye disease:

- **Definition**: DED, also known as dry eye syndrome or keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a chronic, multifactorial condition characterized by a deficiency in tear production or excessive evaporation, leading to ocular surface inflammation and discomfort.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of DED involves two main mechanisms: aqueous tear deficiency and evaporative dry eye. Aqueous tear deficiency is due to decreased tear production, often associated with age, autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren's syndrome, or certain medications. Evaporative dry eye is primarily due to meibomian gland dysfunction, resulting in an unstable tear film and increased tear evaporation.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of DED varies widely globally, depending on the geographic region and the diagnostic criteria used, ranging from 5% to 50%. In the US, the prevalence of DED in adults is estimated at 5–7%, with rates 2–3 times higher in females.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for DED include older age, female sex, contact lens wear, screen time, environmental factors such as pollution and low humidity, hormonal changes such as menopause, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome, and certain medications, including antihistamines, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and some antihypertensives.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of DED is characterized by symptoms of ocular discomfort, irritation, pain, foreign body sensation, burning, and visual disturbances. Signs of DED include conjunctival injection.

### Investigation of delefilcon A contact lenses for symptomatic daily disposable contact lens wearers with dry eye disease: A prospective comparative study [^115JHWdh]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

This prospective comparative study aimed to assess the effects on contact lens comfort, dryness, and wear time when symptomatic daily disposable (DD) contact lens (CL) wearers were refit with delefilcon A (DT1) lenses.

Thirty-five symptomatic DD CL wearers with dry eye disease, as determined according to the TFOS DEWS 2 guidelines, were enrolled and completed the study. Participants wore their habitual DD CLs during an initial assessment and were subsequently refit with DT1 for 1 month. Participants were masked to the study lens type. Subjective ratings of end-of-day comfort and dryness, average wear time, and comfortable wear time were evaluated as primary endpoints.

Of the 35 participants, two were classified as having aqueous deficient dry eye, while the remaining participants exhibited symptoms primarily due to evaporative causes. The median CLDEQ-8 score for dryness significantly improved from 17 (fair) with habitual lenses to 13 (good) with DT1 lenses (p < 0.01). Participants reported significantly better end-of-day comfort (p = 0.01) and less end-of-day dryness (p = 0.01) with DT1 compared to their habitual DD lenses. The comfortable wear time was significantly longer with DT1 (8.5 ± 4.1 hours) compared to habitual DD lenses (6.7 ± 3.2 hours) (p = 0.04). No significant differences were observed in vision ratings (p = 0.07).

Refitting symptomatic DD CL wearers with DT1 resulted in improved end-of-day comfort, reduced end-of-day dryness, and extended comfortable wear time compared to their habitual lenses.

### Risk behaviors for contact lens-related eye infections among adults and adolescents - United States, 2016 [^111nRnis]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Adolescent contact lens wearers reported engaging in some healthier contact lens hygiene behaviors than their adult counterparts, yet there is still room for improvement to prevent potentially serious outcomes, including blindness. Prevention efforts should focus on encouraging contact lens wearers to replace their contact lens storage case regularly and to avoid sleeping or napping in contact lenses. There are insufficient data regarding the appropriate frequency of lens case and contact lens replacement, but contact lens wearers who do not follow recommended lens replacement schedules experience more complications and self-reported discomfort than those who adhere to the recommendations.

Existing health communication strategies known to influence behavior change in adolescents (e.g. appeals to vanity and social norms marketing) can be applied to communication efforts focusing on contact lens hygiene behaviors in this population. Additionally, encouraging adolescents to adopt healthy contact lens wear and care habits early might help them maintain these habits into young adulthood when the frequency of reported risk behaviors increases. Prevention messages targeting young adults can be shaped around the lifestyle changes known to occur in this population.

### Contact lens health week - August 19–23, 2019 [^115PEH7C]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

August 19–23, 2019, marks the sixth annual Contact Lens Health Week. In collaboration with partners from clinical, public health, industry, and regulatory sectors, the CDC is promoting healthy contact lens wear and care practices to reduce the risk of eye infections among the approximately 45 million people in the United States who wear contact lenses. Studies conducted following outbreaks of rare but serious eye infections in the United States have found that these infections occur most frequently in contact lens wearers who do not take proper care of their contact lenses, indicating a need to promote safer wear and care practices.

A report in this issue of MMWR reviews the provision and receipt of contact lens wear and care recommendations among providers and patients in the United States. One-third of lens wearers recalled never hearing any lens care recommendations, while most eye care providers reported sharing recommendations always or most of the time. Developing effective health communication messages can help eye care providers communicate with their patients. Practicing proper contact lens hygiene and regularly visiting an eye care provider are important actions for keeping contact lens wearers' eyes healthy.

Additional information on Contact Lens Health Week and the proper wear and care of contact lenses is available.

### Contact lens wearer demographics and risk behaviors for contact lens-related eye infections — United States, 2014 [^11712j4s]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

An estimated one in six adults in the United States wears contact lenses, and one-third of them report at least one health care visit for a red or painful eye while wearing lenses. Approximately 99% of contact lens wearers reported at least one risk behavior ever for eye infections or inflammation. Of particular concern, contact lens wearers of all types frequently reported exposure of their contact lenses to water, including storing or rinsing their lenses in tap water and showering or swimming while wearing lenses. Exposure of lenses to water raises the risk for infection because microorganisms living in water can be transferred to the eye. Even household tap water, although treated to be safe for drinking, is not sterile and contains microorganisms that can contaminate lens cases and contact lenses and cause eye infections.

Sleeping in contact lenses was a frequently reported behavior. Although many soft and some rigid contact lenses have U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved indications for overnight wear, sleeping in any type of contact lens increases the risk for eye infection, although the precise mechanism is not known. Noncompliance with recommended lens and case replacement schedules was also commonly reported. Infrequent replacement of contact lens cases has been linked to serious eye infections. Additionally, contact lens wearers who do not follow recommended contact lens replacement schedules have more complications and eye discomfort. These behaviors raise the risk for eye infections because repeated handling of the lens and case provides opportunities for contamination.

### Diagnosis and management of red eye in primary care [^115y7vo5]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Red eye is the cardinal sign of ocular inflammation and is usually benign, allowing management by primary care physicians. Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye. Other frequent causes include blepharitis, corneal abrasion, foreign body, subconjunctival hemorrhage, keratitis, iritis, glaucoma, chemical burns, and scleritis.

Signs and symptoms of red eye include eye discharge, redness, pain, photophobia, itching, and visual changes. Viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are generally self-limiting, with serious complications being rare. Due to the lack of specific diagnostic tests to differentiate viral from bacterial conjunctivitis, most cases are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Conjunctivitis can also be caused by allergies or irritants. A detailed patient history and careful eye examination can diagnose the cause of red eye, with treatment based on the underlying etiology.

Recognizing the need for emergent referral to an ophthalmologist is crucial in the primary care management of red eye. Referral is necessary when there is severe pain unrelieved by topical anesthetics, a requirement for topical steroids, or in cases of vision loss, copious purulent discharge, corneal involvement, traumatic eye injury, recent ocular surgery, distorted pupil, herpes infection, or reinfections.

### Contact lens wearer demographics and risk behaviors for contact lens-related eye infections — United States, 2014 [^112tFDfA]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Approximately 1,000 contact lens wearers completed the Contact Lens Risk Survey. Respondents were mostly female (82%) and aged ≥ 40 years (62%). Approximately 99% of respondents reported at least one contact lens hygiene behavior previously associated with an increased risk for eye infection or inflammation.

- **Risk behaviors**: Half or more of wearers reported ever sleeping overnight in contact lenses (50.2%), ever napping in contact lenses (87.1%), ever topping off disinfecting solution (adding new solution to existing solution in the contact lens case instead of emptying and cleaning the case before adding new solution, 55.1%), extending the recommended replacement frequency of lenses (49.9%) or cases (82.3%), and ever showering (84.9%) or swimming (61.0%) in contact lenses.

Approximately one third (35.5%) of contact lens wearers reported ever rinsing their lenses in tap water, and 16.8% reported ever storing their lenses in tap water. Almost all rigid wearers (91.3%) reported ever rinsing their lenses in water, and 33.3% reported ever storing their lenses in tap water. Nearly one third of all wearers reported ever having experienced a contact lens-related red or painful eye that required a doctor's visit.

### Increased eotaxin in tears of patients wearing contact lenses [^115JkM58]. Cornea (2004). Low credibility.

Giant papillary conjunctivitis in patients wearing contact lenses occurs after intolerance and/or allergy to contact lenses. Eotaxin is a CC chemokine with a potent and specific chemotactic effect for eosinophils, which are involved in allergies. The purpose of this study is to measure the eotaxin levels in the tears of patients wearing contact lenses and in normal subjects, and to correlate these levels with the grade of giant papillary conjunctivitis.

- **Methods**: Around 10 microL of tears were collected using glass capillaries from 16 patients wearing contact lenses and 10 normal volunteers. Giant papillary conjunctivitis was graded from 0 to 4 using standard slit-lamp photographs of the superior tarsal conjunctiva. Eotaxin concentration in tears was measured by ELISA using mouse anti-human eotaxin monoclonal antibodies. The paired Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test was used for statistical analysis of the results.

- **Results**: The mean concentration of eotaxin was 2698 ± 233 (SEM) pg/mL in patients wearing contact lenses and 1498 ± 139 pg/mL in normal subjects. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.0004). The mean score of papilla grade was 1.75 ± 0.19 in patients wearing contact lenses and 0.2 ± 0.13 in normal subjects (P < 0.0001). Papilla grade was correlated to the eotaxin level in tears (R² = 0.6562 and P < 0.0001).

- **Conclusion**: An increase in eotaxin levels in tears was measured in patients wearing contact lenses. Eotaxin levels correlated with the severity of giant papillary conjunctivitis. These data suggest that eotaxin could play a role in the development or exacerbation of giant papillary conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers.

### Conjunctivitis: A systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^115mqPVn]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

Conjunctivitis is a common problem. The objective of this review is to examine the diagnosis, management, and treatment of conjunctivitis, including various antibiotics and alternatives to antibiotic use in infectious conjunctivitis, as well as the use of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers in allergic conjunctivitis.

- **Evidence review**: A search of the literature published through March 2013 was performed using PubMed, the ISI Web of Knowledge database, and the Cochrane Library. Eligible articles were selected after reviewing titles, abstracts, and references.

- **Findings**: Viral conjunctivitis is the most common overall cause of infectious conjunctivitis and usually does not require treatment; the signs and symptoms at presentation are variable. Bacterial conjunctivitis is the second most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis, with most uncomplicated cases resolving in 1 to 2 weeks. Mattering and adherence of the eyelids on waking, lack of itching, and absence of a history of conjunctivitis are the strongest factors associated with bacterial conjunctivitis. Topical antibiotics decrease the duration of bacterial conjunctivitis and allow earlier return to school or work. Conjunctivitis secondary to sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, requires systemic treatment in addition to topical antibiotic therapy. Allergic conjunctivitis is encountered in up to 40% of the population, but only a small proportion of these individuals seek medical help. Itching is the most consistent sign in allergic conjunctivitis, and treatment consists of topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers.

### Retrospective analysis on the outcomes of contact lens-associated keratitis in a tertiary centre: An evidence-based management protocol to optimise resource allocation [^1111wvCj]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

All patients who attended the Eye Casualty at Moorfields Eye Unit, St. Georges Hospital, London, with a primary diagnosis of CLAK between 1 July 2021 and 28 February 2022 (8 months) were included in the study. The exclusion criteria were a primary diagnosis other than CLAK and a lack of or indeterminate primary diagnosis.

- **Data collection**: In our retrospective cohort study, data were collected from the local electronic patient record (OpenEyes) to identify patients with CLAK. A query targeting the keywords "Contact Lens", "Keratitis", and "Ulcer" in patient notes was generated during the aforementioned time period. Patients who met this criterion had their notes manually screened to determine the nature of their presentation. The following data were collected from patients meeting the inclusion criteria in the following categories:

- **Patient demographics**: Age, sex, ethnicity, and ocular history.

- **Diagnosis and follow-up**: Dates of diagnosis and follow-ups, corneal scrape and PCR if performed, culture results, and outcomes of follow-up visits.

- **CLAK features**: Visual acuity (VA) (LogMAR), laterality, size of epithelial defect(s) (ED), size of infiltrate(s), anterior chamber inflammation (cells or flare), corneal oedema, presence of blepharitis, and any other pertinent features.

- **CLAK risk factors**: Previous CLAK diagnosis, use of extended wear CL, duration of wear, history of sleeping, showering, and swimming in CL, presence of blepharitis, and presence of punctate epithelial erosions.

- **Treatment**: Medication prescribed, length of courses, and any changes over the course of treatment were documented.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: Implications for treatment and management [^117SpSi8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis can be difficult. Clinical ambiguity exists between the acute viral and bacterial forms, as well as the allergic form, which can confound diagnosis. Moreover, distinguishing between viral or bacterial origins of infectious conjunctivitis based on historical, nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms contributes to a high rate of misdiagnosis and the overuse of antibiotic treatment. Therefore, to effectively treat acute infectious conjunctivitis, physicians must be aware of the clinical signs and symptoms and utilize available diagnostic tests that can provide a more accurate differential diagnosis.

### Contact lens health week - August 19–23, 2019 [^112PtvHT]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

August 19–23, 2019, marks the sixth annual Contact Lens Health Week. In collaboration with partners from clinical, public health, industry, and regulatory sectors, the CDC is promoting healthy contact lens wear and care practices to reduce the risk of eye infections among the approximately 45 million persons in the United States who wear contact lenses. Studies conducted following outbreaks of rare but serious eye infections in the United States have found that these infections occur most frequently in contact lens wearers who do not take proper care of their contact lenses, indicating a need to promote safer wear and care practices.

### Consensus document on allergic conjunctivitis (DECA) [^112mMCQo]. Journal of Investigational Allergology & Clinical Immunology (2015). High credibility.

The DECA criteria is a clinical calculator used for the suspicion of allergic conjunctivitis. DECA stands for Discomfort, Eosinophils, Conjunctival hyperemia, and Antigen exposure. This scoring system applies to patients presenting with eye discomfort, particularly those with a history of allergies or exposure to potential allergens.

The clinical utility of the DECA criteria is to aid in the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis, a common eye condition characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva due to allergic reactions. It helps clinicians differentiate allergic conjunctivitis from other types of conjunctivitis, such as bacterial or viral, based on the presence of specific signs and symptoms.

Exclusion criteria for the use of the DECA criteria may include patients with other known eye conditions or infections, those with a history of eye surgery or trauma, and those who do not have a history of allergies or exposure to allergens. It's also important to note that the DECA criteria should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive clinical assessment and not as a standalone diagnostic tool.

This tool evaluates the possibility of allergic conjunctivitis by considering seven factors related to eye and allergy symptoms. Each factor is assigned a specific score when the symptom is present, and the total score aids in determining whether the criteria for suspicion of allergic conjunctivitis are met.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: Implications for treatment and management [^112Q6fN6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Chlamydia is the cause of 1.8–5.6% of all acute conjunctivitis cases. Chlamydial conjunctivitis primarily presents unilaterally with congenital infection and is characterized by conjunctival redness, lymphoid follicle formation, or mild purulent discharge. A distinctive sign of this infection in adults is bulbar conjunctival follicles, which are absent in neonates and infants. Chlamydial conjunctivitis typically spreads through sexual contact. Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with 1,708,569 cases reported in 2017. From 2013 to 2017, the number of reported chlamydia cases in the United States increased by 22%. In neonates, the eyes can be infected after vaginal delivery by infected mothers. Treatment includes oral azithromycin or oral doxycycline in adults, and erythromycin in neonates.

- **Allergic conjunctivitis**: Most cases of allergic conjunctivitis are attributable to seasonal allergies and present with bilateral symptoms. Mild to severe itching and redness are key symptoms, often accompanied by watery or mucoid discharge. Treatment includes supportive measures such as cold compresses and artificial tears, as well as topical or oral antihistamines and mast cell inhibitors. A short course of topical corticosteroids can be used in select cases, provided corneal involvement and herpetic infection have been ruled out, as both conditions could worsen with steroid use.

- **Differential diagnosis**: To satisfy the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines, the treatment of conjunctivitis must be directed.

Medication history will also be informative. For example, anticoagulants are associated with subconjunctival hemorrhage, and topiramate is associated with angle-closure glaucoma. Patients requiring steroids may be at risk of more severe disease or other pathology, and referral to an eye care provider is recommended. The clinical examination should also include an assessment of the lymph nodes (swollen submandibular and preauricular lymph nodes). Lymphadenopathy, such as an enlarged, tender preauricular lymph node, is more common in viral versus bacterial conjunctivitis.

The physical eye examination should inspect for visual acuity, discharge type, corneal opacity, abnormal pupil size or shape, eyelid swelling, and orbit protrusion or asymmetry. Referral to an ophthalmologist or eye care professional should be performed immediately for cases that involve visual loss, moderate to severe pain, severe purulent discharge, or any corneal involvement. Useful information can be obtained with a simple penlight in the absence of a slit lamp, especially as it pertains to the measurement of the anterior chamber depth and the ruling out of angle closure. Viral conjunctivitis can vary in presentation, but tearing, clear to white discharge, redness, and bilaterality are very common. Viral conjunctivitis usually starts with one eye, with the second eye to follow within a few days. Bacterial conjunctivitis is strongly suggested by glued eyelids, lack of itching, and lack of history of conjunctivitis. A diagnostic index for bacterial conjunctivitis by van Weert et al. suggests that younger adult patients are more prone to this condition.

### Estimate of the direct and indirect annual cost of bacterial conjunctivitis in the United States [^112G8EKM]. BMC Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Bacterial conjunctivitis is a microbial infection of the mucous membrane of the conjunctiva of the eye and can occur in both adults and children. It is caused by an array of microorganisms, with the most common bacterial pathogen worldwide being Staphylococcus aureus. Other prominent bacterial species include Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, while other Staphylococcus species, Moraxella species, and opportunistic bacteria are more typically seen in chronic forms of bacterial conjunctivitis. Haemophilus influenzae is the most common isolate in children less than seven years of age. In sexually active individuals with symptoms of conjunctivitis, infection with either gonorrhea or chlamydia may occur. In most cases, the infection begins unilaterally, with the fellow eye becoming involved within a few days. Although typically considered a minor infection, bacterial conjunctivitis can have a considerable impact on school attendance and work productivity, and in rare cases, may result in permanent or sight-threatening sequelae such as bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis in extreme cases.

### Healthy contact lens behaviors communicated by eye care providers and recalled by patients - United States, 2018 [^111sr2Jc]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

Eye care providers report mentioning nine contact lens wear and care recommendations to patients frequently, but patients recall hearing these messages less often. This discrepancy in provider-patient communication has been reported previously in many medical specialties, despite the identification of patient communication as an important physician competency and an important component of medical education curricula for physicians in the United States. Effective communication between physicians and patients can have a positive impact on health, as studies demonstrate evidence of positive associations between physician communication behaviors and positive patient outcomes. Patients continue to report that many of their informational needs remain unmet during a doctor's visit. The gap between what providers say and what patients hear might be a factor in the large proportion of contact lens wearers reporting behaviors that put them at risk for a contact lens-related eye infection. Addressing this gap might improve contact lens wear and care practices.

The survey results show that eye care providers most often recommend complying with the recommended lens replacement schedules. However, other risk behaviors are more common or pose a greater risk for contact lens-related eye infections. For example, sleeping in contact lenses and topping off lens solution both increase the risk for contact lens-related eye infections approximately sixfold, and both behaviors have been reported by a majority of lens wearers. Storing lenses in water increases the risk for infection.

### Investigation of delefilcon A contact lenses for symptomatic daily disposable contact lens wearers with dry eye disease: A prospective comparative study [^1167F1kG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Previous studies have not yet examined the classification of DED subtypes and assessed the performance of DT1 lenses using the TFOS DEWS II guidelines in symptomatic DD lens wearers. Therefore, this study not only fills this gap in the literature but also aims to provide valuable insights into the management of contact lens discomfort and dry eye symptoms in this specific population.

In this study, the dry eye subclassification guidelines provided by TFOS DEWS II were employed to qualify and characterize the DED subtypes in these individuals to identify the primary underlying causes contributing to their discomfort. The primary endpoints of this study included subjective ratings of end-of-day comfort and dryness, average wear time, and comfortable wear time. Comparing these endpoints between habitual DD lenses and DT1 lenses will allow evidence-based recommendations for lens selection and management in this specific population.

### The epidemiology and treatment of conjunctivitis at urgent care centres in Israel [^115KBDLm]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

The majority of patients (82%) received a prescription for topical antibiotics. This finding is similar to previous studies: in the Netherlands, 80% of patients with conjunctivitis under the care of general practitioners received topical antibiotics. In a survey carried out in Great Britain, 95% of general care practitioners reported prescribing topical antibiotics for conjunctivitis. A study in the United States found that 68% of patients diagnosed with conjunctivitis at urgent care centers (UCC) filled their prescription for topical antibiotics, although the actual prescription rate is likely to be higher.

The high rate of antibiotic prescription for conjunctivitis may suggest overuse, since most conjunctivitis cases are viral. However, in this study, 31% of the cohort presenting at UCC with conjunctivitis were younger than 6 years of age. Since bacterial pathogens are the most common cause of acute pediatric conjunctivitis, and 78% of these children had purulent ocular discharge, they were most likely suffering from bacterial conjunctivitis. While bacterial conjunctivitis will resolve by itself, antimicrobials can be prescribed to shorten the duration of illness. Furthermore, many child care providers exclude children with conjunctivitis until antibiotic treatment is provided, impacting the decision to prescribe antibiotics. Moreover, it is difficult to clinically differentiate viral from bacterial conjunctivitis, so providers tend to "err on the side of safety" and prescribe antibiotics "just in case".

### Contact lens-related corneal infections - United States, 2005–2015 [^112GUufK]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Keratitis, an inflammation of the cornea, can result from contact lens wear or other causes. Approximately 1 million clinic and emergency department visits occur annually due to keratitis from all causes, including contact lens wear. This results in an estimated $175 million in direct health care expenditures in 2010. Approximately 41 million U.S. residents wear contact lenses, with more than 99% of wearers surveyed in 2014 reporting at least one behavior that puts them at risk for contact lens-related eye infections.

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates contact lenses as medical devices. Certain adverse events related to contact lenses are reported to the FDA's Medical Device Report (MDR) database. An analysis of contact lens-related corneal infections reported to the FDA included 1,075 MDRs containing terms like "ulcer" or "keratitis" reported during 2005–2015. Among these reports, 925 (86.0%) were submitted by a contact lens manufacturer, and 150 (14.0%) by an eye care provider or patient. Overall, 213 (19.8%) reports described a patient who developed a central corneal scar, experienced decreased visual acuity, or required a corneal transplant following the event.

- **Modifiable factors**: Among the reports, 270 (25.1%) cited modifiable factors associated with an increased risk for contact lens-related corneal infections, including sleeping in contact lenses or poor contact lens hygiene. The remainder of the reports did not provide details that permitted determination of associated factors.

### Corneal infections associated with sleeping in contact lenses - six cases, United States, 2016–2018 [^115FVBKt]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Contact lenses, when worn and cared for properly, are a safe and effective form of vision correction used by an estimated 45 million Americans. However, contact lens wearers are at risk for contact lens-related eye infections, especially when wearers do not practice proper contact lens wear and care habits. These infections, affecting the cornea and known as microbial keratitis, can lead to serious adverse health outcomes. Because contact lenses are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as medical devices, contact lens-related corneal infections should be reported to the FDA as an adverse event.

To illustrate their serious health implications, six cases of contact lens-related corneal infection, in which sleeping in lenses was reported as the main risk factor, are presented. Consequences of infection reported among the identified cases included the need for frequent administration of antibiotic eye drops, multiple follow-up medical appointments, and permanent eye damage. Health education measures directed toward contact lens wearers should emphasize raising awareness of the risks of sleeping in contact lenses as well as adherence to all recommendations for the wear and care of contact lenses. Additional measures are needed to educate eye care professionals about the need to report contact lens-related corneal infections to MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting program (https://www.fda.gov/MedWatch/).

### Retrospective analysis on the outcomes of contact lens-associated keratitis in a tertiary centre: an evidence-based management protocol to optimise resource allocation [^115ypX9T]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Microbial keratitis is a common ocular disorder that poses a significant burden on affected populations, and if untreated, can lead to blindness. Contact lens-associated keratitis (CLAK) is defined as microbial keratitis (MK) secondary to contact lens (CL) usage, and it has a global incidence rate of 2–20 cases per 10,000 CL wearers each year. CL wear is often cited as the most common risk factor, with studies reporting it being implicated in up to 50.3% of MK cases. Other common risk factors include ocular surface disorders, trauma, and immunosuppression. The risk of CLAK is influenced primarily by CL hygiene but is also dependent on the type of CLs worn, online availability, and social behaviors.

The population penetrance of CL usage was 13.9% (45 million) in the United States in 2016 and 9% (6.3 million) in the UK in 2020, with an increase to 25%–30% in the Netherlands and Sweden. With CL wear of all types in the UK being on a steady yearly rise, CLAK poses a significant burden on eye emergency services, contributing to 18% of attendances annually. Additionally, the management protocol across the UK is based on historical practice and dictates that every patient with CLAK requires review in 48 hours, further increasing the burden on a resource-limited healthcare service. We aimed to quantify this burden on services at our local tertiary centre and provide evidence to support our hypothesis that the majority of patients with low-risk CLAK are being followed up unnecessarily and can be discharged in the first instance.
