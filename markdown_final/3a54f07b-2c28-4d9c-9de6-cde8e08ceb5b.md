## Question

Risk of taking opioids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks of taking opioids and how to contextualize, quantify, and mitigate those risks in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching risk framework and dose-response relationships. Then, I should verify the major risk domains and quantify them where possible. Next, I will examine patient-level risk modifiers and the limits of risk prediction tools. After that, I need to review guideline-based mitigation strategies, including dosing, monitoring, and tapering. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical, patient-centered approach with clear thresholds and actions, while double-checking areas where evidence is limited or controversial.

> Let me first confirm the risk framework. Opioid-related harms increase continuously with dose, and there is no absolute threshold below which risk is eliminated, so I need to ensure I do not imply a "safe" dose; the CDC 2022 guideline explicitly warns against rigid numeric thresholds and emphasizes individualized risk–benefit assessment, which I should keep front and center as I proceed [^112dgYFH] [^113ZMsv1]. I should also remember that the balance of benefits and harms shifts unfavorably over time for chronic pain, with limited evidence of long-term benefit and accumulating risks, reinforcing the need for ongoing reassessment and deprescribing when appropriate [^113sLZsH] [^1154BiF8].

> Now, I will examine overdose risk and its dose-response. Multiple observational analyses summarized by CDC show that overdose risk rises progressively: at 50– < 100 MME/day, overdose risk is roughly 1.9–4.6 times that of 1– < 20 MME/day, and at ≥ 100 MME/day, risk is about 2.0–8.9 times higher; for acute pain, similar relative risks are seen at comparable dose bands, which underscores the dose-dependent nature of risk even early in therapy [^113hBnpt]. Wait, let me verify the clinical implication: this supports using the lowest effective dose, avoiding escalation beyond 50 MME/day without compelling justification, and reassessing frequently if higher doses are contemplated, aligning with CDC's caution about diminishing returns beyond 50 MME/day [^112dgYFH] [^115PSmeW].

> Next, I should review opioid use disorder (OUD) risk. I need to check incidence estimates and modifiers: among opioid-naïve patients, long-term prescriptions (> 90 days) are associated with markedly increased odds of a new OUD diagnosis, with adjusted odds ratios of about 15, 29, and 122 at low, medium, and high daily doses, respectively, compared with no opioid use, which is striking and clinically important for shared decision-making and exit strategies [^1154BiF8]. Hold on, I should verify patient-level predictors: a history of opioid or other substance use disorder and certain mental health diagnoses substantially elevate risk, whereas only the absence of a mood disorder modestly lowers risk; importantly, most screening tools have poor diagnostic performance for identifying high- versus low-risk patients, so I should not over-rely on them [^112XpE5F] [^113Zne9p].

> I will now examine respiratory depression and other serious adverse effects. Respiratory depression can occur at any time, especially during initiation and dose escalation, and is magnified with concomitant CNS depressants; I need to ensure I counsel patients about additive risks with benzodiazepines, alcohol, sedatives, and other opioids, and consider naloxone for those at elevated risk or with household exposure risks [^115CzNjb] [^114QmWu7]. Let me consider additional harms: long-term opioid therapy is associated with increased risks of fractures, falls, myocardial infarction, and new-onset depression, and patients on opioids have high rates of constipation, drowsiness, confusion, tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal, all of which require anticipatory guidance and monitoring plans [^1154BiF8] [^115ueToi].

> But wait, what about misuse and diversion? I should confirm that misuse risk is higher with certain patient characteristics and prescription patterns: younger age, male sex, current or prior substance use disorder, mental health comorbidities, and longer prescription durations are associated with increased misuse; co-prescribed benzodiazepines and higher doses also track with higher-dose prescribing and likely harm, reinforcing the need to avoid high-risk combinations and to reassess the necessity of ongoing therapy [^116u6XBL] [^114QmWu7]. Hold on, I should verify that diversion risk is real: prescribed opioids are subject to diversion and nonmedical use, so safe storage, limited quantities, and disposal counseling are essential parts of risk mitigation [^112oWmrW].

> Next, I should review patient-level risk modifiers and the limits of prediction tools. A history of opioid or other substance use disorder, certain mental health diagnoses, and concomitant psychiatric medications increase the likelihood of prescription OUD, yet no symptom complex or screening tool reliably identifies low-risk patients suitable for "safe" opioid prescribing; even commonly used tools like ORT or SOAPP-R have limited diagnostic utility, so I need to avoid false reassurance and instead apply universal precautions with enhanced monitoring for those with identifiable risk factors [^112XpE5F] [^113Zne9p]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that a good score on a risk tool means low risk; I should correct that: the evidence shows poor discrimination overall, so clinical judgment and close follow-up remain paramount [^111VGjWn].

> I will now examine guideline-based mitigation strategies. The CDC 2022 guideline recommends nonopioid therapies as preferred for subacute and chronic pain, using the lowest effective opioid dose when opioids are necessary, and avoiding dosage increases above levels likely to yield diminishing returns; for acute pain, prescribe the smallest quantity likely to be needed, typically no more than 3–7 days, with a plan for tapering and discontinuation as pain resolves [^115AbWS9] [^113sLZsH]. I should double-check monitoring cadence: reassess within 1–4 weeks of initiation or dose escalation, then every 3 months or more frequently for higher-risk patients, incorporating PDMP checks and considering urine drug testing to detect high-risk combinations or undisclosed substances [^114Z8NZ8] [^111F2YBX].

> Let me consider tapering and discontinuation. If risks outweigh benefits, clinicians should collaborate with patients on a gradual taper, recognizing that abrupt discontinuation can precipitate withdrawal and destabilize pain control; most patients report stable or improved function after voluntary dose reductions, though some experience transient worsening of pain, anxiety, or insomnia, which requires supportive care and pacing of the taper to patient goals and tolerance [^112uGmtg]. Hold on, I should verify that tapers are individualized: shared decision-making, slow dose reductions, and contingency plans for withdrawal symptoms are key to success and safety [^111tf6pq].

> I need to ensure harm-reduction measures are in place. Naloxone should be offered to patients at overdose risk, including those on ≥ 50 MME/day, those with concomitant CNS depressants, a history of OUD or prior overdose, or households with children or others at risk of accidental ingestion; patients and caregivers should be educated on use and access pathways [^114wjGTx] [^113rGrDF]. I should confirm that PDMP review and, when indicated, urine drug testing are part of routine monitoring to identify hazardous combinations or undisclosed substances that elevate overdose risk [^111F2YBX].

> Next, I should review special populations. For older adults, I need to check for heightened sensitivity to respiratory depression, sedation, and falls; intriguingly, incident opioid prescriptions in older adults have been associated with higher early overdose risk, so I should start low, go slow, and reassess frequently, with particular caution around dose escalations and drug–drug interactions [^113pWCVs]. For patients with cancer pain, opioids remain the gold standard, but I should apply universal precautions, screen for misuse risk, and proactively manage adverse effects to preserve the therapeutic index [^117GkZD9] [^116EZ9ZS]. For surgical patients, prior opioid exposure is the strongest predictor of prolonged use; minimizing perioperative quantities and planning for de-escalation can mitigate transition to chronic use [^111uz8Mv] [^116d9mYB].

> Let me synthesize a practical, patient-centered approach. Before prescribing, I should confirm that nonpharmacologic and nonopioid options have been optimized, discuss realistic benefits and risks with the patient, and define functional goals and an exit strategy; if opioids are initiated, I should prescribe the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, avoid high-risk combinations such as benzodiazepines, reassess within 1–4 weeks, and then every 3 months, incorporating PDMP and, when appropriate, urine testing; if risks outweigh benefits, I should offer a collaborative taper with symptom management and naloxone as indicated [^11224N28] [^111F2YBX]. I should double-check that I have not implied rigid dose caps; the guidance is to avoid escalating above levels with diminishing returns, with particular caution beyond 50 MME/day, rather than enforcing a universal ceiling, which respects clinical heterogeneity while maintaining safety [^112dgYFH].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the key messages are explicit and evidence-aligned: opioid risks rise continuously with dose and accumulate over time; overdose, OUD, respiratory depression, fractures, cardiovascular events, and functional impairment are the principal concerns; patient-level risks include prior substance use disorder, mental health comorbidity, and high-risk combinations; most screening tools have limited predictive value, so universal precautions and vigilant monitoring are essential; and guideline-concordant prescribing — lowest effective dose, short duration, early reassessment, PDMP/UDT use, and planned tapering with naloxone for at-risk patients — mitigates harm while preserving analgesia when truly indicated [^113hBnpt] [^112XpE5F] [^11224N28].

Opioids carry **significant risks** that increase with dose and duration, including respiratory depression, overdose, addiction, and misuse [^113hBnpt] [^1154BiF8]. Key risks include:

- **Respiratory depression and overdose**: Risk rises with higher doses, especially ≥ 50 MME/day, and is further increased with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants [^113hBnpt] [^1154EVmS].
- **Addiction and misuse**: Higher risk with prior substance use disorder, mental health conditions, and prolonged use; screening tools have limited predictive value [^112XpE5F] [^1154BiF8].
- **Common adverse effects**: Constipation, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness, and cognitive impairment are frequent and may limit therapy [^115ueToi].
- **Serious harms**: Overdose, fractures, falls, and myocardial infarction are more likely with long-term or high-dose therapy [^1154BiF8].
- **Dependence and withdrawal**: Physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms are common with chronic use, complicating discontinuation [^115ueToi].

To mitigate risks, use the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration, avoid high-risk combinations, and monitor closely with PDMP and urine testing [^112dgYFH] [^111F2YBX]. Naloxone should be offered to patients at overdose risk, and tapering should be planned if risks outweigh benefits [^114wjGTx] [^112uGmtg].

### Factors associated with the prescribing of high-dose opioids in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158aQH8]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The risks of harms from opioids increase substantially at high doses, and high-dose prescribing has increased in primary care. However, little is known about what leads to high-dose prescribing, and studies exploring this have not been synthesized. We, therefore, systematically synthesized factors associated with the prescribing of high-dose opioids in primary care.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of observational studies in high-income countries that used patient-level primary care data and explored any factor(s) in people for whom opioids were prescribed, stratified by oral morphine equivalents (OME). We defined high doses as ≥ 90 OME mg/day. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, reference lists, forward citations, and conference proceedings from database inception to 5 April 2019. Two investigators independently screened studies, extracted data, and appraised the quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. We pooled data on factors using random effects meta-analyses and reported relative risks (RR) or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) where appropriate. We also performed a number needed to harm (NNT H) calculation on factors when applicable.

Results

We included six studies with a total of 4,248,119 participants taking opioids, of whom 3.64% (n = 154,749) were taking high doses. The majority of included studies (n = 4) were conducted in the United States, one in Australia and one in the UK. The largest study (n = 4,046,275) was from the United States. Included studies were graded as having fair to good quality evidence. The co-prescription of benzodiazepines (RR 3.27, 95% CI 1.32 to 8.13, I² = 99.9%), depression (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.51, I² = 0%), emergency department visits (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.46 to 1.61, I² = 0%, NNT H 15, 95% CI 12 to 20), unemployment (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.63, I² = 0%), and male gender (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.28, I² = 78.6%) were significantly associated with the prescribing of high-dose opioids in primary care.

Conclusions

High doses of opioids are associated with greater risks of harms. Associated factors such as the co-prescription of benzodiazepines and depression identify priority areas that should be considered when selecting, identifying, and managing people taking high-dose opioids in primary care. Coordinated strategies and services that promote the safe prescribing of opioids are needed.

### Understanding risk factors for opioid overdose in clinical populations to inform treatment and policy [^112KiJim]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Overdoses involving opioid analgesics represent a significant public health problem in the United States. We reviewed the literature on risk factors for overdose, with a focus on studies that examine clinical populations of patients receiving opioids for pain and potential risk factors for overdose in these populations. A structured review resulted in 15 articles published between 2007 and 2015 that examined risk factors for fatal and nonfatal overdose in patients receiving opioid analgesics. Opioid dosage was the factor most consistently analyzed and also associated with increased risk of overdose. Other risk factors include concurrent use of sedative-hypnotics, use of extended-release/long-acting opioids, and the presence of substance use and other mental health disorder comorbidities. Future research is needed to better characterize populations taking opioids for pain to help clarify discrepancies between existing studies and identify previously unexplored risk factors for overdose. Given that policy and clinical practice have shifted as a result of prior studies reviewed here, further efforts in understanding patient groups and opioid-related prescribing practices associated with overdose risk have great potential to impact policy and practice in the treatment of pain while improving the safety around opioid prescribing.

### Current risk assessment and management paradigms: snapshots in the life of the pain specialist [^11682dy6]. Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Opioid analgesics can be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with chronic pain, but issues surrounding their use-including side effects, tolerance, and the potential for misuse and diversion-prompt some clinicians to avoid using these agents, and can lead to the continued undertreatment of pain. This article offers practical advice to clinicians who choose to prescribe opioid analgesics. Through a series of case presentations, it illustrates the steps health care providers can take to prepare their practice for opioid prescribing, assess and select patients for opioid treatment, initiate and manage therapy, and address concerns about aberrant behaviors.

### Strategies to identify patient risks of prescription opioid addiction when initiating opioids for pain: a systematic review [^111MGDtc]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How can physicians identify patients with pain for whom prescription opioids can be safely prescribed?

Findings

This systematic review found that a history of opioid use disorder or other substance use disorder, a mental health diagnosis, and concomitant prescription of certain psychiatric medications may be associated with an increased risk of prescription opioid addiction. However, only the absence of a mood disorder appeared useful for identifying lower risk, and assessment tools incorporating combinations of patient characteristics and risk factors were not useful.

Meaning

This study suggests that there are few valid ways to identify patients who can be safely prescribed opioid analgesics.

### Strategies to identify patient risks of prescription opioid addiction when initiating opioids for pain: a systematic review [^114rUnH8]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Recently, prescription opioids have been detected in up to 77% of opioid-related overdose fatalities, and the health, social, and economic costs associated with opioid use disorder (OUD) continue to increase. Importantly, the quantities of opioids prescribed in different regions have been strongly associated with higher rates of subsequent opioid overdose. Nevertheless, despite the well-recognized harms of prescription opioids, recent data suggest that the number of opioid prescriptions is remaining stable, and while the United States has seen a decrease in the national opioid prescribing rate, in 2017, prescribing rates remained very high in most US jurisdictions.

While there is great variability in the estimates, a substantial proportion of persons prescribed opioids for chronic pain may subsequently develop OUD. As such, the optimal mechanism for prevention remains with the promotion of safer prescribing by health care professionals. The need for safer prescribing is also acknowledged in the recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pain guidelines that highlight the importance of carefully screening patients to identify those at high risk of OUD. However, patient characteristics and screening tools currently in use for predicting risk of prescription opioid addiction have not been critically assessed for diagnostic performance in a systematic review. Therefore, this review describes the incidence of prescription OUD and diagnostic accuracy of strategies used for identifying patients at high vs low risk of prescription OUD being prescribed opioids for pain.

### Challenges with implementing the centers for disease control and prevention opioid guideline: a consensus panel report [^113qUNmo]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A national crisis of opioid-related morbidity, mortality, and misuse has led to initiatives to address the appropriate role of opioids to treat pain. Deployment of a guideline from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reduce the risks of opioid therapy has raised substantial clinical and public policy challenges. The agency anticipated implementation challenges and committed to reevaluating the guideline for intended and unintended effects on clinician and patient outcomes.

Observations

A multidisciplinary expert panel met to review the influence of the core recommendations of the guideline on pain management practices, principally regarding the estimated 5 to 8 million Americans with chronic pain currently on opioids. The panel identified implementation challenges, including application of dosage ceilings and prescription duration guidance, failure to appreciate the importance of patient involvement in decisions to taper or discontinue opioids, barriers to diagnosis and treatment of opioid use disorder, and impeded access to recommended comprehensive, multimodal pain care. Furthermore, policy-making and regulatory bodies may misapply guideline recommendations without flexibility and, sometimes, without full awareness of what the guideline contains.

Conclusions and Relevance

The panel largely supported the guideline, endorsing its focal points of safety and comprehensive assessment and monitoring. To mitigate clinical and policy challenges identified with implementing the guideline, the panel discussed areas where viewpoints diverged and arrived at consensus proposals. The target audience includes the leaders and institutions that create policy and influence guideline implementation to include regulatory agencies, legislators, public and private payers, and health care systems.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113t7Bkw]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

This guideline provides recommendations for clinicians providing pain care, including those prescribing opioids, for outpatients aged ≥ 18 years. It updates the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain - United States, 2016 (MMWR Recomm Rep 2016;65[No. RR-1]:1–49) and includes recommendations for managing acute (duration of < 1 month), subacute (duration of 1–3 months), and chronic (duration of > 3 months) pain. The recommendations do not apply to pain related to sickle cell disease or cancer or to patients receiving palliative or end-of-life care. The guideline addresses the following four areas: 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain, 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages, 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up, and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. CDC developed the guideline using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Recommendations are based on systematic reviews of the scientific evidence and reflect considerations of benefits and harms, patient and clinician values and preferences, and resource allocation. CDC obtained input from the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (a federally chartered advisory committee), the public, and peer reviewers. CDC recommends that persons with pain receive appropriate pain treatment, with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of all treatment options in the context of the patient's circumstances. Recommendations should not be applied as inflexible standards of care across patient populations. This clinical practice guideline is intended to improve communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of pain treatments, including opioid therapy; improve the effectiveness and safety of pain treatment; mitigate pain; improve function and quality of life for patients with pain; and reduce risks associated with opioid pain therapy, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death.

### CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain – United States, 2016 [^113sLZsH]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Primary care clinicians find managing chronic pain challenging. Evidence of long-term efficacy of opioids for chronic pain is limited. Opioid use is associated with serious risks, including opioid use disorder and overdose.

Objective

To provide recommendations about opioid prescribing for primary care clinicians treating adult patients with chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care.

Process

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated a 2014 systematic review on effectiveness and risks of opioids and conducted a supplemental review on benefits and harms, values and preferences, and costs. CDC used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to assess evidence type and determine the recommendation category.

Evidence Synthesis

Evidence consisted of observational studies or randomized clinical trials with notable limitations, characterized as low quality using GRADE methodology. Meta-analysis was not attempted due to the limited number of studies, variability in study designs and clinical heterogeneity, and methodological shortcomings of studies. No study evaluated long-term (≥ 1 year) benefit of opioids for chronic pain. Opioids were associated with increased risks, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death, with dose-dependent effects.

Recommendations

There are 12 recommendations. Of primary importance, nonopioid therapy is preferred for treatment of chronic pain. Opioids should be used only when benefits for pain and function are expected to outweigh risks. Before starting opioids, clinicians should establish treatment goals with patients and consider how opioids will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks. When opioids are used, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage, carefully reassess benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage to 50 morphine milligram equivalents or more per day, and avoid concurrent opioids and benzodiazepines whenever possible. Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms of continued opioid therapy with patients every 3 months or more frequently and review prescription drug monitoring program data, when available, for high-risk combinations or dosages. For patients with opioid use disorder, clinicians should offer or arrange evidence-based treatment, such as medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine or methadone.

Conclusions and Relevance

The guideline is intended to improve communication about benefits and risks of opioids for chronic pain, improve safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, and reduce risks associated with long-term opioid therapy.

### Strategies for selecting treatment and mitigating risk in patients with chronic pain [^111Jc4KJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Although opioid analgesics treat more types of pain and are usually more potent than other classes of analgesics, opioids are ineffective for some patients and can cause adverse physiologic or psychiatric effects in others. If a prescriber determines that opioid treatment is appropriate for a patient, opioid medications can be used chronically with both effectiveness and safety. Responsible opioid prescribing requires risk management, including assessing patients for abuse risk, identifying and measuring functional outcomes, and monitoring for adverse medication effects. Prescribers should follow the Federation of State Medical Boards model policy for using controlled substances and transparently document risk management when treating pain.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111tf6pq]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to choice of agent and dosage, CDC 2022 guidelines recommend to assess benefits and risks carefully and exercise care when changing the opioid dosage in patients already receiving opioid therapy. Optimize nonopioid therapies while continuing opioid therapy if the benefits outweigh the risks of continued opioid therapy. Optimize other therapies and gradually taper to lower dosages or, if warranted based on the individual circumstances of the patient, appropriately taper and discontinue opioids if the benefits do not outweigh the risks of continued opioid therapy.

### Risk factors for opioid-use disorder and overdose [^113JxqA5]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

Opioid analgesics are recognized as a legitimate medical therapy for selected patients with severe chronic pain that does not respond to other therapies. However, opioids are associated with risks for patients and society that include misuse, abuse, diversion, addiction, and overdose deaths. Therapeutic success depends on proper candidate selection, assessment before administering opioid therapy, and close monitoring throughout the course of treatment. Risk assessment and prevention include knowledge of patient factors that may contribute to misuse, abuse, addiction, suicide, and respiratory depression. Risk factors for opioid misuse or addiction include past or current substance abuse, untreated psychiatric disorders, younger age, and social or family environments that encourage misuse. Opioid mortality prevalence is higher in people who are middle aged and have substance abuse and psychiatric comorbidities. Suicides are probably undercounted or frequently misclassified in reports of opioid-related poisoning deaths. Greater understanding and better assessment are needed of the risk associated with suicide risk in patients with pain. Clinical tools and an evolving evidence base are available to assist clinicians with identifying patients whose risk factors put them at risk for adverse outcomes with opioids.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111k3Hq1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Since release of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, new evidence has emerged on the benefits and risks of prescription opioids for both acute and chronic pain, comparisons with nonopioid pain treatments, dosing strategies, opioid dose-dependent effects, risk mitigation strategies, and opioid tapering and discontinuation. This evidence includes studies on misapplication of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, benefits and risks of different tapering strategies and rapid tapering associated with patient harm (,–), challenges in patient access to opioids, patient abandonment and abrupt discontinuation of opioids, a seminal randomized clinical trial comparing prescription opioids to nonopioid medications on long-term pain outcomes, the association of characteristics of initial opioid prescriptions with subsequent likelihood for long-term opioid use, and the small proportion of opioids used by patients compared with the amount prescribed to them for postoperative pain.

Opioid medications remain a common treatment for pain despite declines in the number of opioid prescriptions after 2012. During 2015–2018, approximately 6% of U.S. adults reported use of one or more prescription opioids during the past 30 days, and in 2020, approximately 143 million opioid prescriptions were dispensed from pharmacies in the United States. Rates of opioid prescribing continue to vary across states, medical specialties, patient demographics, and pain conditions in ways that cannot be explained by the underlying health status of the population, and often are discordant with the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline recommendations (,–). The prevalence of prescription opioid misuse and prescription opioid use disorder also has declined in recent years. In 2019, among persons aged ≥ 12 years in the United States, 9.7 million reported misuse of prescription opioids during the past year (a decrease from 12.5 million in 2015), and 1.4 million met criteria for a past-year prescription opioid use disorder (a decrease from 2.0 million in 2015). However, in 2020, prescription opioids remained the most commonly misused prescription drug in the United States. Also in 2020, among those reporting misuse during the past year, 64.6% reported the main reason for their most recent misuse was to "relieve physical pain" compared with 11.3% to "feel good or get high" and 2.3% "because I am hooked or have to have it". Taken together, these factors underscore the need for an updated clinical practice guideline on appropriate opioid prescribing for pain and pain management.

### Weighing the risks and benefits of chronic opioid therapy [^112gPGsn]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence supports the use of opioids for treating acute pain. However, the evidence is limited for the use of chronic opioid therapy for chronic pain. Furthermore, the risks of chronic therapy are significant and may outweigh any potential benefits. When considering chronic opioid therapy, physicians should weigh the risks against any possible benefits throughout the therapy, including assessing for the risks of opioid misuse, opioid use disorder, and overdose. When initiating opioid therapy, physicians should consider buprenorphine for patients at risk of opioid misuse, opioid use disorder, and overdose. If and when opioid misuse is detected, opioids do not necessarily need to be discontinued, but misuse should be noted on the problem list and interventions should be performed to change the patient's behavior. If aberrant behavior continues, opioid use disorder should be diagnosed and treated accordingly. When patients are discontinuing opioid therapy, the dosage should be decreased slowly, especially in those who have intolerable withdrawal. It is not unreasonable for discontinuation of chronic opioid therapy to take many months. Benzodiazepines should not be coprescribed during chronic opioid therapy or when tapering, because some patients may develop cross-dependence. For patients at risk of overdose, naloxone should be offered to the patient and to others who may be in a position to witness and reverse opioid overdose.

### Strategies to identify patient risks of prescription opioid addiction when initiating opioids for pain: a systematic review [^112Cms7e]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

While these findings are disheartening given the urgent need to identify more effective strategies to manage patients with chronic pain, they are well aligned with the evolving literature regarding risk of prescription OUD among individuals prescribed opioid medications for pain management, and the discordance between this literature and common prescribing behaviors in North America. For instance, while recent reports have demonstrated that physician perception of the low risk of prescription opioids may be based on flawed or limited studies, more rigorous reviews have highlighted the risks of prescription opioids and the limited evidence of benefit. For instance, the systematic review for the Pathways to Prevention Workshop, which was sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health, highlighted questions about the clinical effectiveness of prescription opioids in the chronic pain context and reported a dose-dependent risk for serious harms of long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. More recently, the Strategies for Prescribing Analgesics Comparative Effectiveness (SPACE) trial found that treatment with prescription opioids was not superior to treatment with nonopioid medications on pain-related function in patients with chronic back pain or hip or knee osteoarthritis pain. Together with the lack of diagnostic value of the tools in widespread use for identifying patients at high or low risk, as identified in our review, this evolving literature on the limitations and harms of prescription opioids highlights the need to reconsider the common prescription of opioids for minor acute pain conditions and chronic pain.

### Opioid prescribing: a systematic review and critical appraisal of guidelines for chronic pain [^1133c3WL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Deaths due to prescription opioid overdoses have increased dramatically. High-quality guidelines could help clinicians mitigate risks associated with opioid therapy.

Purpose

To evaluate the quality and content of guidelines on the use of opioids for chronic pain.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, National Guideline Clearinghouse, specialty society Web sites, and international guideline clearinghouses (searched in July 2013).

Study Selection

Guidelines published between January 2007 and July 2013 addressing the use of opioids for chronic pain in adults were selected. Guidelines on specific settings, populations, and conditions were excluded.

Data Extraction

Guidelines and associated systematic reviews were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument and A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR), respectively, and recommendations for mitigating opioid-related risks were compared.

Data Synthesis

Thirteen guidelines met selection criteria. Overall AGREE II scores were 3.00 to 6.20 (on a scale of 1 to 7). The AMSTAR ratings were poor to fair for 10 guidelines. Two received high AGREE II and AMSTAR scores. Most guidelines recommend that clinicians avoid doses greater than 90 to 200 mg of morphine equivalents per day, have additional knowledge to prescribe methadone, recognize risks of fentanyl patches, titrate cautiously, and reduce doses by at least 25% to 50% when switching opioids. Guidelines also agree that opioid risk assessment tools, written treatment agreements, and urine drug testing can mitigate risks. Most recommendations are supported by observational data or expert consensus.

Limitation

Exclusion of non-English-language guidelines and reliance on published information.

Conclusion

Despite limited evidence and variable development methods, recent guidelines on chronic pain agree on several opioid risk mitigation strategies, including upper dosing thresholds; cautions with certain medications; attention to drug-drug and drug-disease interactions; and use of risk assessment tools, treatment agreements, and urine drug testing. Future research should directly examine the effectiveness of opioid risk mitigation strategies.

### Updated centers for disease control and prevention guidelines on opioid prescribing: what should surgeons know? [^116i5wmJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published a 2022 guideline on opioid prescribing for acute, subacute, and chronic pain. This information is relevant to surgeons because many patients receive their first opioid prescription after surgery. When prescribing opioids, surgeons walk the line between benefit and harm. Many of the CDC recommendations mirror the AAO-HNS Clinical Practice Guideline: Opioid Prescribing for Analgesia After Common Otolaryngology Operations. For example, opioids are not recommended as first-line therapy for acute pain from otolaryngology-head, and neck surgery procedures. New insights include safeguards and strategies to mitigate the risk of complications in patients with chronic pain undergoing surgical procedures. Consultation with a pain specialist should be considered for patients transitioning from acute to chronic pain, cognizant of the risks of abrupt discontinuation of opioids in patients with opioid use disorder. This article summarizes key considerations for providing individualized, evidence-based perioperative pain management.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111rqDma]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Each of the 12 recommendation statements is followed by considerations for implementation and a rationale for the recommendation. The implementation considerations offer practical insights, context, and specific examples meant to further inform clinician-patient decision-making for the respective recommendation and are not meant to be rigidly or inflexibly followed.

The recommendations are grouped into four areas:

Determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain
Selecting opioids and determining dosages
Deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up
Assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use

In addition, these five guiding principles should broadly inform implementation across recommendations (Box 4):

BOX 4
Guiding principles for implementation of the CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain — United States, 2022 recommendations

Acute, subacute, and chronic pain needs to be appropriately assessed and treated independent of whether opioids are part of a treatment regimen.
Recommendations are voluntary and are intended to support, not supplant, individualized, person-centered care. Flexibility to meet the care needs and the clinical circumstances of a specific patient is paramount.
A multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management attending to the physical health, behavioral health, long-term services and supports, and expected health outcomes and well-being of each person is critical.
Special attention should be given to avoid misapplying this clinical practice guideline beyond its intended use or implementing policies purportedly derived from it that might lead to unintended and potentially harmful consequences for patients.
Clinicians, practices, health systems, and payers should vigilantly attend to health inequities; provide culturally and linguistically appropriate communication, including communication that is accessible to persons with disabilities; and ensure access to an appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic pain management regimen for all persons.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^112oWmrW]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition to the potential risks to patients, prescribed opioids have the potential for diversion and nonmedical use among persons to whom they were not prescribed. In the United States, opioid prescribing increased fourfold during 1999–2010; this increase was paralleled by an approximately fourfold increase in overdose deaths involving prescription opioids during the same period and increases in prescription opioid use disorder. In addition to the increased overall volume of opioid prescriptions during this period, how opioids were prescribed also changed; opioids increasingly were prescribed at higher dosages and for longer durations, prescribing behaviors associated with opioid use disorder and overdose. The limited evidence of long-term effectiveness of opioids for chronic pain, coupled with risks to patients and to persons using prescription opioids that were not prescribed to them, underscored the importance of reducing inappropriate opioid prescribing while advancing evidence-based pain care to improve the lives of persons living with pain.

CDC recognized the need for a national guideline on pain management that could improve appropriate opioid prescribing while minimizing opioid-related risks and released the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain — United States, 2016 (referred to as the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline hereafter). The 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline included 12 recommendations for the prescribing of opioids for chronic pain by primary care clinicians in outpatient settings, excluding active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. The recommendations in the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline were based on a systematic review of the best-available evidence at the time, along with input from experts and the public and review and deliberation by the Board of Scientific Counselors (BSC) of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) (a federally chartered advisory committee). The goals of the guideline were to 1) ensure that clinicians and patients considered safer and more effective pain treatment; 2) improve patient outcomes, such as reduced pain and improved function; and 3) reduce the number of persons who developed opioid use disorder, experienced overdose, or experienced other prescription opioid–related adverse events. To facilitate uptake and implementation of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline in clinical practice, CDC used a broad-reaching strategy that included clinician education and training, partnerships with health systems and payers, and multiple clinical tools and fact sheets.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^112U4wgZ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

In addition to evaluating benefits and risks of opioids before starting opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2), clinicians should evaluate patients to assess benefits and risks of opioids within 1–4 weeks of starting long-term opioid therapy or of dosage escalation.
Clinicians should consider follow-up intervals within the lower end of this range when ER/LA opioids are started or increased, because of the increased risk for overdose within the first 2 weeks of treatment, or when total daily opioid dosage is ≥ 50 MME/day. (Overdose risk is doubled across multiple studies for dosages of 50 to < 100 MME/day relative to < 20 MME/day.) (See Recommendation 4.)
Shorter follow-up intervals (every 2–3 days for the first week) should be strongly considered when starting or increasing the dosage of methadone, because of the variable half-life of this drug (see Recommendation 3) and the potential for drug accumulation during initiation and during upward titration of dosage.
An initial follow-up interval closer to 4 weeks can be considered when starting immediate-release opioids at a dosage of < 50 MME/day.
Clinicians should follow up with and evaluate patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for 30 days to reassess the patient's pain, function, and treatment course; ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed; and prevent unintentional initiation of long-term opioid therapy. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should regularly reassess all patients receiving long-term opioid therapy, including patients who are new to the clinician but on long-term opioid therapy, with a suggested interval of every 3 months or more frequently for most patients.
Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should reevaluate patients who are at higher risk for opioid use disorder or overdose (e.g. patients with depression or other mental health conditions, a history of substance use disorder, a history of overdose, taking ≥ 50 MME/day, or taking other central nervous system depressants with opioids) more frequently than every 3 months. Clinicians should regularly screen all patients for these conditions, which can change during the course of treatment (see Recommendation 8).
Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize unintended effects on patients by ensuring all patients can access and afford follow-up evaluation.
In practice contexts where virtual visits are part of standard care (e.g. in remote areas where distance or other context makes follow-up visits challenging), or for patients for whom in-person follow-up visits are challenging (e.g. frail patients), follow-up assessments that allow the clinician to communicate with and observe the patient through telehealth modalities might be conducted.
At follow-up, clinicians should review patient perspectives and goals, determine whether opioids continue to meet treatment goals, including sustained improvement in pain and function, and determine whether the patient has experienced common or serious adverse events or early warning signs of serious adverse events or has signs of opioid use disorder.
Clinicians should ensure that treatment for depression, anxiety, or other psychological comorbidities is optimized.
Clinicians should ask patients about their preferences for continuing opioids, considering their effects on pain and function relative to any adverse effects experienced. If risks outweigh benefits of continued opioid therapy (e.g. if patients do not experience meaningful, sustained improvements in pain and function compared with before initiation of opioid therapy; if patients are taking higher-risk regimens [e.g. dosages of ≥ 50 MME/day or opioids combined with benzodiazepines] without evidence of benefit; if patients believe benefits no longer outweigh risks; if patients request dosage reduction or discontinuation; or if patients experience overdose or other serious adverse events), clinicians should work with patients to taper and reduce opioid dosage or taper and discontinue opioids when possible (see from Recommendation 5).
Clinicians should maximize pain treatment with nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments as appropriate (see Recommendation 2).

### Safe opioid use: management of opioid-related adverse effects and aberrant behaviors [^1114qrDw]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Opioids are highly effective for cancer pain but are associated with multiple adverse effects and risk of addiction. This article provides a synopsis on the management of various opioid-related adverse effects and strategies to minimize aberrant opioid use in patients who have cancer. Many adverse effects can be effectively managed. Some patients on chronic opioid therapy may demonstrate aberrant behaviors suggestive of opioid misuse or diversion. Through intensive education, longitudinal monitoring, early identification, and timely management, clinicians can optimize the risk to benefit ratio to support safe opioid use.

### Opioid overdose history, risk behaviors, and knowledge in patients taking prescribed opioids for chronic pain [^111mfNQw]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

More than 100 million adults in the United States experience chronic pain, and prescription opioids are the third most widely prescribed class of medications. Current opioid overdose prevention efforts almost exclusively target illicit opioid users, and little is known about the experience of overdose among patients being treated for chronic pain (CP) with a prescription opioid.

Methods

Patients experiencing CP forthree or more months and receiving a prescription opioid for pain management (N = 502) completed a self-report survey that asked questions about opioid overdose history, past 30-day risk factors, and knowledge of opioid overdose, overdose risk, and naloxone.

Results

Approximately one in five CP participants reported experiencing a lifetime overdose. CP participants reported engaging in several behaviors associated with overdose risk and were unlikely to have been trained to administer naloxone. Fewer than 50% of participants answered any knowledge item correctly. The likelihood of having experienced an overdose increased as the scores on the SOAPP-R and DSM-5 opioid use disorder checklist increased, and a SOAPP-R scoreof 7 or higher or meeting DSM-5 mild opioid use disorder criteria were significantly associated with reporting a lifetime overdose (85% and 84% of participants who experienced an overdose, respectively).

Conclusions

Opioid overdose occurs at a high rate among CP participants, and this group is relatively uninformed about risk factors for overdose. Established SOAPP-R and DSM thresholds provide an opportunity to identify participants at elevated risk for having experienced an opioid overdose. These data support development of additional concentrated efforts to prevent overdose among chronic pain patients.

### Risk factors for misuse of prescribed opioids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116u6XBL]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Increasing opioid prescribing has been linked to an epidemic of opioid misuse. Our objective is to synthesize the available evidence about patient-, prescriber-, medication-, and system-level risk factors for developing misuse among patients prescribed opioids for noncancer pain.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of the scientific and gray literature for studies reporting on risk factors for prescription opioid misuse. Two reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full texts; extracted data; and assessed study quality. We excluded studies with greater than 50% cancer patients, palliative patients, and illicit opioid initiation. When possible, we synthesized the effect sizes of dichotomous risk factors and their associations with opioid misuse, using inverse-variance random-effects meta-analysis. We calculated the mean difference between opioid misusers and nonmisusers for continuous risk factors. When studies lacked homogeneity, we synthesized their results qualitatively.

Results

Of 9,629 studies, 65 met our inclusion criteria. Among patients with outpatient opioid prescriptions, the following factors were associated with the development of misuse: any current or previous substance use (odds ratio [OR] 3.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.62 to 4.82), any mental health diagnosis (OR 2.45; 95% CI 1.91 to 3.15), younger age (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.81 to 2.64), and male sex (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.36).

Conclusion

Although clinicians should endeavor to offer alternative pain management strategies to all patients, those who are younger, are male patients, and report a history of or current substance use or mental health diagnoses were associated with a greater risk of developing opioid misuse. Clinicians should consider prioritizing alternative pain management strategies for these higher-risk patients.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^112dgYFH]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).
When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).
The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). TABLE Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management Sources: Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7. Abbreviations: mcg/hr = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent. * Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ -receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ -receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists.
If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.
Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥ 50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥ 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113LMk8q]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Although findings regarding risks for new long-term opioid use after use for acute pain relate specifically to patients who were previously opioid naïve, risks also might be associated with dosage escalation (see Recommendation 4) if patients already treated with long-term opioids are prescribed additional opioid medication for new acute pain superimposed on chronic pain. Therefore, strategies that minimize opioid use should be implemented for both opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant patients with acute pain when possible. If patients receiving long-term opioid therapy require additional medication for acute pain, nonopioid medications should be used when possible. If additional opioids are required (e.g. for superimposed severe acute pain), they should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including an appropriate taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).

ASIPP guidelines — Risk mitigation for opioid diversion, overdose, and addiction in chronic pain care states that these risks are present to some degree with all opioids and with all pain diagnoses, and that no single or simple change in prescribing behavior can be expected to alleviate all risks while properly managing pain. The following approaches can help mitigate all risks, including limiting the prescribed opioid to the lowest effective dose for the shortest effective duration, following recommended screening for addiction with all patients, using the PDMP and monitoring for diversion which is described as critical, and that all prescribers of opioids for pain management should expand the use of naloxone to prevent overdoses. It also notes that most patients with chronic non-cancer pain do not have the disease of addiction.

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen [^111xWjBY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

### The appropriate use of opiates in chronic pain [^113vXG9e]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic pain is a common but undertreated health problem in the United States. Opioids are effective for moderate-to-severe chronic pain, but these drugs must be used with care due to the risks for overdose and addiction. When initiating opioid treatment, physicians should perform a complete patient history, physical exam, and other appropriate testing and also assess the patient's risk for substance misuse, abuse, or addiction. Patients should be monitored regularly for both improvement of function and for aberrant drug behaviors. With proper monitoring and risk management, patients with chronic pain can be treated effectively and safely with opioids.

### Strategies to identify patient risks of prescription opioid addiction when initiating opioids for pain: a systematic review [^1121xWDD]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Methods

To identify relevant articles that examined risk factors for opioid addiction as defined by study authors, MEDLINE and Embase records from January 1946 to November 2018 were systematically searched. Search terms included opioid-related disorders; Medical Subject Headings terms substance related disorders, pain, and analgesics; and terms previously found to be useful for retrieving diagnostic studies. We also restricted eligibility to studies of opioid-naive patients newly starting opioid medications for pain and excluded studies assessing for a diagnosis of OUD among patients already receiving opioid medications. We also undertook a quality review of identified studies. Specifically, studies that evaluated prescription characteristics, patient characteristics (including a previous diagnosis of either a substance use disorder or mental health disorder), and screening tools assessing symptoms of prescription opioid addiction in the context of pain management, were considered if they met a predefined quality threshold (≥ 3) based on a 5-level hierarchy of evidence rating scale by Simel and Rennie. In accordance with the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for Diagnostic Test Accuracy reporting guideline and Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy reporting guideline, sources of bias for each study were also evaluated with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool. Following the policies of the University of British Columbia and Providence Healthcare Research Ethics Board, studies that use deidentified data are exempt from institutional review board approval; therefore, this study was not submitted for review.

### Opioid misuse and abuse: risk assessment and management in patients with cancer pain [^116x5vRh]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Low credibility.

The FDA's 2012 risk evaluation and mitigation strategy is a major step toward systematically reducing the inherent risks of chronic opioid therapy for pain, but does not distinguish between risks related to sources of pain. This article discusses the effect of risk mitigation in the treatment of cancer pain, with a focus on pretreatment screening and ongoing monitoring in this patient population that often requires pain management at some time during cancer treatment. Experience with screening, risk stratification, and interventions at one cancer center is shared, along with some recommendations for practice. A new screening checklist is proposed that summarizes known risk factors. Patients with cancer are not protected from the problems of opioid abuse/misuse, and the multidisciplinary cancer treatment team should coordinate an evaluation of risk and the monitoring of aberrant behaviors as part of the comprehensive care plan.

### What is "Opioid stewardship"? An overview of current definitions and proposal for a universally acceptable definition [^112PKGdK]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Currently, most opioid stewardship programs emphasise reducing prescription numbers and doses of opioids. There is a lack of emphasis on patient-centred decision-making regarding tapering decisions. Opioid tapering is a recommended strategy to reduce risks associated with chronic opioid therapy by reducing doses to a lower level. In particular, patients with OUD can be disadvantaged, increasing the risk of illicit opioid use and overdose.

A crucial element that the current opioid stewardship guidelines and definition need to incorporate is patient perspectives in shared decision-makings. The blanket approach of curbing down opioids with outcomes solely focused on prescription numbers and doses without considering patient-reported outcomes is less likely to be successful. It is important to involve patients, carers and multi-disciplinary healthcare professionals involved in their care. A previous study demonstrated that patient-reported outcomes were positively linked to the opportunity to interact with healthcare professionals and wider opioid stewardship programs.

While the current definitions of opioid stewardship mainly focus on "improvement or appropriateness of prescribing and monitoring the use of opioids", emphasis on two essential themes, ie, "appropriate procurement, inventory management and storage" and "promoting better communications between patients and prescribers", remain sparse. Also, the concept of perioperative opioid discharge planning is another essential component of stewardship, as all opioid-naive patients are counselled to avoid repeat/refill opioid prescriptions without physicians' consultation. Most opioid stewardship interventions are multi-component, involving clinical interventions, care processes, and implementation strategies. Provisions of education, policies, dashboards, audit and feedback, monitoring and metrics, health information exchange, and electronic health record tools were some implementation strategies identified by the present review.

Determining Whether or Not to Initiate Opioids for Pain

All patients with pain should receive treatment that provides the greatest benefits relative to risks. (See Recommendation 1 for determining whether or not to initiate opioids for acute pain [i.e. pain lasting < 1 month] and Recommendation 2 for determining whether or not to initiate opioids for subacute pain [i.e. pain lasting 1–3 months] or chronic pain [i.e. pain lasting > 3 months].)

Recommendation 1

Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Before prescribing opioid therapy for acute pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 3).

### Strategies to identify patient risks of prescription opioid addiction when initiating opioids for pain: a systematic review [^112XpE5F]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Although prescription opioid use disorder is associated with substantial harms, strategies to identify patients with pain among whom prescription opioids can be safely prescribed have not been systematically reviewed.

Objective

To review the evidence examining factors associated with opioid addiction and screening tools for identifying adult patients at high vs low risk of developing symptoms of prescription opioid addiction when initiating prescription opioids for pain.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and Embase (January 1946 to November 2018) were searched for articles investigating risks of prescription opioid addiction.

Study Selection

Original studies that were included compared symptoms, signs, risk factors, and screening tools among patients who developed prescription opioid addiction and those who did not.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently assessed quality to exclude biased or unreliable study designs and extracted data from higher quality studies. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) reporting guideline was followed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Likelihood ratios (LRs) for risk factors and screening tools were calculated.

Results

Of 1287 identified studies, 6 high-quality studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and 4 were included in the quantitative synthesis. The 4 high-quality studies included in the quantitative synthesis were all retrospective studies including a total of 2 888 346 patients with 4470 cases that met the authors' definitions of prescription opioid addiction. A history of opioid use disorder (LR range, 17–22) or other substance use disorder (LR range, 4.2–17), certain mental health diagnoses (eg, personality disorder: LR, 27; 95% CI, 18–41), and concomitant prescription of certain psychiatric medications (eg, atypical antipsychotics: LR, 17; 95% CI, 15–18) appeared useful for identifying patients at high risk of opioid addiction. Among individual findings, only the absence of a mood disorder (negative LR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.45–0.52) was associated with a lower risk of opioid addiction. Despite their widespread use, most screening tools involving combinations of questions were based on low-quality studies or, when diagnostic performance was assessed among high-quality studies, demonstrated poor performance in helping to identify patients at high vs low risk.

Conclusions and Relevance

While a history of substance use disorder, certain mental health diagnoses, and concomitant prescription of certain psychiatric medications appeared useful for identifying patients at higher risk, few quality studies were available and no symptoms, signs, or screening tools were particularly useful for identifying those at lower risk.

Risk Assessment Tools

While this review identified 31 studies that have evaluated risk assessment tools for prescription OUD, only 2 studies (which examined 5 individual tools) met criteria to be defined as high quality and, thus, were included (Table 2). Furthermore, despite risk assessment tools becoming a widespread aspect of the prescribing of opioids in some pain management settings, their ability to identify patients at high vs low risk was limited. Among the tools evaluated through high-quality studies, the Pain Medication Questionnaire (PMQ) (cutoff score ≥ 30) appeared most promising, although its ability to differentiate patients at high risk from those at low risk was poor overall (Table 2). Among the PMQ validation sample, having 30 or more positive answers modestly increased the likelihood of symptoms of prescription OUD (LR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4–4.8). However, having fewer than 30 positive answers had marginal utility for identifying those least likely to develop prescription OUD (negative LR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60–0.94). In addition to its limited ability to discern patients at high risk from those at low risk and the fact that the PMQ is only useful for patients who have had pain treated in the past, the tool may be cumbersome, requiring approximately 10 minutes to administer. Similarly, no scale proved useful for assessing patients newly presenting with chronic or acute pain. Nevertheless, the PMQ is different from other scales because it assesses patient agreement with statements about their beliefs concerning past pain relief and behaviors in addressing pain, rather than traditional risk factors such as prior substance use disorders or comorbid conditions. Examples of questions include items such as "In the past, I have had some difficulty getting the medication I need from my doctor(s)" and "At times, I take pain medication when I feel anxious and sad, or when I need help sleeping".

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen (Endocet) [^113rGrDF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

ENDOCET should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of ENDOCET for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with ENDOCET. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with ENDOCET [see WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression; PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients/ Caregivers].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing regulations (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see WARNINGS, Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants].

Consider prescribing naloxone when the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

### Mortality among people with opioid use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Yupdz]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Opioids are among the most commonly used class of illicit drugs. We aimed to produce pooled estimates of mortality risks among people with opioid use disorder (OUD), with a focus upon all-cause mortality, and also overdose-specific causes of death.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of cohorts of people with OUD involving illicit opioids with data on all-cause or overdose-specific mortality.

Setting and Participants

Of 4247 papers, 92 were eligible, reporting on 101 cohorts that measured all-cause mortality and opioid-overdose mortality. Cohorts (n = 101–229,274) were in North America, Australia, several Eastern and Western European countries, and Asia.

Measurement

Titles/abstracts and full texts were independently screened by 2 reviewers, with discrepancies resolved via a third reviewer. We extracted data on crude mortality rates (CMRs) per 1000 person-years (PY); we imputed CMRs where possible if not reported by study authors. We also calculated mortality relative risks. Data were pooled using random-effects models; potential reasons for heterogeneity were explored using subgroup analyses and meta-regressions.

Findings

The overall all-cause CMR was 18.7 per 1000 PY (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.1–20.3). The overall overdose-specific CMR was 7.0 per 1000 PY (95% CI 6.1–8.0). All-cause and overdose-specific mortality were substantially higher in low/middle-income countries, among those with HIV, and among people who use injection drugs.

Conclusions

Individuals with OUD carry a high risk of all-cause and overdose-specific mortality. Potentially modifiable risk factors, such as HIV and injection drug use, were predictive of mortality risk and are amenable to global efforts aiming to improve access to OUD treatment and targeted harm reduction efforts.

Regarding medical management for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to choice of agent and dosage, DoD/VA 2022 guidelines recommend to reevaluate patient-specific risks and benefits and monitor for adverse events, including opioid use disorder and risk of overdose with increasing dosage, when considering an increase in opioid dosage.

### Strategies to identify patient risks of prescription opioid addiction when initiating opioids for pain: a systematic review [^11642VTQ]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

This review found that a history of opioid or nonopioid substance use disorder, concomitant prescription of certain psychiatric medications, prolonged duration of opioid prescriptions (≥ 30 days), higher daily opioid doses, and a history of certain mental health disorders may be useful for identifying patients at high risk for prescription OUD, whereas only the absence of a mood disorder was useful for identifying patients at lower risk. The review also found that most screening tools are from low-quality studies and that no screening tool was particularly useful for identifying patients for whom opioids can be safely prescribed. Furthermore, few high-quality studies exist that can inform clinicians and policy makers on how to manage this difficult and important public health problem. These findings, alongside persistently high rates of opioid prescribing and the literature demonstrating the overall harms and limited benefits of prescription opioids in many pain conditions, suggest that prescribers should be better aware of the major diagnostic limitations of assessing patient characteristics and using screening tools when seeking to identify patients who may safely be prescribed opioid medications.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^112uGmtg]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

For patients already taking opioids long term (both established patients and patients transferring from other clinicians), the possibility of opioid dosage reduction might provoke substantial anxiety. In addition, tapering opioids after years of taking them can be especially challenging because of physical and psychological dependence. However, patients should be offered the opportunity to reevaluate their continued use of opioids. Clinicians should review benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with empathy.

Whenever possible, clinicians should collaborate with patients and share decision-making about whether and how to taper opioids. Clinicians should review benefits and risks of opioid therapy with the patient and decide whether tapering is appropriate for the patient. If the existing opioid regimen does not put the patient at imminent risk for overdose or other injury, tapering does not need to occur immediately, and clinicians can take time to reach agreement with patients. For patients who agree to taper opioids to lower dosages, clinicians should collaborate with the patient on a tapering plan. Open discussion between the clinician and patient should take place, whether the goal of the taper is stopping opioids or reducing opioids to a point where benefits outweigh risks; the goal will depend on the patient's circumstances and an individualized assessment of benefits and risks. Tapering is more likely to be successful when patients collaborate in the taper. Clinicians can discuss with patients the patient's perceptions of benefits, risks, and adverse effects of continued opioid therapy; include patient concerns in taper planning; and include patients in making decisions such as which medication will be decreased first (e.g. in patients prescribed more than one opioid) and how quickly tapering will occur.

Providing Advice to Patients Before Tapering

Clinicians should advise patients that overall, after voluntary reduction of long-term opioid dosages, most patients report stable or improved function, anxiety, and mood without worsening pain or with decreased pain levels (,–). However, other patients report insomnia, anxiety, depression, and increased pain, particularly in the short term. Increased pain might be related to hyperalgesia or opioid withdrawal and can be prolonged in some patients. Patients can be counseled that worsening of pain is a frequent symptom of opioid withdrawal that tends to diminish over time. Clinicians should advise patients about the increased risk for overdose with abrupt return to a previously prescribed higher dosage because of loss of opioid tolerance and warn of a risk for overdose if the patient returns to their original dosage. Clinicians should provide opioid overdose education and offer naloxone.

### Balancing opioid analgesia with the risk of nonmedical opioid use in patients with cancer [^117GkZD9]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

The current opioid crisis has brought renewed attention and scrutiny to opioid prescriptions. When patients receiving opioid therapy for pain engage in nonmedical opioid use (NMOU) or diversion, untoward consequences can occur. New evidence suggests that patients with cancer might be at a higher risk of NMOU than was previously thought, but clinical evidence still supports the use of opioid analgesics as the gold standard to treat cancer-related pain, creating a dilemma in patient management. Clinicians are encouraged to adopt a universal precautions approach to patients with cancer receiving opioids, which includes screening all patients; discussing the risks, benefits, adverse effects and alternatives of opioid therapy; and providing education on safe use, storage and disposal. Use of urine drug tests, prescription drug monitoring programmes and close observation of behaviours related to opioid use help to ensure treatment adherence, detect NMOU and support therapeutic decision-making. These measures can optimize the risk-benefit ratio while supporting safe opioid use. In this Review, we examine the role of opioids in cancer pain, the risk of substance use disorder and methods to achieve the right balance between the two in order to ensure safe opioid use.

### Are prescription opioids driving the opioid crisis? Assumptions vs facts [^112WpCLN]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline for Chronic Pain

In March 2016, the CDC published an opioid prescribing guideline for chronic pain in primary care. Of its 12 recommendations, most represent standard practice, including risk mitigation strategies. A minority of these recommendations, however, provoked intense criticism and alarm by pain professionals and patient advocacy groups, and concerns by the American Medical Association, American Cancer Society, American Academy of Pain Management, American Academy of Pain Medicine, and other organizations. The CDC guidelines have already begun to have a major impact on opioid prescribing. Nonetheless, they perpetuate the misperceptions of opioid analgesics discussed above. Discussion of specific recommendations is beyond the scope of this paper, but aspects of the development process merit closer attention, as this shaped the contents of the end product.

Guideline recommendations can be influenced by the opinions, experience, and makeup of the Guideline Development Group (GDG). Instead of placing patient needs as the priority, practices can be regulated to control costs, serve societal needs, or protect special interests. Much of the opposition to the CDC guideline reflected the perception that it was not patient-centered.

Review available low-cost options for pain management for all patients, and particularly for patients who have low incomes, do not have health insurance, or have inadequate insurance. Review considerations related to access to care because of the clinical oversight needed to initiate and continue opioid therapy and other treatments for pain.
Be explicit and realistic about expected benefits of opioids, explaining that there is not robust evidence that opioids improve pain or function with long-term use and that complete elimination of pain is unlikely.
Emphasize improvement in function as a primary goal and that function can improve even when pain is not eliminated.
Advise patients about serious adverse effects of opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and development of a potentially serious opioid use disorder that can cause distress and inability to fulfill major obligations at work, school, or home.
Advise patients about common effects of opioids, such as constipation, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms when stopping opioids. To prevent constipation associated with opioid use, advise patients to increase hydration and fiber intake and to maintain or increase physical activity. Prophylactic pharmacologic therapy (e.g. a stimulant laxative such as senna, with or without a stool softener) is usually needed to ensure regular bowel movements if opioids are taken regularly. Stool softeners or fiber laxatives without another laxative should be avoided.
If formulations are prescribed that combine opioids with acetaminophen, advise patients of the risks for taking additional over-the-counter products containing acetaminophen.
Discuss effects that opioids might have on ability to safely operate a vehicle or other machinery, particularly when opioids are initiated, when dosages are increased, or when other central nervous system depressants, such as benzodiazepines or alcohol, are used concurrently.
Discuss the potential for workplace toxicology testing programs to detect therapeutic opioid use.
Discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder, respiratory depression, and death at higher dosages, along with the importance of taking only the amount of opioids prescribed (i.e. not taking more opioids than prescribed or taking them more often).
Review increased risks for respiratory depression when opioids are taken with benzodiazepines, other sedatives, alcohol, nonprescribed drugs such as heroin, or other opioids.
Discuss risks for household members and other persons if opioids are intentionally or unintentionally shared with others for whom they are not prescribed, including the possibility that others might experience overdose at the same or at lower dosage than prescribed for the patient and that young children are susceptible to unintentional ingestion. Discuss storage of opioids in a secure, preferably locked location and options for safe disposal of unused opioids.
Discuss the importance of periodic reassessment to ensure that opioids are helping to meet patient goals and, if opioids are not effective or are harmful, to allow opportunities for consideration of opioid tapering and dosage reduction or discontinuation and of additional nonpharmacologic or nonopioid pharmacologic treatment options.
Discuss expectations for clinician and patient responsibilities to mitigate risks of opioid therapy and planned use of precautions to reduce risks, including naloxone for overdose reversal (see Recommendation 8) and clinician use of PDMP information (see Recommendation 9) and toxicology screening (see Recommendation 10).
Consider whether cognitive status might interfere with management of opioid therapy and, if so, determine whether a caregiver can responsibly comanage medication therapy. Discuss the importance of reassessing medication use over time with both the patient and caregiver, as appropriate.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen [^115CzNjb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets [see WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression; PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients/Caregivers].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing regulations (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see WARNINGS, Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants].

Consider prescribing naloxone when the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

### Principles for ensuring the safe management of pain medication prescriptions by occupational and environmental physicians [^114efpTc]. ACOEM (2016). Medium credibility.

ACOEM Practice Guidelines — opioid prescribing safeguards intended to decrease the inappropriate and harmful use of opioids for non-cancer-related chronic pain state that physicians should use evidence-based treatment guidelines addressing the appropriate use of prescription medications (including opioids and other Schedule II medications), are strongly encouraged to take advantage of continuing medical education on the safe prescription of pain medications, and should use principles of informed choice with patients before starting opioid therapy by advising about risks in relation to potential benefit. For acute pain, physicians should set expectations for discontinuation and limit quantities to what is clinically needed; in most non-operative cases opioids should be limited to several days, preferably less than a week and not to exceed 2 weeks. Long-term opioid use, greater than 4 weeks in the absence of clear recurrent physical issues such as care for extensive burns or repeated surgical procedures, should only occur after careful patient evaluation, discussion of the risks and benefits, and a clear explanation of rules for safe use, and other therapeutic measures should be exhausted before beginning a chronic opioid trial.

### Factors associated with the prescribing of high-dose opioids in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111yiCt4]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We pooled patient-level data from over four million participants taking opioids and found that high doses of opioids are associated with the co-prescription of benzodiazepines, depression, more visits to emergency departments, unemployment, and male gender. We conclude that people taking opioids in high doses are at a greater risk of harm which warrants closer management in primary care.

Comparison with existing literature

Our review is the first to synthesize factors associated with high-dose opioids in primary care, so comparison with existing systematic reviews is not possible. Others have conducted a narrative review on the association between opioid dose and the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and death which concluded that increasing opioid dose is associated with an increased risk of serious harm. Quinlan and colleagues conducted a review on the risk factors for opioid dependence following surgery and proposed strategies to mitigate dependence including the avoidance of repeat opioid prescriptions postoperatively. Our findings align with the notion of "adverse selection", whereby the riskiest drugs and doses are prescribed to those who will most probably be harmed by them. Thus, biases in prescribers' clinical decision-making may underlie some of the observed associations.

Anxiety was not associated with high doses of opioids despite people taking high doses to be three times more likely to have benzodiazepines co-prescribed. Campbell et al. found one fifth of people taking both high- and low-dose opioids to have moderate to severe anxiety while Kobus et al. found those on high doses to be twice as likely to have an ICD-9 code for anxiety than people on low doses. This may be explained by comorbidities, such as insomnia, and the severity of anxiety reported by participants. Non-pharmacological treatments for anxiety are the preferred first-line treatment for people on opioids.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113ZMsv1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

This clinical practice guideline is

a clinical tool to improve communication between clinicians and patients and empower them to make informed, person-centered decisions related to pain care together;
intended for primary care clinicians and other clinicians providing pain care for outpatients aged ≥ 18 years with acute pain (duration of < 1 month), subacute pain (duration of 1–3 months), or chronic pain (duration of > 3 months); and
intended to be flexible to enable person-centered decision-making, taking into account a patient's expected health outcomes and well-being.

This clinical practice guideline is not

a replacement for clinical judgment or individualized, person-centered care;
intended to be applied as inflexible standards of care across patients or patient populations by health care professionals, health systems, pharmacies, third-party payers, or governmental jurisdictions or to lead to the rapid tapering or abrupt discontinuation of opioids for patients;
a law, regulation, or policy that dictates clinical practice or as a substitute for Food and Drug Administration–approved labeling;
applicable to management of pain related to sickle cell disease, management of cancer-related pain, or palliative care or end-of-life care; or
focused on opioids prescribed for opioid use disorder.

CDC developed a draft clinical practice guideline on the basis of five systematic reviews of the best-available evidence on the benefits and risks of prescription opioids, nonopioid pharmacologic treatments, and nonpharmacologic treatments. The draft clinical practice guideline was reviewed by an independent federal advisory committee (the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control), peer reviewers, and the public and was revised after feedback from these reviews. Additional insights from patients, caregivers, and clinicians shared during virtual conversations held in 2020 were incorporated in the update. Importantly, to discourage the misapplication of opioid pain medication dosage thresholds as inflexible standards, revised recommendation statement language emphasizes principles such as avoiding increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients. More-specific considerations related to dosage have been moved to implementation considerations that follow each recommendation statement, where more nuance is offered to inform clinical decision-making and individualized patient care.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111vpjyP]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients who started opioid therapy for acute pain and are continuing to receive opioids for subacute pain might be at a particularly critical point for potential transition to chronic pain and potential transition to long-term opioid therapy. Clinicians should follow up with and evaluate patients with subacute pain who have been treated with opioid therapy for 30 days. Clinicians should ensure that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment, but only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient. Clinicians should reassess the patient's pain, function, and treatment course; ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed; and optimize pain management as needed (see Recommendation 2).

In analyses of placebo-controlled trials, the clinical evidence reviews found that effects of opioids on mean improvement in pain and in function were greater at 1–3 months than at 3–6 months. A cohort study found an association between longer duration of therapy and increased risk for new-onset depression. Because of potential changes in the balance of benefits and risks of opioid therapy over time, clinicians should regularly reassess all patients receiving long-term opioid therapy, including patients who are new to the clinician but on long-term opioid therapy, with a suggested interval of every 3 months or more frequently. Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2). Clinicians should reevaluate patients who are at greater risk for opioid use disorder or overdose (e.g. patients with depression or other mental health conditions, a history of substance use disorder, a history of overdose, taking ≥ 50 MME/day, or taking other central nervous system depressants with opioids) more frequently than every 3 months. Clinicians should regularly screen all patients for these conditions, which can change during the course of treatment (see Recommendation 8). Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize unintended effects on patients by ensuring all patients can access and afford follow-up evaluation. In addition, policymakers can consider evidence-based methods of minimizing barriers to care (e.g. paid sick leave). In practice contexts where virtual visits are part of standard care (e.g. in remote areas where distance or other context makes follow-up visits challenging), or for patients for whom in-person follow-up visits are challenging (e.g. frail patients), follow-up assessments that allow the clinician to communicate with and observe the patient through telehealth modalities might be conducted when available.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113hBnpt]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Four observational studies identified in the clinical evidence reviews consistently found an association between higher doses of long-term opioids and risk for overdose or overdose death. Opioid dosages for chronic pain of 50 to < 100 MME/day in observational studies have been associated with increased risks for opioid overdose by factors of 1.9–4.6 compared with dosages of 1 to < 20 MME/day, and dosages of ≥ 100 MME/day were found to be associated with increased risks for overdose 2.0–8.9 times the risk at 1 to < 20 MME/day, after adjusting for confounders on the basis of demographics, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and other factors. When opioids are prescribed for acute pain, similar associations have been found, with dosages of 50 to < 100 MME/day associated with 4.73 times the risk for overdose and dosages of ≥ 100 MME/day associated with 6.64 times the risk, compared with dosages of 1 to < 20 MME/day. The MME cut points in these studies (e.g. 20 MME, 50 MME, and 100 MME) were selected by the authors for research purposes, and whereas their findings are consistent with progressive increases in overdose risk being associated with increases in prescribed opioid dosages, they do not demonstrate a specific dosage threshold below which opioids are never associated with overdose. In a national sample of Veterans Health Administration patients with chronic pain who were prescribed opioids, mean prescribed daily opioid dosage among patients who died from opioid overdose was 98 MME (median: 60 MME), compared with mean prescribed daily opioid dosage of 48 MME (median: 25 MME) among patients not experiencing fatal overdose. A narrative review conducted by FDA staff concluded that, although there is not a single dosage threshold below which overdose risk is eliminated, the studies included in the review indicated an increasing risk for serious adverse health outcomes, including misuse, overdose, and death associated with increasing opioid dose. These studies examined dose-response risk for overdose for full agonist opioids and not for partial agonist opioids such as buprenorphine, which is unlikely to have the same continuous association between dosage and overdose risk because respiratory depressant effects of buprenorphine reach a plateau.

### Changes in initial opioid prescribing practices after the 2016 release of the CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain [^112VrpdE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Opioid prescribing began to increase in the US in the 1990s, continued to increase thereafter, and peaked in 2010, resulting in millions of people using opioids for pain management. Although the public health crisis of opioid overdose has evolved over time, with use of heroin and other synthetic opioids (eg, fentanyl)increasing in relative importance in the past decade, prescription opioid overdose death rates have remained high. In addition, individuals receiving prescription opioids are at increased risk of developing opioid use disorder, with approximately 4 in 5 people who initiate heroin use having previously misused prescription opioids, and many patients presenting with heroin overdose have a history of having received an opioid prescription. Given these facts and the lack of evidence-based guidelines to encourage opioid stewardship, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the "Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain"in 2016 (hereafter, CDC guideline).

The voluntary CDC guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to encourage clinicians in primary care settings to use caution when prescribing opioids for adults with chronic, noncancer pain. The purpose of the guideline is to (1) improve patient-physician communication about the risks and benefits of opioid therapy, (2) enhance safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, and (3) reduce risks of long-term opioid use. When opioids are prescribed, the CDC guideline provides recommendations on dosage and duration, including when opioids are used for acute pain prescribing for a period similar to the expected duration of severe pain (in which 3 days or less is often sufficient and more than 7 days is rarely needed) and the lowest daily dosage at which pain is reduced should be used (with special care taken surrounding dosages of 50 morphine milligram equivalents [MMEs] or more per day). How these recommendations corresponded to changes in prescribing for patients who are opioid naive, beyond just those affected by chronic pain, remains an open question.

These included the Opioid Risk Tool (LR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.76–2.9), Brief Risk Questionnaire (LR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.96–1.6), Brief Risk Interview (LR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.96–1.6), and Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (LR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.94–1.4) (tools' characteristics are shown in Table 3 and eTable 2 in the Supplement). Furthermore, when their ability to discern patients at high vs low risk was critically assessed using 95% confidence intervals of LRs, none of these risk assessment tools appeared useful (Table 2).

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1154BiF8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical evidence reviews identified an observational study finding long-term (> 90 days' supply) opioid prescription to be associated with considerably increased risk for a new opioid use disorder diagnosis for all dosages of long-term (> 90 days' supply) opioids prescribed compared with no opioids prescribed, with adjusted odds ratios of 15, 29, and 122 at low (1–36 MME/day), medium (36–120 MME/day), and high (≥ 120 MME/day) opioid dosages, respectively. Compared with no opioid use, opioid use was associated with increased risk for opioid use disorder, overdose, all-cause deaths, fractures, falls, and myocardial infarction.

Multiple experts from OWG stated that they appreciated this recommendation because of the importance of highlighting both pain and function, sharing realistic expectations with patients before initiating treatment, and paying attention to tapering and exit strategies. Although some experts reasoned the recommendation statement could state nonopioid therapies "may be preferred" or "may be effective" for chronic pain, others agreed with language that nonopioid therapies "are preferred" for chronic pain because opioid therapies are associated with small short-term benefits compared with placebo, comparable or reduced short-term benefits compared with nonopioid therapies, uncertain long-term benefits, and potential for serious harms.

Opioids should not be considered first-line or routine therapy for subacute or chronic pain. Although evidence on long-term benefits of nonopioid therapies also is limited, these therapies also are associated with short-term benefits, no evidence exists for attenuated benefit over time or difficulty stopping therapy when benefits do not outweigh risks, and risks for serious harms are usually lower. This does not mean that patients should be required to sequentially fail nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or be required to use any specific treatment before proceeding to opioid therapy. Rather, expected benefits specific to the clinical context should be weighed against risks before initiating therapy. In some clinical contexts (e.g. serious illness in a patient with poor prognosis for return to previous level of function, contraindications to other therapies, and clinician and patient agreement that the overriding goal is patient comfort), opioids might be appropriate regardless of previous therapies used. In other situations (e.g. headache or fibromyalgia), expected benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to outweigh risks regardless of previous nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies used.

### Opioid use and driving performance [^116VrHZM]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The USA is in an opioid epidemic, with an increased number of individuals taking psychoactive drugs while executing the tasks of everyday life, including operating a motor vehicle. The pharmacology of opioids has been widely studied, but the effects of opioids on psychomotor function, driving performance, and the risk of motor vehicle collision remain less clear. Clinicians are faced with the challenge of controlling patient pain while also reconciling conflicting messages from the literature about how safe it is for their patients taking opioids to engage in potentially dangerous routine tasks.

Discussion

This review assesses the current literature regarding opioids as they relate to neurocognitive function, driving performance, and accident risk. Manuscripts are categorized by study context and subject matter: controlled experimental administration, illicit use, prescription use, retrospective forensic toxicology, and polydrug consumption.

Conclusion

Illicit use, initiation of therapy, and opioid use in combination with other psychoactive medications are contexts most clearly associated with impairment of driving-related functions and/or operation of a motor vehicle. Clinicians should counsel patients on the risk of impairment when initiating therapy, when co-prescribing opioids and other psychoactive drugs, or when a patient is suspected of having an opioid use disorder.

### Codeine sulfate [^114Yak2e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1
Important Dosage
and Administration
Instructions

Codeine sulfate tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of codeine sulfate tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.
Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.
There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with codeine sulfate tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of
Opioid Overdose

Discussthe availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with codeine sulfate tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)].

Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

### Benefit-risk analysis of buprenorphine for pain management [^116jGVFe]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Overall, the safety data and additional benefits of buprenorphine suggest that it has a lower risk of adverse events compared with conventional opioids, most notably with respiratory depression. However, all opioids, including buprenorphine, carry the risk of adverse events and addiction potential, depending on the dose. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the risks and benefits of each opioid before prescribing. Health care providers should consider using one or more opioid risk screening tools before the initiation of any opioid therapy.

### Rational urine drug monitoring in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain: consensus recommendations [^114AvTTp]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Expert Panel Discussion

The expert panelists suggest that patients be assessed for risk of aberrant medication-taking behavior, misuse, and opioid use disorder to determine the frequency of UDM. A high-dose cutoff alone (e.g. 120-mg morphine equivalent dose per day) was perceived as being inadequate for identifying high-risk patients because high doses may be appropriate to accommodate development of tolerance in specific patients. In addition, patients predisposed to misuse may be at risk of opioid use disorder or unsafe use even with low to moderate doses.

No specific risk assessment tool or behavioral assessment is recommended by panelists. Clinicians are encouraged to choose one or more of the many available tools that match their preferences and can be incorporated into their electronic medical records and work flow. Understanding why specific factors predict risk is more important than knowledge of the risk assessment tools themselves (Figure 3). Risk stratification is not static, and regular reevaluation of patient circumstances (e.g. loss of a job, divorce) is recommended. An unexpected UDM result increases a patient's risk of misuse and opioid use disorder, necessitates more frequent testing, and prompts reconsideration of whether to modify opioid therapy or refer the patient to a pain or addiction specialist.

### Strategies to identify patient risks of prescription opioid addiction when initiating opioids for pain: a systematic review [^1157TAKE]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. While prior reviews have attempted to describe risk factors or opioid risk screening tools that can be used to classify patients into high- vs low-risk categories, to our knowledge, none have conducted rigorous quality assessments or used LRs as a strategy to assess the diagnostic utility of screening for risk factors or screening tools. Recently, an earlier similar reviewon this topic has been updated, but our review used a more systematic approach and quality assessment of reviewed studies. Specifically, our study quality assessment resulted in the exclusion of most studies included in earlier reviews on this topic. Nevertheless, the present review's limitations highlight the gaps that exist in the literature in this area (eg, the identified heterogeneity among the included studies due to patient population, care setting, and criteria for diagnosis). In fact, the diagnosis of prescription opioid addiction in the context of chronic pain can be challenging, and studies included in this review used varying definitions (eg, DSM-III, DSM-IV, ICD-9) for the diagnosis of prescription opioid addiction. Because its definition has not been consistent in the pain literature, we considered a wide definition of prescription opioid addiction based on the definitions used by study authors (eTable 8 in the Supplement). Although the low incidence of OUD found in the large cohort studies, might suggest that patients with an OUD diagnosis in those studies were more likely to have severe OUD, this explanation requires further investigation.

While it would be hoped that individual patient characteristics and risk screening tools might prove useful, when subjected to critical review, only a few individual patient characteristics (often identified in only 1 unreplicated study) helped identify patients at high risk, and no individual patient characteristics, other than the absence of a mood disorder, or screening tools appeared particularly useful for safely identifying patients at lower risk. Instead, most screening tools, including the commonly used Opioid Risk Tool, were based on lower-quality studies or, when test performance was assessed by calculating LRs, demonstrated poor diagnostic performance.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^115AbWS9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 2

Nonopioid therapies are preferred for subacute and chronic pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider initiating opioid therapy if expected benefits for pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Before starting opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy, should work with patients to establish treatment goals for pain and function, and should consider how opioid therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 2).

### Opioid agonist treatment and risk of mortality during opioid overdose public health emergency: population based retrospective cohort study [^116vEx26]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The global burden of disease due to opioid use disorder continues to grow. Between 1990 and 2016, the total number (age standardised prevalence) of people dependent on opioids increased from 18.2 million (360.8 per 100 000) to 26.8 million (353.0 per 100 000), resulting in 86 200 deaths and 36.6 million years of life lost in 2016. In North America, the introduction of illicitly manufactured fentanyl and other highly potent, synthetic opioids in the drug supply has contributed to a rapidly worsening disease burden. In Canada, an unprecedented 4614 opioid related deaths occurred in 2018, with nearly three quarters of these deaths involving fentanyl or other synthetic opioids. People with opioid use disorder are at high risk of exposure to these contaminants, which are up to 10 000 times more potent than morphine. This is contributing to a mounting global public health concern as fentanyl and other synthetic opioids become more widespread internationally.

Opioid agonist treatment (OAT), primarily with methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone, is a safe and effective treatment for opioid use disorder that has been shown to suppress illicit opioid use and reduce the risk of death. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies conducted between 1974 and 2016 found that being on treatment was associated with a lower risk of death from all causes and from overdose. However, the risk of death changed according to time since starting or stopping treatment and differed by medication type. Pooled analyses concluded that all cause mortality was reduced by a factor of 3.2 (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 3.9) when people were taking methadone and 2.2 (1.3 to 3.6) when they were taking buprenorphine/naloxone. The risk of death was highest in the first four weeks after stopping treatment (32.0 deaths per 100 000 person years on methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone), with a swift decline in the risk of death observed thereafter. These findings are important because people frequently stop and start these medications, and this exposes them to repeated periods of high risk of death. Excess mortality after stopping treatment can be explained by a loss of tolerance to illicit opioids during treatment, which increases the risk of fatal overdose after resuming illicit opioid use. Other factors that may contribute to the high risk of death after stopping treatment include subsequent disruptions in care for concurrent conditions and lifestyle instability that increases the risk of death due to other causes.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^112eaxGM]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP dose descriptions — morphine milligram equivalents (MME) thresholds and overdose risk note that, with overwhelming evidence for the risk of misuse and limited efficacy of chronic opioid therapy, the rationale for high-dose opioids is limited and absolute MME cut offs remain inconsistent. Generally, patients who do not respond to low or medium opioid doses are unlikely to respond to higher doses. Guidance thresholds cited include State of Washington advice that the daily dose of opioids should not exceed 120 mg of MME; American Pain Society/AAPM defining "high doses" as 100 mg MME; CDC guidelines recommended a limit of 50–90 MME; ASIPP designation of low dose as 40 MME; and a Canadian "watchful dose" at 200 MME. Reported overdose risk signals include increased risk when dose is equivalent to 50 MME or higher, a 9-fold increase in overdoses at higher doses of opioids (> 100 MME) versus lower doses (< 20 MME), greater overdose risk if daily doses are above 40 MME, and much higher overdose death rates at higher doses (200–400 MME) and at very high doses > 400 MME).

### Opioid prescription patterns and risk factors associated with opioid use in the Netherlands [^116LNY7c]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

An increase in opioid prescription has been observed in the Netherlands. It is vital to understand this increase and to identify risk factors for opioid prescription to ensure that health interventions remain appropriately targeted.

Objectives

To determine the prevalence of opioid prescriptions and adverse events associated with opioids, and to identify risk factors associated with opioid prescription in the Dutch population.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used national statistics from the Netherlands from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2017, including the full Dutch population of 16 779 575 people in 2013 and 17 081 507 people in 2017. Data from the Dutch Health Monitor surveys of 2012 and 2016 were also included. Databases were anonymized prior to analysis. All analyses were performed between December 2018 and February 2019.

Exposure

Opioid prescription.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were the dynamics of opioid prescriptions, hospital admissions for opioid overdose, and opioid overdose mortalities. The secondary outcome was risk factors associated with opioid prescription.

Results

In 2013, 814 211 individuals (4.9% of the total population) received an opioid prescription. In 2017, 1 027 019 individuals (6.0% of the total population) received at least 1 opioid prescription (mean [SD] age, 59.3 [18.5] years; 613 203 [59.7%] women). The rate of hospital admissions for opioid overdose was 9.2 per 100 000 inhabitants in 2013 and 13.1 per 100 000 inhabitants in 2017 (relative risk, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.34–1.52]). Similarly, an increased risk of opioid overdose death was observed, from 0.83 per 100 000 inhabitants in 2013 to 1.2 per 100 000 inhabitants in 2017 (relative risk, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.20–1.85]). Based on data from the 2012 Dutch Health Monitor survey, risk factors associated with opioid prescription included being older than 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 4.20 [95% CI, 3.98–4.43]), having only a primary school education (OR, 3.62 [95% CI, 3.46–3.77]), being widowed (OR, 3.30 [95% CI, 3.13–3.49]), reporting always feeling symptoms of depression (OR, 3.77 [95% CI, 3.41–4.18]), and reporting poor or very poor physical health (OR, 10.40 [95% CI, 10.01–10.81]). Self-reported back pain (OR, 4.34 [95% CI, 4.23–4.46]) and rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia (OR, 3.77 [95% CI, 3.65–3.90]) were also associated with opioid prescription. However, unemployment (OR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.96–1.13]) was not associated with opioid prescription, and alcohol use disorder (OR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.73–0.80]) was negatively associated with opioid prescription.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that opioid prescriptions have increased in the Netherlands. Although the risk of adverse events is still relatively low, there is an urgent need to review pain management to prevent a further increase in opioid prescription.

### Strategies to identify patient risks of prescription opioid addiction when initiating opioids for pain: a systematic review [^113v8Pdq]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Recently published estimates suggest that more than one-third of US civilian, noninstitutionalized adults used prescription opioids in 2015. However, despite the public health emergency related to prescription opioid addiction, this review demonstrated that there are few quality studies available to help health care professionals determine which patients are likely to develop OUD and that incidence of prescription opioid addiction has likely been underestimated in high-quality (level ≥ 3) studies. Among single high-quality studies, having a history of a substance use disorder (opioid or nonopioid) or mental health diagnosis (eg, personality disorder, somatoform disorder, psychotic disorder, or anxiety disorder) was associated with a substantial increase in the likelihood of developing a prescription OUD. Furthermore, certain opioid prescription characteristics, including a duration of 30 days or greater, a daily dose greater than 120 morphine milligram equivalents, and concurrent prescriptions of atypical antipsychotics, were associated with an increase in the likelihood of developing a prescription OUD. However, few of these findings have been replicated in more than 1 study. Quality replication studies are needed. Furthermore, only the absence of mood disorder produced negative LRs that modestly lowered risk for prescription OUD, whereas none of the other findings were useful for identifying patients at lower risk. Finally, despite risk assessment tools becoming a widespread aspect of the prescribing of opioids in pain management care environments, they appeared to be of little value for identifying patients at high vs low risk.

While not relevant to the assessments of most individual characteristics or medication characteristics, one explanation for the poor performance of risk prediction tools may be that the act of screening may change patient behavior and/or decision making by physicians, lowering the overall incidence rate of prescription OUD. In other words, risk prediction tools may have low apparent diagnostic accuracy because the assessment process itself lowers the incidence of prescription OUD in patients at high risk. For instance, the PMQ has a series of questions that can be used to discuss the dangers of opioid addiction, which may cause the tool itself to increase patient awareness and encourage patients to limit opioid use. This may not be relevant to high-quality studies in which risk assessment and prescribing behavior were independent. While this explanation requires further investigation, from an evidence-based medicine perspective, the findings of this review nevertheless suggest that health care professionals do not have good tools to identify patients at high risk for developing prescription OUD or those at low risk, for whom prescription opioids can be safely prescribed.

We show distinct neurochemical substrates underlying risk-taking with the dorsal cingulate cortex mu-opioid receptor binding associated with rewards and dorsal striatal serotonin transporter binding associated with losses. We highlight distinct neurochemical and anatomical substrates as a function of valence within risk-taking and goal-directed control processes. Our findings have implications for the effects of illicit drugs and pharmaceutical agents on risk-taking tendencies and highlight the potential role of pharmacological agents or neuromodulation on modifying risk-taking biases.

### Optimizing pain control during the opioid epidemic [^1116inCg]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The current opioid crisis has raised awareness of the risks of misuse, addiction, and overdose with opioid prescribing for pain management in the perioperative and nonoperative care of surgical patients. Despite these risks, it is essential for surgical providers to provide safe and adequate functional pain control to enhance recovery. The purpose of this review is to outline the relevance of the US opioid crisis to surgical prescribing, describe strategies for opioid reduction using a stepwise therapy approach, and provide recommendations for improving the safety of opioid prescribing. Additional recommendations for risk assessment and naloxone coprescribing for high-risk patients are addressed.

### Assessment of potentially inappropriate prescribing of opioid analgesics requiring prior opioid tolerance [^1118xA4k]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What proportion of patients are opioid-tolerant when starting opioids that require prior tolerance for safe use?

Findings

In this cohort study including 153 385 use episodes of opioid analgesics labeled only for use in people who are opioid-tolerant, more than half of patients who received these medications showed no evidence of prior opioid tolerance in health insurance claims or electronic health records.

Meaning

These findings suggest that many patients may be at risk of potentially serious adverse events owing to widespread use of certain extended-release opioids without prior opioid tolerance.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1154EVmS]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Patient education and discussion before starting outpatient opioid therapy are critical so that patient preferences and values can be understood and used to inform clinical decisions. Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy. Essential elements for communication and discussion with patients before prescribing outpatient opioid therapy for acute pain include the following:

Advise patients that short-term opioid use can lead to unintended long-term opioid use and of the importance of working toward planned discontinuation of opioid use as soon as feasible, including a plan to appropriately taper opioids as pain resolves if opioids have been used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).
Review communication mechanisms and protocols patients can use to tell clinicians of severe or uncontrolled pain and to arrange for timely reassessment and management.
Advise patients about serious adverse effects of opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and development of a potentially serious opioid use disorder (see Recommendation 12) that can cause distress and inability to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.
Advise patients about common effects of opioids, such as constipation, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms when stopping opioids. To prevent constipation associated with opioid use, advise patients to increase hydration and fiber intake and to maintain or increase physical activity as they are able. Prophylactic pharmacologic therapy (e.g. a stimulant laxative such as senna, with or without a stool softener) might be needed to ensure regular bowel movements if opioids are used for more than a few days. Stool softeners or fiber laxatives without another laxative should be avoided. To minimize withdrawal symptoms, clinicians should provide and discuss an opioid tapering plan when opioids will be used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6). Limiting opioid use to the minimum needed to manage pain (e.g. taking the opioid only when needed if needed less frequently than every 4 hours and the prescription is written for every 4 hours as needed for pain) can help limit development of tolerance and therefore withdrawal after opioids are discontinued.
If formulations are prescribed that combine opioids with acetaminophen, advise patients of the risks of taking additional over-the-counter products containing acetaminophen.
To help patients assess when a dose of opioids is needed, explain that the goal is to reduce pain to make it manageable rather than to eliminate pain.
Discuss effects that opioids might have on a person's ability to safely operate a vehicle or other machinery, particularly when opioids are initiated or when other central nervous system depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines or alcohol) are used concurrently.
Discuss the potential for workplace toxicology testing programs to detect therapeutic opioid use.
Discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder, respiratory depression, and death at higher dosages, along with the importance of taking only the amount of opioids prescribed (i.e. not taking more opioids than prescribed or taking them more often).
Review increased risks for respiratory depression when opioids are taken with benzodiazepines, other sedatives, alcohol, nonprescribed or illicit drugs (e.g. heroin), or other opioids (see Recommendations 8 and 11).
Discuss risks to household members and other persons if opioids are intentionally or unintentionally shared with others for whom they are not prescribed, including the possibility that others might experience overdose at the same or lower dosage than prescribed for the patient and that young children and pets are susceptible to unintentional ingestion. Discuss storage of opioids in a secure and preferably locked location, options for safe disposal of unused opioids, and the value of having naloxone available.
Discuss planned use of precautions to reduce risks, including naloxone for overdose reversal (see Recommendation 8) and clinician use of PDMP information (see Recommendation 9).

### Development and validation of a bedside risk assessment for sustained prescription opioid use after surgery [^111uz8Mv]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can a risk score for sustained prescription opioid use after surgery be developed for a working-age population using readily available clinical information?

Findings

In this case-control study of 86 356 patients undergoing 1 of 10 common surgical procedures, prior opioid exposure was the factor most strongly associated with sustained opioid use. The group with the lowest Stopping Opioids After Surgery scores (< 31) had a mean 4.1% risk of sustained opioid use; the group with intermediate scores (31–50) had a mean risk of 14.9%; and the group with the highest scores (> 50) had a mean risk of 35.8%.

Meaning

The scoring system developed in this study may inform the risk of sustained prescription opioid use after surgery and be scalable to clinical practice.

### Morphine sulfate (Mitigo) [^114pa19X]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse

MITIGO®contains morphine, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, MITIGO®exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed MITIGO®. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused

or abused.

Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing MITIGO®, and monitor all patients receiving MITIGO®for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for

these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as MITIGO®but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of MITIGO®along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.

Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing MITIGO®. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity.

### Factors associated with opioid overdose after an initial opioid prescription [^113pWCVs]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This study found several patient and prescription-related risk factors that can provide guidance to clinicians, when either writing the initial opioid prescription or prescribing over the next several months, in the early period of a patient's opioid prescription experience. These risk factors may be considered by prescribers to identify opioid-naive patients who may be most at risk for harm; to inform patient counseling and monitoring if opioids are prescribed; and to provide additional information on safe use, storage, and disposal of opioids and on signs of overdose.

The first consideration should be patient-level factors. In the present cohort, those who were at the highest adjusted risk for subsequent overdose were older (≥ 75 years) and younger (18–24 years) individuals. The fact that older patients had an HR of 3.22 compared with the reference group (aged 35–44 years) is concerning because opioid prescribing to older patients occurs frequently, and recent data have shown an increase of opioid-related hospitalizations among older patients. This finding differs from national data showing that, in 2019, individuals 65 years or older had the lowest rates of drug overdose deaths compared with other age groupsand may reflect the inclusion criteria for the cohort, which required an incident opioid prescription. For younger patients, the morbidity and mortality that were associated with heroin and fentanyl use were substantially higher than in the older age groups, and the initial opioid prescription may be an individual's first experience with opioids, increasing the risk of using illicit opioids.

### Opioids for the treatment of chronic noncancer pain [^114D15r4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Increasingly, opioids are used to treat chronic noncancer pain. While opioids are well recognized for their effectiveness in treating acute pain, the evidence supporting the benefits for the treatment of chronic pain is less well established. Improvement of both pain and function should be considered goals of therapy. Patients with chronic pain have a higher incidence of preexisting psychological disorders. Adverse effects of opioid therapy include dependence, overdose, and withdrawal. Risk factors for poor outcomes with opioid therapy are identified, and include preexisting mental illness and dose prescribed. Recommended strategies to more safely use opioids are discussed, including tools for identifying high-risk patients. The evidence supporting the use of treatment agreements and urine drug testing to reduce the effects of adverse outcomes is limited.

### AAN position: opioids [^116qvVXa]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

AAN Position: Opioids — The document states that the available body of scientific literature does not support the use of opioids for chronic pain, notes limited options for safe and effective nonopioid therapies for pain in neurologic conditions, and indicates that many patients may benefit from focusing on functional goal setting rather than achieving a completely pain-free state. It highlights that patients living with traumatic brain injury are often prescribed multiple medications, including opioids, which can place them at risk of misuse or potentially slow recovery, and it calls for more research to understand the use and impact of analgesics on the recovering brain so that therapies can be developed that promote healing. As an example of successful nonopioid innovation, it cites calcitonin gene–related peptide–targeted treatments for migraine to demonstrate that with sufficient research investment, nonopioid disease-specific medications can be developed that reduce disability and disease burden. The text emphasizes the American Academy of Neurology's commitment to advancing brain health and its focus on the impact of opioids on brain development and postsurgery recovery. It further identifies increased funding for pain research, dedicated funds for addiction services, resources for prescribers, and promoting interoperable electronic prescribing and prescription monitoring programs as measures that can improve pain therapy and potentially eliminate the need for chronic opioid treatments that are fraught with risk of misuse.

ER/LA opioid analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) — The stated goals by the FDA of the REMS program are assessing patients for treatment with ER/LA opioid analgesic therapy; initiating therapy, modifying dosing, and discontinuing use of ER/LA opioid analgesics; managing therapy with ER/LA opioid analgesics; counseling patients and caregivers about the safe use of ER/LA opioid analgesics; and providing general and specific drug information related to ER/LA opioid analgesic products. In addition, all ER/LA opioid analgesic companies are partners in this effort and must help to provide education for prescribers through accredited continuing education activities and information that prescribers can use when counseling patients about the risks and benefits of ER/LA opioid analgesics.

Deciding Duration of Initial Opioid Prescription and Conducting Follow-Up (Recommendations 6 and 7)

When opioids are needed for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).
Clinicians should evaluate benefits and risks with patients within 1–4 weeks of starting opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain or of dosage escalation. Clinicians should regularly reevaluate benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).

Assessing Risk and Addressing Potential Harms of Opioid Use (Recommendations 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12)

Before starting and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate risk for opioid-related harms and discuss risk with patients. Clinicians should work with patients to incorporate into the management plan strategies to mitigate risk, including offering naloxone (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).
When prescribing initial opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, and periodically during opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should review the patient's history of controlled substance prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data to determine whether the patient is receiving opioid dosages or combinations that put the patient at high risk for overdose (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 4).
When prescribing opioids for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should consider the benefits and risks of toxicology testing to assess for prescribed medications as well as other prescribed and nonprescribed controlled substances (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 4).
Clinicians should use particular caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently and consider whether benefits outweigh risks of concurrent prescribing of opioids and other central nervous system depressants (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 3).
Clinicians should offer or arrange treatment with evidence-based medications to treat patients with opioid use disorder. Detoxification on its own, without medications for opioid use disorder, is not recommended for opioid use disorder because of increased risks for resuming drug use, overdose, and overdose death (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 1).

### Opioid overdose-the surgeon's role [^113kmHQT]. Annals of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

With increased focus on the potential harms of surgical opioid prescribing, surgeons should be cognizant of the risk of opioid-related adverse events in their patients, including overdose. Risk factors for overdose may be more prevalent than surgeons think, and include high current opioid use, previous or existing substance use disorder, history of overdose, or certain medical comorbidities. The first step to protecting surgical patients from opioid overdose is adequate screening for risk factors; appropriate patient counseling and prudent prescribing practices can then help protect at-risk patients.

### A prospective, longitudinal study to evaluate the clinical utility of a predictive algorithm that detects risk of opioid use disorder [^113Cgyeo]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical utility of an algorithm-based decision tool designed to assess risk associated with opioid use. Specifically, we sought to assess how physicians were using the profile in patient care and how its use affected patient outcomes.

Patients and Methods

A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted to assess the utility of precision medicine testing in 5,397 patients across 100 clinics in the United States. Using a patent-protected, validated algorithm combining specific genetic risk factors with phenotypic traits, patients were categorized into low-, moderate-, and high-risk patients for opioid abuse. Physicians who ordered precision medicine testing were asked to complete patient evaluations and document their actions, decisions, and perceptions regarding the utility of the precision medicine tests. The patient outcomes associated with each treatment action were carefully documented.

Results

Physicians used the profile to guide treatment decisions for over half of the patients. Of those, guided treatment decisions for 24.5% of the patients were opioid related, including changing the opioid prescribed, starting an opioid, or titrating a patient off the opioid. Treatment guidance was strongly influenced by profile-predicted opioid use disorder (OUD) risk. Most importantly, patients whose physicians used the profile to guide opioid-related treatment decisions had improved clinical outcomes, including better pain management by medication adjustments, with an average pain decrease of 3.4 points on a scale of 1–10.

Conclusion

Patients whose physicians used the profile to guide opioid-related treatment decisions had improved clinical outcomes, as measured by decreased pain levels resulting from better pain management with prescribed medications. The clinical utility of the profile is twofold. It provides clinically actionable recommendations that can be used to 1) prevent OUD through limiting initial opioid prescriptions and 2) reduce pain in patients at low risk of developing OUD.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^115gGVWw]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP opioid dose–risk evidence indicates that higher morphine milligram equivalents (MME) and tramadol dosing are associated with adverse outcomes. In patients on moderate doses (< 200 MME), an overdose rate of 7.92 (9.94 per 1,000 population) was reported, and patients receiving > 120 MME per day were more likely to have drug-related encounters than those getting lower doses. Implementation of guidelines that considered 120 MME as a high dose reduced overall opioids per day by 27% and long-acting Schedule II opioids by 37% among those on > 120 MME per day, and the number of deaths was reduced by 50% from 2009 to 2010. High dose tramadol (> 400 mg) showed an increasing frequency of adverse effects with 2 patients experiencing seizures. Doses > 100 MME per day have not been validated in clinical trials and should be considered excessive, and available literature correlates increasing mortality with increasing doses.

### ACOEM practice guidelines: opioids for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative pain [^1145Gwt1]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

ACOEM opioids guideline — clinical recommendations emphasize selective short‑acting use, risk assessment, agreements, and a dose limit: The panel recommends that quality evidence currently fails to demonstrate superiority of opioids to other medications and treatments for treatment of pain, and it recommends comprehensive history and physical examinations. Selective use of the lowest effective, short‑acting opioid dose is recommended as adjunctive treatment for patients with acute and postoperative pain that is inadequately treated with NSAIDs or other treatments. The strongest risk factors for overdose and deaths include concomitant use of benzodiazepines, illicit substances, unemployment status, psychiatric disorders, and a substance(s) abuse history. Opioid consent and treatment agreements are recommended for treatment of subacute and chronic pain with opioids, and opioid maintenance only with documented functional gain(s) is recommended. A strong and reproducible dose–response relationship identifies a recommended MED limit of 50 mg/day for acute or chronic pain, and higher doses are recommended to require documented commensurately greater functional benefit(s).
