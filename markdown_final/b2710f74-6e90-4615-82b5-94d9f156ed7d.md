## Question

Atropine infusion to reverse hypertension

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an atropine infusion can be used to reverse hypertension and what the evidence and pharmacology say about that strategy, including risks and alternatives [^114VCUjo]. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about atropine's mechanism and expected hemodynamic effects. Then, I should verify whether any clinical trials or labeling indicate blood-pressure–lowering use. Next, I will review studies that report atropine's impact on blood pressure and heart rate. After that, I should confirm labeled indications to see if hypertension appears anywhere. Finally, I need to consider harms, correct any misassumptions, and align the recommendation with hypertension guidelines for appropriate therapy instead of atropine [^115T8ZH6] [^116pQoiU].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology because that often predicts clinical effects; atropine is a competitive antagonist at muscarinic receptors, removing vagal tone, thereby increasing sinus rate and shortening AV conduction, with no direct vasodilatory action described and no primary effect on systemic vascular resistance that would be expected to lower blood pressure [^115T8ZH6].

> Wait, let me verify what actually happens to hemodynamics in controlled settings; in a randomized trial during propofol–remifentanil anesthesia, prophylactic atropine blunted the fall in mean arterial pressure and prevented bradycardia, meaning it attenuated hypotension rather than lowering blood pressure, consistent with a pressor-supporting rather than an antihypertensive profile [^115YF4pY].

> I should double-check in another peri-spinal anesthesia context; IV atropine reduced the incidence of hypotension and the need for vasopressors, again indicating that atropine's net clinical effect in these studies was to prevent or mitigate low blood pressure, not to decrease high blood pressure [^11627SDP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without checking labeling and indications; FDA labeling for atropine lists uses such as symptomatic bradycardia, bradyasystolic cardiac arrest, organophosphate or muscarinic mushroom poisoning, antisialagogue effects, and ophthalmic mydriasis/cycloplegia, with no indication for treating hypertension or hypertensive crises anywhere in the approved uses [^114VCUjo] [^1127WjiN] [^113oQJa1] [^111NVkVL] [^115iJcwC] [^1127jguy].

> I need to check whether atropine tends to raise heart rate substantially because that would argue against using it in hypertension; sublingual atropine in volunteers increased heart rate by about 62% at 10 minutes, and peri-induction atropine prevented bradycardia, which implies increased cardiac output and potentially higher blood pressure in some contexts rather than any BP-lowering effect [^1137nrk2] [^115YF4pY].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could blocking muscarinic receptors cause vasodilation somehow to lower blood pressure; let me reconsider because the vascular beds have limited parasympathetic cholinergic tone, so atropine's dominant systemic effect is loss of vagal brake with tachycardia and no clinically useful vasodilatory action, making an antihypertensive effect physiologically implausible in routine care [^115T8ZH6].

> Next, I should review how atropine infusions are actually used; continuous atropine infusions are described to maintain atropinization in organophosphate poisoning after rapid atropine escalation, not to treat hypertension, and even there the goal is reversal of muscarinic toxicity with heart rate support, not blood pressure reduction [^1145Uf7o] [^1127WjiN].

> But wait, what if a patient is hypertensive with severe reflex bradycardia — would atropine help by correcting bradycardia and therefore "reverse" hypertension; I should be careful here, because treating the cause of bradycardia may normalize hemodynamics, but atropine still does not function as an antihypertensive agent and could worsen blood pressure by increasing cardiac output, so it should not be selected to lower blood pressure per se [^115T8ZH6].

> I need to ensure my recommendation aligns with evidence-based hypertension management; contemporary guidelines recommend selecting intravenous antihypertensives tailored to the clinical scenario, and for example, in preeclampsia or eclampsia complicated by pulmonary edema, an IV nitroglycerin infusion is recommended, which underscores that muscarinic antagonists like atropine are not part of antihypertensive protocols [^116pQoiU].

> I should confirm the bottom line and potential harm; there is no evidence supporting atropine infusion to reverse hypertension, and pharmacology and clinical trials instead show atropine counters hypotension and increases heart rate, which can increase myocardial oxygen demand and may aggravate hypertension, so using atropine to lower blood pressure is inappropriate and potentially harmful compared with guideline-supported antihypertensive therapies [^115T8ZH6] [^115YF4pY] [^11627SDP] [^116pQoiU] [^114VCUjo].

Atropine infusion is **not used to reverse hypertension**; it is a muscarinic antagonist [^115T8ZH6] that increases heart rate [^115YF4pY] and can cause hypertension as a side effect. Atropine is indicated for bradycardia [^114VCUjo], organophosphate or carbamate poisoning [^113oQJa1], and as an antisialagogue [^111NVkVL], **not for hypertension management**. If hypertension occurs during atropine infusion, stop the infusion and treat with standard antihypertensive agents and supportive measures.

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of atropine

Atropine competitively blocks acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors [^115T8ZH6], reducing parasympathetic tone, increasing heart rate [^116vzo9Z], and decreasing secretions. It **does not lower blood pressure** [^115T8ZH6] and may increase it via tachycardia [^115YF4pY] and reduced vagal tone.

---

## Clinical indications for atropine infusion

Atropine is indicated for:

- **Bradycardia**: Symptomatic bradycardia or AV block [^114VCUjo].
- **Organophosphate or carbamate poisoning**: Antidote for cholinergic crisis [^113oQJa1] [^114VCUjo].
- **Antisialagogue**: Reduce secretions preoperatively [^111NVkVL] [^114VCUjo].

It is **not indicated for hypertension management**.

---

## Atropine and hypertension

Atropine can **cause hypertension** as an adverse effect, especially in high doses or sensitive patients, due to increased heart rate [^115YF4pY] and reduced vagal tone. It is not used to reverse hypertension and may worsen it.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

No guidelines recommend atropine for **hypertension**; it is indicated for bradycardia, organophosphate or carbamate poisoning, and as an antisialagogue [^114VCUjo]. If hypertension occurs during atropine infusion, stop the infusion and treat with standard antihypertensives and supportive care.

---

## Risks and adverse effects of atropine infusion

Atropine infusion can cause:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Tachycardia [^115T8ZH6], hypertension, arrhythmias.
- **Central nervous system effects**: Confusion, delirium, seizures [^115T8ZH6].
- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Dry mouth, nausea, vomiting [^115T8ZH6].
- **Ocular effects**: Mydriasis, blurred vision [^115T8ZH6].

These risks make it **unsuitable for hypertension management**.

---

## Alternative pharmacological interventions for hypertension

Standard **antihypertensive agents** include:

- **Beta-blockers**: Metoprolol, propranolol.
- **Calcium channel blockers**: Diltiazem, verapamil.
- **Vasodilators**: Nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside.
- **ACE inhibitors**: Lisinopril, enalapril.
- **Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**: Losartan, valsartan.

These are effective and safe for hypertension management.

---

## Clinical scenarios where atropine infusion may be considered

Atropine infusion is appropriate for symptomatic bradycardia or AV block [^114VCUjo], for organophosphate or carbamate poisoning [^1145Uf7o] as an antidote for cholinergic crisis [^114VCUjo], and as an antisialagogue to reduce secretions preoperatively [^111NVkVL] [^114VCUjo]. It is **not appropriate for hypertension management**.

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

When using atropine infusion, monitor cardiovascular status (heart rate, blood pressure, ECG) [^115T8ZH6], central nervous system status (mental status and seizure activity), respiratory status (airway patency and respiratory rate), and laboratory parameters (electrolytes and renal function). Discontinue infusion if significant **hypertension** or adverse effects occur.

---

Atropine infusion is **not used to reverse hypertension**; it may cause hypertension as a side effect. Use standard antihypertensive agents and supportive care for hypertension management.

### Atropen auto-injector [^115T8ZH6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Atropine competitively blocks the effects of acetylcholine, including excess acetylcholine due to organophosphorus poisoning, at muscarinic cholinergic receptors on smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, secretory gland cells, and in peripheral autonomic ganglia and the central nervous system.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Atropine reduces secretions in the mouth and respiratory passages, relieves airway constriction, and may reduce centrally-mediated respiratory paralysis. In severe organophosphorus poisoning, a fully atropinized patient may develop or continue to have respiratory failure and may require artificial respiration and suctioning of airway secretions. Atropine may cause thickening of secretions.

	- Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine increases heart rate and reduces atrioventricular conduction time. Adequate atropine doses can prevent or abolish bradycardia or asystole produced by organophosphorus nerve agents.

	- Atropine may decrease the degree of partial heart block, which can occur after organophosphorus poisoning. In some patients with complete heart block, atropine may accelerate the idioventricular rate; in others, the rate is stabilized. In some patients with conduction defects, atropine may cause paradoxical atrioventricular block and nodal rhythm.

	- Atropine will not act on the neuromuscular junction and has no effect on muscle paralysis.

### Rapid atropine synthesis for the treatment of massive nerve agent exposure [^11518ZSD]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

We developed and tested a protocol for compounding a large volume of injectable atropine from powder. The resulting protocol could be used by hospitals to rapidly deploy large amounts of stockpiled atropine.

- **Methods**: The protocol required 2 g of solid (powdered) atropine and 1 L of normal saline solution. The solution was filtered and mixed. One hundred syringes were filled using a standard syringe-batching system. Modifications, including hand filling, were studied to reduce the time required to synthesize one hundred 3-mL syringes.

- **Results**: A single pharmacist was able to reconstitute one hundred 6-mg atropine syringes in 29 minutes using the batching system. The quickest method for a single pharmacist filling syringes by hand was 34 minutes. The cost to the hospital for 5 g of powdered atropine was $11 compared to $5,000 for prefilled syringes.

- **Conclusion**: Large quantities of atropine syringes can be compounded from a powdered form in a timely manner. Additionally, there is a significant cost advantage to using powdered atropine as a hospital stockpile.

### Prophylactic atropine administration attenuates the negative haemodynamic effects of induction of anaesthesia with propofol and high-dose remifentanil: A randomised controlled trial [^115YF4pY]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2017). High credibility.

Induction of anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil often induces unwanted bradycardia and hypotension, raising concerns regarding tissue oxygenation. The electrophysiological cardiac effects of remifentanil can be reversed by atropine.

- **Objective**: To investigate if prophylactic administration of atropine can attenuate the negative haemodynamic effects of propofol and a high dose of remifentanil during induction of anaesthesia.
- **Design**: A double-blind, randomised controlled trial.
- **Setting**: Single-centre, University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands.
- **Patients**: Sixty euvolaemic patients scheduled for surgery under general anaesthesia.
- **Interventions**: Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with a target-controlled infusion of propofol with a target effect-site concentration (Ce) of 2.5 μg/ml, remifentanil (target-controlled infusion), (Ce 8 ng/ml), and cis-atracurium. Methylatropine (500 μg) or 0.9% saline was administered immediately before induction of anaesthesia.
- **Main outcome measures**: The changes (Δ) in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), rate pressure product, cerebral tissue oxygenation, and peripheral tissue oxygenation between induction of anaesthesia (T0) and 10 min later (T10).

Results showed that atropine significantly attenuated the changes in the outcome measures between T0 and T10. The median (inter-quartile range) changes were: MAP, Δ = -24 (-40 to -21) vs. Δ = -37 mmHg (-41 to -31) (P = 0.02); HR, Δ = 0 ± 13 vs. -19 ± 11 bpm (P < 0.01); CI, Δ = -0.4 ± 0.7 vs. -0.9 ± 0.6 l/min/m² (P < 0.01); and rate pressure product, Δ = -3241 (-5015 to -613) vs. Δ = -571.

### Addition of atropine to submaximal exercise stress testing in patients evaluated for suspected ischaemia with SPECT imaging: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^116vzo9Z]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effects of the addition of atropine to exercise testing in patients who failed to achieve their target heart rate during stress myocardial perfusion imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), the study used a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled design. Patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease who failed to achieve a target heart rate (≥ 85% of maximal predicted HR) during exercise SPECT imaging were randomized to receive intravenous atropine (n = 100) or placebo (n = 101).

The two groups of patients did not differ with respect to demographic or clinical characteristics. A higher proportion of patients in the atropine group achieved the target heart rate compared to the placebo group (60% versus 3%, p < 0.0001). SPECT imaging was abnormal in a higher proportion of patients in the atropine group as compared to the placebo group (57% versus 42%, p < 0.05). Stress-induced myocardial ischaemia was present in more patients in the atropine group compared to placebo (47% versus 29%, p < 0.01). In both groups of patients, no major side effects occurred.

The addition of atropine at the end of exercise testing is more effective than placebo in raising heart rate to adequate levels, without additional risks of complications. The use of atropine in patients who initially failed to achieve their maximal predicted heart rate is associated with a higher probability of achieving a diagnostic myocardial perfusion study.

### Guidelines for reporting case studies on extracorporeal treatments in poisonings: Methodology [^113z4K8V]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

There are limitations to our methodology; the group of panelists that were chosen ultimately dictated which final criteria were selected, which can be biased if certain specialties are overrepresented. However, the individuals were chosen for their content expertise and came from diverse backgrounds. All panelists had extensive prior experience in reviewing and criticizing case reports for the EXTRIP clinical guideline development; many were also experienced in other peer-review activities. Furthermore, several conference calls and in-house meetings permitted group discussions on the ideal constituents of a robust case report. Adherence to these reporting guidelines will need to be prospectively evaluated over time and modified accordingly if necessary.

The sequential steps undertaken by our group differed from those proposed by the Guidance for Developers of Health Research Reporting Guidelines due to the previous work performed by the EXTRIP workgroup. For example, significant discussion had already taken place prior to the Delphi rounds; there may therefore have been a priori consensus, which could theoretically have impeded critical thought, and this may be suggested by the relatively few Delphi rounds needed to obtain consensus. The addition of two external validation rounds permitted the reporting guideline development to remain dynamic and ascertain that all items remained clear and understandable without extensive explanations for an end-user.

Because case reports are likely to remain a significant proportion of the available literature in many acute care specialties.

### Phase I trial of preoperative concurrent doxorubicin and radiation therapy, surgical resection, and intraoperative electron-beam radiation therapy for patients with localized retroperitoneal sarcoma [^115UUe7v]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this phase I trial was to define the maximum-tolerated dose of external-beam radiation with fixed-dose continuous-infusion doxorubicin, followed by surgical resection and electron-beam intraoperative radiation therapy (EB-IORT) for patients with localized, potentially resectable retroperitoneal sarcomas (RPS).

Thirty-five patients with radiographically resectable primary or intermediate- or high-grade RPS were treated. Doxorubicin was administered weekly for 4 or 5 weeks as an initial bolus (4 mg/m²) followed by a 4-day continuous infusion (4 mg/m²/day). Radiation therapy was administered in escalating doses of 18.0, 30.6, 36.0, 41.4, 46.8, or 50.4 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions. Radiographic restaging was performed 4 to 8 weeks after chemoradiation, and patients with localized disease underwent surgical resection with EB-IORT (15 Gy).

Chemoradiation was completed as outpatient therapy in 31 patients (89%); four patients required hospital admission during chemoradiation or in the post-chemoradiation preoperative period. At the highest radiation dose of 50.4 Gy, two (18%) of 11 patients had grade 3 or 4 nausea. Twenty-nine patients (83%) underwent laparotomy; six patients had interval disease progression and did not undergo surgery. Grossly complete resection (R0 or R1) was performed in 26 (90%) of 29 patients who had surgery. EB-IORT was feasible and successfully administered to 22 patients who had R0 or R1 resections.

### Atropen auto-injector [^117EeD7v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to the effects of atropine.

- **Pregnancy**: Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters fetal circulation. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of atropine in pregnant women. Adequate animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Lactation**: Atropine has been reported to be excreted in human milk. There are no data on the effects of atropine on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Atropen and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Atropen or from the underlying maternal condition.

- **Pediatric use**: A review of published literature supports the safety and effectiveness of atropine in the setting of organophosphate insecticide poisoning in all pediatric age groups. Adverse events seen in pediatric patients treated with atropine are similar to those that occur in adult patients, although central nervous system effects are often seen earlier and at lower doses. Overheating (atropine fever) caused by suppression of sweat gland activity may be more pronounced in infants and small children. Extreme hyperthermia in a newborn.

### Organophosphate poisonings with parathion and dimethoate [^117Eea3P]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Organophosphate toxicity is the leading cause of morbidity and death in poisoning by insecticides. The clinical symptoms of pesticide toxicity range from the classic cholinergic syndrome to flaccid paralysis and intractable seizures. The mainstays of therapy are atropine, oximes, benzodiazepines, and supportive care. The toxicokinetics vary not only with the extent of exposure but also with the chemical structure of the agent.

- **Patients**: We report two cases of poisoning with parathion-ethyl and dimethoate. The patients developed a cholinergic syndrome immediately, accompanied by bradycardia and hypotension.

- **Interventions**: The patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) a few hours after ingestion. Atropine was administered according to the cholinergic symptoms. The patients recovered in the ICU after 10–12 days and were discharged after 3 and 4 weeks.

- **Measurements and results**: Organophosphate blood and urine levels were determined on admission and during hospitalization. The pesticides were rapidly distributed, and a slow elimination rate of the poisons was documented. In the case of parathion-ethyl, the distribution half-life estimated was t(1/2alpha) = 3.1 h, while the terminal half-life was t(1/2beta) = 17.9 h. Using a one-compartment model for dimethoate, the elimination half-life was t(1/2beta) = 30.4 h in plasma and 23.8 h in urine. The serum pseudo-cholinesterase activity was below the limit of detection at admission and recovered during the following 3 weeks.

### Provocative challenges to help diagnose and monitor asthma: Exercise, methacholine, adenosine, and mannitol [^1159zsoM]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to evaluate bronchial provocation tests used in measuring bronchial hyperresponsiveness, aiding in the diagnosis of asthma.

Recent findings include the examination of bronchial provocation tests such as exercise, methacholine, AMP, and mannitol. Methodology and treatment monitoring are also discussed.

Methacholine is utilized to identify bronchial hyperresponsiveness and guide treatment. Exercise serves as a provocation test, indicating the prevention of exercise-induced asthma as a drug use marker. Both tests contribute to studying beta2 agonist tolerance. There is a growing use of eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea as a surrogate test for exercise-induced asthma, especially among athletes. Concerns have been raised regarding different breathing patterns for inhaling methacholine and AMP aerosols, impacting the cutoff for identifying bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

A new test involving a kit with prepacked mannitol capsules and a delivery device is introduced. Interest is increasing in tests that indirectly trigger mediator release, given that bronchial hyperresponsiveness indicates inflammation presence. As inflammation treatment results in a loss of hyperresponsiveness to indirect stimuli, these tests are effective in assessing treatment success.

### Effect of coronary revascularization on the prognostic value of stress myocardial contrast wall motion and perfusion imaging [^115MPFM9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

**Stress protocol**: Dipyridamole was infused at the total dose of 0.84 mg/kg in all patients. A total of 461 patients underwent a 10-minute 0.84 mg/kg dipyridamole infusion combined with atropine administration (up to 1 mg). The majority of patients (n = 868) underwent a 6-minute protocol consisting of the 0.84 mg/kg dipyridamole infusion, which does not require additional atropine administration. Two-dimensional echocardiography, 12-lead ECGs, and blood pressure monitoring were performed in accordance with established standard protocols. Aminophylline was routinely used to reverse the dipyridamole effect. When an obvious new wall motion abnormality (≥ 1 akinetic segment) was observed by the physician performing the test, dipyridamole infusion was stopped, and aminophylline was administered.

### Prognostic value of long QT interval in acute and severe organophosphate poisoning [^113wBLn3]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Suicidal poisoning with organophosphorus (OP) pesticides is common, particularly in rural areas. This highlights the importance of determining the prognosis of OP poisoning to decide the aggressiveness of treatment. Reports suggest a relationship between a prolonged corrected QT (QTC) interval and the severity of poisoning. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic utility of this clinical tool in patients with OP poisoning (OPP).

Methods: Patients with a primary diagnosis of OPP admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Loghman-Hakim Hospital Poison Centre (LHHPC) were the subjects of this prospective study. Cholinesterase (CE) activity and the QTC interval were determined for each patient using the Bazett formula, with < 440 msec considered normal. Comparative outcomes included the duration of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation, serum CE activity on admission and its daily level, the total amount of atropine administered, analysis of the QT and QTC intervals in the primary ECG on admission and at the end of hospitalization, and the rate of mortality.

Results: The study included 42 patients diagnosed with OPP. The mean age was 32, ranging from 12 to 81 years old. The mortality rate was 37.5%. There was no significant difference between two groups (prolonged and normal QTC intervals) concerning gender and age (p = .491 and p = .133, respectively). The CE levels for the long and normal QTC interval groups were 3.90 ± 0.33 kU/L vs. 4.41 ± 0.23 kU/L, respectively. The mortality rate in the long QTC group was significantly higher.

### Odor identification impairment and cholinesterase inhibitor treatment in Alzheimer's disease [^117Xko8J]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Low credibility.

This study evaluated the acute change in odor identification following an atropine nasal spray challenge and the 8-week change in odor identification ability as predictors of long-term improvement in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) who received open-label cholinesterase inhibitor treatment.

- **Methods**: In patients with clinical AD, the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) was administered before and after an anticholinergic atropine nasal spray challenge. Patients were then treated with donepezil for 52 weeks.

- **Results**: In 21 study participants, the acute atropine-induced decrease in UPSIT was not associated with changes in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) or Selective Reminding Test (SRT). A decline in odor identification performance from baseline to week 8 was indicative of a future decline in cognitive performance over 52 weeks.

- **Discussion**: Change in odor identification with atropine challenge is not a useful predictor of treatment response to cholinesterase inhibitors. Short-term change in odor identification performance needs further investigation as a potential predictor of cognitive improvement with cholinesterase inhibitor treatment.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^114ygow5]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The target population for these recommendations includes calcium channel blocker (CCB)-poisoned adults. However, given the paucity of literature regarding the treatment of CCB-poisoned children and the absence of evidence indicating that children respond differently than adults to CCB poisoning, the workgroup believes it is reasonable to apply the recommendations to the pediatric population.

Even if articles were found to answer some key questions (KQs 1–5), the overall evidence available to develop these recommendations was of very low quality. Many interventions had only been studied for surrogate outcomes. With the exception of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) for cardiotoxicant poisonings, the use of and costs associated with these resources had not been described. Hence, many questions within our proposed analytic framework remain unanswered. These represent potential areas for future research.

- **First**: Comparative studies should be conducted to identify which intervention improves intermediate and health outcomes (KQ 1, 3, and 4) for each specific class of CCB (KQ 2) with acceptable adverse effects and costs (KQ 5).

- **Second**: Observational studies should identify prognostic factors, which is particularly imperative in severe cases that may potentially require VA-ECMO (KQ 2).

- **Third**: Scientists should conduct clinical trials to identify factors associated with favorable responses to high-dose insulin therapies (KQ 2). Prospective, controlled clinical trials are needed to evaluate currently recommended antidotes or to assess new ones (KQ 1, 3, 4, and 5).

### Acute abdomen associated with organophosphate poisoning [^116Hca85]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Pesticides are extensively used in developed and developing countries. The present study was designed to evaluate the clinical course of patients with carbamate or organophosphate poisoning presenting to a university-based emergency department (ED).

Methods included enrolling all consecutive patients admitted to our ED due to intoxication with carbamate or organophosphate compounds over a 2-year period.

Results indicated that a total of 49 consecutive patients (26 females) were diagnosed with carbamate or organophosphate poisoning during the 24-month study period. The mean age of the patients was 32 ± 13.1 years (range 16–70 years). Signs and symptoms most frequently noted in patients with organophosphate or carbamate poisoning were perspiration, vomiting, and bronchorrhea. Abdominal pain was reported by 65.3% of the patients. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed in 22 patients who complained of abdominal pain as a leading symptom, among whom 63.6% were found to have abdominal free fluid. Pancreatitis and peritonitis developed in one case. Atropine treatment was administered for approximately 24–36 hours, with a mean total dose of 13.75 ± 6.75 mg. Pralidoxime was administered to 70.9% of patients with organophosphate poisoning, but was not used in patients intoxicated with carbamates. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilatory support were required in 14.2% of the patients. Mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 3.7 ± 2.2 days. The overall mortality rate was 10.2%.

Conclusion: Patients with a diagnosis of organophosphate poisoning should be screened carefully for associated complications.

### SPL drug information for atropine sulfate [^1161bL6J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of atropine sulfate for intramuscular (IM) administration in the treatment of mild organophosphate poisoning in adults is 2 mg IM initially, followed by two additional doses in rapid succession if severe symptoms occur after the first dose.

### Protopam chloride [^1154UqSD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

The treatment of organophosphate poisoning should include general supportive care, atropinization, and decontamination, alongside the use of Protopam Chloride. Treatment is most effective if initiated immediately after poisoning. The administration of Protopam Chloride should be performed slowly, preferably by infusion. If intravenous administration is not feasible, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection should be used. Generally, little is accomplished if Protopam Chloride is given more than 36 hours after termination of exposure to the poison.

When the poison has been ingested, it is crucial to consider the potential for ongoing absorption from the lower bowel, as this constitutes new exposure and fatal relapses have been reported after initial improvement. In such cases, additional doses of Protopam Chloride may be needed every three to eight hours. Essentially, the patient should be "titrated" with Protopam Chloride as long as signs of poisoning recur. As in all cases of organophosphate poisoning, it is important to keep the patient under observation for at least 48 to 72 hours.

If dermal exposure has occurred, clothing should be removed, and the hair and skin should be washed thoroughly with sodium bicarbonate or alcohol as soon as possible. Supportive care, including airway management, respiratory and cardiovascular support, correction of metabolic abnormalities, and seizure control, may be necessary in severe cases of organophosphate poisoning.

Atropine should be administered as soon as possible after hypoxemia is improved.

### Recovery from ultra-high dose organophosphate poisoning after "in-the-field" antidote treatment: Potential lessons for civil defense [^117VUmwk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Organophosphate poisoning is associated with a high mortality rate due to respiratory failure, dysrhythmias, and multi-organ failure. We report two cases of survival after "in-the-field" antidote treatment of very severe organophosphate poisonings. Two patients orally ingested large amounts of the organophosphorous agent oxydemeton-methyl in suicide attempts, resulting in the hypercholinergic syndrome in both cases. Resuscitation included early administration of antidote by emergency medical personnel as well as high-dose atropine. Plasma levels of pseudocholinesterase were initially very low in both patients. Long-term mechanical ventilation was necessary, and both patients developed aspiration pneumonia. At discharge, no major neurological deficits were present. Prompt antidote treatment and aggressive supportive emergency and intensive care unit therapy contribute to improved survival after acute organophosphate poisoning. We believe that, in cases of mass poisonings — for example, terrorist activity — therapy must be available on the scene as soon as possible. This also may require decentralized antidote storage.

### Diltiazem HCl [^1158zTHq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In cases of overdose or an exaggerated response to diltiazem, limited experience is reported; however, certain supportive measures can be employed. These measures include:

- **Bradycardia**: Administer atropine (0.6 to 1 mg). If there is no response to vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously.

- **High-degree AV block**: Treat as per bradycardia outlined above. Fixed high-degree AV block should be treated with cardiac pacing.

- **Cardiac failure**: Administer inotropic agents such as isoproterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine, and diuretics.

- **Hypotension**: Use vasopressors such as dopamine or norepinephrine.

The effectiveness of intravenous calcium in reversing diltiazem overdose has shown inconsistency. Reports indicate that some cases of overdose associated with hypotension and bradycardia, which initially were refractory to atropine, became more responsive to the drug after intravenous calcium administration. In some instances, intravenous calcium has been administered as 1 g of calcium chloride or 3 g of calcium gluconate over 5 minutes, repeated every 10 to 20 minutes as necessary. Additionally, calcium gluconate has been administered as a continuous infusion at a rate of 2 g per hour for 10 hours. Infusions of calcium for 24 hours or more may be required. Monitoring for signs of hypercalcemia in patients is crucial.

The choice of treatment and dosage should reflect the severity of the clinical situation, along with the judgment and experience of the treating physician. Furthermore, diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis.

### Sodium nitrite [^115VbBVJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety of administering other cyanide antidotes simultaneously with sodium nitrite injection has not been established. If a decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with sodium nitrite injection, these drugs should not be administered concurrently in the same intravenous (IV) line [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

- **Recommended dosing**: Sodium nitrite injection and sodium thiosulfate injection are administered by slow intravenous injection. They should be given as early as possible following a diagnosis of acute life-threatening cyanide poisoning has been established. Sodium nitrite should be administered first, followed immediately by sodium thiosulfate. Blood pressure must be monitored during infusion in both adults and children. The rate of infusion should be decreased if significant hypotension is noted.

	- **Note**: If signs of poisoning reappear, repeat treatment using one-half the original dose of both sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate.

	- In adult and pediatric patients with known anemia, it is recommended that the dosage of sodium nitrite should be reduced proportionately to the hemoglobin concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. All parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Adrenergic mediation of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure [^112rxoLU]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

We used the original model of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) and the nonselective α-adrenergic and β-adrenergic antagonists, phentolamine and propranolol, as well as the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist atropine in doses shown previously to be both safe and effective. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that adrenergic activation, cholinergic activation, or both mediate the effect of recent antecedent hypoglycemia to reduce the sympathoadrenal response to subsequent hypoglycemia, which is the key feature of HAAF in diabetes, in humans.

### Cardizem [^116tya22]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The effectiveness of intravenous calcium administration to reverse the pharmacological effects of diltiazem overdose has been inconsistent. In a few reported cases, overdoses with calcium channel blockers associated with hypotension and bradycardia that were initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to atropine after the patients received intravenous calcium. In some cases, intravenous calcium has been administered (1 g calcium chloride or 3 g calcium gluconate) over 5 minutes and repeated every 10 to 20 minutes as necessary. Calcium gluconate has also been administered as a continuous infusion at a rate of 2 g per hour for 10 hours. Infusions of calcium for 24 hours or more may be required. Patients should be monitored for signs of hypercalcemia.

In the event of overdose or exaggerated response, appropriate supportive measures should be employed in addition to gastrointestinal decontamination. Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis. Limited data suggest that plasmapheresis or charcoal hemoperfusion may hasten diltiazem elimination following overdose. Based on the known pharmacological effects of diltiazem and/or reported clinical experiences, the following measures may be considered:

- **Bradycardia**: Administer atropine (0.60 to 1.0 mg). If there is no response to vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously.

- **High-degree AV block**: Treat as for bradycardia above. Fixed high-degree AV block should be treated with cardiac pacing.

- **Cardiac failure**: Administer inotropic agents (isoproterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine) and diuretics.

### Utility of red blood cell acetylcholinesterase measurement in mechanically ventilated subjects after organophosphate poisoning [^116epqG8]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Many patients with organophosphate poisoning require mechanical ventilation. Muscle acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity determines the impairment of muscle force generation, and red blood cell (RBC) AChE has been regarded as a surrogate for muscle AChE in organophosphate poisoning. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate whether RBC AChE at presentation can predict the duration of mechanical ventilatory support and whether RBC AChE at weaning can predict weaning trial outcomes in patients on mechanical ventilation for organophosphate poisoning.

- **Methods**: This retrospective observational case series identified 74 patients with a history of mechanical ventilation secondary to organophosphate poisoning and whose RBC AChE levels were available at presentation to the emergency department, at 24 hours of presentation, or at weaning. Data were collected for plasma cholinesterase assay results, weaning outcome, duration of mechanical ventilation, and details of patient management, including ICU stay and amount of atropine and pralidoxime administered.

- **Results**: RBC AChE activity levels at presentation and at 24 hours had a negative correlation with the duration of mechanical ventilation in subjects who ingested dimethyl organophosphate, but this correlation was not observed for those who had ingested diethyl or unclassified organophosphate. The optimal cutoff value of RBC AChE activity at presentation for predicting mechanical ventilation for less than 7 days was 1,330 U/L in subjects intoxicated with dimethyl organophosphate. However, there was no difference in R

### Innohep [^112LfFeP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2008). Low credibility.

Innohep® should not be mixed with other injections or infusions. It should be used with care in patients with a bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, and hemorrhage.

Consistent with expected age-related changes in renal function, elderly patients and patients with renal insufficiency may show reduced elimination of tinzaparin sodium. Innohep® should be used with care in these patients. Patients aged 90 years or older with creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL/min should not be treated with Innohep®.

- **Laboratory tests**: Periodic complete blood counts, including platelet count and hematocrit or hemoglobin, and stool tests for occult blood are recommended during treatment with Innohep®. When administered at the recommended doses, routine anticoagulation tests such as prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are relatively insensitive measures of Innohep® activity and, therefore, are unsuitable for monitoring.

- **Drug interactions**: Because of the increased risk of bleeding, Innohep® should be used with caution in patients receiving oral anticoagulants, platelet inhibitors (e.g. salicylates, dipyridamole, sulfinpyrazone, dextran, NSAIDs including ketorolac tromethamine, ticlopidine, and clopidogrel), and thrombolytics. If coadministration is essential, close clinical and laboratory monitoring of these patients is advised.

### Early death due to severe organophosphate poisoning is a centrally mediated process [^116uRsSf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003).

To distinguish whether early death from severe organophosphate (OP) poisoning with dichlorvos is mediated through peripheral or central nervous system (CNS) actions, a study was conducted using Wistar rats (n = 72). The rats were randomized to pretreatment with either normal saline (controls), peripheral anticholinergics (glycopyrrolate [low, medium, or high dose] or nebulized ipratropium bromide), or CNS + peripherally acting anticholinergics (diphenhydramine, nebulized atropine, or injected atropine). All treatments were administered prior to a subcutaneous injection of 25 mg/kg dichlorvos (n = 8 per group). Survival was assessed at 10 minutes (early death) and 24 hours (delayed death). Kaplan-Meier (95% confidence intervals [95% CIs]) and chi-squared analysis were then performed to determine differences between treatments.

Regardless of treatment, all animals exhibited profound nicotinic effects (fasciculations) without obvious seizures within 2 minutes of poisoning. In rats pretreated with peripherally acting agents, the fasciculations were rapidly followed by reduced motor activity, sedation, and death. Mortality at 10 minutes for saline controls, glycopyrrolate, and ipratropium was 88%, 96%, and 100%, respectively. The single control animal surviving beyond 10 minutes went on to develop peripheral cholinergic manifestations, including hypersalivation, urination, and defecation. Only one of 24 animals treated with injected atropine, nebulized atropine, or diphenhydramine died during the early phase of poisoning; all others survived to 24 hours (p < 0.01).

In conclusion, death in acute organophosphate poisoning appears to be a centrally mediated process.

### Protopam chloride [^114YyWYx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**: The principal action of pralidoxime chloride is to reactivate cholinesterase (mainly outside of the central nervous system), which has been inactivated by phosphorylation due to an organophosphate pesticide or related compound. The destruction of accumulated acetylcholine can then proceed, and neuromuscular junctions will again function normally. Pralidoxime chloride also slows the process of "aging" of phosphorylated cholinesterase to a nonreactivatable form and detoxifies certain organophosphates by direct chemical reaction. The drug has its most critical effect in relieving paralysis of the muscles of respiration. Because pralidoxime chloride is less effective in relieving depression of the respiratory center, atropine is always required concomitantly to block the effect of accumulated acetylcholine at this site. Pralidoxime chloride relieves muscarinic signs and symptoms, such as salivation and bronchospasm. However, this action is relatively unimportant since atropine is adequate for this purpose.

- **Research and considerations**: Protopam chloride has been studied in animals as an antidote against numerous organophosphate pesticides, chemicals, and drugs (see animal pharmacology and toxicology). Regardless of whether or not animal studies suggest that the organophosphate poison to which a particular patient has been exposed is amenable to treatment with pralidoxime chloride, the use of pralidoxime chloride should, nevertheless, be considered in any life-threatening situation resulting from poisoning by these compounds, since the limited and arbitrary conditions of pharmacologic screening.

### Repeated pulse intramuscular injection of pralidoxime chloride in severe acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning [^115syDBp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This study aimed to clarify the efficacy of two therapies for patients with severe acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning, including atropine adverse effects, the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, complications, and mortality.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 152 cases collected from May 2008 to November 2012 at two urban university hospitals. Patients admitted for organophosphate poisoning were divided into two groups with different therapeutic regimens: Group A received a repeated pulse intramuscular injection of pralidoxime chloride, while Group B received the same initial dosage of atropine and pralidoxime chloride, with the intravenous therapy of pralidoxime chloride limited to three days, regardless of the duration of atropine therapy. Subsequently, adverse effects of atropine, length of ICU stay, complications, and mortality were statistically analyzed and compared between the two groups.

- **Results**: The total dose of atropine was 57.40 ± 15.14 mg in Group A and 308.26 ± 139.16 mg in Group B. Group A received less atropine than Group B (P = 0.001). The length of ICU stay was reduced for Group A (P = 0.025), and Group A had fewer atropine-related adverse effects (P = 0.002). However, there was no significant difference in mortality or complication rates between the two groups (P > .05).

- **Conclusion**: In patients with severe poisoning, Group A used less atropine, experienced fewer adverse effects from atropine, and had a shorter stay in the ICU. It is suggested that therapy should be initiated as early as possible using a sufficient amount of pralidoxime chloride.

### Malathion [^115PF4BS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consideration should be given, as part of the treatment program, to the high concentration of isopropyl alcohol in the vehicle. Malathion, although a weaker cholinesterase inhibitor than some other organophosphates, may be expected to exhibit the same symptoms of cholinesterase depletion after accidental oral ingestion. If accidentally swallowed, vomiting should be induced promptly, or the stomach lavaged with a 5% sodium bicarbonate solution.

Severe respiratory distress is the major and most serious symptom of organophosphate poisoning, requiring artificial respiration, and atropine may be needed to counteract the symptoms of cholinesterase depletion. Repeat analyses of serum and RBC cholinesterase may assist in establishing the diagnosis and formulating a long-range prognosis.

### A mixture of organophosphate and pyrethroid intoxication requiring intensive care unit admission: A diagnostic dilemma and therapeutic approach [^114uL2WS]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

The illegal mixing of organophosphates and pyrethroids in marketed agriculture insecticides is becoming prevalent in developing countries. Over a 12-month period, eight patients were admitted to the emergency department of a university hospital in Dharan, Nepal, after ingestion of such a mixture with suicidal intent. All patients presented with a combination of miosis, bradycardia, tachypnea, and unconsciousness. The occurrence of both pupillary dilation following a small-dose infusion of atropine (0.08 to 0.2 mg/kg in 1–3 hours) and seizures raised the possibility of pyrethroid poisoning. In each case, an examination of the insecticide container confirmed that it contained a mixture of organophosphate and pyrethroid. After seizure control, gastric lavage, respiratory support, hemodynamic stabilization, and diuresis, seven of the patients recovered without neurological deficit. One patient suffered aspiration pneumonia and died. The early clinical picture after this mixed poisoning is based on the toxicity of organophosphates rather than pyrethroids. Because the patients responded to a small dose of atropine with mydriasis and tachycardia, it suggested a mixed poisoning. Early suspicion of mixed poisoning may have a significant prognostic impact.

### Comparison of current recommended regimens of atropinization in organophosphate poisoning [^116ePT1D]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Atropine is the mainstay of therapy in organophosphate (OP) toxicity, though research and consensus on dosing is lacking. In 2004, as reported by Eddleston et al. (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol 42(6):865–75, 2004), variation in recommended regimens was noted. We assessed revisions of original references, additional citations, and electronic sources to determine the variability in atropine dosing recommendations. Updated editions of references from Eddleston et al.'s work, texts on internal and emergency medicine, and electronic resources were reviewed for atropine dosing guidelines. For comparison, recommendations were assessed using the same mean dose (23.4 mg) and the highest dose (75 mg) of atropine as used in the original paper. Recommendations were also compared with the dosing regimen from the World Health Organization (WHO).

Thirteen of the original recommendations were updated, and 15 additional references were added, giving a convenience sample of 28. Sufficient information to calculate time to targeted dose was provided by 24 of these samples. Compared to 2004, recommendations have greatly increased the speed of atropinization, with 13 out of 24 able to reach the mean and high atropine dose within 30 minutes compared to 1 out of 36 in 2004. In 2004, there were 13 regimens where the maximum time to reach 75 mg was over 18 hours, whereas now, there are 2. While only one recommendation called for doubling the dose for faster escalation in 2004, 15 of the 24 works now include dose doubling.

### Inderalla [^111iUqEk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Propranolol is not significantly dialyzable. In the event of overdosage or exaggerated response, the following measures should be employed:

- **General**: If ingestion is or may have been recent, evacuate gastric contents, taking care to prevent pulmonary aspiration.

- **Supportive therapy**: Hypotension and bradycardia have been reported following propranolol overdose and should be treated accordingly. Glucagon can exert potent inotropic and chronotropic effects and may be particularly useful for the treatment of hypotension or depressed myocardial function following a propranolol overdose. Glucagon should be administered as 50 to 150 mcg/kg intravenously, followed by a continuous drip of 1 to 5 mg/hour for positive chronotropic effect. Isoproterenol, dopamine, or phosphodiesterase inhibitors may also be useful. However, epinephrine may provoke uncontrolled hypertension. Bradycardia can be treated with atropine or isoproterenol. Serious bradycardia may require temporary cardiac pacing.

The electrocardiogram, pulse, blood pressure, neurobehavioral status, and intake-output balance must be monitored. Isoproterenol and aminophylline may be used for bronchospasm.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^116UApcQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For the management of patients who have ingested a potentially toxic amount of calcium channel blockers (CCB), the workgroup provides specific recommendations.

- **Therapy in asymptomatic patients**: The workgroup suggests observation and consideration of decontamination, in line with position statements previously published jointly by the European Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT). Based on volunteer studies, the administration of activated charcoal may be considered if a patient has ingested a potentially toxic amount of a poison up to one hour previously. The potential for benefit after one hour cannot be excluded.

	- **Rationale**: It is preferable to observe and monitor asymptomatic patients in a hospital setting for approximately 24 hours if they have ingested more than a single therapeutic dose of CCB and are to be considered for gastrointestinal decontamination. This is based on case series. The workgroup deferred specific indications and types of decontamination to the AACT and the EAPCCT position statement (2005), instead of proposing new recommendations.

- **First-line therapy for symptomatic patients**: For symptomatic CCB-poisoned patients, the workgroup recommends:

	- Intravenous calcium (1D).
	- High-dose insulin therapy with other first-line treatments if myocardial dysfunction is present (1D).
	- Norepinephrine and/or epinephrine in the presence of shock, even if myocardial function has not yet been assessed.

### p-Stat6, PU.1, and NF-κB are involved in allergen-induced late-phase airway inflammation in asthma patients [^115GQCNf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Study individuals were seen at the screening visit where their eligibility for the study was checked based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. This visit included physical examination, spirometry, measurement of airway responsiveness to methacholine, and skin prick testing. At 24 hours before the bronchial allergen challenge, spirometry was performed and peripheral blood was collected from all eligible study subjects. An allergen (D. pteronyssinus, birch, or five grass mixture) for the bronchial challenge test in patients with allergic asthma (AA) was chosen according to the results of skin prick testing and clinical data in patients' medical records. In the case of multiple positive results from the skin prick test, the allergen that most likely caused bronchoconstriction previously was selected for specific bronchial challenge. All healthy volunteers were challenged with a D. pteronyssinus allergen. Bronchial allergen challenge was performed at 8:00 in the morning, and spirometry was reassessed every 10 minutes within the first hour, and then every hour for the subsequent 6 hours. Physical examination, spirometry, and peripheral blood collection were performed again 24 hours after the bronchial allergen challenge.

A flow chart of the study is presented in Fig. 1.

### Degenerative cervical radiculopathy: Diagnosis and conservative treatment. A review [^114vxtmt]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical radiculopathy involves the clinical diagnosis and conservative treatment of the condition. To provide a state-of-the-art assessment of diagnosis and non-surgical treatment, a literature search focused on studies discussing the epidemiology and diagnosis — through electrophysiological examination and imaging studies — as well as various conservative treatment methods. The most common causes of cervical root compression include spondylarthrosis and disc herniation. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical grounds, despite the absence of well-defined criteria. Provocative tests, such as the foraminal compression test, are widely used but not thoroughly evaluated. Magnetic resonance imaging can confirm the clinical diagnosis of degenerative cervical radiculopathy, while electromyography is mainly used to rule out other conditions. Initial treatment for cervical radiculopathy is conservative; however, no treatment modality has been evaluated through a randomized controlled trial.

### Jimson weed extract as a protective agent in severe organophosphate toxicity [^112M2nGR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients following organophosphate (OP) exposure can deplete a hospital's entire supply of atropine. Given the possibility of multiple severe exposures following a terrorist attack using OP nerve agents, there is a need for either greater atropine stores or the development of alternative antidotes. Jimson weed (Datura stramonium) contains atropine and other anticholinergic compounds and is common and readily available. It is used recreationally for its central anticholinergic effects and can easily be made into an extract by boiling the crushed seeds. The extract has a rapid onset of effects and may be useful for the treatment of OP poisoning.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether pretreatment with an easily stored and prepared Datura seed extract (DSE) will increase survival following severe OP poisoning.

- **Methods**: Datura stramonium seeds were collected, crushed, and heated in water to make a 2 mg/mL atropine solution (100 seeds contain approximately 6 mg of atropine or 0.007 mg/seed). Male rats were randomized to pretreatment with either saline (n = 10) or 7.5 mg/kg DSE (n = 10), given as a single intraperitoneal injection 5 minutes prior to a subcutaneous injection of 25 mg/kg of dichlorvos. The endpoint was time to death, recorded by a blinded observer.

- **Results**: The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 24-hour survival rate were 90% (95% CI = 56% to 100%) for the DSE-pretreated group and 10% (95% CI = 0% to 45%) for the control group. The log-rank test revealed a statistically significant longer survival for the Datura-treated animals (p = 0.0002).

### Sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate are effective against acute cyanide poisoning when administered by intramuscular injection [^111VL59q]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The study investigates the administration method of two antidotes for acute cyanide poisoning in the United States. Traditionally given intravenously, such an approach is impractical in out-of-hospital situations, especially during mass casualty events, where intramuscular injection would be preferable. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate when administered intramuscularly.

- **Methods**: A randomized, nonblinded, parallel-group study was conducted using three mammalian models: cyanide gas inhalation in mice with postexposure treatment, intravenous sodium cyanide infusion in rabbits triggered by severe hypotension, and intravenous potassium cyanide infusion in pigs triggered by apnea. In all cases, the drugs were administered intramuscularly, with the untreated models proving lethal without therapy.

- **Results**: Sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate alone rescued 100% of the mice, while their combination saved 73% of rabbits and 80% of pigs. Survival rates in treated animals across all species were significantly higher than in the control groups (log rank test, p < 0.05). In pigs specifically, the drugs significantly reduced plasma lactate concentrations within five minutes post-injection (difference: plasma lactate, saline solution-treated versus nitrite- or thiosulfate-treated 1.76 [95% confidence interval 1.25 to 2.27]).

Overall, the study concludes that sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate are effective when administered via intramuscular injection, offering a practical antidote approach for acute cyanide poisoning outside of hospital settings.

### Mannitol and exercise challenge tests in asthmatic children [^115oApk3]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2009). Low credibility.

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), a characteristic feature of asthma, can be assessed through standardized bronchial provocation tests (BPT). Exercise as a BPT is used in diagnosing and monitoring exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Recently, a novel osmotic BPT has been developed using dry powder mannitol. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical utility of the mannitol challenge to identify asthmatic children with EIB.

- **Materials and methods**: Thirty-three clinically stable children, aged 9–18 years, with a history of EIB, performed both mannitol and exercise provocation challenges. Data were composed of a cross-tabulation comparing the reaction on exercise provocation challenge to mannitol challenge. Correlations between post-exercise fall in FEV1 and response-dose ratio (RDR) and PD1) of mannitol were calculated.

- **Results**: Twenty-five children completed both tests. Pearson's correlation between log-transformed RDR for mannitol and post-exercise fall in FEV1 was r(p) = 0.666 (P < 0.001). There was no significant relationship between the log PD1) of mannitol and post-exercise fall in FEV1. Children on long-acting bronchodilator agents (LABA) were significantly (P < 0.05) more likely to have a positive response on the mannitol challenge. Positive and negative predictive values of the mannitol challenge for EIB were 69% and 91%.

- **Conclusion**: Mannitol challenge appears to be a suitable alternative for an exercise provocation test to assess EIB in asthmatic children. Given the negative predictive value of 91%, it is especially useful to exclude the condition.

### Lopressor [^11772N9J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**: Overdosage of Lopressor may lead to severe bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiogenic shock. Clinical presentation can also include atrioventricular block, heart failure, bronchospasm, hypoxia, impairment of consciousness/coma, nausea, and vomiting.

- **Treatment**: Consider treating the patient with intensive care. Patients with myocardial infarction or heart failure may be prone to significant hemodynamic instability. Beta-blocker overdose may result in significant resistance to resuscitation with adrenergic agents, including beta-agonists. Based on the pharmacologic actions of metoprolol, employ the following measures.

Hemodialysis is unlikely to make a useful contribution to metoprolol elimination [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Bradycardia**: Evaluate the need for atropine, adrenergic-stimulating drugs, or pacemaker to treat bradycardia and conduction disorders.

- **Hypotension**: Treat underlying bradycardia. Consider intravenous vasopressor infusion, such as dopamine or norepinephrine.

- **Heart failure and shock**: May be treated when appropriate with suitable volume expansion, injection of glucagon (if necessary, followed by an intravenous infusion of glucagon), intravenous administration of adrenergic drugs such as dobutamine, with α1 receptor agonistic drugs added in the presence of vasodilation.

- **Bronchospasm**: Can usually be reversed by bronchodilators.

### Oximes for acute organophosphate pesticide poisoning [^113aQDcr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning causes tens of thousands of deaths each year across the developing world. Standard treatment involves the administration of intravenous atropine and oxime, which reactivate inhibited acetylcholinesterase. The clinical usefulness of oximes, such as pralidoxime and obidoxime, has been challenged over the past 20 years by physicians worldwide.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the effectiveness and safety of the administration of oximes in patients poisoned with acute organophosphorus pesticides.

- **Search strategy**: We searched both English and Chinese databases, including the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S), and the Chinese language databases CNKI and WANGFANG. All searches were conducted in September 2009.

- **Selection criteria**: Articles that could possibly be RCTs were retrieved to determine if they were randomized.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The published methodology of three RCTs was not clear. We attempted to contact the principal authors of these studies but did not obtain further information.

- **Main results**: Seven pralidoxime RCTs were found. Three RCTs involving 366 patients studied pralidoxime versus placebo, while four RCTs with 479 patients compared two or more different doses of pralidoxime. These trials yielded quite disparate results, with treatment effects ranging from benefit to harm. However, many studies did not specify clear outcomes.

### Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of the chemokine receptor CXCR2 prevents experimental hypertension and vascular dysfunction [^111fzeaR]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

We next tested whether inhibition of CXCR2 can reverse pre-established hypertension in mice induced by angiotensin II or DOCA-salt. Consistent with previous and present data, angiotensin II infusion or DOCA-salt treatment for 2 weeks elevated blood pressure to 173 ± 5.9 mm Hg or 131 ± 4.5 mm Hg, respectively, compared with saline control (97 ± 6.9 mm Hg). Mice were then divided into two groups: one received an intraperitoneal injection of inhibitor SB265610 (2 mg/kg/d per mouse) for an additional 2 weeks, and another group received the vehicle only. Treatment of mice with SB265610 significantly lowered blood pressure in mice induced by either angiotensin II (Figure 7A) or DOCA-salt (Figure 7B) within 1 week of treatment. These results indicate that blockade of CXCR2 lowers hypertension and reduces pre-established hypertension.

- **Figure 7 description**: Treatment with SB265610 reverses angiotensin II- and DOCA-salt–induced hypertension. A and B: After 2 weeks of saline, angiotensin II, or DOCA-salt treatment, mice were given either vehicle or SB265610. During the remaining 1 or 2 weeks of treatment with saline, angiotensin II, or DOCA-salt, the systolic blood pressure was recorded by the tail-cuff method every week. ✱ p < 0.05 versus saline + vehicle, #P < 0.05 versus Ang II/DOCA + SB265610; n = 10 per group.

### Addition of neostigmine and atropine to conventional management of postdural puncture headache: A randomized controlled trial [^1159co9y]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). High credibility.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) lacks a standard evidence-based treatment. A patient treated with neostigmine for severe PDPH prompted this study.

- **Methods**: This randomized, controlled, double-blind study compared neostigmine and atropine (n = 41) versus a saline placebo (n = 44) for treating PDPH in addition to conservative management of 85 patients with hydration and analgesics. The primary outcome was a visual analog scale score of ≤ 3 at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours after intervention. Secondary outcomes were the need for an epidural blood patch, neck stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Patients received either neostigmine 20 μg/kg and atropine 10 μg/kg or an equal volume of saline.

- **Results**: Visual analog scale scores were significantly better with two doses of neostigmine/atropine. There were no between-group differences in neck stiffness, nausea, or vomiting. Complications, including abdominal cramps, muscle twitches, and urinary bladder hyperactivity, occurred only in the neostigmine/atropine group (P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: Neostigmine/atropine was effective in treating PDPH after only two doses. Neostigmine can pass the choroid plexus but not the blood-brain barrier. The central effects of both drugs influence both cerebrospinal fluid secretion and cerebral vascular tone, which are the primary pathophysiological factors.

### Tegsedi [^115Thijr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions and antibody formation**: Tegsedi can cause hypersensitivity reactions. In clinical studies, 6 of 161 (4%) Tegsedi-treated patients discontinued treatment due to a hypersensitivity reaction, with antibodies to Tegsedi present during these occurrences. The reactions generally manifested within 2 hours of administration and included symptoms such as headache, chest pain, hypertension, chills, flushing, dysphagia, palmar erythema, eosinophilia, involuntary choreaform movements, arthralgia, myalgia, and flu-like symptoms. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue administration of Tegsedi and initiate appropriate therapy. Do not use in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to Tegsedi.

- **Uninterpretable platelet counts and antiplatelet antibodies interaction with EDTA**: In Study 1 [see Clinical Studies (14)], 23% of Tegsedi-treated patients experienced at least one uninterpretable platelet count due to platelet clumping, compared to 13% of placebo patients. In two cases of severe thrombocytopenia, where platelet count fell below 25 x 10⁹/L and one resulted in death, clumped platelet samples caused a delay in diagnosis and treatment. Both subjects tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-platelet IgG antibodies shortly before or at the time of severe platelet count reduction. Although platelet clumping can result from various causes (e.g. incompletely mixed or inadequately anticoagulated samples), it may occur due to a reaction between antiplatelet antibodies and ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA).

### An open-label study examining the effect of pharmacological treatment on mannitol- and exercise-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic children and adolescents with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^117Jvq73]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Mannitol- and exercise-induced bronchial provocation tests are both used to diagnose exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. The study aimed to compare the short-term treatment response to budesonide and montelukast on airway hyperresponsiveness to mannitol challenge test and to exercise challenge test in children and adolescents with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

- **Methods**: Patients were recruited from a pediatric asthma rehabilitation clinic located in the Swiss Alps. Individuals with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and a positive result in the exercise challenge test underwent a mannitol challenge test on day 0. All subjects then received treatment with 400 μg of budesonide and bronchodilators as needed for 7 days. After this period, both the exercise- and mannitol-challenge tests were repeated (day 7). Montelukast was then added to the previous treatment, and the tests were repeated again after another 7 days (day 14).

- **Results**: Of 26 children and adolescents with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, 14 had a positive exercise challenge test at baseline and were included in the intervention study. Seven of 14 (50%) also had a positive mannitol challenge test. There was a strong correlation between airway responsiveness to exercise and to mannitol at baseline (r = 0.560, p = 0.037). Treatment with budesonide and montelukast decreased airway hyperresponsiveness to the exercise challenge test and, to a lesser degree, to the mannitol challenge test. The fall in forced expiratory volume in one second during the exercise challenge test was 21.7% on day 0 compared to 6.7% on day 14 (p = 0.001).

### Hypothermia and fever after organophosphorus poisoning in humans — a prospective case series [^114ziCD9]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Over the two study periods, 53 patients were admitted to Polonnaruwa General Hospital (PGH) with deliberate organophosphorus (OP) self-poisoning. Of these patients, 41 were excluded because they were initially asymptomatic (17) or had received atropine therapy prior to admission (24). There were 11 male patients and one female patient, with a mean age of 37.9 years (range 17–65), and they had ingested a range of OP compounds. All 12 patients demonstrated manifestations of OP activity at muscarinic and/or nicotinic receptors and presented within 6 hours of ingestion. Five patients had a reduced level of consciousness on admission. Seven required intubation and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). One of these seven patients, whose admission was complicated by aspiration pneumonia, died unexpectedly 8 days after admission, although he had been apparently stable following extubation the preceding day.

The data collected is demonstrated by temperature readings shown in Figure 1 for the patient with the greatest disturbance of temperature. This was a 43-year-old male admitted three and a half hours after ingestion of unknown quantities of chlorpyrifos and alcohol. He received only IV saline prior to transfer and, on arrival, had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 4.

### Unituxin [^1161wJxC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform patients and caregivers about potential risks and necessary actions during the course of treatment with Unituxin:

- **Serious infusion reactions**: Patients should be aware of the risk of serious infusion reactions and anaphylaxis. It is crucial to immediately report any signs or symptoms, such as facial or lip swelling, urticaria, difficulty breathing, lightheadedness, or dizziness, occurring during or within 24 hours following the infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Pain, peripheral neuropathy, prolonged urinary retention, and transverse myelitis**: Patients should be informed about the risk of severe pain, sensory and motor neuropathy, prolonged urinary retention, and transverse myelitis. Promptly report severe or worsening pain and signs and symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, burning, weakness, or inability to urinate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Neurological disorders of the eye**: It is important to inform patients about the risk of neurological disorders of the eye. Prompt reporting of signs or symptoms, such as blurred vision, photophobia, ptosis, diplopia, or unequal pupil size, is essential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS)**: Patients should be informed of the risk of RPLS and instructed to immediately report signs or symptoms, like severe headache, hypertension, visual changes, lethargy, or seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Capillary leak syndrome**: Ensure that patients are aware of the condition and discuss potential symptoms and necessary actions with healthcare providers.

### The use of intravenous atropine following a saline infusion in the prevention of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in elderly patients [^11627SDP]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2000). Low credibility.

We investigated the efficacy of IV atropine for preventing spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in elderly patients. Seventy-five patients undergoing transurethral prostate or bladder surgery were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 25), atropine 5 microg/kg (small-dose atropine, n = 25), or atropine 10 microg/kg (large-dose atropine, n = 25) after the induction of spinal anesthesia. All the patients received an IV infusion of 10 mL/kg 0.9% normal saline over 10 minutes before the induction of anesthesia.

The systolic blood pressure decreased in all three groups after spinal anesthesia. There was a significant increase in the mean heart rate in both atropine groups compared to the placebo group (placebo group: 78 bpm, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 76.6–78.5; small-dose atropine group: 86 bpm, 95% CI 83.9–88.8; large-dose atropine group: 97 bpm, 95% CI 94.5–100.3; P = 0.001). There was a significant decrease in the incidence of hypotension in patients who received atropine (placebo group: 76%; small-dose atropine group: 52%; large-dose atropine group: 40%; P = 0.03).

The mean dose of ephedrine required was significantly decreased in the atropine groups (placebo group: 12.2 mg [SD = 10.5]; small-dose atropine group: 7.4 mg [SD = 10.0]; large-dose atropine group: 5.4 mg [SD = 8.7 mg]; P = 0.048). The total amount of IV fluid and the number of patients requiring metaraminol in addition to 30 mg of ephedrine were not significantly different among the three groups.

Significant side effects, such as confusion, ST segment changes, or angina, were not detected in any of the groups.

### Clinical and bioavailability studies of sublingually administered atropine sulfate [^1137nrk2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The increased use of organophosphorus (OP) pesticides and the ever-increasing possibility of terror groups using nerve agents underscore a need to develop effective and safe antidotes against OP poisoning. The objectives of the present study were to develop a novel atropine sulfate (AS) sublingual injection formulation, to create its bioavailability data in humans, and to evaluate its suitability for field use with a view to obtaining early therapeutic drug concentration in comparison to the conventional intramuscular route that provides a therapeutic peak of 6 to 8 ng/mL in blood at 30 minutes.

- **Methods**: Two milligrams per 0.1 mL of AS was sublingually injected into 6 volunteers, and bioavailability and atropinization signs (blood pressure, pupil diameter, and heart rate) were noted.

- **Results**: A human bioavailability curve was created, which was equivalent to a 2 mg IM injection in amplitude within 10 minutes and describing a better curve thereafter. The peak plasma concentration of AS occurred at 15 minutes and was 21 ng/mL. The increase in heart rate became extremely significant at 5 minutes (P < .0001) with a maximum increase of 62% ± 6% at 10 minutes after administration. Pupil diameter showed a maximal increase of 58% ± 21% at 15 minutes (P < .01).

- **Conclusions**: Sublingual AS appears to have several advantages over the conventional IM route, including better bioavailability, rapid onset of action, and early atropinization. It is a safe and efficacious procedure with the potential to become an alternative to conventional IM injection, particularly in cases of chemical terrorism.

### Enhanced cough response to hyperpnea with cold air challenge in chronic cough patients showing increased cough sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin [^114oJhzm]. Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Although many chronic cough patients have complained of an induced cough by cold air contact, the clinical relevance of cold air in inducing a cough and the diagnostic value of a hyperpnea with cold air (HCA) challenge to detect a hyperreactive cough reflex have not yet been investigated.

- **Methods**: Recordings of cough counts following a 2-minute HCA challenge were performed in 49 chronic cough patients and 15 healthy controls. Capsaicin cough provocation tests, which determine the threshold concentration of capsaicin that induces five or more consecutive coughs (C5), were also administered.

- **Results**: After comparing the results from the capsaicin cough provocation tests of the patients and the controls, the chronic cough patients were divided into two groups: an increased cough sensitivity (ICS) group (n = 28; C5 or ≥ 32 micromol/l). The median value of induced cough counts following a HCA challenge was 11 coughs in patients with ICS, which was a significantly enhanced cough response compared to that of the patients with normal cough sensitivity (NCS) and healthy controls (four coughs, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: A simple cough provocation test using a HCA challenge may be useful for detecting ICS. It also suggests that hyperreactive cough reflexes may be one of the mechanisms of inducing chronic cough.

### Mannitol as a challenge test to identify exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in elite athletes [^1143p6ZZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Bronchial provocation tests provide objective criteria for asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) and were recommended to justify the use of inhaled beta2-agonists by athletes at the Winter Olympics 2002. Eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea (EVH) was one test recommended to identify EIB. Provocation with EVH requires a special dry gas mixture, limiting its availability. In contrast, provocation tests with osmotic aerosols require less expensive equipment that is easily portable.

We assessed the sensitivity of a challenge with mannitol to identify responsiveness to EVH in 50 elite summer sport athletes, who were unselected based on respiratory symptoms. Asthma was previously diagnosed by a doctor in 27 subjects, and 21 subjects were currently under treatment for EIB or asthma. The mean predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 103.6% ± 10.8%, forced vital capacity (FVC) was 99% ± 13.3%, and the mean forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the FVC was 104% ± 22.7%.

A total of 25 subjects were positive to the EVH challenge, with a mean percentage fall in FEV1 of 25.4% ± 15% SD, and 26 subjects had a positive mannitol challenge. The geometric mean [95% confidence interval] provoking dose causing a 10% fall in FEV1 (PD10) was 202 mg [134, 300], with 24 of the subjects positive to both challenges. Mannitol showed a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 92% in identifying a positive response to EVH and, as such, could be used as an alternative to EVH to identify EIB.

### Osmitrol [^116cx32h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, hypotension, and dyspnea resulting in cardiac arrest and death, have been reported with OSMITROL. Stop the infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of a suspected hypersensitivity reaction develop. Initiate appropriate therapeutic countermeasures as clinically indicated.

- **Renal complications including renal failure**: Renal complications, including irreversible renal failure, have been reported in patients receiving mannitol. Reversible oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI) has occurred in patients with normal pretreatment renal function who received large intravenous doses of mannitol. Although the osmotic nephrosis associated with mannitol administration is in principle reversible, osmotic nephrosis in general is known to potentially progress to chronic or even end-stage renal failure. Monitor renal function closely, including signs of urine output reduction, during OSMITROL infusion. Patients with pre-existing renal disease, conditions that put them at high risk for renal failure, or those receiving potentially nephrotoxic drugs or other diuretics are at increased risk of renal failure following administration of OSMITROL. Avoid concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. aminoglycosides) or other diuretics with OSMITROL, if possible [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].

Patients with oliguric AKI who subsequently develop anuria while receiving mannitol are at risk of congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and hypertensive crisis.

### Open-label randomized clinical trial of atropine bolus injection versus incremental boluses plus infusion for organophosphate poisoning in Bangladesh [^1145Uf7o]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2012). High credibility.

Severe organophosphate compound (OPC) poisoning is an important clinical problem in many countries worldwide. Unfortunately, little clinical research has been performed, and little evidence exists to determine the best therapy. Therefore, a study was undertaken to determine the optimal dosing regimen for atropine in the treatment of OPC poisoning. An open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted at Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Chittagong, Bangladesh, on 156 hospitalized individuals with OPC poisoning from June to September 2006. The aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of conventional bolus doses with individualized incremental doses of atropine for atropinization followed by continuous atropine infusion for managing OPC poisoning.

Inclusion criteria included patients with a clear history of OPC poisoning with evident clinical signs of toxicity, specifically features of a cholinergic crisis. The patients were observed for at least 96 hours, with immediate outcomes and complications recorded. Out of 156 patients, 81 received conventional bolus dose atropine (Group A), and 75 received rapidly incremental doses of atropine followed by infusion (Group B). The mortality in Group A was 22.5% (18/80), and in Group B, it was 8% (6/75) (p < 0.05). The mean duration of atropinization in Group A was 151.74 minutes compared to 23.90 minutes for Group B (p < 0.001). More patients in Group A experienced atropine toxicity than in Group B (28.4% versus 12.0%, p < 0.05); intermediate syndrome was more common in Group A than in Group B (13.6% versus 4%, p < 0.05).
