## Question

what is the management of Left seventh eighth ninth and tenth mildly displaced posterior rib fractures.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of mildly displaced left posterior rib fractures involving ribs 7–10. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the injury pattern and its anatomic implications. Then, I should verify the severity classification and whether "mildly displaced" meets operative thresholds. Next, I will review guideline-based indications for surgical stabilization versus nonoperative care. After that, I need to check for associated injuries and complications that could alter management. Then, I will outline a nonoperative protocol including analgesia, respiratory therapy, and monitoring. Finally, I will define escalation criteria, timing for reassessment, and when to consider SSRF if the clinical course deteriorates, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the injury pattern and its clinical significance. Ribs 7–10 on the left are in the mid-lower chest wall and contribute substantially to chest wall mechanics; posterior fractures in this region are protected somewhat by paraspinal musculature but can still impair ventilation and cause pain with splinting, which increases the risk of atelectasis and pneumonia, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities [^112oHjDQ] [^114dLHtU].

> Wait, let me verify the severity classification before jumping ahead. "Mildly displaced" typically corresponds to offset or partial displacement rather than bicortical, severely displaced fractures; standardized nomenclature describes displaced fractures as those with 0–50% cross-sectional overlap, whereas severely displaced implies no overlap, so "mildly displaced" likely does not meet the ≥ 50% displacement threshold often used to define severe displacement in SSRF indications [^116yJGwM] [^111JddxW].

> I should confirm guideline-based indications for surgical stabilization. High-quality WSES-AAST guidance recommends SSRF for multiple (≥ 3) ipsilateral rib fractures (ribs 3–10) when they are severely displaced and/or when there is failure to wean from mechanical ventilation or severe pain refractory to optimized multimodal therapy; they also advise recognizing hemodynamic instability as a contraindication and considering SSRF in all hemodynamically stable flail chest patients [^113HHty9] [^1121bNpy] [^111VM7qk] [^111odryb] [^114vQXkG]. Hold on, I should verify the timing advice: if SSRF is indicated, early fixation within 48–72 hours is preferred; if early intervention is contraindicated, perform as soon as feasible within 3–7 days [^111HJYhs].

> Let me consider the anatomic location nuance. Posterior rib fractures are technically more challenging to access and some position papers caution against routine repair of ribs near the transverse process unless reliable fixation can be achieved; however, WSES-AAST still supports SSRF for ribs 3–10 when severely displaced or when physiologic indications are present, so posterior location alone is not an absolute barrier if indications are compelling [^116h2bqB] [^115hL4wr] [^113HHty9].

> Next, I should review associated injuries and complications that could change management. I need to check for pneumothorax or hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, and intra-abdominal injuries, because lower rib fractures can be associated with splenic or hepatic trauma; if a pleural space is open at the time of SSRF, a chest tube is recommended, and if significant hemothorax or pneumothorax persists despite tube drainage, concurrent video-assisted thoracoscopy should be considered [^111SEThs] [^112bdRmy]. But wait, what if there is delayed bleeding? Case literature shows delayed hemothorax and intercostal arterial injury can occur days after seemingly stable presentations, so vigilance for evolving effusions is warranted [^111LoAJM].

> Given that these fractures are only mildly displaced and assuming no flail segment, respiratory failure, or refractory pain, nonoperative management is appropriate. I should double-check the core elements: multimodal analgesia including NSAIDs when not contraindicated, consideration of regional techniques such as epidural or paravertebral blocks in severe cases, aggressive pulmonary hygiene with incentive spirometry, and structured follow-up to detect deterioration early [^115Eqvtm] [^116fDocR] [^114dLHtU]. Hold on, I should verify that neuraxial techniques are indeed guideline-supported for traumatic rib fractures; yes, SCCM-endorsed guidance supports thoracic epidural in trauma patients with rib fractures to optimize pain control and ventilation [^116fDocR].

> I will now examine the monitoring and reassessment cadence. Daily pain scoring, respiratory rate, oxygenation, and incentive spirometry volumes should be tracked; a practical threshold for concern is pain > 5/10, respiratory rate > 20, or IS < 50% predicted despite optimized analgesia, which signal pulmonary derangements that may prompt reconsideration of SSRF; serial chest radiographs or repeat CT can be used selectively if symptoms worsen or new complications are suspected [^116yJGwM] [^114dLHtU]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to obtain routine repeat CT at 48–72 hours, but I should correct that: routine repeat imaging is not mandated; imaging should be symptom-driven or if escalation is being considered, aligning with appropriateness criteria that discourage unnecessary CT in isolated rib fractures [^113Jt7Rh].

> Let me think about escalation criteria and timing. If the patient develops flail chest physiology, fails to wean from mechanical ventilation, or has severe pain unresponsive to multimodal therapy including regional anesthesia, SSRF should be considered. If early fixation is feasible, aim for within 48–72 hours of injury, or as soon as possible within 3–7 days if delayed by instability or other factors [^113HHty9] [^111HJYhs]. I should confirm that severe pain alone can be an indication; yes, WSES-AAST includes severe refractory pain as a relative indication for SSRF, albeit with lower-quality evidence, so case-by-case judgment is essential [^117P3YmE] [^114JfSgP].

> Hold on, I should verify the operative approach and fixation choices if SSRF becomes indicated. Muscle-sparing incisions tailored to the fracture pattern, sequential repair of displaced ribs, and selection of implants such as plates or intramedullary struts are acceptable; metal plates may provide more reliable alignment than resorbable devices in posterior locations, and minimally invasive or thoracoscopic-assisted techniques can reduce soft-tissue morbidity in experienced hands [^11715ftX] [^113nGmMm] [^114S2SyW] [^111NN8mD] [^114pLxg9]. I need to ensure I also note that if intrathoracic pathology is present, concurrent VATS can be performed at the time of SSRF when indicated [^112bdRmy].

> Let me reconsider special populations and contraindications. Advanced age, significant cardiopulmonary comorbidity, active malignancy, or terminal illness are relative contraindications requiring individualized risk–benefit analysis. Hemodynamic instability is an absolute contraindication to elective SSRF, and TBI or pulmonary contusion are not absolute contraindications but warrant careful selection and timing [^115JdzZp] [^111odryb] [^116LjefB]. I should double-check that these align with contemporary guidance; yes, WSES-AAST and position statements concur on these points [^115JdzZp] [^116RUcwq].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is as follows, and I should confirm it maps to the evidence above. For mildly displaced left posterior ribs 7–10 without flail, respiratory failure, or refractory pain, proceed with nonoperative management using multimodal analgesia, regional techniques as appropriate, aggressive pulmonary hygiene, and close monitoring of pain scores, respiratory parameters, and spirometry. Reserve surgical stabilization for evolution into flail chest, ventilatory failure or weaning failure, severe refractory pain despite optimized therapy, or progressive chest wall deformity with physiologic compromise, ideally within 48–72 hours if SSRF is chosen, with approach and implants tailored to anatomy and surgeon expertise [^113HHty9] [^111HJYhs] [^114dLHtU] [^116yJGwM].

---

For mildly displaced left posterior ribs 7–10, **nonoperative management is first-line** [^114dLHtU] with multimodal analgesia (NSAIDs, acetaminophen, opioids, regional blocks) [^115Eqvtm] [^116fDocR], aggressive pulmonary therapy (incentive spirometry, coughing, early mobilization), and close monitoring for complications [^1135ZQi1]. SSRF is **not indicated for mild displacement alone** [^1135Hd1w] but may be considered if pain remains refractory despite optimized therapy [^117P3YmE] or if respiratory function deteriorates [^111HJYhs]. Most patients recover in 6–8 weeks; counsel on activity restriction and red flags, and arrange follow-up at 2 weeks and 6 weeks.

## Clinical significance of mildly displaced posterior rib fractures

Mildly displaced posterior rib fractures are common after blunt trauma and can cause **significant pain**, impaired ventilation, and increased risk of complications such as pneumonia, atelectasis, and respiratory failure [^114dLHtU] [^116WWoPe]. The posterior rib region is less mobile than the lateral or anterior regions, so mild displacement may still cause substantial pain and respiratory compromise, particularly in older adults or those with comorbidities [^112oHjDQ] [^117DYgq5] [^113NWEbs].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) is generally reserved for specific indications, including:

- **Flail chest**: Three or more consecutive ribs fractured in two or more places, causing paradoxical motion and respiratory compromise [^114vQXkG].

- **Severe displacement**: Multiple (≥ 3) ipsilateral rib fractures (ribs 3–10) with severe displacement (> 50% of rib width) [^113HHty9].

- **Respiratory failure**: Poor response to or inability to wean from mechanical ventilation [^1121bNpy].

- **Refractory pain**: Severe pain unresponsive to optimal medical management [^117P3YmE].

In the case of mildly displaced posterior rib fractures (ribs 7–10), **SSRF is not routinely indicated** unless there is progression to severe displacement, refractory pain, or respiratory compromise despite optimal medical management [^1135Hd1w].

---

## Nonoperative management strategies

Nonoperative management is the **standard approach** for mildly displaced posterior rib fractures and includes:

---

### Pain management

Pain control is essential to enable adequate ventilation and prevent complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia [^115XDkD9]. A **multimodal analgesic regimen** is recommended, including:

- **NSAIDs**: First-line agents for mild to moderate pain [^notfound].

- **Acetaminophen**: Adjunctive therapy for additional pain control.

- **Opioids**: Short-term use for moderate to severe pain [^notfound].

- **Regional anesthesia**: Epidural or paravertebral blocks for severe pain refractory to oral medications [^116fDocR].

---

### Respiratory therapy

Aggressive pulmonary hygiene and respiratory therapy are critical to prevent complications. Incentive spirometry should be performed regularly to maintain lung volumes and prevent atelectasis; **coughing and deep breathing exercises** help clear secretions and reduce pneumonia risk; and early mobilization encourages ambulation and activity as tolerated to improve respiratory function and reduce complications [^1135ZQi1].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor for complications and ensure adequate healing. Clinical reassessment should occur at 2 weeks and 6 weeks to evaluate pain control, respiratory function, and fracture healing; **patient education** should cover activity restriction, proper breathing techniques, and signs of complications (e.g. worsening pain, dyspnea, fever) [^1135ZQi1].

---

## Potential complications and risks

Mildly displaced posterior rib fractures carry risks of:

- **Pneumonia**: Increased risk due to impaired ventilation and cough suppression [^114dLHtU].

- **Atelectasis**: Collapse of lung segments due to inadequate ventilation [^114hSPpJ].

- **Chronic pain**: Persistent pain due to malunion or nonunion [^116yJGwM].

- **Respiratory failure**: Particularly in patients with pre-existing respiratory conditions or multiple rib fractures [^11673F6b].

---

## Prognosis and recovery timeline

The prognosis for mildly displaced posterior rib fractures is **generally favorable**. Most patients experience significant pain improvement within 2–3 weeks, with full recovery typically achieved within 6–8 weeks. Recovery may be prolonged in older adults or those with comorbidities, but overall outcomes remain positive with appropriate management [^113Jt7Rh].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patients should be educated about:

- **Activity restriction**: Avoid heavy lifting, strenuous activities, and contact sports until pain resolves and healing is confirmed.

- **Pain management**: Adherence to prescribed analgesic regimen and use of regional anesthesia if indicated.

- **Signs of complications**: Worsening pain, dyspnea, fever, or chest infection symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Summary of management plan

| **Management aspect** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Pain management | - Multimodal analgesia (NSAIDs, acetaminophen, opioids) [^115Eqvtm] <br/> - Regional anesthesia if indicated [^116fDocR] |
| Respiratory therapy | - Incentive spirometry <br/> - Coughing and deep breathing exercises <br/> - Early mobilization [^notfound] |
| Monitoring | - Clinical reassessment at 2 and 6 weeks <br/> - Patient education on complications [^notfound] |
| Surgical intervention | - Not indicated unless severe displacement, refractory pain, or respiratory compromise [^111HJYhs] |
| Prognosis | - Generally favorable <br/> - Recovery in 6–8 weeks [^notfound] |

---

Mildly displaced left posterior ribs 7–10 are best managed with **nonoperative care**, including multimodal analgesia, aggressive respiratory therapy, and close follow-up. SSRF is reserved for refractory pain, respiratory compromise, or progression to severe displacement. Most patients recover within 6–8 weeks with a favorable prognosis.

Background

Blunt mechanism accounts for the majority of trauma in most centers and for > 15% of emergency department (ED) trauma visits worldwide. Approximately 35% of blunt trauma patients are diagnosed with one or more rib fractures. The risk of pulmonary complications such as pneumonia, pulmonary effusion, atelectasis and lobar collapse is drastically increased in patients with rib fractures. It has been widely documented that mortality rates in patients with rib fractures are high for young adults (10%) and even higher for the elderly (22%). Patients with chest wall injury are managed by surgical and emergency medicine teams that use protocols to dictate interventions and disposition. Decision-making in patients with severe blunt trauma and rib fractures is less complicated if mechanical ventilation or emergent surgical intervention is required. When injuries are less severe, it becomes difficult to decipher who may require more aggressive management and who is appropriate for discharge from the ED. Symptoms are insufficient to determine appropriate discharge. Additionally, symptoms are not considered accurate in predicting the outcome and morbidity in patients with thoracic trauma. There are no current nationally recognized clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the management in this population.

### Surgical stabilization of rib fractures improves survival in functionally dependent trauma patients [^113NWEbs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rib fractures are common injuries in cases of multiple trauma, particularly among elderly and functionally dependent patients, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These fractures can cause severe pain, impaired ventilation, and increased risk of pneumonia or respiratory failure, especially in patients with pre-existing comorbidities. Traditional management primarily involves pain control and supportive care; however, conservative treatment may be inadequate for frail individuals. Studies have shown that in patients over 65 years old with rib fractures, conservative management is associated with mortality rates of up to 20% and complication rates as high as 30%.

In recent years, surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) has gained attention as a method for stabilizing fractured ribs, improving pulmonary mechanics, and reducing complications. Several studies have demonstrated that SSRF can shorten hospital length of stays (LOS), reduce ventilator dependence, and improve long-term functional outcomes. Current consensus guidelines recommend SSRF for all patients with flail chest injuries. Beyond flail chest, SSRF should also be considered in non-flail chest patients with multiple (≥ 3) ipsilateral severely displaced rib fractures, or in those with ribs 3–10 fractures accompanied by respiratory failure despite mechanical ventilation, or pulmonary derangements in non-ventilated patients despite adequate analgesia. Additional indications include chest wall deformities affecting lung function, flail segments with displacement (particularly antero-lateral), and severe pain unresponsive to conservative treatment. SSRF should ideally be performed in specialized centers with multidisciplinary teams and standardized care protocols to ensure optimal outcomes. Most existing research and clinical guidelines have focused on younger or physically independent populations, leaving the benefits of SSRF in functionally dependent patients largely unexplored.

Scoring systems

Clinical and radiographic scoring systems have been developed for patients with thoracic trauma and rib fractures for risk assessment. Pape et al reported a scoring system with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.916–0.924 for chest-related complications or death based on number of rib fractures, arterial oxygen tension:fractional inspired oxygen ratio, presence of lung contusions, pleural involvement and patient age. Chapman and colleagues established RibScore, a radiographic scoring system assessing presence of ≥ 6 rib fractures, bilateral fractures, flail chest, ≥ 3 severely displaced fractures, first rib fracture, and presence of fractures in the anterior, lateral and posterior regions. This scoring system was associated with development of pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, and tracheostomy with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.71–0.75. Patients who developed pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, or who required tracheostomy had higher summed RibScores than those who did not develop such complications. Likewise, bivariate analyses showed that each of the variables in the RibScore correlated with the same complications.

Conclusion

In recent years, SSRF has become a popular topic of study. The most recent practice guidelines from EAST recommend offering this to patients with flail segments, as it demonstrated clinical benefit. Based on our institution's outcomes, we did not find data to support this. Expansion of indications to include the presence of displaced rib fractures and the presence of bilateral rib fractures for SSRF requires more study. In our study population, SSRF may lead to an increased ICU stay, which has clinical, financial and societal impact in the use of healthcare resources.

### Rib fracture repair: indications, technical issues, and future directions [^112CD116]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Rib fracture repair has been performed at selected centers around the world for more than 50 years; however, the operative indications have not been established and are considered controversial. The outcome of a strictly nonoperative approach may not be optimal. Potential indications for rib fracture repair include flail chest, painful, movable rib fractures refractory to conventional pain management, chest wall deformity/defect, rib fracture nonunion, and during thoracotomy for other traumatic indication. Rib fracture repair is technically challenging secondary to the human rib's relatively thin cortex and its tendency to fracture obliquely. Nonetheless, several effective repair systems have been developed. Future directions for progress on this important surgical problem include the development of minimally invasive techniques and the conduct of multicenter, randomized trials.

Case summary

A 24-year-old man presented to the emergency department after blunt thoracic trauma. As a vested rider, he was competing in a rodeo bull riding competition when he was thrown and suffered a bull stomp to his left thoracic cage. At presentation, he was hemodynamically stable with an obviously deformed left anterolateral chest wall. Complete trauma evaluation was performed and injury was limited to the chest with fractures of ribs 1–8 and a moderate left pleural effusion. Ribs 3–7 were comminuted and severely displaced (figure 1). Severe pulmonary contusion was present. He underwent left tube thoracostomy with evacuation of the bloody effusion. The patient did not require mechanical ventilation and remained clinically stable.

Preoperative CT. Imaging demonstrates significant chest wall injury of severely displaced left ribs with concern of parenchymal violation.

The patient was stabilized in the surgical intensive care unit and on hospital day 3 underwent left thoracoscopy, left lateral thoracotomy, wedge resection of the lung, and stabilization of left rib fractures with plating due to significant rib displacement, persistent pain, and splinting with inspiration. The displaced fracture line ran obliquely along the mid to posterior axillary line from the third to seventh ribs with significant displacement of the posterior segments into the left upper lobe parenchyma near the hilum. No active bleeding was present. The left upper lobe laceration was resected in a non-anatomic sublobar fashion using a stapler. Open reduction and internal fixation of ribs 3–7 with titanium plate and screw rib fixation device was accomplished (figure 2). Intercostal muscle tissue loss was extensive and covered with the latissimus dorsi muscle. Chest tubes were placed and the incision was closed anatomically.

### Contemporary management of patients with multiple rib fractures: what you need to know [^114dLHtU]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Ten percent of all injured patients and 55% of patients with blunt chest trauma experience rib fractures. The incidence of death due to rib fractures is related to the number of fractured ribs, severity of fractured ribs, and patient age and comorbid conditions. Death due to rib fracture is mostly caused by pneumonia because of inability to expectorate and take deep breaths. Over the last 25 to 30 years, there has been renewed interest in surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF), known colloquially as "rib plating". This review will present what you need to know in regard to triage decisions on whether to admit a patient to the hospital, the location to which they should be admitted, criteria and evidentiary support for SSRF, timing to SSRF, and operative technique. The review also addresses the cost-effectiveness of this operation and stresses nonoperative treatment modalities that should be implemented prior to operation.

### Prospective randomized trial of metal versus resorbable plates in surgical stabilization of rib fractures [^111NN8mD]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical stabilization of rib fractures has gained popularity as both metal and resorbable plates have been approved for fracture repair. Is there a difference between metal and resorbable plate rib fixation regarding rib fracture alignment, control of pain, and quality-of-life (QOL) scores (Rand SF-36 survey)?

Methods

Eligible patients (pts) included 18 years or older with one or more of the following: flail chest, one or more bicortical displaced fractures (3–10), nondisplaced fractures with failure of medical management. Patients were randomized to either metal or resorbable plate fixation. Primary outcome was fracture alignment. Secondary outcomes were pain scores, opioid use, and QOL scores.

Results

Thirty pts were randomized (15 metal/15 resorbable). Total ribs plated 167 (88 metal/79 resorbable). Patients with rib displacement at day of discharge (DOD) metal 0/14 (one pt died, not from plating) versus resorbable 9/15 or 60% (p = 0.001). Ribs displaced at DOD metal 0/88 versus resorbable 22/79 or 28% (p < 0.001), 48% in posterior location. Patients with increased rib displacement 3 months to 6 months: metal, 0/11 versus resorbable, 3/9 or 33% (p = 0.043). Ribs with increased displacement 3 months to 6 months metal 0 of 67 versus resorbable 6 of 49 or 12.2% (p < 0.004). Pain scores and narcotic use at postoperative Days 1, 2, 3, DOD, 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months showed no statistically significant difference between groups. QOL scores were also similar at 3 months and 6 months. Trauma recidivism in outpatient period resulted in fracture of resorbable plates in two pts requiring a second surgery.

Conclusion

Metal plates provided better initial alignment with no displacement over time. Clinical outcomes were similar regarding pain, narcotic use, and QOL scores. Routine use of resorbable plates for posterior rib fractures is not warranted. Lateral repairs were technically most feasible for using resorbable plates but still resulted in significant displacement. Resorbable plates may not maintain rib alignment when exposed to subsequent injury.

### Chronic pain associated with costal margin rupture [^111qZrG2]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

A 60-year-old man presented to our clinic with a 5-year history of severe, chronic chest pain. His symptoms began in September 2013 when he had a prolonged upper respiratory illness and persistent cough. After 2 weeks of coughing, he awoke one morning with severe left-sided chest pain and a large bruise over his left chest wall. He presented to his local hospital, where he was found to have a displaced left sixth rib fracture and a large left hemothorax, eventually requiring video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) evacuation. After recovering from his acute illness, he developed chronic left chest wall pain and persistent clicking and popping of his costal margin. Along with the pain, he developed symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress to a point at which he lost his business and had considered suicide.

On physical examination, he had normal vital signs and a body mass index of 28.3 kg/m 2. He had two scars on his left chest from his VATS. His left chest wall was severely tender to palpation from the midaxillary line to the sternum. He had marked, palpable instability of his costal margin on deep inspiration. He had no pain or tenderness on the right side of his chest, and the remainder of the examination was unremarkable. A CT scan of the chest demonstrated a healed fracture deformity of the left fifth rib laterally. Small near-bridging synostosis of the left posterior sixth and seventh ribs and mild gapping of the left sixth and seventh ribs laterally with no costochondral joint dislocation were identified. Reconstructions were performed on his chest CT and representative images are shown in figure 1.

### Thoracic trauma WSES-AAST guidelines [^111HJYhs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Thoracic wall injuries

Hemodynamic instability is a contraindication to surgical stabilization of rib fractures (LoE Moderate, GoR Strong).

Surgical stabilization of rib fractures should be considered in all hemodynamically stable patients presenting with a flail chest (LoE Moderate, GoR Moderate).

Surgical stabilization of rib fractures should be considered in patients presenting multiple (≥ 3) rib fractures (in ribs from 3rd to 10th) if they are ipsilateral and severely displaced and/or in presence of poor response to or impossibility to wean from mechanical ventilation (LoE Moderate, GoR Moderate).

Surgical stabilization of rib fractures should be performed within 48–72 h after injury (LoE High, GoR Strong)

If early intervention is contraindicated, surgical stabilization of rib fractures should be performed as soon as possible within 3 to 7 days after injury (LoE Moderate, GoR Moderate).

Surgical stabilization of rib fractures may be considered in severe pain unresponsive to other treatments (LoE Low, GoR Weak).

Traumatic brain injury and pulmonary contusion are not absolute contraindications to surgical stabilization of rib fractures (LoE Moderate, GoR Moderate).

Advanced age, significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities, active malignancy or other terminal illnesses represent relative contraindications to surgical stabilization of rib fractures; case-by-case evaluation is mandatory (LoE Low, GoR Strong).

In patients with empyema or prior chest radiation surgical stabilization of rib fractures mandates a careful evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio (LoE Low, GoR Strong).

If intrathoracic organ injury is suspected or significant haemothorax or pneumothorax is present despite chest tube, video assisted thoracoscopy should be considered at the time of rib fractures surgical stabilization (LoE Moderate, GoR Moderate).

### Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF): the WSES and CWIS position paper [^112mnafe]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Project rationale and design

This position paper is supported by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and the Chest Wall Injury Society (CWIS) and aims to provide a systematic review of the literature investigating the surgical management of rib fractures in the emergency setting, to develop position statements based on the currently best available evidence and practice. For this purpose, the organizing committee constituted a steering committee, that had the task of drafting the present position paper, and an international expert panel composed of experts who were asked to revise the manuscript and position statements critically. The position paper was developed according to the WSES methodology. We shall present the systematic review of the literature and provide the derived statements upon which a consensus was reached, specifying the quality of the supporting evidence and suggesting future research directions.

Purpose and use of these guidelines

These guidelines are evidence-based, with the grades of recommendation based on the evidence. They do not represent the standard of practice, but are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and a consensus of experts. They do not exclude other approaches as being within a standard of practice. The treating clinician should determine the most appropriate action, after taking into account conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. The responsibility for the management and outcome rests with the engaging practitioners, and not the consensus group. Furthermore, we recognize that the SSRF literature is continually evolving, and these guidelines represent the state of the art at the current time, subject to modifications as new research becomes available.

Discussion

This case presents a unique scenario where a patient with chronic pain and complex rib fractures, initially deemed ineligible for surgical intervention based solely on adherence to national guidelines, ultimately required emergent surgical stabilization on hospital 5 due to an escalating pain crisis and worsening respiratory mechanics. This patient failed maximum conservative management of their rib fractures and our team thought they required delayed surgical stabilization of their rib fractures. Ideally, rib fractures should be stabilized within 72 hours of presentation.

While conventional recommendations dictate surgical intervention for patients with specific fracture patterns (ie, flail chest or multiple bicortical offset fractures), severe displacement in several ribs or evidence of paradoxical chest motion, this patient initially fell outside these criteria, with only one rib displaying greater than 50% displacement. This case demonstrates the need in select patient populations (ie, with severe chronic pain) to consider early rib stabilization when they possess pulmonary physiologic derangements despite locoregional anesthesia and multimodal pain therapy (but do not meet the displacement or fracture pattern guidelines).

This case reminds us that evolving clinical presentations necessitate continuous re-evaluation by the trauma team of the treatment approach that may not align with current guidelines. Given this changing clinical picture and the urgency of the patient's pain crisis, a tailored approach was necessary, irrespective of the conventional guidelines. This decision underscored the commitment to prioritizing the patient's individual circumstances and adapting to their changing clinical needs.

Case 1

A patient in their 70s with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease presented after slipping and falling on ice with a left-sided 9th rib fracture and left superior and inferior pubic rami fractures. Despite the continued use of analgesics, the patient continued to endorse posterior rib pain at the site of the mildly displaced fracture. The patient's initial reported pain level was 9/10 on the subjective pain scale and initial IS reading was about 800 mL. After just 1 hour, the patient reported their pain level as 1/10 on the subjective pain scale and IS measured as 1000 mL. At the 8-hour follow-up, pain was 0/10 at rest and 7–8/10 with movement and IS was 1250 mL. At 16 hours, pain continued to be 0/10 at rest, 5/10 with movement and IS was up to 1500 mL. Finally, at 24 hours, the patient's pain was 0/10 at rest and with movement and IS remained constant between 1250 and 1500 mL. The patient could not be reached for the 14-day follow-up.

Case 2

A previously healthy patient in their 30s presented after motor vehicle crash (MVC) with multiple injuries including left-sided rib fractures to ribs 2–7, a left hemopneumothorax, left L2–L4 transverse process fractures, bilateral superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, and right comminuted sacral fracture. The patient was in obvious pain due to their rib fractures but was uncomfortable and in much more pain due to the position they had to be placed in to complete the procedure. We asked the patient if they wanted to terminate the procedure; it was our opinion that we could not effectively and safely continue if the patient was so uncomfortable. Ultimately, the patient agreed they were not tolerating the procedure and decided it would be best to terminate the procedure at that time due to concomitant injuries.

### Assessment of thoracic volume changes after the collapse of lateral rib fractures based on chest computed tomography data: computer simulation and a multiple variable linear regression analysis [^117P2vGy]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In general, the influence of rib fracture displacement and collapse on thoracic volume in fractures of the 6th through 8th ribs are critical in lateral rib fractures. For patients with 6th to 8th rib fractures and posterior rib collapse, operational decisions to perform surgical intervention to restore thoracic volume may be more important. For patients undergoing surgical treatment of flail chest, the collapse of the 6th to 8th ribs and posterior ribs should be first fixed while maintaining the stability of the thoracic cage.

### Delayed hemothorax following blunt thoracic trauma: a case report [^111LoAJM]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 79-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with persistent pain on the posterior right chest wall after a fall from a stepladder while changing a lightbulb that had occurred 5 days before presentation. Past medical history included heart failure, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, aortoiliac aneurysm correction, and biological mitral valve replacement 10 years ago. Before admission, his medications included nifedipine, clonidine, timolol, and metformin.

Upon arrival, his temperature was 36 °C, pulse 75/min, breaths 16 /min, blood pressure 102/63 mmHg and oxygen saturation 94%. Physical examination showed bruising along the right costal margin. Pulmonary sounds were absent in the right hemithorax. Computed tomography (CT) scan reported non-displaced transverse fractures in the middle third of the right seventh, eighth, ninth, and 12th costal arches, and depressed rib fractures of the 10th and 11th arches (Image 1 A), along with a massive hemothorax. Treatment included closed thoracostomy, with drainage of 1200 cc upon insertion of the chest tube, analgesia, and respiratory therapy. On the fifth day of inpatient management, with symptom improvement, stable hemoglobin (Hb) levels (Table 1), and a chest X-ray showing minimal residual hemothorax (Image 2), the tube was removed, and the patient was discharged.

### The surgical stabilization of multiple rib fractures using titanium elastic nail in blunt chest trauma with acute respiratory failure [^112oHjDQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

During the study period, all of the operations were uneventful. There were no surgical complications and no surgical mortalities. The length of the surgical wound was limited to 8–12 cm. The first three patients had larger surgical wounds because the surgeon was unpracticed in the technique. However, even during this learning period, no patients required a standard exploratory thoracotomy. In this early period, the most important details of this operation were identified. First, the fracture sites of the ribs must be evaluated carefully. Based on the anatomic distribution of the twelve pairs of ribs, they are divided into three groups: the first to the third ribs, the fourth to the ninth ribs, and the tenth to the twelfth ribs. Rib fractures in the first to the third ribs do not cause a deformation of the chest cavity, because the thick muscle layers of the shoulder girdle are located on the lateral and posterior sides, and the pectoris major and minor are located on the anterior side. All of these muscle groups prevent severe deformation of the chest during accidents. The clavicle bone, located at the apex of the chest wall, also provides excellent support for the upper chest. If the clavicle bone is fractured and there is total displacement, fixation of the fractured clavicle bone to support the upper chest is recommended. The thick muscle layers around the first to the third ribs also make any approach to the upper chest difficult. A larger incision wound is required, which means that the large chest wall muscle groups are destroyed. The tenth to the twelfth ribs are located beneath the diaphragm. Fractures in this region do not degrade the integrity of the chest cavity, and there is no need for fixation. The region of the fourth to the ninth ribs comprises the largest volume of the entire chest cavity. Fractures in this region can cause severe deformation of the chest wall, especially when combined with flail chest. Rib fractures in this region are suitable for fixation. Second, only fractures on the anterior lateral side can be fixed, because injuries in this region usually cause severe chest wall deformation. The posterior third ribs, especially near the thoracic vertebral spine, do not require fixation. Ribs in these areas are surrounded by para-spinal muscle groups. These muscle groups are thick and strong. Fractures in these regions are protected by these muscle groups, and severe deformation of the chest wall is prevented. This strong musculature not only inhibits movement of the fracture site, but also provides an adequate blood supply for rapid healing. Any approach to these regions is also very difficult, because of these strong para-spinal muscles. Third, not all fractured ribs require fixation. The tenting force of a fixed rib can cause the unfixed rib to return to its original position spontaneously. An example of this is when a patient has continuous fractures to the fourth to the eighth ribs. Not all five ribs require fixation. It is possible to fix the fourth, sixth, and eighth ribs only. The other two fractured ribs are then pushed to their primary position, which maintains the stability of the chest wall. This procedure reduces use of materials and the total time required for surgery.

Rib fractures are common among patients sustaining blunt trauma, and are markers of severe bodily and solid organ injury. They are associated with high morbidity and mortality, including multiple pulmonary complications, and can lead to chronic pain and disability. Clinical and radiographic scoring systems have been developed at several institutions to predict risk of complications. Clinical strategies to reduce morbidity have been studied, including multimodal pain management, catheter-based analgesia, pulmonary hygiene, and operative stabilization. In this article, we review risk factors for morbidity and complications, intervention strategies, and discuss experience with bundled clinical pathways for rib fractures. In addition, we introduce the multidisciplinary rib fracture management protocol used at our level I trauma center.

Anatomic considerations for SSRF

The ribs are divided into three anatomic sections — anterior, lateral and posterior — by the anterior and posterior axillary lines, respectively. The decision to stabilize fractured ribs is predicated on both physiologic and anatomic considerations. SSRF should be considered for fractures in ribs 3–10. Repair of ribs 1, 11 and 12 does not improve chest wall stability or pain control; it should only be considered in highly specific scenarios — such as severe displacement, vascular compromise or persistent localized pain (level 5, grade D). Fractures near the transverse process are not recommended for repair unless the surgeon can obtain reliable fixation on the proximal fracture fragment (level 5, grade D). Conversely, fractures within 2.5 cm of the costal cartilage may be effectively repaired by anchoring the plates to either the cartilage or the sternum. Surgical fixation hardware requires adequate rib length on each side of the fracture to secure the hardware. Typically, at least 2.5 cm of healthy rib is required for adequate fixation, and issues pertaining to inadequate length for fixation are more commonly encountered with fractures involving the most anterior and posterior ribs. If there are multiple fracture sites in a single rib, both fracture sites should be repaired. For inexperienced surgeons who are attempting thoracoscopic SSRF, it is recommended they begin with ribs 6–8, as these are more easily repaired and will allow for improvement in surgical technique.

Materials and methods

Literature and search strategy

Two different investigators independently searched the following electronic databases for information from February 1958 to April 2018: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. The following related terms were searched: Rib fractures; Surgical procedures, Operative; Conservative treatment; Flail chest; and Meta-analysis. A search strategy was constructed by combining the above terms with "AND" or "OR". No restrictions were imposed on the language of the studies. We also screened the references lists of the retrieved articles so that relevant studies were not missed.

Study selection criteria

Two different reviewers independently assessed the retrieved articles to determine whether the study met the inclusion criteria. In case of disagreements, a third reviewer was involved in the discussion until a consensus was reached. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (I) randomized controlled trials comparing surgical management with non-surgical management in adults with rib fractures; and (II) studies with patients who had no other concomitant diseases, such as respiratory dysfunction, liver or kidney dysfunction, etc. The exclusion criteria included the following: (I) case-control studies, animal studies, cadaver studies, single case reports, comments, letters, editorials, protocols, guidelines, publications based on surgical registries, and review papers; and (II) studies with patients who had the following characteristics: (i) coagulation disorders, instability of vital signs, infections or any surgical contraindications; (ii) thoracocyllosis; (iii) previous or current complicated severe pulmonary disease (such as emphysema, respiratory failure, etc.), circulatory system disease (such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, etc.), liver or kidney insufficiency, and tumours.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two different investigators independently performed the data extraction and methodological quality assessment. Data extracted from the included studies consisted of authors, publication date, study design, number of patients, surgical approach, follow-up duration and outcome data in both the surgical management group and the non-surgical management group. The outcome measures included duration of antibiotic use, incurred expense, hospitalization time, intensive care time, mechanical ventilation time, mortality rate, pulmonary infection rate and tracheotomy rate. The methodological quality of the study was evaluated in six domains, including sequence generation, allocation concealment, participant blinding, assessor blinding, incomplete data, selective reporting and other bias. Each included study could be considered as unclear risk, low risk or high risk of bias in each domain based on the Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0.

Fracture severity

The fracture severity is described as incomplete (type 1), bicortical non-displaced (type 2), or displaced/distracted/comminuted (type 3). The numbers are used in shorthand notation when documenting ("mapping") rib fractures (figure 2). Incomplete fractures are defined as fractures with only a single cortex that has a clear fracture (and no clear fracture line that crosses the second cortex) or that have no clear fracture on either cortex but have at least one cortex with a "buckle" fracture. Bicortical non-displaced fractures are fractures with a clear fracture line through both cortices, but at least one cortex, or both, remains aligned. Displaced fractures are fractures where both cortices are completely off alignment, where there is comminution, or where there is a 3 mm or greater distraction. Additionally, a "Z-like" fracture pattern, where there is often not a clear cortical fracture line, is considered displaced (often seen in the higher anterior ribs).

Case report

These anatomic findings were modified slightly and employed clinically. The patient is a 53-year-old man who presented to a level 1 trauma center after being involved in a motor vehicle crash. He was the unrestrained driver of a car that crashed into a tree. He had multiple left-sided rib fractures with a flail segment and hemothorax. The patient's respiratory status did not improve during the course of 3 days with maximal multimodal pain management including an epidural pain catheter and aggressive pulmonary toilet. He had persistent spells of sharp incapacitating pain along his left chest and could not pull volumes greater than 300 mL on incentive spirometry.

A 3D reconstruction was done on his admission CT scan (figure 5). His left ribs were fractured at multiple levels: ribs 2 and 3 fractured posteriorly but not displaced, rib 4 fractured posteriorly with displacement, rib 5 fractured in a flail pattern laterally and posteriorly, and rib 6 fractured laterally with displacement. After informed consent was obtained, he was taken to the operating room for evacuation of hemothorax and chest wall stabilization.

Figure 5
Preoperative 3D CT scan of the chest and postoperative chest X-ray of a patient after rib plating.

The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position. A small incision was made posteriorly along the inferior aspect of the scapula. The dissection was carried down to the chest wall and a plane was developed with blunt dissection using a sponge stick. A Bookwalter was used to exposure placing a long Richardson blade underneath the scapula to develop the operative filed. A separate incision was made and a trocar was placed in the midaxillary line through which a laparoscope was introduced. The posterior fractures on ribs 4 and 5 were visualized. They were reduced and the anterior surface of the ribs close to the fractures was cleaned off. The fractures were bridged and plated with 50 mm Acute Innovations RibLoc plates. Identification of the anterior-lateral fractures proved difficult as the fracture on fifth and sixth ribs was directly under the anterior serratus muscle. The laparoscope was removed. A separate incision was made directly over the anterior-lateral fractures on ribs 5 and 6. Two 50 mm plates using standard open technique. Prior to closure, the left hemithorax was drained thoracoscopically and a chest tube was left in place.

Introduction

Fracture patterns and clinical outcomes

Rib fractures occur in ∼9–10% of patients with trauma, and are markers of severe bodily and solid organ injury. In addition to being associated with concomitant thoracic injuries, rib fractures are associated with head, extremity, abdominal, and blunt cardiac injuries. These patients have poor overall clinical outcomes, and are at increased risk for multiple complications. Thoracic complications of rib fractures are common, including pneumonia, pulmonary effusion, aspiration, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary emboli, and atelectasis or lobar collapse; these are important as targeted interventions may enable risk reductions. An evaluation of the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) from 1994 to 2003 identified a mortality rate of 10% and a 13% complication rate, of which 48% were pulmonary complications. Among 711 patients at a level II trauma center, 45% of patients with rib fracture experienced complications, including 35% sustaining pulmonary complications. In addition, 34% were discharged to a long-term care facility and 12% died; pulmonary complications accounted for 54% of late deaths within this population.

Hospital Course

Abdominal and thoracic computed tomography (CT) did not identify any signs of pneumonia or abdominal mass but, unexpectedly, revealed multiple posterior rib fractures (8th, 9th, and 10th left side and 10th right side), pulmonary contusions in both lower lobes and a small left hemothorax (see Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Chest computed tomography showing rib fracture (10th right side), pulmonary contusions in both lower lobes and left hemothorax.

An abdominal ultrasound was repeated by a pediatric radiologist and revealed a hyperechoic lesion on hepatic segment VII suggestive of hematoma, which was not visible on the CT, probably due to technical limitations. This finding was consistent with elevated liver transaminases which remained high for 2 weeks. Frank hematuria occurred and persisted for a month. It was attributed to HUS rather than trauma to the urinary tract and kidneys. Given the patient's precarious condition, bedside ultrasounds were favored subsequently, with no progression of the hepatic lesion and no signs of peritonitis. With no history of significant or high-velocity accidental trauma, child protective services were involved, and a forensic evaluation was completed. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was normal and fundoscopic examination directed by an ophthalmologist showed no retinal hemorrhages. Three additional subacute fractures (4th and 7th left rib and scapula) were identified when skeletal survey (21 films) became feasible 3 weeks after the patient's admission to the hospital. This could not be conducted earlier in the child's medical course because of significant instability. No medical conditions predisposing to bony injuries or bleeding diathesis were found.

### Assessment of thoracic volume changes after the collapse of lateral rib fractures based on chest computed tomography data: computer simulation and a multiple variable linear regression analysis [^111vW1RW]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chest blunt trauma (CBT) and the resultant rib fractures often lead to thoracic collapse. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of displacement of the rib fracture and thoracic collapse on the thoracic volume by using normal chest CT data.

Methods

In this retrospective study, seven consecutive normal participants were selected from our hospital between June and July 2018. Normal thoracic models were reconstructed, followed by simulation of lateral fractures through the 4th to 9th ribs under three collapse modes with 1–5cm of collapse. The thoracic collapse models (n = 630) were reconstructed using 3Dmax 2014. We calculated the thoracic volume and reduction percentage for each thoracic collapse model. Linear regression-based comparisons of thoracic volume reductions were performed.

Results

In all three collapse modes, the degree of the collapse was linearly correlated with the mean thoracic volume reduction. The reduction percentage in the posterior collapse mode was higher than that in the anterior collapse mode (P < 0.001). The largest volume reductions in the anterior, posterior, and simultaneous collapse models were in the 6th rib fracture model (P < 0.001), 8th rib fracture model (P < 0.001), and 7th rib fracture model (P < 0.001), respectively.

Conclusions

The influences of rib fracture displacement and collapse on the thoracic volume in the 6th through 8th ribs are critical in lateral rib fractures. For patients with 6th to 8th rib fractures and posterior rib collapse, surgical intervention to restore thoracic volume may be more essential.

Significant chest wall injury or deformity

SSRF should be considered in non-FC patients with multiple (≥ 3) ipsilateral severely displaced fractures. SSRF should also be considered in non-FC patients with multiple (≥ 3) ipsilateral displaced rib 3–10 fractures in combination with respiratory failure, ventilatory weaning failure or ≥ 2 pulmonary derangements in non-ventilated patients despite adequate locoregional analgesia. Pulmonary derangements include respiratory rate > 20 breaths per minute, incentive spirometry < 50% predicted, numeric pain score > 5 and poor cough. Rib fracture nomenclature to standardize this approach includes non-displaced→90% cross-sectional overlap; offset — 50%–90% cross-sectional overlap; displaced — 0%–50% cross-sectional overlap; severely displaced — no cross-sectional overlap or overlapping ribs. Chest wall deformities resulting from multiple, severely displaced rib fractures can impair respiratory function and aesthetic appearance. Volume loss occurs when ribs are displaced bi-cortically and can further hinder pulmonary performance. Additionally, non-union or malunion of the bone can occur, which leads to chronic pain, disability, unemployment, loss of independence, and opioid dependence. SSRF addresses these deformities, restoring the chest wall's structural and functional integrity and has been demonstrated to decrease rates of pneumonia, reduce ICU and hospital LOS, decrease duration of mechanical ventilation, decrease dyspnea and decrease mortality.

Rib fractures in infants and children are highly specific for inflicted injury in the absence of a major accidental injury or underlying bone disorder. We present a 9-week-old infant diagnosed with an acute rib fracture by US at the site where physicians palpated chest wall crepitus when no rib fractures had been visualized on the skeletal survey, including oblique views of the ribs. Based on the US diagnosis of the acute rib fracture the infant was taken into protective custody. Follow-up skeletal survey 2 weeks later revealed healing fractures of the left 6th and 7th posterolateral ribs and right 7th, 8th and 9th anterolateral ribs. We were unable to locate previous reports describing the diagnosis of rib fractures in infants by US.

Rib fractures are a common injury following blunt thoracic trauma, often resulting in high levels of morbidity and mortality. With the ageing global population, the incidence of rib fractures is expected to increase, posing a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide. With advancements in surgical techniques and pioneering research on the topic the use of surgical stabilisation of rib fractures (SSRF) has increased significantly over the past two decades. However, the relationship between certain prognostic factors and patient outcomes following surgery is still contested and there lacks a consensus on definitive indications for the operation. This literature review presents the current research on SSRF outcomes for; patients with flail chest injuries and multiple-non flail rib fractures, optimal timing between injury and operation, and patient age. This article contributes to the ongoing dialogue surrounding chest wall trauma management and may be drawn upon to aid future research and develop clinical practice guidelines.

Introduction

Rib fractures are the most common type of chest wall injury, occurring in approximately 10% of all traumatic injuries and 55% of blunt chest wall injuries. Accounting for over 400 000 annual hospital admissions, rib fractures are a significant source of morbidity and mortality. Mortality rates for rib fractures range from 2% to 20%, with the highest rates occurring among the elderly. Stawicki et al demonstrated that mortality for elderly patients (≥ 65 years) was higher compared with young patients (20.1% vs 11.4%), underscoring the need for guideline-driven care and early intervention. Studies consistently demonstrate a link between mortality and the number of broken ribs, with one particular study indicating that the odds of death rise by 19% for every fractured rib in elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years). Mortality following rib fractures mostly occurs due to pneumonia secondary to splinted, shallow respirations. Rib fractures are managed primarily through non-operative measures, but it has been widely recognized for millennia that immobilization leads to improved results. Reports dating back to Egyptian and Persian civilizations indicated improved outcomes with rudimentary rib immobilization, and rib fixation was practiced in America until the 1950s. Until recently, rib fracture management focused primarily on conservative, non-operative management. However, the failure to improve outcomes significantly with conservative management has fueled a paradigm shift in the contemporary management of rib fractures and fueled a debate on the utilization of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).

Chest wall injuries, particularly rib fractures, significantly impact patient mobility, morbidity and mortality, especially in higher-risk patients. Effective, evidence-based, management is crucial to reduce complications such as respiratory failure, prolonged hospitalization and chronic pain. Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) has re-emerged as a pivotal intervention in specific scenarios, offering benefits over conservative treatment. This expert review discusses the indications, procedural considerations, timing and follow-up for SSRF, guided by evidence-based recommendations from the Chest Wall Injury Society (CWIS).

Summary

Although nonoperative management is the mainstay for rib fracture treatment, surgical stabilization of rib fractures is becoming more common. Recently, the number of high-quality studies on management of rib fractures has also increased. The primary purpose of this review is to analyze the currently available prospective randomized studies on the management of rib fractures. In addition, we will summarize both short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with rib fractures.

At a minimum a CT scan is required prior to SSRF. The other modalities, including 3D reconstruction, may add value in certain cases but their absence should neither delay nor preclude surgery.
5 Rib fractures sites for SSRF

PS 5.1 SSRF should be considered for fractures in ribs 2–10. Repair of ribs 1, 11, and 12 does not confer additional benefits in terms of either chest wall stability or pain control and may be considered only in highly selected circumstances, such as marked displacement, thoracic or abdominal organs impalement/damage/herniation or marked chest wall deformity, vascular impingement or localized refractory pain (LoE V, Grade D).
PS 5.2 During preoperative image analysis, the surgeon should determine the rib fracture types and locations (anterior /lateral/ posterior), indicating the anatomical landmarks used (LoE V, Grade D).
PS 5.3 Fractures within 2.5 cm of the costal cartilage may be repaired by spanning plates to the sternum outer cortex if possible, or alternatively by fixation to the cartilage (LoE IV, Grade C).
PS 5.4 Fractures abutting the transverse process of the vertebral body may be repaired if the surgeon is able to obtain reliable fixation on the proximal fracture fragment. There is no absolute distance cutoff for this decision (LoE V Grade D).
PS 5.5 In patients with multiple fractures series (e.g. flail segment or FC), both fracture lines should be stabilized, wherever possible (LoE IV, Grade C).
PS 5.6 In patients with non-FC rib fracture patterns, all displaced ribs should be stabilized, whenever possible (LoE IV, Grade C).

Rib fracture sites for fixation

Knowledge and understanding of the taxonomy of rib fractures is fundamental for thoracic trauma patient prognosis, SSRF risk benefit analysis, and preoperative planning, to establish the most appropriate operative approach and technique for each case. We have yet to fully examine the importance of correctly defining the individual fracture displacement. In general, the type of individual fractures may be further characterized as: "simple", defined as a single fracture line across the rib, with no fragmentation or comminution; "wedge" when the fracture has a second fracture line, which does not span the whole width of the rib, creating a single fragment that may be termed a butterfly fragment; and "complex" that has at least two fractures lines, with one or more fragments which span the width of the rib.

Regarding surgical interventions for rib fracture, more specifically with respect to surgical stabilization, technical considerations, RFC 2017 guidelines recommend to do not offer repairment of ribs 1, 2, 11, and 12, as it does not confer additional benefit in terms of either chest wall stability or pain control. Consider repairing fractures of these ribs in highly selected patients with marked displacement, vascular impingement, or localized refractory pain.

### Assessment of thoracic volume changes after the collapse of lateral rib fractures based on chest computed tomography data: computer simulation and a multiple variable linear regression analysis [^115Kkict]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The results of this study can be used to guide clinical treatment. The mortality rate of patients with posterior rib fracture collapse of 3 or more ribs is 12-fold higher. On the basis of our results, we suggest that for patients with serious fractures (e.g. flail chest), the posterior rib collapse and lateral fractures of the 6th to 8th ribs should be fixed first to ensure the stability of the thoracic structure, which can reduce the complications caused by the volume reduction and help patients improve their long-term respiratory function. However, fractures of the 4th and 5th ribs, especially on the left side, should be managed carefully because they may be associated with damage to the heart or important vascular structures; fractures of the 9th rib should be managed while considering the possibility of injuries to abdominal organs such as the liver and spleen.

To best of our knowledge, the methodology we applied in this study (computer simulation and stereo model, and a multiple variable linear regression analysis) is quite very novel, which provides a new idea for the similar research in the future. The strengths of this study are as follows. First, simulated rib fractures are free from the influence of pain, pulmonary contusion, and pulmonary infection, which will result in insufficient pulmonary ventilation in actual patients, and the chest volume obtained by CT is less than the actual value. Second, computer simulations of rib fractures simulate the fracture on the basis of the normal thoracic model. Thus, the thoracic volume before and after the simulated fracture can be calculated to determine the reduction in thoracic volume after the fracture. However, in real rib fractures, the normal thoracic volume value before the injury cannot be obtained. Third, computer modeling of the rib model is ideal and accurate, which can allow assessments of different degrees of displacement and collapse modes in the fracture model.

The limitations of this study are as follows. First, the computerized-modelled rib fracture collapse is obtained under ideal conditions, which is different from the actual clinical condition. This study aimed to find out which rib fracture displacement in the lateral rib fracture has the greatest influence on the thoracic volume by computer simulation, not to supply the clinical evidence. The simulated results need to be further verified in clinical practice. Second, we obtained good simulation results for lateral rib fractures in this study. However, we failed to simulate the anterior rib fracture model and posterior rib fractures.

As the left 7th and 8th anterior ribs and the 10th and 11th posterior ribs were dislocated, the patient was taken to the operating room. After the double lumen endotracheal intubation general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the right decubitus position. After skin preparation and draping, a 4 cm incision was made in the 7th intercostal space near the anterior axillary line, where a membrane incision expander was put in, and thoracoscopes and operating instruments operated through the port. Exploration revealed minor active bleeding in the parietal pleura around the fracture, after suction and electrocoagulation, hematoma and deformity were found in the 7th and 8th anterior rib, as well as 10th and 11th ribs, the bone friction sensation around the rib fracture line was evident when pressed. Special instruments were needed (Fig. 2). The rib coaptation boards with 4 or 8 arms (manufactured by Lanzhou Seemine Shape Memory Alloy Co. Ltd, China) were used to fix the fractures. The implantation tool with detachable tong head (manufactured by Lanzhou Seemine Shape Memory Alloy Co. Ltd, China,) was used to connect the rib coaptation board and placed it to the broken ribs. An oval bending forcep (manufactured by Lanzhou Seemine Shape Memory Alloy Co. Ltd, China) was used to reduce displacements. After exposing fractures with an electrocoagulation hook burning, reduction was implement with forcep (for the 10th and 11th rib) or fingers (for the 7th and 8th rib). Loosened the arms of boards under 0℃ ice sterile saline, connected the boards and implantation tool, delivered boards to fractures, and inserted four embracing arms into the upper and lower edges of the fractured rib. After prayed 50℃ sterile saline, boards return to previous shape to clasp and fix the fractured rib. As the result, the rib fractures are stable without screws or wires (Fig. 3). A drainage tube was placed from the incision, and the procedure end up with incision suturing layer by layer (Fig. 4).

Discussion

Due to many benefits such as relieving pain, increased chest stability, corrected chest wall deformity, improved lung function, shorter ICU stay and ventilator use time, and lower mortality, SSRF has become an available option.

Flail chest is an universally acceptable surgical indication, however, many relative indications are also existing in clinical practice. A multicenter, prospective, controlled clinical trial indicated that SSRF could obviously reduce the numeric pain score and improved respiratory disability-related quality of life for the patients with nonflail fractures. Some guidelines also pointed the necessity of the surgery for some nonflail patterns, including multiple fractures, marked displacement, localized refractory pain, accompanied with conditions requiring operation. Although most nonflail chest rib fractures can be healed spontaneously after a long time, SSRF could prevents continual friction and promote faster recovery. However, actually, SSRF for nonflail patterns remains controversial due to previous large injuries with surgery. Traditional SSRF requires large incisions to obtain good exposure, which often resulting in enormous associated trauma. The muscles, blood vessels, and nerves in the chest wall were severely damaged, resulting in long-term intractable pain, scar proliferation, upper limb dysfunction, skin paresthesia, and wound infection, which limits the development of SSRF. While VATS can provide a satisfactory visual field in small incisions, reduce complications caused by large incisions, and treat intrathoracic injuries at the same time, VATS is gradually accepted and applied in this procedure. We note that there are currently no reports of treatment of multiple nonflail fractures accompanied with hemothorax by uni-port VATS. In our case, we tried to operate with uni-port to alleviate pain, treat the hemothorax at the same time, and minimize the impact on the sensory and motor function to a greater extent. Detailed preoperative planning and appropriate incision selection before the operation were the preconditions for smooth operation. The 7th and 8th anterior ribs and the 10th and 11th posterior ribs needed surgery, and the 7th intercostal incision in the anterior axillary line was selected. The advantage was that it was directly over the target posterior rib, which was convenient for reducing displacement with forcep and implanting boards to broken ribs. The anterior ribs of the target was located around the incision and manual reduction with fingers could be available. The operation was carried out smoothly, the patient's pain was significantly relieved, and the scar was tiny and not prominent. The postoperative review indicated that the fixation effect was excellent.

Case presentation

An adult patient presented after a high-speed motor vehicle collision with left 7–10 rib fractures and left hemopneumothorax. At the transfer facility, they required chest tube placement and intubation due to hypoxia. The patient was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) and was successfully extubated on hospital day 1. Of note, the patient had a history of pelvic radiation, and their home chronic pain regimen included the following: 80 mg oxycodone extended release and hydrocodone taken as needed 10–325 up to 8 pills per day. The pain service was consulted on hospital day 1, and despite an erector spinae plane block and epidural analgesia catheter placement, the patient experienced two uncontrolled pain crises overnight. The trauma service requested a new CT chest with 3D reconstruction on hospital day 3, which revealed multiple oblique fractures with displacement of ribs 7–10 (figure 1). Worsening atelectasis further underscored the need for intervention. Per the Chest Wall Injury Society Guideline, the patient did not meet the traditional criteria for rib plating at admission or with the new CT chest. The patient had > 3 ipsilateral acute rib fractures within ribs 3–10 with > pulmonary physiologic derangements (pain score > 5/10 and poor cough) despite locoregional anesthesia and multimodal pain therapy; however, the ribs were not severely displaced (≥ 50% of the rib width on axial CT). The patient's acute pain crisis has now prompted a re-evaluation of their management strategy.

### Clinical significance of rib fractures' anatomical patterns [^116WWoPe]. Injury (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Rib fractures are common and carry significant morbidity. Chest CT provides an accurate mapping of the fractures. The aim of this study is to propose an anatomical classification of rib fractures, and assess their relation to complication development.

Method

The records of all blunt trauma patients between January 1st 2014 and December 31st 2017 at a university hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Wounded who were hospitalized with rib fractures (two and more) as the primary injury were included in the study. Based on the chest CT scans, the cohort was divided into five groups: upper ribs (1–4) fractures, anterior, lateral and posterior middle ribs (4–7) fractures, and lower ribs (9–12) fractures. Data regarding demographics, complications (pneumothorax, hemothorax, chest drains, pulmonary contusion atelectasis, pneumonia, respiratory failure and death), intensive care admission and hospital stay were collected.

Results

A total of 102 wounded were included in the study, with a mean age of 46.3 years. The mean number of fractured ribs per person was 3.82 ± 1.68, and 46 wounded had displaced fractures. Rib fracture distribution was: upper ribs - 13.7%, anterior middle ribs - 28.5%, lateral middle ribs fractures - 27.5%, posterior middle ribs - 14.7%, lower ribs fractures - 15.7%. Wounded sustaining lateral middle ribs fractures had the highest complications rates in relation to any other fracture location group, with 25% respiratory failure rate.

Conclusions

Lateral middle ribs fractures are associated with a higher complication rate and may require closer oabservation.

### Rib fractures, the evidence supporting their management, and adherence to that evidence base… [^1134B7Wa]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The octogenarian who fell into the side of his bathtub; the restrained driver in a motor vehicle collision at 40 mph with side impact; the retiree who slipped from her ladder while cleaning out her gutters. Invariably, it seems, an initial chest radiograph shows some fractured ribs, and the injury list in the electronic health record is populated with an S22 International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code. However, from this juncture, given that trauma surgeons are wont to form strong but divergent opinions regarding management, the treatment courses vary. Is a chest computed tomographic scan necessary. Should the patient be admitted to an intensive care unit. Which form of analgesia is most appropriate. Should a thoracostomy tube be placed for a modest associated pneumothorax or hemothorax. Does noninvasive ventilation have a role. If there are multiple adjacent rib fractures, should the fractures be operatively stabilized.

In their cohort study evaluating more than 625 000 patients with rib fractures at 777 US trauma centers in the National Trauma Data Bank from 2007 to 2014, Tignanelli et al1 waded into the complex but fundamentally central topics of how, from an empirical perspective, trauma surgeons actually manage these patients and how aligned this care is with the available evidence from comparative effectiveness studies. However, before we rush headlong into measuring adherence to rib fracture EBPs, we must first ask ourselves, how certain are we that we know what optimal practice is for these injuries. Is it possible to measure such practices in a valid, reliable, feasible, and useful manner.

Except for 1 trial involving 50 patients, 5 the cited evidence for pneumatic stabilization consisted of studies that were not randomized, involved only a minor fraction of participants with rib fractures, or focused on a different comparison.

### Surgical rib fixation-technical aspects [^115DiLgt]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Surgical rib fixation (SRF) for severe rib fracture injuries is increasingly becoming an accepted treatment modality. There is now adequate evidence in randomised controlled trials that rib fixation in flail chest patients reduces ventilator times, intensive care stay and costs of treatment in ventilator dependent patients [1–3]. Despite this, rib fixation has not become standard of care for these patients and remains a treatment modality practised by few centres, usually those with large trauma loads who see high volumes of severe rib fracture injury patients. The purpose of this article is to outline the available prostheses, indications, operative planning and techniques of rib fixation. Surgical approaches to rib fractures in anterior, lateral and posterior positions are described as are the use of currently available cortical and medullary fixation prostheses.

### Assessment of thoracic volume changes after the collapse of lateral rib fractures based on chest computed tomography data: computer simulation and a multiple variable linear regression analysis [^113ZUDtm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

In the multiple linear regression analysis, the slope prediction values for the three collapse modes were 0.29 for posterior collapse, 0.17 for anterior collapse, and 0.49 for simultaneous anterior and posterior collapse (see detailed multiple linear regression results in Appendix I). The reduction percentage of thoracic volume in the posterior collapse mode was higher than that in the anterior collapse mode (P < 0.001) and the reduction of thoracic volume in the simultaneous anterior and posterior collapse mode was more significant than the sum of the reductions in the anterior and posterior collapse modes at the same collapse degree (centimeters) (P < 0.001) (see the thoracic volume reduction trend in Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Trend of thoracic volume reduction across 18 different thoracic collapse scenarios based on 630 thoracic collapse models

For the 9th lateral rib fracture model, no statistical significance was found as the percentage of thoracic volume decreased with an increase in the degree of collapse in the anterior collapse mode (P = 0.69). The largest volume reductions in the anterior, posterior, and simultaneous collapse modes were observed in the 6th rib fracture model (P < 0.001), 8th rib fracture model (P < 0.001), and 7th rib fracture model (P < 0.001), respectively. The collapse of the 4th and 5th ribs caused a relatively small reduction in the thoracic volume, while the anterior collapse of the 9th rib caused almost no change in the thoracic volume. In general, the displacement and collapse of the 6th, 7th, and 8th ribs had a key influence on the thoracic volume in side-rib fractures (see the percentage of thoracic volume reduction for each lateral rib fracture in the 3 collapse modes in Fig. 6).

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRib fractures [^113Jt7Rh]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rib fractures are the most common thoracic injury after minor blunt trauma. Although rib fractures can produce significant morbidity, the diagnosis of injuries to underlying organs is arguably more important as these complications are likely to have the most significant clinical impact. Isolated rib fractures have a relatively low morbidity and mortality and treatment is generally conservative. As such, evaluation with standard chest radiographs is usually sufficient for the diagnosis of rib fractures, and further imaging is generally not appropriate as there is little data that undiagnosed isolated rib fractures after minor blunt trauma affect management or outcomes. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation frequently results in anterior rib fractures and chest radiographs are usually appropriate (and sufficient) as the initial imaging modality in these patients. In patients with suspected pathologic fractures, chest CT or Tc-99m bone scans are usually appropriate and complementary modalities to chest radiography based on the clinical scenario. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Rib fixation: who, what, when? [^1171frRT]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Rib fractures are among the most common traumatic injury found in ∼20% of all patients who suffer thoracic trauma. The majority of these are a result of a blunt mechanism and are often associated with other traumatic injuries. The most common associated injury is lung contusion. Rib fractures impart an increased morbidity and mortality with the highest mortality associated with a flail chest in the elderly population. Flail chest is defined radiographically as 3 or more consecutive ribs fractured in 2 or more places. This often translates to a clinical flail which is associated with paradoxical chest wall movement during respiratory cycles. The mainstay of treatment has been pain control and respiratory support with positive pressure ventilation. However, over the past 2 decades, there has been mounting evidence to suggest that open reduction and internal fixation of ribs benefits patients. The indications remain confined to the most severely injured patients with flail chest or chronic non-unions; however, there remains debate whether or not less severely injured patients would benefit as well. This article will review the current evidence and provide proposed indications based on available evidence and current expert opinion.

Patient 3

A male in his 40s suffered a severe chest crush injury after being pinned by a forklift, leading to cardiac arrest. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after bilateral chest tube placement, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and large-volume blood product administration. His injuries included bilateral lung lacerations and contusions, a sternal fracture, and left clinical flail chest (left posteromedial, lateral, and paraspinal rib fractures 2–8 with severe displacement) (figure 2A). He developed hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, requiring bedside VV-ECMO cannulation shortly after ICU admission. Due to ongoing bloody chest tube output, anticoagulation was withheld, and he underwent damage control thoracotomy with left chest packing.

Figure 2

(B) Patient 4's scan demonstrating left rib fractures 1–11, including flail segments of ribs 3–7 and 10–11. (C) Patient 5's scan demonstrating right posterolateral fractures of ribs 3–12 including displaced fractures and a radiographic flail segment of ribs 4–6.

Attempts to wean VV-ECMO were unsuccessful due to chest wall instability, which contributed to poor ventilation and ongoing pulmonary injury. On hospital day 3, SSRF was performed for flail segments of ribs 4–6 and a severely displaced fracture of rib 9.

Post-SSRF, his pulmonary mechanics improved, leading to VV-ECMO decannulation on post-SSRF day 4 (ECMO day 6). After a 5-week hospital stay, he was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility and later home, with excellent functional recovery at 10 months follow-up.

Main Outcomes and Measures Six EBPs were defined: neuraxial blockade, intensive care unit admission, pneumatic stabilization, chest computed tomographic scans for older adults with 3 or more rib fractures, surgical rib fixation for flail chest, and tube thoracostomy placement for hemothorax and/or pneumothorax. Results Of the 625 617 patients with rib fractures included in this analysis, 456 196 patients were white and 432 229 patients were male; the median age of the patients was 51 years, and the mean Injury Severity Score was 18.
3. The mean number of rib fractures was 4.
2. On univariate analysis, patients treated at verified level I trauma centers were more likely to receive 5 or 6 EBPs. We also excluded patients who were not admitted from the emergency department or were missing the emergency department disposition variable.

We defined 6 EBPs for patients with rib fractures based on national trauma guidelines. 9, 14 We chose practices with varying levels of evidence. The recommendations evaluated were the following: EBP1: Neuraxial block placement for older adults with 3 or more rib fractures who were not transferred to another facility for definitive management. 15–18 Epidural analgesia was defined by ICD-9 codes 3. 90 and
3. 91, and paravertebral block was defined by ICD-9 codes 4. 80 and 4.
81. **EBP4**: Pneumatic stabilization via noninvasive ventilation for older adults with 3 or more rib fractures who were not transferred to another facility for definitive management. 16, 25–28 Noninvasive ventilation was defined by ICD-9 codes 93. 90 and 93.

### Rib fixation: who, what, when? [^116Lbk85]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The most common ribs repaired are the 4th through the 10th. These are the most mobile ribs and produce a significant amount of pain. The first through third ribs are more difficult to access and the benefit of the added dissection/trauma may not justify repairing these ribs; however, there is no high level evidence to suggest no benefit. There is some evidence to suggest that not all the fractures on multiple levels need to be repaired. Therefore, we recommend that if those ribs are severely displaced and accessible from the main incision, then it is reasonable to attempt the repair. If the fractures are anterior, the patient may remain supine, however, if the fractures have a lateral or posterior component, then a lateral decubitus position is preferable.

The incision should be minimized by strategically placing the incision in the middle of the segment to be repaired (figure 5). One should remember that the posterior chest wall may be more easily accessed via the auscultory window. A skin flap should be raised in order to allow for maximal movement of the incision to visualize the necessary muscular windows. Dissection is carried out to allow access to the rib segment but should be minimized and muscle spared. The periosteum of the rib should remain in place and not excessively dissected. When using plates, there should be just enough space to reduce the fracture and find a landing zone for the screws (figure 6).

### Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF): the WSES and CWIS position paper [^116RUcwq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Rib fractures are one of the most common traumatic injuries and may result in significant morbidity and mortality. Despite growing evidence, technological advances and increasing acceptance, surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) remains not uniformly considered in trauma centers. Indications, contraindications, appropriate timing, surgical approaches and utilized implants are part of an ongoing debate. The present position paper, which is endorsed by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES), and supported by the Chest Wall Injury Society, aims to provide a review of the literature investigating the use of SSRF in rib fracture management to develop graded position statements, providing an updated guide and reference for SSRF.

Methods

This position paper was developed according to the WSES methodology. A steering committee performed the literature review and drafted the position paper. An international panel of experts then critically revised the manuscript and discussed it in detail, to develop a consensus on the position statements.

Results

A total of 287 studies (systematic reviews, randomized clinical trial, prospective and retrospective comparative studies, case series, original articles) have been selected from an initial pool of 9928 studies. Thirty-nine graded position statements were put forward to address eight crucial aspects of SSRF: surgical indications, contraindications, optimal timing of surgery, preoperative imaging evaluation, rib fracture sites for surgical fixation, management of concurrent thoracic injuries, surgical approach, stabilization methods and material selection.

Conclusion

This consensus document addresses the key focus questions on surgical treatment of rib fractures. The expert recommendations clarify current evidences on SSRF indications, timing, operative planning, approaches and techniques, with the aim to guide clinicians in optimizing the management of rib fractures, to improve patient outcomes and direct future research.

Summary

Rib fractures are important indicators of injury severity, and patients with multiple rib fractures carry high risk of morbidity and mortality. Based on the existing literature, we recommend a comprehensive and standardized management algorithm, such as our institutional bundled care pathway presented here, including consideration of catheter-based analgesia, multimodal pain management, respiratory therapy interventions, and frequent reevaluation.

### Western Trauma Association critical decisions in trauma: management of rib fractures [^112cfSLi]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

This is a recommended management algorithm from the Western Trauma Association addressing the management of adult patients with rib fractures. Because there is a paucity of published prospective randomized clinical trials that have generated Class I data, these recommendations are based primarily on published observational studies and expert opinion of Western Trauma Association members. The algorithm and accompanying comments represent a safe and sensible approach that can be followed at most trauma centers. We recognize that there will be patient, personnel, institutional, and situational factors that may warrant or require deviation from the recommended algorithm. We encourage institutions to use this as a guideline to develop their own local protocols.
