## Question

how much weight loss does saxenda give

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much weight loss to expect with Saxenda (liraglutide 3.0 mg). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality randomized trial evidence to anchor the expected mean weight loss. Then, I should verify categorical outcomes (≥ 5%, ≥ 10%) and how they differ by diabetes status. Next, I will review real-world effectiveness and whether it aligns with trials. After that, I need to check the FDA stopping rule and early response predictors. Finally, I will synthesize a practical answer with caveats about adherence, tolerability, and maintenance over time.

> Let me first confirm the pivotal trial anchor. In the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes trial of 3,731 adults without diabetes, liraglutide 3.0 mg daily for 56 weeks produced a mean weight loss of 8.4 kg (8.0% of baseline) versus 2.8 kg (2.6%) with placebo, yielding a placebo-subtracted loss of about 5.6 kg, which is the most reliable estimate for typical efficacy in non-diabetic adults on lifestyle therapy [^117Xhhuc] [^113sxh8P].

> Wait, let me verify categorical outcomes because patients often ask about ≥ 5% and ≥ 10% thresholds. In that same trial, 63.2% achieved ≥ 5% weight loss and 33.1% achieved ≥ 10% weight loss on liraglutide versus 27.1% and 10.6% on placebo, respectively, confirming clinically meaningful response rates in a substantial proportion of users [^117Xhhuc] [^114NND7f].

> Hold on, I should verify how diabetes status modifies expectations. In SCALE Diabetes (adults with type 2 diabetes), mean weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg was about 6.0% (6.4 kg) versus 2.0% (2.2 kg) with placebo, indicating attenuated weight loss in diabetes by roughly 2–3% compared with non-diabetic populations, which is consistent with broader pharmacologic observations in diabetes [^116xb97X] [^1154Vj1e].

> Next, I should review real-world effectiveness to ensure these RCT figures translate clinically. In a Canadian real-world cohort, mean weight loss at 6 months was about 7.1% in those persisting to 6 months, and 64.1% achieved ≥ 5% loss, which aligns reasonably with trial data when adherence is sufficient [^116i87vt]. In a Swiss cohort, mean loss was 12.4% by 10 months, suggesting that with good persistence, some patients exceed trial means, though selection and follow-up differ from RCTs [^111epYsd]. In a UK primary care dataset, persistence averaged only about 3 months, and only a small subset had data to assess the 16–24 week stopping window, underscoring that real-world effectiveness is often limited by early discontinuation [^111AiEsH].

> I need to check the FDA stopping rule and early response predictors. The label advises evaluating weight change at 16 weeks and discontinuing if the patient has not lost at least 4% of baseline weight, because early nonresponse predicts low likelihood of clinically meaningful loss at 1 year; pooled analyses show early responders lose about 10.8% by week 56 in non-diabetic adults versus 3.0% in nonresponders, and about 8.5% versus 3.1% in those with diabetes, supporting the 16-week decision point [^117EiDcD] [^115fzVcV] [^113LyKpG].

> Let me consider dose, titration, and tolerability because they affect both attainment and interpretation of outcomes. The recommended regimen is weekly 0.6 mg increments to 3.0 mg over about 4–5 weeks; slower escalation can mitigate gastrointestinal adverse effects with minimal long-term impact on weight loss, and most GI symptoms attenuate with time, which helps adherence and realization of expected loss [^117EiDcD] [^1132nfpT] [^114iAAwC].

> I should double-check longer-term durability. In the 160-week extension of SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes, weight loss diminished from 8.0% at 56 weeks to about 6.1% at 160 weeks, indicating modest regain after year 1 but sustained clinically meaningful reduction versus placebo; this pattern is typical for anti-obesity pharmacotherapy and reinforces the need for ongoing lifestyle and pharmacologic continuity [^115J1j1a] [^113X28sa].

> But wait, what about head-to-head context and expectations relative to newer agents. Contemporary guidance notes average losses of about 8% with liraglutide 3.0 mg, 14.9% with semaglutide 2.4 mg, and 20.9% with tirzepatide, which helps frame Saxenda's magnitude in the current therapeutic landscape while acknowledging different trial designs and populations [^111rZYPQ].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. For adults with obesity or overweight with comorbidity who adhere to 3.0 mg daily with lifestyle therapy, a reasonable expectation is a mean loss of about 8% of initial body weight at 56 weeks, with approximately 63% achieving ≥ 5% and 33% achieving ≥ 10% loss; in type 2 diabetes, mean loss is closer to 6%, and real-world outcomes often fall below trial means due to shorter persistence and lower dose attainment, so counseling should emphasize adherence, GI management, and the 16-week stopping assessment to optimize benefit [^117Xhhuc] [^116xb97X] [^116i87vt] [^117EiDcD].

---

Saxenda (liraglutide 3.0 mg) produces an **average weight loss of 8.0%** [^117Xhhuc] of initial body weight at 56 weeks in adults without diabetes, with a placebo-subtracted loss of 5.4%. In adults with type 2 diabetes, average weight loss is **6.0%** [^116xb97X] at 56 weeks, with a placebo-subtracted loss of 4.0% [^116xb97X]. About 63% of patients without diabetes and 54% with diabetes achieve ≥ 5% weight loss [^117Xhhuc] [^116xb97X], while 33% and 25% achieve ≥ 10%, respectively. Weight loss is dose-dependent [^113TPkLH] and sustained with continued therapy, but some regain occurs after discontinuation [^1143zNFb] [^1132nfpT].

## Clinical trial evidence

Key characteristics of SCALE trials in non-diabetic and type 2 diabetes populations:

| **Aspect** | **Scale obesity and prediabetes (non-diabetic population)** | **Scale diabetes (type 2 diabetes population)** |
|-|-|-|
| Study design | 56-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117Xhhuc] | 56-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116xb97X] |
| Participants | 3,731 adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m²) with at least one weight-related comorbidity, without type 2 diabetes [^117Xhhuc] | 846 adults with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes [^116xb97X] |
| Intervention | Liraglutide 3.0 mg daily plus lifestyle intervention vs. placebo plus lifestyle intervention [^11243U9U] | Liraglutide 3.0 mg or 1.8 mg daily vs. placebo, all with lifestyle intervention [^116xb97X] |
| Results | Mean weight loss was 8.4 kg (8.0% of initial body weight) with liraglutide vs. 2.8 kg (2.6%) with placebo (difference: -5.6 kg; 95% CI: -6.0 to -5.1 kg; P < 0.001) [^117Xhhuc] | Mean weight loss was 6.0% with liraglutide 3.0 mg vs. 2.0% with placebo (difference: -4.0%; 95% CI: -5.1% to -2.9%; P < 0.001) [^116xb97X] |
| Categorical outcomes | ≥ 5% weight loss in 63.2% (liraglutide) vs. 27.1% (placebo); ≥ 10% in 33.1% vs. 10.6% [^117Xhhuc] | ≥ 5% weight loss in 54.3% (liraglutide 3.0 mg) vs. 21.4% (placebo); ≥ 10% in 25.2% vs. 6.7% [^116xb97X] |

## Long-term weight loss maintenance

Long-term maintenance was assessed in the **SCALE obesity and prediabetes extension** (160 weeks) [^115J1j1a]. Weight loss was 6.1% with liraglutide vs. 1.9% with placebo, indicating modest regain after the first year but sustained clinically meaningful loss. In the **SCALE maintenance trial**, after ≥ 5% weight loss on a low-calorie diet, liraglutide 3.0 mg maintained and augmented loss (additional 6.2% vs. 0.2% with placebo over 56 weeks) [^113xgzcL].

---

## Real-world effectiveness

Real-world data show **similar effectiveness** when treatment persists:

- **Canadian cohort**: Mean weight loss 7.1% at 6 months in persistent users [^116i87vt].
- **Swiss cohort**: Mean 12.4% loss at 10 months in reimbursed patients [^111epYsd].
- **UK cohort**: Mean 6.5% loss at 6 months; persistence and adherence were lower than in trials [^111AiEsH].

---

## Factors influencing weight loss efficacy

Several factors influence **weight loss with Saxenda**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on weight loss** |
|-|-|
| Dose | Higher doses (up to 3.0 mg) yield greater loss [^113TPkLH] [^115TcoX5] |
| Adherence | Better adherence improves outcomes [^notfound] |
| Baseline BMI | Higher BMI associated with greater absolute loss [^111kcnow] |
| Diabetes status | Less loss in type 2 diabetes vs. non-diabetic [^111cUxhJ] |
| Early response | ≥ 4% loss at 16 weeks predicts ≥ 5% loss at 56 weeks [^115fzVcV] |

---

## Comparison with other weight loss medications

Saxenda is **less effective than newer GLP-1 agents**: semaglutide 2.4 mg produces ~14.9% mean loss [^111rZYPQ] and tirzepatide 15 mg ~20.9% [^111rZYPQ], versus ~8.0% with liraglutide 3.0 mg. Compared with orlistat (~3.0%) and naltrexone/bupropion (~5.0%), Saxenda demonstrates superior efficacy [^112UYAaX].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Common adverse effects are **gastrointestinal** — nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation [^116xktYv] are usually transient and improve with dose titration [^112BxYAN]. Serious adverse effects are uncommon but include pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, and rare thyroid C-cell tumors; Saxenda is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2 [^1152ohcZ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend Saxenda as an adjunct to lifestyle therapy for adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² with obesity-related comorbidities [^114XmqL3]. They also advise evaluating weight loss at 16 weeks and discontinuing if **< 4% loss** is observed, as continued benefit is unlikely [^117EiDcD].

---

Saxenda produces **clinically meaningful weight loss** of about 8% at 56 weeks in non-diabetic adults and about 6% in those with type 2 diabetes, with higher response rates than placebo and sustained benefit with ongoing therapy.

### Liraglutide: an injectable option for the management of obesity [^113rBiq6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of liraglutide, marketed as Saxenda, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog for obesity management.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1970 to March 2015) was conducted for English-language articles using the terms glucagon-like peptide 1, liraglutide, and obesity.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Published articles pertinent to the efficacy and safety of liraglutide for short- and long-term obesity management among overweight or obese patients and special populations were reviewed and summarized.

Data Synthesis

Based on randomized placebo-controlled and active-comparator studies, liraglutide can increase weight loss among overweight and obese patients in a dose-dependent manner with once-daily doses of 1.2 to 3.0 mg. It has been shown that a higher proportion of patients experienced 5% and 10% weight loss from baseline compared with placebo and orlistat. Data support the potential benefit of liraglutide among overweight and obese patients with prediabetes, as well as women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with an inadequate response to metformin. Larger and more robust studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of liraglutide among other agents for obesity in diverse populations.

Conclusions

Liraglutide is an adjunct to lifestyle modifications to improve success rates among overweight or obese individuals without diabetes. It may have a potential role in special populations, such as in those with prediabetes and women with PCOS. Based on its clinical evidence, liraglutide can result in more weight loss from baseline compared with orlistat and placebo. Adverse events associated with liraglutide are primarily gastrointestinal and usually dose dependent.

Introduction

Managing obesity with pharmacotherapy plus lifestyle intervention can help increase the proportion of people reaching ≥ 5% weight loss, the regulatory benchmark for clinically meaningful weight loss 1, 2, but use of pharmacotherapy must be balanced against potential adverse effects of treatment and costs. One strategy to increase benefit versus risk in obesity pharmacotherapy is through identification of long‐term weight loss predictors. By stopping drug therapy early in patients unlikely to achieve clinical benefit, clinicians can minimize drug exposure, improve the benefit:risk ratio for the patient 3, and use health resources more effectively. Early weight loss, whether through lifestyle 4, 5, 6, 7 or pharmacotherapy 8, 9, 10, 11, is a good predictor of long‐term weight loss. Indeed, all recently approved weight loss medication labels include "stopping rules" stating when pharmacotherapy should be discontinued if clinically relevant weight loss is not, or is unlikely to be, achieved. However, current labels provide little information on outcomes in those individuals eligible for continued treatment beyond the early milestone; reported results are for all randomized individuals.

Liraglutide is a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 analog with 97% homology to human glucagon‐like peptide‐1, a physiological regulator of appetite 12, 13. Liraglutide at doses up to 1.8 mg once daily (Victoza ®, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) has been licensed for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) since 2009. More recently, liraglutide 3.0 mg (Saxenda ®; Novo Nordisk), as an adjunct to a reduced‐calorie diet and increased physical activity, has been approved for weight management in the United States, EU, and elsewhere.

This article describes how the early treatment criterion that best predicts ≥ 5% weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg at week 56 was identified, based on data from the two largest trials in the SCALE program of phase 3a trials of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management. Post hoc analyses are presented of the efficacy and safety results from these trials by early responder status, using this early response criterion.

Table 4 presents the results for the changes in weight observed in Studies 1, 2, and 3. After 56 weeks, treatment with SAXENDA resulted in a statistically significant reduction in weight compared with placebo. Statistically significantly greater proportions of patients treated with SAXENDA achieved 5% and 10% weight loss than those treated with placebo. In Study 3, statistically significantly more patients randomized to SAXENDA than placebo had not gained more than 0.5% of body weight from randomization to week 56.

Table 4. Changes in Weight at Week 56 for Studies 1, 2, and 3

SD = Standard Deviation; CI = Confidence Interval

✱ p < 0.0001 compared to placebo. Type 1 error was controlled across the three endpoints.

Includes all randomized subjects who had a baseline body weight measurement. All available body weight data during the 56 week treatment period are included in the analysis. In Studies 1 and 2 missing values for week 56 were handled using multiple imputations analysis. In Study 3 missing values for week 56 were handled using weighted regression analysis.

The cumulative frequency distributions of change in body weight from baseline to week 56 are shown in Figure 2 for Studies 1 and 2. One way to interpret this figure is to select a change in body weight of interest on the horizontal axis and note the corresponding proportions of patients (vertical axis) in each treatment group who achieved at least that degree of weight loss. For example, note that the vertical line arising from ‑10% in Study 1 intersects the SAXENDA and placebo curves at approximately 34% and 15%, respectively, which correspond to the values shown in Table 4.

Liraglutide (Saxenda)

The Satiety and Clinical Adiposity Liraglutide Evidence (SCALE) program included four RCTs on liraglutide 3 mg once daily (QD), compared to placebo, each extending over 56 weeks, except for the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes Extension trials that spanned over 160 weeks. The study population included patients with overweight/obesity, and the range of mean age of all participants was 45.0–49.0 years, and majority women (76–84% of participants). The range of mean baseline BMI was 37.5–39.3 kg/m². In the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes trial, participants with overweight/obesity without type 2 diabetes (n = 3731) were randomized to liraglutide, 3.0 mg/d (n = 2487) or placebo (n = 1244), in addition to lifestyle modifications. These lifestyle modifications included advising patients to increase their physical activity to at least 150 min per week and reduce their daily energy intake by 500 kcal below their individualized energy requirements. At 56 weeks, the weight reduction was 8 (6.7) % in the Liraglutide arm and 2.6 (5.7) % in the placebo arm (Fig. 2). At 160 weeks, weight reductions, compared to baseline, were 6.1 (7.3) % and 1.9 (6.3) % (Fig. 2) for patients on liraglutide 3 mg (n = 1472) and placebo (n = 738), respectively, implying a small weight regain after the first year of treatment. The SCALE maintenance trial included a run-in period aiming at achieving a least 5% total body weight loss, with a 500 kcal per day deficit diet, based on estimated 24-h energy expenditure. Participants were then randomized to liraglutide 3 mg (n = 207) or placebo (n = 206) and had thereafter additional percent weight reduction of 6.2 (7.3) % on and 0.2 (7.0) %, respectively. The SCALE-Intensive Behavioral Therapy (SCALE-IBT) compared liraglutide 3 mg (n = 142) to placebo (n = 140), on top of a co-intervention in both arms, consisting of intensive behavioral therapy (IBT), an exercise plan, and a caloric prescription depending on the participant baseline weight. Weight reduction was of 7.5% and 4.0% in liraglutide and placebo, respectively, at 56 weeks of treatment (SD not available). In patients with DM, with a baseline characteristics profile similar to other SCALE trials (with the exception of the presence of DM), at 56 weeks, a significant total body weight loss was achieved (percent total body weight loss of 6% in liraglutide 3 mg, 4.7% in liraglutide 1.8 mg, 2.0% in the placebo, p < 0.001 between both arms and placebo, SD not available). The dropout rate in the SCALE studies was 8–10% in the Liraglutide group and 11–20% in the placebo groups, with an exceptionally high dropout rate of 65% in the extension study. The adverse events observed in more than 10% of the population in the main trials for approval of this drug include a somewhat increased heart rate; GI symptoms such as constipation, diarrhea, nausea, dyspepsia, decreased appetite, and vomiting; infections such as nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection and influenza; hypoglycemia; symptoms of the nervous system such as dizziness and headaches (Table 1).

### Liraglutide 3.0 mg (saxenda ©) for weight loss and remission of pre-diabetes. real-world clinical evaluation of effectiveness among patients awaiting bariatric surgery [^1116XBhG]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The effectiveness of liraglutide 3.0 mg (Saxenda) therapy to induce weight loss among obese patients prior to bariatric surgery remains uncertain.

Methods

Clinical data was retrospectively obtained from patients with prediabetes (HbA1c 42–47 mmol/mol) and selected patients on the waiting list for bariatric surgery at the Royal Derby Hospital. Clinical data was collected retrospectively at 6, 12, 26 and 52 week intervals. The outcomes included mean weight change, proportion of patients achieving ≥ 5% and ≥ 10% weight loss and achieving HbA1c reduction to normal range values.

Results

Fifty patients (mean age of 46.2 ± 10.5 years; 76% female and 94% had Class III obesity) who completed 52 and/or 26 weeks of treatment were included. Liraglutide 3.0 mg produced a consistent and statistically significant reduction in weight (kg), BMI (kg/m²) and HbA1c (mmol/mol) across all four time intervals. Average ± SD reduction for weight, BMI and HbA1c respectively at 26 weeks were: -10.9 ± 9.1 (P < 0.01), -3.67 ± 3.5 (P < 0.01), -4.7 IQR 4.95 (P < 0.001), and at 52 weeks were: -14 ± 9.2 kg (P < 0.001), -4.64 ± 4.0 (P < 0.001 and -5.5 IQR 4 (P = 0.009). 85.7% and 33.3% of patients achieved ≥ 5% and 10% weight loss target respectively at 52 weeks. 92.3% and 72.2% achieved remission of pre-diabetes by 6 and 12 months respectively. Liraglutide 3.0 mg was well-tolerated with only 10% discontinuing medication due to tolerability issues.

Conclusion

Liraglutide 3.0 mg, with lifestyle management, reduced weight and improved glycaemic control. These results support liraglutide's application in certain high-risk populations, including patients waiting for bariatric surgical intervention.

Liraglutide

Liraglutide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonist to be injected subcutaneously once daily. Marketing authorization was granted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2009 in doses up to 1.8 mg for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus under the tradename Victoza®. In 2015, marketing authorization was granted for treatment of obesity in doses up to 3 mg per day, the corresponding tradename is Saxenda®. The SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes trial evaluated Liraglutide in obese and overweight nondiabetic patients. The study included 3731 subjects who were treated with Liraglutide 3 mg daily or placebo. Patients were also counseled on diet and exercise. At the end of the 56-week trial, the Liraglutide group lost an average of 8% (7.2 kg) of their initial body weight compared with 2.6% (2.8 kg) in the placebo group. The placebo-corrected weight loss was 4.4 kg. The proportion of patients achieving a weight reduction of 5–10% of baseline weight is 2–3 times greater with Liraglutide than with placebo. For weight loss, there is a clear dose relationship for doses up to 3 mg daily. The recommended dosing scheme is to start with 0.6 mg daily, and then increase the dose by 0.6 mg weekly up to the target or maximum dose, to reduce the frequent gastrointestinal side effects. Cardiovascular safety is of utmost importance for new anti-obesity drugs, especially after the withdrawal of Sibutramine due to the increased risk of cardiovascular adverse effects. Treatment with Liraglutide lowers waist circumference, lipids, HbA1c, blood pressure, blood sugar, and insulin to an extent proportional to the achieved weight loss. Moreover, the LEADER study demonstrated, for the first time for treatment with a GLP1 receptor agonist, a reduction in cardiovascular and total mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although weight reduction was not a primary endpoint in the LEADER trial, treatment with Liraglutide resulted in a weight loss of 2.3 kg over placebo. Still, long-term efficacy and safety of GLP1 receptor agonists remain somewhat controversial. Even if cardiovascular protection seems to be a class effect, the suspected risk of worsening of diabetic retinopathy is still in need of clarification. The risk of pancreatitis and cholecystitis is now largely considered refuted, but long-term data are lacking for Liraglutide and other GLP1 receptor agonists for the treatment of obesity. Animal studies with Liraglutide raised the suspicion of an association with medullary thyroid cancer. Even though there has been no sign of this association in humans, a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is considered a contraindication for treatment with this drug. Liraglutide is a useful therapeutic option to achieve weight loss in individual subjects, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, therapy costs may be too high for many patients, which might limit the broader use of these drugs depending on the reimbursement situation in a specific country.

Tabulated results for weight, BMI and HbA1c

By 3 months, 71.8% had their HbA1c return to normal (< 42 mmol/mol) with an average HbA1c value of 40.65 mmol/mol. Similarly, 92.3% achieved this remission by 6 months with an average HbA1c of 38.46 and 72.2% achieved this remission at 12 months with an average HbA1c of 37.7%.

Saxenda© was well-tolerated with the maximal tolerated dose being 2.84 ± 0.43 mg and only 10% discontinuing medication due to tolerability issues. Reported side effects included nausea (22.0%), abdominal pain (4.0%), constipation (6.0%), sulphurous eructation (14%), headache (10%), reduced appetite (12%), diarrhoea (10.0%), vomiting (8.0%), dry mouth (4.0%). Overall 15 of the 50 patients discontinued treatment with Saxenda©: 80% of these discontinuations were due to external reasons e.g. being listed for bariatric surgery, 6.7% due to compliance issues and 26.7% due to symptoms/tolerability (Fig. 1).

### Exposure-response analyses of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management [^113TPkLH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The actions of the glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) hormone include both reduction of energy intake (via receptors in the central nervous system), and the regulation of glucose metabolism 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Liraglutide is an acylated analogue of GLP‐1 with an amino acid sequence 97% homologous to human GLP‐1 9. Like native GLP‐1, liraglutide lowers body weight through decreased caloric intake, while stimulating insulin secretion and reducing glucagon via a glucose‐dependent mechanism 10. As a result of its dual effects on appetite/weight and glucose regulation, liraglutide was developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (doses up to 1.8 mg, Victoza®; Novo Nordisk, Søborg, Denmark) and weight management (doses of 3.0 mg, Saxenda®, Novo Nordisk). Liraglutide 3.0 mg is currently approved for weight management in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Mexico and the United States.

In the liraglutide 3.0 mg clinical development programme weight loss and glycaemic improvement with liraglutide were dose‐dependent, with higher doses required for maximum weight reduction 11, 12. Women on average had a greater weight loss response with liraglutide 3.0 mg than did men; however, weight loss in men is clinically meaningful and meets US Government Food and Drug Administration (FDA) efficacy benchmarks for weight‐management products 13, 14. Data do not suggest a liraglutide dose–response with safety outcomes, with the exception of gastrointestinal (GI) side‐effects 11, 12, 13.

Intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting clearance, and thus steady‐state plasma concentration (e.g. weight, gender), result in a range of drug exposures in individuals given the same dose; therefore, exposure–response analyses extend results of dose–response analyses (typically restricted to a few discrete dose levels) by allowing exploration of drug effects across a broad range of exposure levels. Analyses of exposure–response relationships are particularly useful when studying subpopulations with high or low exposure, allowing assessment of responses at the extremes of exposure. Previous population pharmacokinetic analysis of liraglutide 3.0 mg found that high body weight and male gender were associated with reduced drug exposure, whereas other covariates had limited effect (R. V. Overgaard, personal communication).

### Liraglutide (Saxenda) [^11627rgV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The proportions of patients who discontinued study drug in the 56-week trials were 27% for the SAXENDA-treated group and 35% for the placebo-treated group, and in the 160-week trial the proportions of patients who discontinued were 47% and 55%, respectively. In the 56-week trials, approximately 10% of patients treated with SAXENDA and 4% of patients treated with placebo discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The majority of patients who discontinued SAXENDA due to adverse reactions did so during the first few months of treatment. In the 160-week trial the proportions of patients who discontinued due to an adverse reaction was 13% and 6% for SAXENDA- and placebo-treated patients, respectively.

Effect of SAXENDA on Body Weight in 56-week Trials

For Study 1 and Study 2, the primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in body weight and the percentages of patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% and 10% weight loss from baseline to week 56. For Study 3, the primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in body weight from randomization to week 56, the percentage of patients not gaining more than 0.5% body weight from randomization (i.e., after run-in) to week 56, and the percentage of patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% weight loss from randomization to week 56. Because losing at least 5% of fasting body weight through lifestyle intervention during the 4- to 12-week run-in was a condition for their continued participation in the randomized treatment period, the results may not reflect those expected in the general population.

14.1 Weight Management Trials in Adults with Overweight or Obesity

The safety and efficacy of SAXENDA for chronic weight management in conjunction with reduced caloric intake and increased physical activity were studied in three 56-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In all studies, SAXENDA was titrated to 3 mg daily during a 4-week period. All patients received instruction for a reduced-calorie diet (approximately 500 kcal/day deficit) and physical activity counseling (recommended increase in physical activity of minimum 150 mins/week) that began with the first dose of study medication or placebo and continued throughout the trial.

Study 1 enrolled 3731 patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2) or with overweight (BMI 27–29.9 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition such as treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either SAXENDA or placebo. Patients were stratified based on the presence or absence of abnormal blood glucose measurements at randomization. All patients were treated for up to 56 weeks. Those patients with abnormal glucose measurements at randomization (2254 of the 3731 patients) were treated for a total of 160 weeks. At baseline, mean age was 45 years (range 18 to 78), 79% were female, 85% were White, 10% were Black or African American, and 11% were Hispanic/Latino Ethnicity. Mean baseline body weight was 106.3 kg and mean BMI was 38.3 kg/m2.

### Impact of dose-escalation schemes and drug discontinuation on weight loss outcomes with liraglutide 3.0 mg: a model-based approach [^113LdcBt]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The global obesity epidemic continues to grow, with an estimated 38% of the world's adult population predicted to be overweight and 20% obese by 2030. 1, 2, 3 Even though first‐line interventions, such as diet and increased physical activity, can lead to weight loss, studies show that people tend to regain the lost weight in the long term, potentially owing to well‐regulated body weight homeostatic mechanisms and decreased effort regarding weight maintenance over time. 4, 5, 6 Thus, effective and well‐tolerated interventions are needed to aid with weight reduction and help sustain the lost weight in the long term. Novel incretin hormone‐based pharmacotherapeutic approaches have been proposed as a viable strategy for weight management in overweight or obese patients. Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) is a member of the incretin hormone family that stimulates insulin secretion and dose‐dependently inhibits glucagon secretion. It has been shown to lead to weight loss via a reduction in energy intake by increasing satiety and reducing hunger. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

### Early weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg predicts 1-year weight loss and is associated with improvements in clinical markers [^117AjMRc]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

It is well documented that early response to a weight loss intervention can predict long‐term weight loss 8, 9, 10, 11; this is the basis for the stopping rules for all recently approved weight loss medications 19, 20, 21. Weight loss response after 1 to 4 months has been used to predict weight loss at 1 year. Interestingly, in the Look AHEAD study, 1‐ and 2‐month weight loss was associated with weight loss through year 8 among individuals with T2D who received an intensive lifestyle intervention 7.

In order to identify an optimal early response criterion for liraglutide 3.0 mg, we examined weight loss of ≥ 3%, 4%, or 5% at 8, 12, or 16 weeks in a pooled analysis predefined with the US FDA before trial data became available. Weight loss of ≥ 4% at week 16 was shown to be the best predictor of ≥ 5% weight loss at 56 weeks and to be appropriate for individuals with and without T2D and for both genders (Table 1, Supporting Information Table S1). Earlier time points would result in discontinuation of treatment in a significant number of individuals who would indeed achieve ≥ 5% weight loss after 56 weeks, while later time points would likely have achieved even greater predictive accuracy but were not considered as they would have entailed additional unnecessary exposure in nonresponders. Accordingly, the stopping rule in the United States specifies a weight loss of ≥ 4% at 16 weeks 22. While health authorities across the world focus on limiting treatment to those who will benefit, their approaches differ slightly. The European Medicines Agency required an early response criterion optimized to exclude individuals who were unlikely to achieve ≥ 10% weight loss at 56 weeks; this was best fulfilled by weight loss of ≥ 5% after 16 weeks (data not shown). Accordingly, the European label requires ≥ 5% weight loss after 12 weeks on the full 3.0 mg dose to qualify for continued treatment 23.

### Early weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg predicts 1-year weight loss and is associated with improvements in clinical markers [^112jphpL]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Weight loss of ≥ 4% after 16 weeks of treatment is a strong predictor of a clinically meaningful weight loss at 56 weeks. More individuals without or with T2D were early responders to liraglutide 3.0 mg in combination with lifestyle intervention compared with lifestyle intervention alone.

Among early responders to liraglutide 3.0 mg, greater mean weight loss, greater proportions achieving weight loss thresholds, and generally greater improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors and HRQoL scores were observed compared with early nonresponders.

### Efficacy of liraglutide for weight loss among patients with type 2 diabetes: the SCALE diabetes randomized clinical trial [^116xb97X]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Weight loss of 5% to 10% can improve type 2 diabetes and related comorbidities. Few safe, effective weight-management drugs are currently available.

Objective

To investigate efficacy and safety of liraglutide vs placebo for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Fifty-six-week randomized (2:1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial with 12-week observational off-drug follow-up period. The study was conducted at 126 sites in 9 countries between June 2011 and January 2013. Of 1361 participants assessed for eligibility, 846 were randomized. Inclusion criteria were body mass index of 27.0 or greater, age 18 years or older, taking 0 to 3 oral hypoglycemic agents (metformin, thiazolidinedione, sulfonylurea) with stable body weight, and glycated hemoglobin level 7.0% to 10.0%.

Interventions

Once-daily, subcutaneous liraglutide (3.0 mg) (n = 423), liraglutide (1.8 mg) (n = 211), or placebo (n = 212), all as adjunct to 500 kcal/d dietary deficit and increased physical activity (≥ 150 min/wk).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Three coprimary end points: relative change in weight, proportion of participants losing 5% or more, or more than 10%, of baseline weight at week 56.

Results

Baseline weight was 105.7 kg with liraglutide (3.0-mg dose), 105.8 kg with liraglutide (1.8-mg dose), and 106.5 kg with placebo. Weight loss was 6.0% (6.4 kg) with liraglutide (3.0-mg dose), 4.7% (5.0 kg) with liraglutide (1.8-mg dose), and 2.0% (2.2 kg) with placebo (estimated difference for liraglutide [3.0 mg] vs placebo, -4.00% [95% CI, -5.10% to -2.90%]; liraglutide [1.8 mg] vs placebo, -2.71% [95% CI, -4.00% to -1.42%]; P < .001 for both). Weight loss of 5% or greater occurred in 54.3% with liraglutide (3.0 mg) and 40.4% with liraglutide (1.8 mg) vs 21.4% with placebo (estimated difference for liraglutide [3.0 mg] vs placebo, 32.9% [95% CI, 24.6% to 41.2%]; for liraglutide [1.8 mg] vs placebo, 19.0% [95% CI, 9.1% to 28.8%]; P < .001 for both). Weight loss greater than 10% occurred in 25.2% with liraglutide (3.0 mg) and 15.9% with liraglutide (1.8 mg) vs 6.7% with placebo (estimated difference for liraglutide [3.0 mg] vs placebo, 18.5% [95% CI, 12.7% to 24.4%], P < .001; for liraglutide [1.8 mg] vs placebo, 9.3% [95% CI, 2.7% to 15.8%], P = 0.006). More gastrointestinal disorders were reported with liraglutide (3.0 mg) vs liraglutide (1.8 mg) and placebo. No pancreatitis was reported.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among overweight and obese participants with type 2 diabetes, use of subcutaneous liraglutide (3.0 mg) daily, compared with placebo, resulted in weight loss over 56 weeks. Further studies are needed to evaluate longer-term efficacy and safety.

### Real-world use of liraglutide for weight management according to label in the United kingdom: a cohort study using the clinical practice research datalink primary care databases [^1167tf5n]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Liraglutide was approved under the brand name Saxenda® in the United States in 2014 and in the EU in 2015 at daily doses of 3.0 mg as an adjunct to a reduced‐calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adults with an initial BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m 2 (obesity) or 30 > BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 (overweight) in the presence of at least one obesity‐related complication. Clinically relevant body weight reduction of Saxenda® versus placebo was demonstrated in five clinical studies involving approximately 5800 patients with obesity or overweight, Liraglutide consistently demonstrated a 4–6 kg mean weight loss compared to placebo. Liraglutide label extensions for Saxenda® were further approved in 2020 at daily doses up to 3.0 mg for adolescents aged ≥ 12 years with obesity. Saxenda® is currently approved in more than 70 countries worldwide.

Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) with UK primary care data has previously been used to evaluate the effectiveness of liraglutide in routine practice with regards to glycaemic control and weight loss in T2D. The superior glycaemic control and weight reduction with liraglutide, for the indication of T2D, was reflected in routine clinical practice, similar to the clinical trials for Victoza®.

Given the availability of two liraglutide products with the same strength and formulation for different indications and doses, there is a potential for inadvertent off‐label use in routine clinical practice, deviating from the approved indications or recommendations in the EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and US Prescribing Information. As part of the authorization for Saxenda, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) required a drug utilization study (DUS) to investigate the real‐world in‐market utilization of liraglutide for weight management. The EMA recommended completing the study in several European countries. Another DUS was conducted based on chart review data from 75 patients prescribed Saxenda® in Italy and 150 patients prescribed Victoza® in Italy and Germany (75 patients each). The captured real‐world data supported the prescriber adherence to the approved indication and posology for Saxenda® in Italy and Victoza® in Italy and Germany. Moreover, the real‐world data presented in the Italian and German study did not indicate any new safety concerns in the real‐world usage of Saxenda® and Victoza®.

Liraglutide — randomized controlled trial context, dosing, and run-in requirements: Direct comparative evidence from RCTs addressed long-term treatment "at a study duration of at least 52 weeks". In 3 studies, both groups received individualized intensive lifestyle intervention; most emphasized "at least 500-kcal" deficit and " ≥ 150 min/wk of physical activity". Liraglutide or placebo was given as a daily SC injection "starting at a dose of 0.6 mg, with weekly dose escalation until the target dose of 3.0 mg daily was reached". In 3 weight maintenance studies, participants followed a calorie-restricted run-in; in 2 studies subjects had to lose "at least 5%" and follow "LCD (800–1000 kcal/d for 8 weeks)", whereas another required " ≥ 5%" during a variable-length "(4–12 weeks)" run-in with "LCD (1200–1400 kcal/d)". In SCALE (Satiety and Clinical Adiposity – Liraglutide Evidence)-Maintenance, participants lost " ≥ 6.5 kg" during the run-in, and in the other studies they lost an average of "12.5–13.1 kg". Overall, "A total of 3964 subjects were randomized to liraglutide 3.0 mg and 2498 subjects were randomized to control groups".

### Predictors of weight reduction effectiveness with liraglutide in diabetes mellitus type 2 patients: a retrospective cohort study [^116fUAYp]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding predictive factors for significant weight loss with GLP-1 RAs, a phase 2 study using liraglutide 3.0 mg in patients with obesity showed that early responders to weight reduction were more likely to achieve intermediate-term results (more than 5% weight loss at one year of liraglutide use). Another study revealed no significant association between sex, age, diabetes duration, or initial body mass index (BMI) and the rate of body weight loss after the use of GLP-1 RAs.

A clearer understanding of the factors that predict significant weight reduction in GLP-1 RAs users can improve clinical application, maximizing benefits, minimizing side effects, and providing an efficient treatment approach for patients with T2DM. This study aimed to identify clinical and biochemical factors associated with significant weight loss (> 5% in 6 months) in T2DM patients using liraglutide 3.0 mg once daily, helping physicians more effectively select patients who are most likely to benefit from this treatment.

Liraglutide (Saxenda) — adult overweight and obesity management includes the following dosing, monitoring, and safety details: Initiate dose titration with 0.6 mg daily, subcutaneously for 1 week; increase daily dose by 0.6 mg per week until reaching a target dose of 3 mg, with slow titration to every other week if the patient cannot tolerate weekly titration. Per the product information, discontinue if 4% weight loss is not achieved by week 16. For patients on secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin, consider reducing the dose of the secretagogue (e.g., by 50%) or insulin to avoid hypoglycemia. Dose in renal impairment should be used with caution. Monitor weight; blood pressure (orthostatic) and/or signs/symptoms of hypotension; resting heart rate; glucose and/or signs/symptoms of hypoglycemia (use additional caution if the patient is using another glucose-lowering agent); and mood (symptoms of depression) and sleep disorders. Common side effects include increased heart rate, headache, hypoglycemia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and fatigue. Contraindications include pregnancy and personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (U.S. Boxed Warning) or MEN2. Warnings include injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions (caution if previous reactions to GLP-1 agonist), thyroid C-cell tumors [Boxed Warning], gallbladder disease, pancreatitis (discontinue), increased heart rate, renal impairment, acute cholelithiasis and cholecystitis, tachycardia, acute/chronic renal failure exacerbation, suicidal behavior and ideation, and to adjust hypoglycemia drugs to avoid hypoglycemia.

### Weight change with liraglutide and comparator therapies: an analysis of seven phase 3 trials from the liraglutide diabetes development programme [^111kcnow]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

We investigated the relationship between weight change and related factors in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with liraglutide versus comparator diabetes therapies.

Methods

Twenty-six-week data from seven phase 3, randomized trials in the liraglutide T2DM development programme were analysed by trial and treatment group: liraglutide (1.2 and 1.8 mg), active comparator and placebo. Outcome measures included proportions of subjects in various weight change categories and their percentage weight change from baseline; impact of body mass index (BMI) and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) on weight change and correlation of weight change with change in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c).

Results

A number of subjects experienced > 5% weight loss during the trials (24.4% liraglutide 1.8 mg and 17.7% liraglutide 1.2 mg; 17.7% exenatide, 10.0% sitagliptin, 3.6–7.0% sulphonylurea, 2.6% thiazolidinedione and 2.6% glargine; 9.9% placebo). More weight loss was seen with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg than with active comparators except exenatide. Across trials, higher initial BMI was associated with slightly greater weight loss with liraglutide. Mean weight loss increased slightly the longer GI AEs persisted. Although HbA1c reduction was slightly larger in higher weight loss categories across treatments (including placebo), sample sizes were small and no clear correlation could be determined. Liraglutide-treated subjects experienced additional HbA1c reduction beyond that which appeared weight induced; thus, not all HbA1c-lowering effect appears weight mediated.

Conclusions

The majority of liraglutide-treated T2DM subjects experienced weight loss in this analysis. Weight loss was greater and occurred more in glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist-treated subjects than in active comparator-treated subjects.

Methods

Trial design

The design, methods, patient populations, and results of the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes (NCT01272219) and SCALE Diabetes (NCT01272232) trials were previously published 14, 15. Briefly, in SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes, 3,731 individuals with overweight or obesity and without diabetes (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with ≥ 1 obesity‐related comorbidity) were randomized 2:1 to liraglutide 3.0 mg or placebo for 56 weeks 14. In SCALE Diabetes, 846 individuals with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 and T2D were randomized 2:1:1 to liraglutide 3.0 mg, liraglutide 1.8 mg, or placebo for 56 weeks 15. Both trials were double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multicenter trials, and trial drug was given as adjunct to lifestyle intervention (500 kcal/day deficit diet and physical activity ≥ 150 min/week). Here, only results for liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo are reported, referred to as "liraglutide 3.0 mg" or "placebo" hereafter. Liraglutide was initiated at a dose of 0.6 mg and dose‐escalated by 0.6 mg increments weekly to the 3.0 mg treatment dose. This was a forced dose escalation, with the dose at 3.0 mg for all individuals by week 4; investigators could delay dose escalation by 7 days in total.

2.2 Dosage in Adults and Pediatric Patients Aged 12 Years and Older

Initiate SAXENDA with a dose of 0.6 mg daily for one week. Then follow the dosage escalation schedule in Table 1 to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Table 1. Dose Escalation Schedule

Adult Patients
For adults, the recommended dosage of SAXENDA is 3 mg daily, lower dosages are for titration only.
Discontinue SAXENDA if the patient cannot tolerate the 3 mg dosage.
If patients do not tolerate an increased dose during dosage escalation, consider delaying dosage escalation for approximately one additional week.
Evaluate the change in body weight 16 weeks after initiating SAXENDA and discontinue SAXENDA if the patient has not lost at least 4% of baseline body weight, since it is unlikely that the patient will achieve and sustain clinically meaningful weight loss with continued treatment.
In adult patients with type 2 diabetes, monitor blood glucose prior to starting SAXENDA and during SAXENDA treatment.

Pediatric Patients

For pediatric patients, the recommended maintenance dosage of SAXENDA is 3 mg daily. Pediatric patients who do not tolerate 3 mg daily may have their maintenance dose reduced to 2.4 mg daily. Discontinue SAXENDA if the patient cannot tolerate the 2.4 mg dose.
If pediatric patients do not tolerate an increased dose during dosage escalation, the dose may also be lowered to the previous level. Dosage escalation for pediatric patients may take up to 8 weeks.
Evaluate the change in BMI after 12 weeks on the maintenance dose and discontinue SAXENDA if the patient has not had a reduction in BMI of at least 1% from baseline, since it is unlikely that the patient will achieve and sustain clinically meaningful weight loss with continued treatment.

### Liraglutide 3.0 mg (saxenda ©) for weight loss and remission of pre-diabetes. real-world clinical evaluation of effectiveness among patients awaiting bariatric surgery [^114UWzTp]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We included both Tier 3 patients with a diagnosis of prediabetes (HbA1c 42–47 mmol/mol) and Tier 4 patients on the waiting list for bariatric surgery since 2019 at Royal Derby Hospital, a regional centre for bariatric surgery across the East Midlands. The planned surgeries for this patient cohort included both Roux-en-Y bypasses and Sleeve Gastrectomies. The waiting times for surgery reflect pressures to the bariatric services across the UK, inclusive of prior COVID-19 delay. Our criteria for referral for bariatric surgery is based on the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines which stipulate that adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m 2 or more, or between 35 kg/m 2 and 39.9 kg/m 2 with a significant health condition that could be improved if they lost weight, can be referred for bariatric surgery assessment.

All Saxenda © treatment was initiated and delivered as per current NICE guidelines, in brief recommended for patients with obesity, non-diabetic hyperglycaemic and a high risk of cardiovascular disease whilst licensed as an adjunct for weight loss alongside a hypocaloric diet and increased physical activity. Weight management services are delivered in tiers: Tier 1 is universal e.g. health promotion, Tier 2 are delivered by local community services and focus on lifestyle interventions, Tier 3 is a specialist service delivered by clinician-led multidisciplinary team typically providing an integrated non-surgical approach, Tier 4 covers those patients proceeding to bariatric surgery.

Eligible patients for Saxenda© were discussed at the Tier 3 multi-disciplinary team meeting (MDT) and were then counselled by a Tier 3 clinician to consent for commencement of Saxenda©. The programme to initiate Saxenda© was supported by the Oviva Patients Support group commissioned by Novo Nordisk who provided patient education regarding medication administration, troubleshooting advice and further details. Thereafter, patients received regular follow-up with the Tier 3 clinician assuming their ongoing compliance and ready engagement with the service.

Since 1950, 25 anti-obesity drugs have been withdrawn from use across the world, largely as a result of adverse effects. 1 For several years, orlistat has been the only drug licensed in the UK for weight management. 2 In January 2017, a new presentation of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue liraglutide (▾Saxenda - Novo Nordisk) was launched in the UK as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adults. Here, we review the evidence for its efficacy and safety and consider its place in managing people who are overweight or obese.

### Real-world use of liraglutide for weight management according to label in the United kingdom: a cohort study using the clinical practice research datalink primary care databases [^1144Ftor]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This retrospective, non‐interventional DUS based on the CPRD database illustrated that both Saxenda® and Victoza® were mostly prescribed by physicians according to their approved indications.

Out of the 306 Saxenda® patients eligible for analysis with valid BMI measurement, 96.4% were treated according to the approved obesity indications. Only 11 patients (3.5%) had a valid BMI measurement at index of < 27 kg/m 2 or 27 kg/m 2 ≤ BMI ≤ 30 kg/m 2 without at least one relevant comorbidity. The number of Saxenda® patients in the database was considered large enough to study the primary objective. Missing body weight data indicated, per stopping rule definition, prescriber non‐adherence to the stopping rule. Accordingly, further analysis of this subgroup with missing body weight data was not required to confirm prescriber non‐adherence to Saxenda discontinuation, as per the label's stopping rule.

The observed off‐label use for Saxenda® in this study is low compared to the overall off‐label use of drug prescriptions, for instance, in the United States. There are currently other marketed compounds within the diabesity area, which could also have potential for inadvertent use, such as semaglutide (Ozempic®; Wegovy®) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro®; Zepbound®), but neither of these had yet been marketed when this study was finalized.

The majority (91%) of Si's received treatment for 0–6 months with an average duration of 3 months. Among the 16 patients treated for 24 weeks with valid BMI measures, the vast majority met the 5% weight loss stopping rule between week 16 and 24, supporting Saxenda's® well‐known weight‐lowering effects. Reliable assessment of Saxenda® dose escalation and stopping rule was hindered by a high level of missing dosage and BMI data in the databases.

### Exposure-response analyses of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management [^112QUCy7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Body Weight Loss in Individuals at the Extremes of Liraglutide Exposure

The 10% lightest women [mean baseline body weight 77.1 kg (highest exposure subgroup)] achieved the greatest observed weight loss [8.1 kg (10.5%)], and the 10% heaviest men [mean baseline body weight 173.7 kg (lowest exposure subgroup)] achieved the least observed relative weight loss [11.4 kg (6.8%); Figure 2 B]; the absolute mean weight loss achieved with 3.0 mg in both the high and low exposure subgroups was clinically meaningful.

Liraglutide Exposure andResponse in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes

The reduction in HbA1c was considerably greater for all liraglutide exposure quantiles than for placebo (Figure 3 A), irrespective of baseline HbA1c level (Figure 3 B). The glucose‐lowering associated with liraglutide exposure plateaued above ∼500 nM × h (corresponding to a liraglutide plasma concentration of ∼21 nM; Figure 3 A); the 'plateau effect' was least obvious in individuals with high baseline HbA1c (Figure 3 B). This suggests individuals with poor glycaemic control might derive greater glycaemic benefit from the 3.0‐mg dose. A mediator analysis showed the incremental glucose‐lowering observed with exposure > 500 nM × h (i.e. further HbA1c reduction associated with increasing the dose from 1.8 to 3.0 mg) could be almost entirely attributed to corresponding incremental weight loss.

### A randomized, controlled trial of 3.0 mg of liraglutide in weight management [^117Xhhuc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a chronic disease with serious health consequences, but weight loss is difficult to maintain through lifestyle intervention alone. Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, has been shown to have potential benefit for weight management at a once-daily dose of 3.0 mg, injected subcutaneously.

Methods

We conducted a 56-week, double-blind trial involving 3731 patients who did not have type 2 diabetes and who had a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of at least 30 or a BMI of at least 27 if they had treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension. We randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-daily subcutaneous injections of liraglutide at a dose of 3.0 mg (2487 patients) or placebo (1244 patients); both groups received counseling on lifestyle modification. The coprimary end points were the change in body weight and the proportions of patients losing at least 5% and more than 10% of their initial body weight.

Results

At baseline, the mean (± SD) age of the patients was 45.1 ± 12.0 years, the mean weight was 106.2 ± 21.4 kg, and the mean BMI was 38.3 ± 6.4; a total of 78.5% of the patients were women and 61.2% had prediabetes. At week 56, patients in the liraglutide group had lost a mean of 8.4 ± 7.3 kg of body weight, and those in the placebo group had lost a mean of 2.8 ± 6.5 kg (a difference of -5.6 kg; 95% confidence interval, -6.0 to -5.1; P < 0.001, with last-observation-carried-forward imputation). A total of 63.2% of the patients in the liraglutide group as compared with 27.1% in the placebo group lost at least 5% of their body weight (P < 0.001), and 33.1% and 10.6%, respectively, lost more than 10% of their body weight (P < 0.001). The most frequently reported adverse events with liraglutide were mild or moderate nausea and diarrhea. Serious events occurred in 6.2% of the patients in the liraglutide group and in 5.0% of the patients in the placebo group.

Conclusions

In this study, 3.0 mg of liraglutide, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, was associated with reduced body weight and improved metabolic control. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes NN8022–1839 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01272219.).

### Liraglutide pharmacokinetics and exposure-response in adolescents with obesity [^1137555Y]. Pediatric Obesity (2021). Medium credibility.

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1), an incretin hormone secreted by intestinal L cells in response to food intake, stimulates insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon secretion in a glucose‐dependent manner. Liraglutide is a GLP‐1 receptor agonist that promotes weight loss through reduced appetite and a subsequent reduction in energy intake. As an adjunct to a reduced‐calorie diet and increased physical activity, liraglutide 3.0 mg (Saxenda) once daily is approved in the United States, European Union and elsewhere (65 countries) for chronic weight management in adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2), or overweight (≥ 27 to < 30 km/m 2) in the presence of at least one weight‐related comorbidity.

The efficacy and safety of liraglutide in adults were evaluated in the Satiety and Clinical Adiposity – Liraglutide Evidence (SCALE) program. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of liraglutide in adolescents aged 12‐17 yearsand in children aged 7‐11 yearshave previously been investigated in short‐term (< 10 weeks) randomized, controlled trials. In phase 3 randomized, controlled 56‐week trial investigating the effects of liraglutide for weight management in pubertal adolescents with obesity, liraglutide, in addition to lifestyle therapy, significantly reduced the BMI standard‐deviation score (SDS) compared with placebo (estimated treatment difference: −0.22; 95% confidence interval, −0.37, −0.08; P = 0.002).

### Differential efficacy of weight loss interventions in patients with versus without diabetes [^1154Vj1e]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Differential Efficacy of Weight Loss Interventions Among Patients with Diabetes

Ketogenic diets strongly reduce dietary carbohydrates, and hence are expected to be of benefit in patients with diabetes. While carefully executed trials in people without diabetes have found weight reductions of up to 12 kg over 6 months, a dedicated meta-analysis of a ketogenic diet in diabetes found a mean adjusted weight difference of − 5.63 kg compared to other diets. As mentioned previously, intermittent fasting diets induce on average a weight loss of merely 1.89 kg among patients with diabetes. By comparison, a meta-analysis encompassing 27 trials of intermittent fasting diets in overweight and obese individuals estimated a mean efficacy of − 4.97 kg, more than twice what has been found in patients with diabetes. Of note, intermittent fasting can be a trigger of acute complications in patients with T1DM, or with T2DM and a high insulin requirement.

GLP-1 agonists are perhaps the pharmacological group for which most evidence exists about their comparative efficacy in patients with or without diabetes. In fact, a dedicated RCT assessed the GLP-1 agonist liraglutide at anti-obesity doses, specifically in patients with diabetes (SCALE Diabetes and SCALE Obesity and prediabetes). Participants in the liraglutide 3.0 mg/day (obesity dose) arm achieved a mean − 6.4 kg body weight change after 56 weeks. By contrast, in the pivotal study of liraglutide 3.0 mg in obesity without diabetes, the weight loss at week 56 was 8.4 kg. In summary, the pooled weight-loss efficacy of liraglutide 3.0 mg/d in RCTs differs markedly in the presence of diabetes. Subcutaneous semaglutide at the anti-obesity dose of 2.4 mg/week has demonstrated reductions in body weight of 15.8% with continued use over 68 weeks in patients without diabetes. Meanwhile, in the STEP 2 trial of semaglutide at the same dose in patients with excess body weight and T2DM, the weight loss was 9.6%, or 9.6 kg (baseline body weight in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm was 99.9 kg), almost half of what was observed in the absence of T2DM.

Results

Liraglutide Exposure and Body Weight Loss

Baseline characteristics of individuals included in the exposure–weight loss analysis are summarized in Table S1, Supporting Information. The percentage of body‐weight change from baseline versus liraglutide exposure is shown in Figure 1 A.

There was a clear relationship between liraglutide exposure and weight loss in all three trials, and this relationship was similar in those trials that included individuals with normoglycaemia and prediabetes (Trials 1 and 3). The shape of the exposure–weight loss curve was similar for individuals with or without type 2 diabetes, although less weight loss was observed at any given exposure (including placebo) for individuals with type 2 diabetes (Figure 1 A). The proportion of individuals achieving ≥ 5% and > 10% weight loss at week 56 also showed a clear relationship with exposure (Figure 1 B, C).

Although there was considerable overlap between exposure with 1.8‐ and 3.0‐mg doses (see overlapping horizontal bars above x ‐axis; Figure 1), the exposure medians of both doses corresponded to the steep part of the exposure–response curve, and considerably greater weight loss was achieved with the exposure corresponding to 3.0 mg. The effect on mean body weight loss appeared to level off at the highest exposures associated with liraglutide 3.0 mg.

Liraglutide Exposure and Body Weight Loss withinSubgroups

Analysis of Trial 1 data stratified by baseline BMI revealed a slight decrease in liraglutide exposure with increasing BMI; however, the exposure differences across BMI subgroups were not associated with meaningful differences in body weight loss, and exposure–weight loss relationships were virtually identical for the four BMI subgroups (Figure S3, Supporting Information).

Liraglutide Exposure and Body Weight Loss in Men and Women

Exposure–weight loss relationships were observed for both men and women, and increasing exposure was associated with greater weight loss across the entire exposure range (Figure 2 A). Women had greater weight loss than did men at similar exposures; ∼50% of the difference in body weight loss between men and women could be attributed to higher exposure in women. Similar results were seen when Trials 1 and 2 were analysed separately; however, an upward, leftward shift of the exposure–weight loss curves were observed for men and women with type 2 diabetes versus those without type 2 diabetes (Figure S2A, B). This shift is consistent with lower mean weight loss in individuals with type 2 diabetes 18, 19, and with lower mean exposure in these individuals (R. V. Overgaard, personal communication).

### Early weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg predicts 1-year weight loss and is associated with improvements in clinical markers [^115fzVcV]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify an early response criterion for predicting ≥ 5% weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg at week 56 and to compare efficacy outcomes in early responders (ERs) and early nonresponders (ENRs).

Methods

Using pooled data from the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes and SCALE Diabetes trials, weight loss of ≥ 4% at 16 weeks best predicted ≥ 5% weight loss after 56 weeks. Weight loss and changes in cardiometabolic risk factors and health‐related quality of life were evaluated in ERs (≥ 4% weight loss at week 16) and ENRs (< 4% weight loss at week 16) completing 56 weeks' treatment.

Results

Proportions of ERs/ENRs to liraglutide 3.0 mg were 77.3%/22.7% (individuals without type 2 diabetes, T2D) and 62.7%/37.3% (those with T2D). Greater mean weight loss was observed in ERs versus ENRs: 10.8% versus 3.0% (without T2D) and 8.5% versus 3.1% (T2D). In both trials, greater proportions of ERs versus ENRs achieved ≥ 5%, > 10%, and > 15% weight loss at week 56 with liraglutide 3.0 mg. Greater improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors and health‐related quality of life scores were observed in ERs versus ENRs.

Conclusions

The early response criterion was clinically useful to identify individuals who would achieve clinically meaningful weight loss at 56 weeks.

### ASGE position statement on endoscopic bariatric therapies in clinical practice [^115mMMkh]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

ASGE position statement — lifestyle intervention and pharmacotherapy for obesity notes that the components of lifestyle intervention include diet, exercise, and behavior modification and should be considered the cornerstone of any obesity treatment, yet as a stand-alone therapy even intensive lifestyle intervention is only modestly effective, with 5% to 10% total body weight loss at 1 year. Weight regain occurs after 1 year, but some health benefits do persist. Medications currently approved for long-term treatment of obesity include orlistat (Xenical/Alli; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC), lorcaserin (Belviq; Eisai; Woodcliff Lake, NJ), phentermine/topiramate combination (Qsymia; VIVUS, Mountain View, Calif), naltrexone/bupropion combination (Contrave; Takeda Pharmaceutical, La Jolla, Calif), and liraglutide (Saxenda; Novo Nordisk, Plainsboro Township, NJ); weight loss medications in combination with moderate intensity lifestyle intervention yields 4.5% to 11% total body weight loss (TBWL). Side effects do occur, but weight loss medications are generally well tolerated, and with the exception of orlistat, the obesity drugs approved for long-term use have only recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and data on weight loss maintenance beyond 2 years and safety are not yet available.

### Weight maintenance and additional weight loss with liraglutide after low-calorie-diet-induced weight loss: the SCALE maintenance randomized study [^113xgzcL]. International Journal of Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Liraglutide, a once-daily human glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, induced clinically meaningful weight loss in a phase 2 study in obese individuals without diabetes. The present randomized phase 3 trial assessed the efficacy of liraglutide in maintaining weight loss achieved with a low-calorie diet (LCD).

Methods

Obese/overweight participants (≥ 18 years, body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities) who lost ≥ 5% of initial weight during a LCD run-in were randomly assigned to liraglutide 3.0 mg per day or placebo (subcutaneous administration) for 56 weeks. Diet and exercise counseling were provided throughout the trial. Co-primary end points were percentage weight change from randomization, the proportion of participants that maintained the initial ≥ 5% weight loss, and the proportion that lost ≥ 5% of randomization weight (intention-to-treat analysis). ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00781937.

Results

Participants (n = 422) lost a mean 6.0% (s.d. 0.9) of screening weight during run-in. From randomization to week 56, weight decreased an additional mean 6.2% (s.d. 7.3) with liraglutide and 0.2% (s.d. 7.0) with placebo (estimated difference -6.1% (95% class intervals -7.5 to -4.6), P < 0.0001). More participants receiving liraglutide (81.4%) maintained the ≥ 5% run-in weight loss, compared with those receiving placebo (48.9%) (estimated odds ratio 4.8 (3.0; 7.7), P < 0.0001), and 50.5% versus 21.8% of participants lost ≥ 5% of randomization weight (estimated odds ratio 3.9 (2.4; 6.1), P < 0.0001). Liraglutide produced small but statistically significant improvements in several cardiometabolic risk factors compared with placebo. Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders were reported more frequently with liraglutide than placebo, but most events were transient, and mild or moderate in severity.

Conclusion

Liraglutide, with diet and exercise, maintained weight loss achieved by caloric restriction and induced further weight loss over 56 weeks. Improvements in some cardiovascular disease-risk factors were also observed. Liraglutide, prescribed as 3.0 mg per day, holds promise for improving the maintenance of lost weight.

### Predictors of weight reduction effectiveness with liraglutide in diabetes mellitus type 2 patients: a retrospective cohort study [^114syH7B]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Lower baseline BMI and greater weight loss at 3 months can help predict short-term weight loss outcomes at 6 months with liraglutide therapy. Identifying simple and accessible predictors based on these parameters will improve patient selection for this treatment, leading to better weight control. Further studies are needed to confirm the causal relationships between these predictors and weight loss outcomes with liraglutide. Developing a predictive model or risk score using these predictors could personalize GLP-1 RAs treatment, enhancing precision medicine and improving patient outcomes.

### Twelve-month analysis of real-world evidence from a telehealth obesity-treatment provider using antiobesity medications [^112PborJ]. Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

For some patients, their treatment strategy varied over time. We examined the frequency of continuing with the original prescription or moving to a different treatment option (Table S2) and weight changes at 12 months by first and last AOM combination (Table 2). Of those in the 12‐month data cohort (n = 6089), 9 (0.001%) patients began with naltrexone/bupropion; however, 204 (3.4%) patients were treated with naltrexone/bupropion by the end of 12 months. Only 4 (0.001%) patients began and ended the 12‐month period with naltrexone/bupropion. Of the 731 (12.0%) patients who were initially prescribed metformin, only 32 (4.4%) remained on this AOM treatment at 12 months. Those who were initiated on metformin had mean weight loss ranging from 9.7% to 20.3%, with the highest weight loss for those who transitioned to a GLP‐1–based treatment. Mounjaro (tirzepatide) was the most prescribed initial and final medication, with 3118 (51.2%) patients treated on this medication at initiation and at 12 months; the average 12‐month weight loss was 21.2% for these patients. Wegovy and Ozempic (semaglutide) ranked as the second and third most frequently prescribed final medications, associated with body weight loss of 15.3% and 13.8%, respectively. There were 763 (12.5%) patients who were exclusively on Wegovy at the end of 12 months. Patients who switched from Mounjaro tended to be prescribed either Wegovy or Ozempic more often. For patients who were treated with Saxenda (liraglutide) at initiation and at 12 months, the average weight loss was 12.0%.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

SAXENDA was evaluated for safety in 5 double-blind, placebo controlled trials that included 3384 overweight or obese adult patients treated with SAXENDA for a treatment period up to 56 weeks (3 trials), 52 weeks (1 trial), and 32 weeks (1 trial) and one trial of 56 weeks in 125 pediatric patients with obesity aged 12 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)]. All patients received study drug in addition to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity counseling. In the adult trials, patients received SAXENDA for a mean treatment duration of 46 weeks (median, 56 weeks). Baseline characteristics included a mean age of 47 years, 71% female, 85% white, 39% with hypertension, 15% with type 2 diabetes, 34% with dyslipidemia, 29% with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2, and 9% with cardiovascular disease. In one of the 56-week trials, a subset of patients (with abnormal glucose measurements at randomization) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] were enrolled for a placebo-controlled 160-week period instead, followed by a 12-week off-treatment follow-up. For those participating in this 160-week period, patients received SAXENDA for a mean treatment duration of 110 weeks (median, 159 weeks). For all trials, dosing was initiated and increased weekly to reach the 3 mg dose.

### Early weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg predicts 1-year weight loss and is associated with improvements in clinical markers [^115g2fdw]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Early responder populations

Among individuals on liraglutide 3.0 mg with a week 16 measurement, 77.3% without T2D and 62.7% with T2D were ERs, and 22.7% and 37.3% were ENRs. The proportions of individuals who were ERs to placebo were much lower than with liraglutide 3.0 mg: 30.5% of individuals without T2D and 20.5% with T2D.

Demographic and other baseline characteristics of all randomized subjects, as well as ERs and ENRs in each trial, are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The "all‐randomized" group included individuals who discontinued the trial before week 16, while the ER/ENR groups did not (by definition they could not be classified as ER or ENR).

Table 2
Demographics and baseline characteristics of patients by early responder status (SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes trial)

Table 3
Demographics and baseline characteristics of patients by early responder status (SCALE Diabetes trial)

In general, baseline characteristics in the ER and ENR groups appeared similar across treatment groups within each trial. In both liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo groups, individuals of White origin appeared more prevalent in the ER versus ENR groups, and female sex appeared consistently associated with early response to liraglutide 3.0 mg (see percentages, Supporting Information Table S3) but not to placebo in individuals with and without T2D.

Review methods and selection criteria

Eligible trials were listed and the inclusion criteria were assessed independently by all authors. Excluded trials were listed with the reason for exclusion. Three authors (TV, MC, and LLG) extracted data independently. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Randomised controlled trials were eligible irrespective of their publication status. We included trials of adult patients with or without type 2 diabetes and who had a body mass index of 25 or more. The GLP-1R agonists assessed were exenatide given twice daily, exenatide given once weekly (as a long acting release), and liraglutide given once daily. The control groups were placebo, no intervention, or antidiabetic drugs. If trials included more than one control group, we included data from the most weight neutral intervention (for example, placebo instead of insulin). We also included randomised comparisons between exenatide and liraglutide. To undertake a review that applied to clinical practice, we only included trials with a duration of at least 20 weeks that assessed clinically relevant doses of at least 10 µg/day for exenatide (5 µg twice daily), 2 mg/week for exenatide once weekly, and 1.2 mg/day for liraglutide once daily.

Assessment of risk of bias

Based on previous evidence, we classed the randomisation methods of selected trials as the primary measure of bias control. We assessed randomisation methods by how the allocation sequence was generated (classed as adequate if based on a table of random numbers, computer generated random numbers, or similar) and concealed (classed as adequate if based on central randomisation, identically coded drug containers, serially numbered opaque sealed envelopes, or similar).

We also extracted information on the following:

(1) Blinding (whether the trial was described as double blind or single blind, the method of blinding; whether patients, investigators, outcome assessors, or other individuals participating in the trial were blinded; and whether the adequacy of blinding was assessed)
(2) Risk of attrition bias (numbers of and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals, and whether all patients were accounted for in the report and analysis of the trial)
(3) Whether the primary outcome measure was defined and reported
(4) Whether sample size calculations were done
(5) Whether the preset sample size was achieved
(6) For trials terminated prematurely, whether this termination was based on predefined criteria

### Real-world clinical effectiveness of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management in Canada [^116i87vt]. Obesity (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Real-world clinical effectiveness of liraglutide 3.0 mg, in combination with diet and exercise, was investigated 4 and 6 months post initiation. Changes in absolute and percent body weight were examined from baseline.

Methods

A cohort of liraglutide 3.0 mg initiators in 2015 and 2016 was identified from six Canadian weight-management clinics. Post initiation values at 4 and 6 months were compared with baseline values using a paired t test.

Results

The full cohort consisted of 311 participants, with 210 in the ≥ 4-month persistence group and 167 in the ≥ 6-month persistence group. Average baseline BMI was 40.7 kg/m 2, and weight was 114.8 kg. There was a significant change in body weight 6 and 4 months after initiation of treatment in persistent subjects (≥ 6-month: -8.0 kg, P < 0.001; ≥ 4-month: -7.0 kg, P < 0.001) and All Subjects, regardless of persistence (-7.3 kg; P < 0.001). Percentage change in body weight from baseline was -7.1% in the ≥ 6-month group and -6.3% in the ≥ 4-month group, and All Subjects lost 6.5% body weight. Of participants in the ≥ 6-month group, 64.10% and 34.5% lost ≥ 5% and > 10% body weight, respectively.

Conclusions

In a real-world setting, liraglutide 3.0 mg, when combined with diet and exercise, was associated with clinically meaningful weight loss.

Outside randomized clinical trial settings, data on weight loss with semaglutide or liraglutide for obesity are generally limited to 6 months of follow-up, based on brand names approved by the FDA for T2D only, or cohorts that exclude patients who did not persist with the treatment. Furthermore, emerging data suggest that persistent coverage with GLP-1 RAs (ie, a cumulative gap of less than 90 days), is difficult to achieve, but little is known about how persistence affects weight loss. Such understanding could inform the need and scope of future research, as well as clinical and policy interventions aimed at addressing the barriers to the use of these medications. We examined weight outcomes at 1 year in patients with obesity who received injectable forms of liraglutide or semaglutide and compared outcomes by GLP-1 RA agent, indication, dosage, and persistent coverage with the medication.

### Exposure-response analyses of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management [^114zziKx]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

In summary, exposure–weight loss analyses suggest that, of all doses tested, liraglutide 3.0 mg provides the optimum exposure for clinically relevant weight loss in all populations: men and women, the entire range of baseline body weight and people with type 2 diabetes.

The relationship between liraglutide exposure and HbA1c was analysed in individuals with type 2 diabetes (Trial 2) only. There was a clear exposure–HbA1c relationship, with the magnitude of HbA1c reduction increasing up to a plasma liraglutide concentration of ∼21 nM. This was consistent with a previous study that estimated a concentration of ∼15 nM was necessary for a full glycaemic response in individuals with similar baseline characteristics to those in Trial 2 22. In the present analysis the mean HbA1c reduction obtained with exposures associated with the 3.0 mg dose was only modestly greater than with 1.8 mg (Figure 3 A); however, when stratified by baseline HbA1c, the HbA1c reduction obtained with exposure levels associated with 3.0 mg did not plateau for the highest baseline HbA1c category [> 8.5% (69.4 mmol/mol)], implying that individuals with high HbA1c may derive additional glycaemic benefit from a 3.0‐mg, rather than 1.8‐mg, dose. A mediator analysis indicated that the incremental HbA1c reduction with doses above 1.8 mg, up to the maximum tested 3.0 mg, was accounted for by the concomitant reduction in body weight.

### Exposure-response analyses of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management [^115VfkaY]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

There was a clear exposure–response relationship between liraglutide and body weight reduction, with percentage weight loss from baseline increasing with greater exposure in all three trials. The shape of the curve describing estimated exposure–weight loss was similar across trials; however, for individuals with type 2 diabetes (Trial 2) the absolute weight loss reduction at any given exposure was lower than that in individuals with normoglycaemia or individuals with prediabetes (Trial 1), even at zero exposure (placebo; Figure 1 A). Inter‐trial differences with respect to absolute weight loss may be ascribed to a trial effect, or to population differences between individuals with/without diabetes. It is established that people with diabetes have more difficulty losing weight than individuals without diabetes 17, 19, a finding previously noted in trials of other anti‐obesity medications 20, 21.

At any given exposure, women achieved more weight loss than did men (Figure S2A, Supporting Information); covariate analysis showed this effect was additional to the extra weight loss expected in women as a result of a 32% higher exposure than in men of similar body weight (R. V. Overgaard, personal communication). The exposure–weight loss response did not appear to fully plateau with exposure levels associated with the 3.0 mg dose in men (Figure S2A, Supporting Information), suggesting that more weight loss could potentially have been achieved in some men at doses above 3.0 mg, although such doses have not been clinically tested. Importantly, the 10% heaviest males subgroup [expected to have least weight loss because of the combined effects of high body weight reducing liraglutide exposure 12, and lesser weight loss response to liraglutide in men vs. women (Figure 2 A)], achieved clinically significant weight loss [6.8% (11.4 kg); Figure 2 B]. Also, the 10% lightest women experienced further weight loss (1.3%), compared with the overall female population [10.5% (8.1 kg) vs. 9.2% (9.3 kg); Figures 2 B and S2A, Supporting Information].

Methods

The study sample comprised participants who enrolled in the SaxendaCare Patient Support Program (PSP) between September 1, 2017, and February 28, 2018 (prescription claims followed until March 31, 2018). SaxendaCare is a free PSP offered by Novo Nordisk and provided to patients who have been prescribed Saxenda, a Therapeutic Goods Administration approved prescription injectable weight‐loss medicine. The injectable prescription medicine assists adults with overweight (BMI ≥ 27) with weight‐related comorbidities or obesity (BMI ≥ 30) to lose weight and maintain weight loss. All patients who had been prescribed liraglutide by their doctors were invited to enroll in the PSP program through the prescribing doctor (general practitioner, endocrinologist, or other specialist), the Saxenda network pharmacists, or the SaxendaCare patient website. Around 60% to 70% of the patients participated in the PSP.

The process of patient enrollment in the PSP is presented in Figure 1. During the period from September 1, 2017, to February 28, 2018, 3,994 participants enrolled in the PSP, of which 1,604 registered via doctors, 1,739 registered via pharmacists, and 651 registered via website. Participants were observed, on average, for 15.54 weeks, with a median of 16.14 weeks and a range from 4.43 weeks to 29.43 weeks. All participants enrolled in the PSP were offered free NovoFine needles, were sent weekly support emails, and had access to the SaxendaCare website. Additionally, participants who enrolled with prescribing doctors were offered an outbound call from an accredited dietitian or a face‐to‐face consultation with HCPs (Saxenda credentialed diabetes educators), and participants who enrolled with Saxenda network pharmacists were offered an outbound call from an accredited dietitian. Of those who enrolled with a doctor, 86 participants received a face‐to‐face consultation and 284 received an outbound call; of those who enrolled with pharmacists, 297 received an outbound call.

Weight loss at week 56 in ERs and ENRs

In SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes, weight loss in ERs to liraglutide 3.0 mg was 10.8% (11.2 kg) versus 3.0% (3.2 kg) for ENRs (Figure 2 A). Similarly, in SCALE Diabetes, ERs had a greater mean weight loss than ENRs (8.5% [9.0 kg] vs. 3.1% [3.2 kg]) at 56 weeks (Figure 2 B). ERs to placebo also achieved greater weight loss than ENRs to placebo (Figure 2).

The proportions of ERs and ENRs achieving ≥ 5%, > 10%, and > 15% weight loss at week 56 in both trials were always greater for ERs versus ENRs to liraglutide 3.0 mg (Figure 3). The same pattern was observed for placebo, although proportions achieving each category were smaller than for liraglutide 3.0 mg.

### Effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on weight loss: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^112ipUsQ]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether treatment with agonists of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) result in weight loss in overweight or obese patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Design

Systematic review with meta-analyses.

Data Sources

Electronic searches (Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science) and manual searches (up to May 2011). Review methods Randomised controlled trials of adult participants with a body mass index of 25 or higher; with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus; and who received exenatide twice daily, exenatide once weekly, or liraglutide once daily at clinically relevant doses for at least 20 weeks. Control interventions assessed were placebo, oral antidiabetic drugs, or insulin.

Data Extraction

Three authors independently extracted data. We used random effects models for the primary meta-analyses. We also did subgroup, sensitivity, regression, and sequential analyses to evaluate sources of intertrial heterogeneity, bias, and the robustness of results after adjusting for multiple testing and random errors.

Results

25 trials were included in the analysis. GLP-1R agonist groups achieved a greater weight loss than control groups (weighted mean difference -2.9 kg, 95% confidence interval -3.6 to -2.2; 21 trials, 6411 participants). We found evidence of intertrial heterogeneity, but no evidence of bias or small study effects in regression analyses. The results were confirmed in sequential analyses. We recorded weight loss in the GLP-1R agonist groups for patients without diabetes (-3.2 kg, -4.3 to -2.1; three trials) as well as patients with diabetes (-2.8 kg, -3.4 to -2.3; 18 trials). In the overall analysis, GLP-1R agonists had beneficial effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma concentrations of cholesterol, and glycaemic control, but did not have a significant effect on plasma concentrations of liver enzymes. GLP-1R agonists were associated with nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting, but not with hypoglycaemia.

Conclusions

The present review provides evidence that treatment with GLP-1R agonists leads to weight loss in overweight or obese patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus.

3.2 Treatment initiation with Saxenda®

Of the 604 initiators of Saxenda® evaluated, N = 306 (50.6%) had valid information on body weight recorded ≤ 6 months before the index date and were eligible for further analyses. Of these patients, 295/306 (96.4%) initiated treatment according to the approved indications: 281 (91.8%) SI's had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 prior to index date and 14 (4.6%) Si's had a BMI between 27 and 29.9 kg/m 2 with at least one documented obesity related comorbidity. A total of 11 SI's (3.6%) were prescribed Saxenda® outside the approved indication: six Si's had a BMI between 27 and 29.9 kg/m 2 without an obesity‐related comorbidity recorded and five had a BMI < 27 kg/m 2 (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Use of Saxenda® according to approved indications in patients with a valid weight at first prescription.

3.3 Adherence to Saxenda® stopping rule

36 Si's, corresponding to 12% of all Si's with a valid BMI at index date (36/306) completed ≥ 24 weeks of treatment following the index date. Only 16 of 36 patients had valid BMI measures both at index and at 24 weeks and were eligible for stopping rule evaluation. The majority of these (11 ≤ N ≤ 14) ‡ had ≥ 5% weight loss in weeks 16–24, while a minority (N < 5)had < 5% weight loss in weeks 16–24, but continued treatment beyond 24 weeks, thereby violating the stopping rule (Table 3).

TABLE 3
Use of Saxenda® — Adherence to stopping rule.

3.4 Use of Saxenda® according to approved posology and treatment duration

The majority of Si's (570/604) discontinued Saxenda® treatment before the censor date. The mean duration of treatment for the cohort was approximately 3.0 months, reducing slightly to 2.6 months for patients that discontinued treatment before the censor date (Table S2).

Most patients (91%) had between 0 and 6 months of treatment and about 3% between 7 and 24 months. The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment at 0–6 months was similar among patients with and without BMI recorded at treatment initiation, although slightly more patients with a BMI recorded continued on treatment for 7–24 months or had ongoing treatment (Table S3).

### Early weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg predicts 1-year weight loss and is associated with improvements in clinical markers [^117XsuFB]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

The greater improvements observed in early responders, compared with early nonresponders, were generally not accompanied by an increase in AEs: the safety profiles of early responders and early nonresponders were similar within each trial, except that early responders reported higher rates of gastrointestinal disorders in SCALE Diabetes and higher rates of gallbladder disorders in SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes. No new safety signals arose among early responders or early nonresponders.

In pooled analyses of the SCALE trials, women had slightly greater weight loss than men with liraglutide 3.0 mg 29; however, both men and women experienced a clinically meaningful weight loss. Consistent with this, there appeared to be more women than men among early responders to liraglutide 3.0 mg in both trials. Greater weight loss in women may in part be explained by higher plasma liraglutide exposure in women versus men 30.

The comparisons between early responders and early nonresponders must be interpreted with caution as they are not comparisons between randomized groups and were therefore not subjected to significance testing. In the case of the diabetes trial, conclusions are further limited by the low number of individuals in the liraglutide early nonresponder and placebo early responder groups. An additional limitation is the use of a forced dose escalation of liraglutide from 0.6 mg daily to 3.0 mg daily in 0.6 mg increments over 4 weeks (with 1 additional week at investigator's discretion) in the original trials. Also, early nonresponders in these trials were continued on treatment for 56 weeks; in clinical practice their treatment would be discontinued after 16 weeks, and improvements in end points might therefore be smaller than those reported here.

From a clinical perspective, use of the stopping rules should help optimize the use of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management. Patients can be informed that, if they respond well during the first 16 weeks, it is likely they will continue to do so. It is reassuring that most AEs were no more frequent in early responders compared with early nonresponders, even with greater weight loss, with the exception of gallbladder disorders, perhaps reinforcing the suggestion that at least part of the increased risk of gallbladder disorders seen in SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes was related to weight loss 14.

### The role of tirzepatide, dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, in the management of type 2 diabetes: the SURPASS clinical trials [^113uk3C3]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Significance of the SURPASS Clinical Trials

Diabetes care has evolved over the last two decades, shifting from a glucocentric approach to multifactorial intervention with the aim of minimising CV morbidity and mortality. International guidelines recommend the choice of anti-hyperglycaemic therapy based not only on the degree of hyperglycaemia but also on the presence or absence of CV disease, renal disease and obesity. GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors have gained popularity due to their clinical efficacy and favourable CV outcomes. Despite these developments, there are still unmet needs for people living with diabetes, especially those with obesity. Tirzepatide has demonstrated greater HbA1c reduction (− 2.4% with 15 mg tirzepatide) and superior weight loss (− 11.3 kg with tirzepatide 15 mg) with comparable adverse effects versus the GLP-1 RA dulaglutide in phase 2 trials. Of note, semaglutide, currently regarded as the most potent GLP-1 RA, demonstrated 1.5–1.8% HbA1c reduction and 4.5–6.5 kg weight reduction. It is not possible to compare the efficacy of tirzepatide and semaglutide with available data from phase 2 trials; however, the SURPASS-2 trial will directly compare the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus semaglutide with the potential for superiority of tirzepatide, particularly with respect to weight reduction. Since the prevalence of diabesity is increasing, diabetes medications with potent weight loss will be increasingly attractive in modern diabetes care. Amongst available GLP-1 RAs, liraglutide 3.0 mg daily subcutaneous injection (Saxenda®) has approval for chronic weight management in patients with obesity or with a weight-related comorbidity and a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2; however, for the management of T2DM, the approval licence remains at the once daily dose of 1.8 mg. In the SCALE trial which compared liraglutide 3 mg versus 1.8 mg versus placebo, there was a small but significant reduction in weight and HbA1c in the liraglutide 3 mg group compared to liraglutide 1.8 mg group. However, the SCALE study was not designed to compare the efficacy of liraglutide 3 mg versus 1.8 mg. In the SCALE insulin trial, liraglutide 3 mg was associated with a HbA1c reduction of 1.1% compared to placebo (0.6%). Of interest, a higher dose of dulaglutide for glucose lowering was recently approved by the FDA following the AWARD-11 trial which demonstrated HbA1c reduction of 1.9% and 1.7% and weight reduction of 5 kg and 4.3 kg with dulaglutide 4.5 mg and 3 mg QW respectively.

### Safety, tolerability and sustained weight loss over 2 years with the once-daily human GLP-1 analog, liraglutide [^112UYAaX]. International Journal of Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Objective:

Having demonstrated short-term weight loss with liraglutide in this group of obese adults, we now evaluate safety/tolerability (primary outcome) and long-term efficacy for sustaining weight loss (secondary outcome) over 2 years.

Design:

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 20-week study with 2-year extension (sponsor unblinded at 20 weeks, participants/investigators at 1 year) in 19 European clinical research centers.

Subjects:

A total of 564 adults (n = 90–98 per group; body mass index 30–40 kg/m²) enrolled, 398 entered the extension and 268 completed the 2-year trial. Participants received diet (500 kcal deficit per day) and exercise counseling during 2-week run-in, before being randomly assigned (with a telephone or web-based system) to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (1.2, 1.8, 2.4 or 3.0 mg, n = 90–95), placebo (n = 98) or open-label orlistat (120 mg × 3, n = 95). After 1 year, liraglutide/placebo recipients switched to liraglutide 2.4 mg, then 3.0 mg (based on 20-week and 1-year results, respectively). The trial ran from January 2007–April 2009 and is registered with, number NCT00480909.

Results:

From randomization to year 1, liraglutide 3.0 mg recipients lost 5.8 kg (95% confidence interval 3.7–8.0) more weight than those on placebo and 3.8 kg (1.6–6.0) more than those on orlistat (P ≤ 0.0001; intention-to-treat, last-observation-carried-forward). At year 2, participants on liraglutide 2.4/3.0 mg for the full 2 years (pooled group, n = 184) lost 3.0 kg (1.3–4.7) more weight than those on orlistat (n = 95; P < 0.001). Completers on liraglutide 2.4/3.0 mg (n = 92) maintained a 2-year weight loss of 7.8 kg from screening. With liraglutide 3.0 mg, 20-week body fat decreased by 15.4% and lean tissue by 2.0%. The most frequent drug-related side effects were mild to moderate, transient nausea and vomiting. With liraglutide 2.4/3.0 mg, the 2-year prevalence of prediabetes and metabolic syndrome decreased by 52 and 59%, with improvements in blood pressure and lipids.

Conclusion:

Liraglutide is well tolerated, sustains weight loss over 2 years and improves cardiovascular risk factors.

### Impact of dose-escalation schemes and drug discontinuation on weight loss outcomes with liraglutide 3.0 mg: a model-based approach [^114iAAwC]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we developed the first population PK/PD model to link liraglutide systemic concentrations to longitudinal trajectories of weight loss in overweight or obese patients. The modelling approach allowed us to identify both a transient and a more sustained weight loss component and, additionally, a subtle signal of seasonal weight changes. Finally, model simulations suggested that slower escalation algorithms, as described in the prescribing information for liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight loss, can be applied with only a modest impact on the expected weight loss outcome. 18, 19, 20, 21 These results are potentially valuable for patients who experience worse GI side effects and would thus benefit from a slower dose escalation. Additionally, we demonstrate weight benefits of liraglutide 3.0 mg beyond cessation of treatment, and that these effects continue for a longer time for patients with a longer liraglutide 3.0 mg treatment duration.

### Early weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg predicts 1-year weight loss and is associated with improvements in clinical markers [^1168GEgu]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

In both trials, higher proportions of subjects were early responders to liraglutide 3.0 mg than to placebo. Early responders to liraglutide achieved greater mean weight loss than early nonresponders and were more likely to achieve ≥ 5%, > 10%, and > 15% weight loss at 56 weeks. Greater responses were also seen among early responders versus early nonresponders to placebo; but fewer subjects were early responders to placebo compared with liraglutide 3.0 mg.

The greater weight loss in early responders was accompanied by a trend toward greater improvements in cardiometabolic biomarkers. Decreases in mean SBP and DBP and favorable changes in lipid profile, in particular, are expected effects of weight loss, contributing to a decreased risk of developing cardiovascular disease 24. In SCALE Diabetes, clinically meaningful reductions in HbA₁c and fasting plasma glucose were seen in both early responders and early nonresponders to liraglutide, due to its direct glucose‐lowering effect 25; in early responders, this effect appeared further enhanced by the greater weight loss versus early nonresponders. The combination of direct effects of liraglutide on glycemia, as well as further improvement likely mediated by enhanced weight loss in early responders, may be particularly beneficial for slowing progression to T2D and increasing regression to normoglycemia in individuals with prediabetes, which further reduces the risk of conversion to T2D 26.

It has been suggested that, in trials of antiobesity drugs, improvements in feeling and functioning should be measured when validated measures exist 27. Improvements in HRQoL were recorded as assessed by IWQOL‐Lite, a questionnaire developed specifically to evaluate the impact of weight on quality of life (both trials), and SF‐36, a more general HRQoL questionnaire (SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes only). For both liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo, improvements were greater in early responders than early nonresponders. The changes recorded for early responders (to either intervention) were clinically relevant. (Clinically relevant improvements for an individual are increases of 7.7 to 12 points for IWQOL‐Lite total score, depending on baseline score 28, and ≥ 2 points for SF‐36 physical component summary score 17.)

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to SAXENDA during pregnancy. SAXENDA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Additionally, weight loss offers no benefit to a pregnant patient and may cause fetal harm. When a pregnancy is recognized, advise the pregnant patient of the risk to a fetus, and discontinue SAXENDA (see Clinical Considerations).

Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse embryofetal developmental outcomes from exposure during pregnancy. Liraglutide exposure was associated with early embryonic deaths and an imbalance in some fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats administered liraglutide during organogenesis at doses that approximate clinical exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits administered liraglutide during organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of major fetal abnormalities were seen at exposures below the human exposures at the MRHD (see Animal Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown.

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

### Association of glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs and agonists administered for obesity with weight loss and adverse events: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112sb821]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Comparative effectiveness of 7 glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agents on weight loss (WL) in obesity remains unknown.

Methods

We performed a systematic review, network meta-analysis (NMA) utilizing the following data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Central and clinical trial registries, from inception to March 2, 2021. The prespecified criteria for study inclusion were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of ≥ 12 weeks' duration. The data appraisal and extraction were performed by two investigators independently, using the published reports. The main outcomes and statistical methods were weight loss over placebo (WLOP) and adverse events (AEs) among GLP-1 agents using random-effects NMA (frequentist approach); relative ranking using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) method and certainty of evidence using grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations (GRADE).

Findings

64 RCTs (from 2004 to 2021) included 27018 patients (median of age, 55.1 years old; 57.4% women; baseline weight 94.8kg and BMI 33.0kg/m 2; trial duration 26 weeks). Direct meta-analysis showed significant WLOP with: -1.44kg (95% CI, -2.14 to -0.74) with dulaglutide ≥ 1.5 mg; -1.82kg (-2.42 to -1.23) with exenatide immediate release (IR); -2.20kg (-4.31 to -0.08) with exenatide extended release (ER); -3.20kg (-6.53 to 0.15) with efpeglenatide; -2.72kg (-3.35 to -2.09) with liraglutide ≤ 1.8mg; -4.49kg (-5.26 to -3.72) with liraglutide > 1.8mg; -0.62kg (-1.22 to -0.02) with lixisenatide; -4.33kg (-5.71 to -3.00) with semaglutide SQ < 2.4mg; -9.88kg (-13.17 to -6.59) with semaglutide SQ 2.4mg; -2.73kg (-4.81 to -0.65) with semaglutide oral; and -1.71kg (-2.64 to -0.78) with taspoglutide. Highest WLOP were with semaglutide SQ 2.4mg and < 2.4mg, and liraglutide > 1.8mg (SUCRAs 100, 86.1, 82.8 respectively). Highest SUCRAs for discontinuation due to AEs were with taspoglutide and liraglutide > 1.8mg. Risk of bias was high or unclear for random sequence generation (29.7%), allocation concealment (26.6%), and incomplete outcome data (26.6%). Heterogeneity (I 2 > 50%) in WL and AEs reflected magnitude, not direction of effect.

### Effects of liraglutide in the treatment of obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^115TcoX5]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

The frequency of obesity has risen dramatically in recent years but only few safe and effective drugs are currently available. We assessed the effect of liraglutide on bodyweight and tolerability in obese individuals without type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled 20-week trial, with open-label orlistat comparator in 19 sites in Europe. 564 individuals (18–65 years of age, body-mass index 30–40 kg/m2) were randomly assigned, with a telephone or web-based system, to one of four liraglutide doses (1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg, or 3.0 mg, n = 90–95) or to placebo (n = 98) administered once a day subcutaneously, or orlistat (120 mg, n = 95) three times a day orally. All individuals had a 500 kcal per day energy-deficit diet and increased their physical activity throughout the trial, including the 2-week run-in. Weight change analysed by intention to treat was the primary endpoint. An 84-week open-label extension followed. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00422058.

Findings

Participants on liraglutide lost significantly more weight than did those on placebo (p = 0.003 for liraglutide 1.2 mg and p < 0.0001 for liraglutide 1.8–3.0 mg) and orlistat (p = 0.003 for liraglutide 2.4 mg and p < 0.0001 for liraglutide 3.0 mg). Mean weight loss with liraglutide 1.2–3.0 mg was 4.8 kg, 5.5 kg, 6.3 kg, and 7.2 kg compared with 2.8 kg with placebo and 4.1 kg with orlistat, and was 2.1 kg (95% CI 0.6–3.6) to 4.4 kg (2.9–6.0) greater than that with placebo. More individuals (76%, n = 70) lost more than 5% weight with liraglutide 3.0 mg that with placebo (30%, n = 29) or orlistat (44%, n = 42). Liraglutide reduced blood pressure at all doses, and reduced the prevalence of prediabetes (84–96% reduction) with 1.8–3.0 mg per day. Nausea and vomiting occurred more often in individuals on liraglutide than in those on placebo, but adverse events were mainly transient and rarely led to discontinuation of treatment.

Interpretation

Liraglutide treatment over 20 weeks is well tolerated, induces weight loss, improves certain obesity-related risk factors, and reduces prediabetes.

### Variables associated with HbA1c and weight reductions when adding liraglutide to multiple daily insulin injections in persons with type 2 diabetes (MDI liraglutide trial 3) [^115aaSfA]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Implications

Higher HbA1c did not predict a greater HbA1c reduction in the liraglutide group when comparing with the HbA1c change in the placebo group. This suggests that this drug should be evaluated as a treatment option not only to those with the poorest glycemic control. The fact that those with lower HbA1c at baseline had the greatest weight reduction suggests the same.

The recommendation for usage of GLP-1 RA is still somewhat restricted in national guidelines. For example the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK has recommended continued treatment with GLP-1 RA only if the patient has lost at least 11 mmol/mol (1.0%) in HbA1c and 3% of body weight in 6 months. On the contrary, our results suggest that there is no correlation between improved glycemic control and weight loss during treatment. Our results indicate a need to start looking at these efficacy variables separately when evaluating the treatment. Substantial weight loss may have benefits for the overall health of the patient even if glycemic control remains the same. At the same time improved glycemic control has positive health effects even in the absence of weight loss.

The findings in the current study suggest that fasting proinsulin may be a predictor of the beneficial effects of liraglutide on HbA1c. This needs to be evaluated in other studies to be confirmed. Finding predictors for effective therapy is important since it can increase our understanding of how the drug acts in an in vivo environment. There has been an ongoing discussion why patients seem to vary in their response to treatment, and it is essential in clinical practice to evaluate the effect on an individual basis.

### Real-world use of liraglutide for weight management according to label in the United kingdom: a cohort study using the clinical practice research datalink primary care databases [^112AHiaw]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess real-world use of Saxenda® (liraglutide 3.0mg) and off-label use of Victoza® (liraglutide 1.2mg/1.8mg) for weight management and Saxenda® posology in the United Kingdom. Their similar doses and formulation pose a risk of inadvertent use due to their use for different indications.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective, non-interventional drug utilization cohort study (DUS), based on anonymized patient data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink databases (CPRD Aurum, GOLD), included adult liraglutide initiators without prior prescription 12months before the index date. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize Saxenda® and Victoza® user demographics and drug utilization.

Results

Totally 604 Saxenda® and 4853 Victoza® patients were included. Approximately half of the Saxenda® initiators (Si's) (N = 306) had available body weight, of which 96.4% initiated treatment according to the weight loss indication. Si's were more likely female than Victoza® initiators (Vi's) (86.4% vs. 52.1%), younger (mean age ± SD: 46.5 ± 11.7years) versus (57.5 ± 12.0years) and with shorter duration of follow-up observation (18.8 ± 13.9months) versus (32.9 ± 15.9months). N < 5 of 16 patients with 24-weeks body mass index (BMI) data did not adhere to the Saxenda® stopping rule. N < 5 of 92 patients with valid dose used Victoza® outside the diabetes indication.

Conclusions

This DUS provides descriptive data for initiators of liraglutide in the initial 5-year period following the launch of Saxenda® in the United Kingdom. Real-world use of Saxenda® and Victoza® raised no new safety concerns. Where assessment was possible, Saxenda® and Victoza® were mostly prescribed by physicians according to their approved indications.

### Liraglutide (Saxenda) [^116huwVd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Weight Management Trial in Pediatric Patients Ages 12 and Older with Obesity

SAXENDA was evaluated in a 56-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo controlled multi-center trial in 251 pubertal pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years, with BMI corresponding to 30 kg/m2or greater for adults by international cut-off points1and BMI of 95thpercentile or greater for age and sex (NCT02918279). After a 12-week lifestyle run-in period, patients were randomized 1:1 to SAXENDA once-daily or placebo once-daily. The SAXENDA dose was titrated to 3 mg over a 4- to 8-week period based on tolerability as judged by the investigator. Escalation of the trial product was not allowed if the subject had a self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) < 56 mg/dL or < 70 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms of hypoglycemia during the week prior to or during the dose escalation visits. The proportion of patients who reached the 3 mg dose was 82.4%; for 8.8% of patients 2.4 mg was the maximum tolerated dose.

The mean age was 14.5 years: 40.6% of patients were male, 87.6% were White, 0.8% were Asian, 8% were Black or African American; 22.3% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean baseline body weight was 100.8 kg, and mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 35.6 kg/m2.

### Short-term exenatide treatment leads to significant weight loss in a subset of obese women without diabetes [^112nM9JK]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Incretin mimetics are quickly gaining popularity for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Exenatide is associated with a reduction in hemoglobin A1C of 0.5–0.8% and liraglutide with a reduction of 1.1–1.5%. Of interest, a consistent finding in large clinical studies is that hemoglobin A1C levels declined but then plateaued while weight loss continued. Data on weight loss with exenatide in individuals without diabetes are limited. One group reported ~3.3 kg placebo-corrected weight loss over 24 weeks. Astrup et al. showed that 1.2–3.0 mg liraglutide daily plus aggressive lifestyle intervention for 20 weeks was associated with dose-dependent, placebo-corrected weight loss, ranging from 2.0 to 4.4 kg among nondiabetic obese individuals. Neither study commented on individual responses to treatment.

Our cohort of women lost, on average, 2.5 kg after 16 weeks of exenatide treatment, and we observed significant weight loss after only 2 weeks. Importantly, we observed that 30% of our study population lost 8% of their body weight during exenatide treatment, whereas another 31% did not lose any weight or gained weight. The variable response to exenatide was apparent as early as 4 weeks. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report stratified weight loss in response to exenatide treatment in obese, nondiabetic individuals. Although we did not identify baseline characteristics that predicted the degree of response to exenatide treatment, our observation that significant weight loss was seen as early as 2 weeks and that high responders could be identified by 4 weeks has important clinical ramifications and demonstrates the value of a short clinical trial to assess the effectiveness in a given individual. A larger prospective study designed to investigate predictors of weight loss with exenatide is an important area for future investigation.

### Safety, tolerability and sustained weight loss over 2 years with the once-daily human GLP-1 analog, liraglutide [^11579aad]. International Journal of Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Having demonstrated short-term weight loss with liraglutide in this group of obese adults, we now evaluate safety/tolerability (primary outcome) and long-term efficacy for sustaining weight loss (secondary outcome) over 2 years.

Design

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 20-week study with 2-year extension (sponsor unblinded at 20 weeks, participants/investigators at 1 year) in 19 European clinical research centers.

Subjects

A total of 564 adults (n = 90–98 per group; body mass index 30–40 kg/m²) enrolled, 398 entered the extension and 268 completed the 2-year trial. Participants received diet (500kcaldeficit per day) and exercise counseling during 2-week run-in, before being randomly assigned (with a telephone or web-based system) to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (1.2, 1.8, 2.4 or 3.0mg, n = 90–95), placebo (n = 98) or open-label orlistat (120mg × 3, n = 95). After 1 year, liraglutide/placebo recipients switched to liraglutide 2.4mg, then 3.0mg (based on 20-week and 1-year results, respectively). The trial ran from January 2007-April 2009 and is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT00480909.

Results

From randomization to year 1, liraglutide 3.0mg recipients lost 5.8kg (95% confidence interval 3.7–8.0) more weight than those on placebo and 3.8kg (1.6–6.0) more than those on orlistat (P0.0001; intention-to-treat, last-observation-carried-forward). At year 2, participants on liraglutide 2.4/3.0mg for the full 2 years (pooled group, n = 184) lost 3.0kg (1.3–4.7) more weight than those on orlistat (n = 95; P < 0.001). Completers on liraglutide 2.4/3.0mg (n = 92) maintained a 2-year weight loss of 7.8kg from screening. With liraglutide 3.0mg, 20-week body fat decreased by 15.4% and lean tissue by 2.0%. The most frequent drug-related side effects were mild to moderate, transient nausea and vomiting. With liraglutide 2.4/3.0mg, the 2-year prevalence of prediabetes and metabolic syndrome decreased by 52 and 59%, with improvements in blood pressure and lipids.

Conclusion

Liraglutide is well tolerated, sustains weight loss over 2 years and improves cardiovascular risk factors.

### Weight loss and treatment patterns in a real-world population of adults receiving liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management in routine clinical practice in Switzerland (ADDRESS study) [^111epYsd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess weight loss associated with liraglutide 3.0mg treatment in individuals with obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30kg/m 2) or overweight (BMI > 27 to < 30kg/m 2) in a reimbursed, real-world setting in Switzerland.

Materials and Methods

ADDRESS was a non-comparative, multicentre, retrospective exposure cohort study in Switzerland, examining weight loss in individuals with obesity or overweight whose treatment was reimbursed (divided into BMI subgroups) or non-reimbursed. The primary outcomes were proportions of participants in the reimbursed cohort achieving predefined weight loss targets with liraglutide 3.0mg at Week 16 (≥ 5% and ≥ 7% for the lower BMI [28 to < 35kg/m 2 with weight-related comorbidities] and higher BMI [≥ 35kg/m 2] subgroups, respectively) and Month 10 (additional ≥ 5% from Week 16; per Swiss reimbursement criteria).

Results

The full analysis set comprised 258 individuals (195 reimbursed; 63 non-reimbursed). In the reimbursed cohort, 139 individuals (71.3%) achieved their weight loss targets at Week 16. Of individuals who met the Week-16 criteria, 43.2% attained an additional 5% weight loss at Month 10. In 162 individuals for whom data were recorded at Month 10, the mean (standard deviation) relative weight loss from baseline to Month 10 was -12.4% (6.4%).

Conclusions

Although reimbursement criteria may be difficult to achieve, particularly the additional weight loss of 5% from Week 16 to Month 10, a clinically relevant overall weight loss from baseline to Month 10 was shown in most individuals with obesity or overweight who received liraglutide 3.0mg.

### Early weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg predicts 1-year weight loss and is associated with improvements in clinical markers [^113LyKpG]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Optimal early response criterion for ≥ 5% weight loss after 56 weeks

The proportion of subjects treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg who lost ≥ 3%, ≥ 4%, or ≥ 5% weight at 8, 12, and 16 weeks in the pooled analysis of SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes and SCALE Diabetes and associated PPVs and NPVs are shown in Table 1. The sensitivity and specificity of each criterion were also calculated (Supporting Information Table S1).

The analyses showed that ≥ 4% weight loss at 16 weeks yielded the highest correctly predicted value (80.1%), consistent with high values for both PPV (81.4%) and NPV (76.0%) (Table 1). The criteria based on the 8‐week time point were associated with lower overall correctly predicted values and, in particular, low NPVs, meaning that treatment would have been incorrectly discontinued in a notable number of individuals who would have gone on to achieve ≥ 5% weight loss after 56 weeks. For example, using NPV for 4% weight loss at 8 weeks, 34.7% (350 of 1,009 subjects identified as ENRs) would have been incorrectly discontinued, versus 24% (150 of 626 subjects) using the 16‐week value (Table 1). The 12‐week time point criteria had PPVs similar to those at the 16‐week time point but comparatively lower NPVs (Table 1). Thus, using NPV for 4% weight loss at 12 weeks, 29.2% (221 of 757 subjects identified as ENRs) would have been incorrectly discontinued, versus 24% (150 of 626 subjects) using the 16‐week value (Table 1). Furthermore, the choice of week 16 meant that individuals would have received treatment‐dose liraglutide 3.0 mg for 12 weeks, consistent with the exposure period generally recommended for other antiobesity medications.

Consistent results and conclusions were reached when the pooled analysis was conducted separately for males and females, or for each trial, and from a sensitivity analysis with missing week 56 responses imputed as nonresponse (Supporting Information Tables S2‐S4).

A separate analysis showed that ≥ 4% weight loss at 16 weeks was also a good criterion for predicting weight loss with placebo, yielding a high overall correctly predicted value (80.0%), consistent with a reasonably high PPV (66.1%) and NPV (85.8%) (Supporting Information Table S5).

### Marked weight loss on liraglutide 3.0 mg: real-life experience of a Swiss cohort with obesity [^115tqpfH]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Effects on weight loss

Overall mean weight change at 4 months was −8.7% (3%) or −10 (3.7) kg. At 10 months, overall mean weight loss was −12.4% (5.5%) or −14.1 (6.6) kg (Table 1, Figure 1). No significant weight changes were depicted at 4 months between patients with BMI > 35 kg/m 2 and patients with BMI ≤ 35 kg/m 2, either in absolute or relative values (−8.5% [2.7%] vs. −9.6% [4.9%], p = 0.9; −10.3 [3.5] kg vs. −8.5 [4.8] kg, p = 0.15, respectively). Similarly, patients with BMI > 35 kg/m 2 had similar weight loss compared with patients with lower BMI (−11.8% [4.6%] vs. −15.0% [8.5%], p = 0.4; −14.3 [6.1] kg vs. −13.5 [8.8] kg, p = 0.3). Between 4 and 10 months, the weight loss (absolute and relative) was lower compared with the weight loss achieved during the first 4 months of treatment (−3.6% [4.5%] and −3.6 [4.7] kg vs. −10.0% [3.7%] and −8.7 [3.1] kg) in the 49 patients who completed the 10‐month treatment. The prevalence of subjects with ≥ 5% weight loss was 87% (n = 47/54) at 4 months and 96% at 10 months (n = 47/49). At 4 months, 28% of patients had ≥ 10% weight loss, and this percentage increased to 61% at 10 months (Figure 1). Percentage weight loss was significantly higher in women than in men at 4 months (9.5% [3.1%] in women vs. −7.2% [2.5%] in men, p = 0.02) and at 10 months (−13.7% [5.2%] in women vs. −9.6% [5.1%] in men, p = 0.006; Figure 1).

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^113dWxNk]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The three GLP‐1RA‐based agents currently approved for weight loss have all shown clear efficacy in promoting weight loss in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), that is, in settings with good medication adherence among participants and a follow‐up of typically one to two years. In contrast, evidence on their long‐term effects and hard clinical outcomes in broad populations with obesity in real‐world clinical practice is still limited, and comparably little is known about the utilization patterns and clinical effects on both weight loss and associated comorbidities of these newer medications in the population‐based setting.,

The goal of this narrative review is to summarize available evidence from real‐world observational studies on the utilization patterns, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of the three currently approved GLP‐1RA for weight loss, that is, liraglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide. The review briefly discusses contemporary real‐world data on drug utilization and then focuses on evidence on clinical outcomes in routine care settings, including weight loss, other clinical outcomes and adverse effects. We focus mainly on larger observational epidemiological studies, with a prioritization of studies conducted in obese populations (if available), and secondarily in T2D populations, to ensure the relevance, robustness and timeliness of the data. Further, we highlight unmet research needs and potential future directions in the study of the real‐world effects of these novel weight‐loss medications.

### 2025 concise clinical guidance: an ACC expert consensus statement on medical weight management for optimization of cardiovascular health: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111rZYPQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Anti-obesity medications targeting NuSH — liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide — are noted as the most effective among FDA-approved obesity medications and have robust long-term efficacy and safety data up to 4 years for managing obesity in those with and without cardiovascular disease. While all currently available medications were initially approved by the FDA to treat T2DM, they are also approved for obesity. These agents share a similar side effect profile of primarily gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation) that can be mitigated with dose reductions or behavioral modifications such as hydration. On maximal doses, average weight loss is 8.0% with liraglutide, 14.9% with semaglutide, and 20.9% with tirzepatide. Liraglutide and semaglutide are GLP-1 receptor agonists.

### Exposure-response analyses of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management [^1166fYj7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

Liraglutide 3.0mg, an acylated GLP-1 analogue approved for weight management, lowers body weight through decreased energy intake. We conducted exposure-response analyses to provide important information on individual responses to given drug doses, reflecting inter-individual variations in drug metabolism, absorption and excretion.

Methods

We report efficacy and safety responses across a wide range of exposure levels, using data from one phase II (liraglutide doses 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 and 3.0mg), and two phase IIIa [SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes (3.0mg); SCALE Diabetes (1.8; 3.0mg)] randomized, placebo-controlled trials (n = 4372).

Results

There was a clear exposure-weight loss response. Weight loss increased with greater exposure and appeared to level off at the highest exposures associated with liraglutide 3.0mg in most individuals, but did not fully plateau in men. In individuals with overweight/obesity and comorbid type 2 diabetes, there was a clear exposure-glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) relationship. HbA1c reduction increased with higher plasma liraglutide concentration (plateauing at ∼21nM); however, for individuals with baseline HbA1c > 8.5%, HbA1c reduction did not fully plateau. No exposure-response relationship was identified for any safety outcome, with the exception of gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs). Individuals with gallbladder AEs, acute pancreatitis or malignant/breast/benign colorectal neoplasms did not have higher liraglutide exposure compared with the overall population.

Conclusions

These analyses support the use of liraglutide 3.0mg for weight management in all subgroups investigated; weight loss increased with higher drug exposure, with no concomitant deterioration in safety/tolerability besides previously known gastrointestinal side effects.

### Pharmacotherapy for obesity: moving towards efficacy improvement [^115X4Ebb]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

The SCALE (Satiety and Clinical Adiposity — Liraglutide Evidence) programme comprise four phase 3a clinical trials that evaluated the use of liraglutide and weight loss in individuals with and without diabetes. A double-blind RCT evaluated liraglutide 3.0 mg in the treatment of obesity for 20 weeks (n = 564), with a two-year extension open-label period (n = 268). Liraglutide showed superior weight loss over orlistat and placebo, and decreased body fat by 15.4% and lean mass by 2% after 20 weeks of treatment. Moreover, it resulted in sustained weight loss, as > 85% of the patients with a > 5% body-weight loss in the first year maintained that loss in the second year. The mean weight loss with liraglutide was 10.3 ± 7.1 kg over the two-year follow-up. Another RCT (n = 3,731) with 56 weeks of treatment showed similar results, being liraglutide superior to placebo in 5% and 10% weight loss. In patients with obesity and T2DM (n = 846), the use of liraglutide 3.0 mg for 56 weeks combined with a daily 500-kcal-deficit diet and increased physical activity yielded a mean weight loss of 6.0% versus 2.0% for those using a placebo. To evaluate the efficacy of liraglutide after weight loss, 422 patients randomly received either liraglutide 3.0 mg or placebo for 54 weeks after losing ≥ 5% body weight with a low-calorie diet (1200–1400 kcal/day) and regular physical exercise. The additional mean weight loss with liraglutide was 6.2% versus 0.2% with placebo (p < 0.0001). None of the trials reported weight loss greater than 20%.

### Incretin-based therapies for the treatment of obesity-related diseases [^113X28sa]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease. (2024). Medium credibility.

Randomized controlled trials (RCT)

Liraglutide, titrated up to 3.0 mg administered subcutaneously once daily (OD), was the first incretin-based AOM to be developed and launched on the market. Evidence of its weight-lowering efficacy was accrued in the dedicated SCALE (Satiety and Clinical Adiposity Liraglutide Evidence) program. In four randomized controlled trials (RCT) conducted in patients with obesity without T2D –, liraglutide 3.0 mg was compared to placebo as an adjunct to lifestyle optimization over 56 weeks, with the exception of the 3-year extension of the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes study. This study was limited to the subgroup of patients with prediabetes with the primary aim to assess the proportion of individuals who developed T2D. Participants were mostly white female adults (mean age 45–49 years), with a mean BMI of 37.5–39.3 kg/m². In the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes trial, 61% of participants had prediabetes, while the prevalence of baseline prediabetes was not stated for the SCALE Maintenance, and SCALE IBTtrials, and participants' mean HbA1c was 5.5%. At 56 weeks, patients on liraglutide 3.0 mg lost on average 6.1–8.0% of BW vs. 0.2–4.0% on placebo –, with the extension of SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes suggesting a slight weight regain after the first year. Liraglutide 3.0 mg was also beneficial in reducing BW in adolescents with obesity compared to placebo (−3.2% vs. 2.2%). Weight loss was also assessed in the SCALE Sleep Apnea RCT, in which 359 non-diabetic individuals (mean age 48.5 years, mean BMI 39.1 kg/m²), mostly males with untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), were enrolled to investigate the effect of liraglutide on disease severity. Patients on liraglutide lost 5.7% BW at 32 weeks compared to 1.6% for those on placebo. The SCALE program also included two RCT conducted in patients with T2D on background oral anti-diabetes medications with, /withoutinsulin, aiming to assess the efficacy of liraglutide 3.0 mg on weight loss at 56 weeks. These studies confirmed the weight lowering efficacy of liraglutide in this setting, showing a BW change ranging from −6.0% to −5.8% with liraglutide compared to −2.0 to −1.5% with placebo. Across the SCALE trials, the proportion of patients losing > 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% of BW was 46.3–63.2%, 22.8–33.1%, 11.0–18.1%, and 6.0%, respectively (Fig. 1), with a mean reduction in waist circumference (WC) ranging from 4.7 to 9.4 cm –.

### Exposure-response analyses of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management [^111jfqKh]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

Liraglutide 3.0 mg, an acylated GLP‐1 analogue approved for weight management, lowers body weight through decreased energy intake. We conducted exposure‐response analyses to provide important information on individual responses to given drug doses, reflecting inter‐individual variations in drug metabolism, absorption and excretion.

Methods

We report efficacy and safety responses across a wide range of exposure levels, using data from one phase(liraglutide doses 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 and 3.0 mg), and two phase[besity andrediabetes (3.0 mg); iabetes (1.8; 3.0 mg)] randomized, placebo‐controlled trials (n = 4372).

Results

There was a clear exposure–weight loss response. Weight loss increased with greater exposure and appeared to level off at the highest exposures associated with liraglutide 3.0 mg in most individuals, but did not fully plateau in men. In individuals with overweight/obesity and comorbid type 2 diabetes, there was a clear exposure–glycated haemoglobin relationship.reduction increased with higher plasma liraglutide concentration (plateauing at ∼21); however, for individuals with baseline > 8.5%, reduction did not fully plateau. No exposure–response relationship was identified for any safety outcome, with the exception of gastrointestinal adverse events. Individuals with gallbladder, acute pancreatitis or malignant/breast/benign colorectal neoplasms did not have higher liraglutide exposure compared with the overall population.

Conclusions

These analyses support the use of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management in all subgroups investigated; weight loss increased with higher drug exposure, with no concomitant deterioration in safety/tolerability besides previously known gastrointestinal side effects.

### Effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on weight loss: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^112PTYtv]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

The patient characteristics at baseline and the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes were very similar across trials. Mean body mass index ranged from 29 to 41, and mean weight from 82 to 111 kg, for both the GLP-1R agonist groups and the control groups. For patients with type 2 diabetes, the mean concentration of fasting plasma glucose at baseline ranged from 8.0 to 11.7 mmol/L for GLP-1R agonist groups, and from 8.2 to 11.2 mmol/L for control groups. Mean values of HbA 1c at baseline ranged from 7.6% to 10.4% for GLP-1R agonists and 7.4% to 10.3% for controls, respectively.

Table 1
Characteristics of included trials

The included trials assessed exenatide twice daily (n = 13 trials), liraglutide (n = 8), and exenatide once weekly (n = 4; table 1). Three trials directly compared exenatide twice daily with liraglutide or with exenatide once weekly. The dose of liraglutide given in most trials was 1.2 or 1.8 mg/day; one trial of obese individuals without diabetes also used doses of 2.4 and 3 mg/day. The doses of exenatide used were 10 to 20 µg/day or 2 mg/week. The GLP-1R agonists were given as subcutaneous injections once daily for liraglutide, and twice daily and once weekly for exenatide. The control groups received placebo, third generation sulphonylurea compounds, insulin, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, or metformin. In trials of patients with type 2 diabetes, cointerventions given to the intervention and control group included metformin, sulphonylurea compounds, or thiazolidinediones.

Quality of bias control

Allocation sequence generation and allocation concealment were adequate in all trials. None of the trials found differences in the baseline characteristics of participants between the GLP-1R agonist and control groups. Thirteen trials were double blind, with masking of both patients and investigators. None of the included trials reported the success of blinding. All trials reported clinically relevant outcome measures, provided a clear description of losses to follow-up, accounted for patients with missing data in the analyses, and undertook sample size calculations. None of the trials were terminated prematurely. We found no evidence of reporting bias when comparing published trial protocols with subsequent trial reports.

### Impact of dose-escalation schemes and drug discontinuation on weight loss outcomes with liraglutide 3.0 mg: a model-based approach [^1132nfpT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

To investigate the impact on weight loss of the treatment changes in overweight or obese people that may be needed in case of gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability issues during escalation of the glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue liraglutide.

Materials and Methods

The individual longitudinal body weight data from the main trial periods of three phase II/III trials in overweight or obese patients (56-week treatment with once-daily liraglutide 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 or 3.0mg or placebo, n = 4952) were analysed using a non-linear mixed-effect modelling approach. Individual pharmacokinetic profiles were derived based on published pharmacokinetic models. Baseline body weight, baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), age, gender, diabetes status (no diabetes, prediabetes or type 2 diabetes), race and trial region were investigated as covariates. As a form of external validation, the model was used to predict the weight regain after treatment cessation at week 56 (data not included in model development).

Results

A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model provided an adequate description of the weight loss trajectories for all studied doses. Gender and diabetes status were identified as the most influential covariates, and an underlying seasonal weight fluctuation was identified. Slower than that recommended, one-week dose-escalation algorithms led up to 2 weeks slower initial weight loss but similar long-term weight loss trajectories.

Conclusions

The relationship between liraglutide systemic exposure and weight loss was successfully established in overweight or obese people. The model could predict the time course of weight regain after treatment cessation and suggests that GI tolerability can be mitigated by slower escalation with only minor impact on the weight loss trajectory.

### Impact of dose-escalation schemes and drug discontinuation on weight loss outcomes with liraglutide 3.0 mg: a model-based approach [^112BxYAN]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Liraglutide is an acylated human GLP‐1 receptor agonist with a half‐life of ~13 hours following subcutaneous injection, supporting a once‐daily dosing regimen. 13, 14 While the positive correlation of liraglutide therapy and weight loss has been established, the objective of the present analysis was to further describe how the systemic concentration of liraglutide is quantitatively linked to weight loss over time. 13, 14, 15 Quantitative approaches, such as population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling, can be used to describe and quantify the relationships and can delineate both the maximal effects expected from a pharmacotherapeutic intervention and the rate over time at which these changes take place. 16

Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, are the most common side effects of liraglutide therapy and have been shown to be transient over time due to tolerance development. 17 To reduce the likelihood of GI side effects, a dose‐escalation algorithm is used during the treatment initiation phase, with 0.6 mg as the starting dose and a weekly increment of 0.6 mg up to the target 3.0 mg dose. 18, 19, 20, 21 If patients do not tolerate the increased dose, it is recommended to delay the dose escalation by 1 week. 18, 19, 20, 21 However, the impact on long‐term weight loss with more conservative algorithms than the standard escalation algorithm is currently unknown. Additionally, patients who discontinue liraglutide treatment have been shown to regain some of the lost weight, but the rate at which this weight regain happens is also unknown.

The aim of the present study was to describe and quantify the longitudinal trajectories of weight loss in overweight or obese people undergoing treatment with liraglutide using a population PK/PD modelling approach and to evaluate the impact of covariates. The developed model was used to investigate the impact of slower dose escalations on the long‐term weight changes and explore the rate at which weight is regained after cessation of liraglutide treatment.

### Impact of dose-escalation schemes and drug discontinuation on weight loss outcomes with liraglutide 3.0 mg: a model-based approach [^1143zNFb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Observed mean weight relative to baseline for Trial 1 (A), Trial 2 (B) and Trial 3 (C) versus time since first dose. The main trial phase for Trials 1 and 2 was up to week 56. Participants that discontinued the trial prematurely were asked to return to trial sites at week 56, and their weight was recorded (in‐trial). After the main phase, participants were discontinued from liraglutide treatment and followed up for 12 weeks. Response data are presented as mean change from baseline body weight as observed, with 95% confidence intervals. Lines represent the mean model population predictions. Data up to week 56 were included in the model development

The bi‐phasic PK/PD model that was used to describe the weight change–time profiles led to a significant improvement in both the log‐likelihood (ΔOFV = ‐6710, +3 parameters) and the goodness‐of‐fit plots as compared to a classic indirect response model. 27 Figure 2 shows the early and sustained weight change phases, as well as the net weight loss effects for the placebo group and following liraglutide 3.0 mg therapy. Treatment differences could be identified for both the transient and the sustained weight loss phases. Liraglutide increased the sustained weight change from baseline in a concentration‐dependent manner via a saturable concentration–effect relationship. The estimated liraglutide EC₅₀ was 22.5 nmol/L (95% confidence interval 17.5–28.2), which is in good agreement with previous exposure–response analyses. 15 The liraglutide concentration–response relationship to change from baseline per week of treatment is shown in Figure S3.

### Predictors of weight reduction effectiveness with liraglutide in diabetes mellitus type 2 patients: a retrospective cohort study [^1177JmGB]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective cohort study emphasizes that certain clinical and biochemical markers may predict short-term weight loss at 6 months in T2DM patients treated with liraglutide. Specifically, a lower baseline BMI and early weight loss at 3 months were associated with greater weight loss at 6 months. Identifying these patterns can help clinicians select patients who are most likely to benefit from liraglutide, improving treatment decisions. By recognizing early predictors, our study aims to support personalized liraglutide use, ensuring that patients most likely to respond are prioritized. This approach promotes cost-effective, efficient care by allowing early identification of 'responders' and minimizing prolonged ineffective treatment for 'non-responders'.

Consistent with prior studies, early weight loss with GLP-1 RAs (e.g. ≥ 5% at 1 month or ≥ 4% by ~ 16 weeks) predicts subsequent (6–12-month) efficacy and helps identify patients likely to achieve significant weight reduction with liraglutide. An early response suggests heightened sensitivity to the drug's effects on appetite suppression, satiety, and energy expenditure. It may also reflect better adherence to lifestyle modifications, such as improved diet, increased physical activity, and consistent use of GLP-1 RAs.

Lower baseline BMI was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of achieving weight loss. Individuals with higher BMI often have greater fat mass and a higher degree of insulin resistance and metabolic adaptation, which can reduce the effectiveness of weight-loss medications like liraglutide. In these individuals, achieving the same level of satiety or energy balance may require more time or higher doses. Additionally, factors such as leptin resistance or impaired satiety signaling may diminish liraglutide's appetite-suppressing effects. In contrast, individuals with lower BMI typically have a higher proportion of lean body mass and may experience more pronounced weight loss compared to those with higher fat mass. Although lower baseline BMI was statistically associated with achieving ≥ 5% weight loss at 6 months (aOR 1.12 per 1 kg/m² lower BMI), the per-unit effect is modest. In practice, early 3-month weight change — which showed a larger adjusted effect — may be a more actionable marker of response. Accordingly, baseline BMI should be interpreted as a supportive factor within shared decision-making rather than a gatekeeper for therapy. Previous studies have reported that lower baseline HbA1c is a predictor of weight loss in GLP-1 RAs users. However, in the present study, baseline HbA1c showed no significant association with weight loss.

The network meta-analysis maps and SUCRA-based treatment rankings for diabetic and non-diabetic participants analyzed separately are shown in Supplemental Material eFigure 9, eFigure 10, and eFigure 11. These additional analyses were generally consistent with the analyses performed for all participants in the studies reviewed to assess overall efficacy of weight loss over placebo for the diabetic and non-diabetic participants together.

11.3.2 Adverse events

In the network meta-analysis, the following showed higher risk of being associated with discontinuation due to adverse events compared to placebo (Table 2): exenatide IR liraglutide ≤ 1.8mg liraglutide > 1.8mg semaglutide SQ < 2.4mgsemaglutide SQ 2.4mg; and taspoglutide. The SUCRA ranking suggested that taspoglutide (SUCRA, 15.1) and liraglutide > 1.8mg (SUCRA, 28.3) were associated with the highest probability of being discontinued because of adverse events, whereas exenatide ER (SUCRA, 89.6) and dulaglutide < 1.5mg (SUCRA, 83.6) were associated with the lowest probability of being discontinued because of adverse events (Figure 3 and see Forest plots respectively for nausea and vomiting in eFigure 12 and eFigure 13 in Supplemental Material).

### Effectiveness and persistence of anti-obesity medications (liraglutide 3 mg, lorcaserin, and orlistat) in a real-world primary care setting [^116ryJMH]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is a chronic disease with rising prevalence. Guidelines suggest medications for obesity management if lifestyle interventions do not lead to substantial weight loss. Randomized control trials have shown the efficacy of anti-obesity medications in inducing weight loss, but real-world data are lacking. Therefore, our study aims to evaluate anti-obesity medications' effectiveness in reducing weight and improving cardiometabolic parameters and to assess their persistence in a real-world setting.

Methods

A historical cohort study using routinely collected data from Clalit Health Services (CHS). We retrieved data on all CHS members aged ≥ 20 years who initiated anti-obesity medication (orlistat, liraglutide 3 mg, and lorcaserin) between 2018 and 2020. We assessed average weight loss and the percentage of patients that had lost ≥ 5% and ≥ 10% of their body weight at 3, 6, and 9 months and compared the effectiveness of these 3 medications.

Results

We included 5,306 CHS members in our study; most (77.8%) were female, aged 40–59 years (52.4%). Treatment with liraglutide 3 mg and lorcaserin was associated with subsequent weight reduction. The average weight loss at 6 months was 5.6 kg (4.95–6.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]) with liraglutide 3 mg and 1.7 kg (1.2–2.2, 95% CI) with lorcaserin. There was no evidence that treatment with orlistat was associated with subsequent weight loss (-0.18 kg [-0.8 to 0.4, 95% CI]). At 6 months, 38% of the patients with orlistat, 43% with lorcaserin, and 51% with liraglutide 3 mg persisted with their treatments (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Liraglutide 3 mg was the primary medication associated with clinically significant weight loss and had the highest persistence rate in our real-world study.
