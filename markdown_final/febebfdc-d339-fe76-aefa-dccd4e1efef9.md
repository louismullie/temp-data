## Question

How does rh immune globulin prevent anti -D formation in rh-neg patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how Rh immune globulin prevents anti-D formation in Rh-negative patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of Rh sensitization and why Rh-negative patients are at risk. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action of anti-D immunoglobulin, including both established and hypothesized pathways. Next, I will examine the pharmacokinetics and dosing rationale, including timing and coverage of fetomaternal hemorrhage. After that, I should review clinical efficacy data and guideline-based indications. Finally, I will consider exceptions, limitations, and synthesize a concise, mechanistic conclusion with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology of Rh sensitization. In Rh-negative individuals, exposure to Rh-positive fetal red cells during pregnancy or procedures can trigger a primary immune response, leading to anti-D production. Subsequent exposure in future pregnancies can cause hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, which is why prevention is critical [^d1923bd3] [^cbec2c0d].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism of action. The exact mechanism is not fully defined, but the leading explanation is that passively administered anti-D binds Rh-positive fetal red cells that enter the maternal circulation, coating them and accelerating their clearance by the reticuloendothelial system, particularly the spleen, before the maternal immune system can mount a primary response. This is sometimes described as Fc receptor–mediated blockade or inhibitory signaling, though Fc-independent effects may also contribute [^672aa076] [^c8c6129d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the dose–response and coverage. A standard 300-microgram dose of anti-D immunoglobulin can suppress sensitization after exposure to up to about 15 mL of Rh-positive red cells, which corresponds to roughly 30 mL of whole blood. Larger fetomaternal hemorrhages require additional vials based on quantitative testing, which is why postpartum screening is recommended to detect excessive hemorrhage and adjust dosing accordingly [^d375ab3b] [^bbf51ae6].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetics and timing. Anti-D has a median half-life around 23 days in the third trimester, which supports a single antenatal dose at 28 weeks and explains why a second antenatal dose is generally not needed unless delivery occurs within 3 weeks. Importantly, administration should occur within 72 hours of a sensitizing event to maximize efficacy, although some benefit may persist beyond 72 hours in practice [^e65367eb] [^8dc53898] [^d8d3a684].

> Next, I should review clinical efficacy. Postpartum prophylaxis alone reduced alloimmunization from about 13–16% to roughly 0.5–1.8%, and adding routine antenatal prophylaxis at 28 weeks further reduced the risk to approximately 0.14–0.2% in contemporary practice. Meta-analytic data also show a large reduction in sensitization with postpartum anti-D, reinforcing its effectiveness when used correctly [^cbec2c0d] [^d0e88358] [^9524bb15].

> Let me consider guideline-based indications to ensure completeness. Routine antenatal prophylaxis at 28 weeks is recommended for all unsensitized Rh-negative pregnant patients, with a second dose after delivery if the infant is Rh-positive. Additional prophylaxis is indicated after potentially sensitizing events such as invasive procedures, external cephalic version, antepartum hemorrhage, abdominal trauma, and second- or third-trimester fetal demise. Dosing in the first trimester is lower, typically 50–120 micrograms, reflecting smaller fetal red cell mass, though evidence quality is limited and practice varies internationally [^1e3dd6ae] [^09a32d8b] [^7aa262cd].

> But wait, what if the patient is already sensitized or has a weak D phenotype. I should double-check those exceptions. Anti-D is not effective once alloimmunization has occurred, so it is not indicated for previously sensitized patients. Regarding weak D, current guidance treats most weak D phenotypes as Rh-negative for transfusion and prophylaxis decisions, though molecular typing can identify types 1, 2, or 3 that may not require prophylaxis; until genotyping is routine, many guidelines still recommend anti-D in weak D patients [^cd78befc] [^bddb19c4] [^926bb0a2].

> I will now examine first-trimester controversies to avoid overgeneralization. Evidence for anti-D after spontaneous or induced abortion before 12 weeks is limited and heterogeneous. Some guidelines still recommend 50 micrograms given the low risk and high consequences of sensitization, whereas others, including French and UK-influenced guidance, advise against routine first-trimester anti-D due to very low-quality evidence. Shared decision-making is reasonable when access or delays are a concern [^a75a6270] [^2b5dadf3] [^ebde7735].

> Let me synthesize the mechanism succinctly. Rh immune globulin prevents anti-D formation by providing passive anti-D that rapidly coats and clears Rh-positive fetal red cells from the maternal circulation before the maternal immune system can recognize and respond to the D antigen. This antibody-mediated immune suppression is dose dependent, time sensitive, and highly effective when administered according to established protocols, reducing sensitization risk from double digits to less than 0.2% in modern practice [^672aa076] [^d375ab3b] [^d0e88358].

---

Rh immune globulin prevents anti-D formation in Rh-negative patients by **coating Rh-positive fetal red cells** that enter maternal circulation, accelerating their clearance by the reticuloendothelial system before the maternal immune system can mount a primary anti-D response [^672aa076]. This **Fc-mediated clearance** and immune modulation suppresses B-cell activation and memory formation, thereby preventing sensitization [^c8c6129d]. For optimal effect, administer 300 micrograms within 72 hours of exposure or at 28 weeks' gestation, and dose based on fetomaternal hemorrhage volume after delivery or sensitizing events [^1e3dd6ae] [^bbf51ae6].

---

## Mechanism of action

### Clearance of Rh-positive fetal red blood cells

- **Coating of fetal red blood cells**: Anti-D immunoglobulin binds to Rh-positive fetal red blood cells, opsonizing them for phagocytosis and destruction by macrophages in the spleen and liver [^672aa076].

- **Accelerated clearance**: This rapid clearance prevents fetal red blood cells from persisting in maternal circulation, reducing the likelihood of maternal immune recognition and sensitization [^672aa076].

- **Fc-mediated effects**: The Fc portion of anti-D immunoglobulin may engage Fc receptors on immune cells, modulating immune responses and contributing to suppression of anti-D production [^c8c6129d].

---

### Immune modulation

- **B-cell modulation**: Anti-D immunoglobulin may interfere with B-cell activation and differentiation, preventing the formation of memory B cells and plasma cells that produce anti-D antibodies [^c8c6129d].

- **Inhibitory signaling**: Engagement of inhibitory Fc receptors (e.g. FcγRIIb) on B cells may suppress antibody production [^c8c6129d].

- **Cytokine modulation**: Anti-D immunoglobulin may influence cytokine production, further suppressing immune responses [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting efficacy

Multiple clinical studies and meta-analyses demonstrate the **effectiveness of anti-D immunoglobulin** in preventing Rh sensitization:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Efficacy of anti-d immunoglobulin** |
|-|-|
| Postpartum prophylaxis | Reduces sensitization from 13–16% to 0.5–1.8% [^cbec2c0d] |
| Antenatal prophylaxis at 28 weeks | Further reduces sensitization to 0.14–0.2% [^d0e88358] |
| After sensitizing events (e.g. miscarriage, trauma) | Reduces sensitization risk significantly [^7bd38d67] |

---

## Timing and dosing considerations

- **Optimal timing**: Administration within 72 hours of exposure or sensitizing event maximizes efficacy [^8dc53898].

- **Standard dosing**: 300 micrograms (1,500 IU) is the standard dose, sufficient to cover up to 15 mL of Rh-positive fetal red blood cells [^d375ab3b].

- **Additional dosing**: Quantification of fetomaternal hemorrhage (e.g. Kleihauer-Betke test) may necessitate additional doses if hemorrhage exceeds 30 mL [^bbf51ae6].

---

## Limitations and exceptions

- **Already sensitized patients**: Anti-D immunoglobulin is ineffective in patients with established anti-D antibodies [^869e77d2].

- **Large fetomaternal hemorrhage**: Excessive hemorrhage may exceed the capacity of standard dosing, requiring additional administration [^bbf51ae6].

- **Rare failures**: Despite prophylaxis, rare cases of sensitization occur due to unrecognized hemorrhage or late administration [^b10ca245].

---

Rh immune globulin prevents anti-D formation by **coating and clearing Rh-positive fetal red cells** and by modulating maternal immune responses, thereby preventing sensitization when given promptly and dosed appropriately [^672aa076] [^c8c6129d].

Antenatal antibody screening before anti-D immune globulin — unsensitized Rh D–negative pregnant women: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend repeated Rh D antibody testing for all unsensitized Rh D–negative women at 24–28 weeks of gestation unless the biological father is known to be Rh D negative (grade B recommendation), and consensus guidance states a routine antenatal antibody screen should be obtained at 28 weeks before administration of anti-D immune globulin. Regardless, routine antibody screening before anti-D immune globulin administration is advised.

Threatened pregnancy loss — anti-D immune globulin prophylaxis: For patients with threatened pregnancy loss and a live embryo or fetus at or before 12 weeks of gestation, use of anti-D immune globulin is controversial and no evidence-based recommendation can be made. The Rh D antigen has been reported on fetal erythrocytes as early as 38 days from fertilization or 7 3/7 weeks of estimated gestational age, and fetal–maternal hemorrhage has been documented in 3–11% of women with threatened pregnancy loss from 7 weeks to 13 weeks of gestation. Guidance is inconsistent: several national guidelines recommend against giving anti-D immune globulin, particularly if bleeding stops before 12 weeks, whereas other guidelines recommend that anti-D immune globulin should be given to all Rh D-negative women with a threatened miscarriage or when bleeding is heavy, repeated, or associated with abdominal pain as gestational age approaches 12 weeks; because of insufficient evidence, no recommendation can be made at this time.

### Anti-D administration in pregnancy for preventing rhesus alloimmunisation [^25a93d0b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

During pregnancy, a Rhesus negative (Rh-negative) woman may develop antibodies when her fetus is Rhesus positive (Rh-positive). These antibodies may harm Rh-positive babies.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin on the incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation when given to Rh-negative women without anti-D antibodies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials in Rh-negative women without anti-D antibodies given anti-D after 28 weeks of pregnancy, compared with no treatment, placebo or a different regimen of anti-D.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

We included two trials involving over 4500 women, comparing anti-D prophylaxis with no anti-D during pregnancy in this review. Overall, the trials were judged to be at moderate to high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence for pre-specified outcomes was also assessed using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. In regards to primary review outcomes, there did not appear to be a clear difference in the risks of immunisation when women who received anti-D at 28 and 34 weeks' gestation were compared with women who were not given antenatal anti-D: risk ratio (RR) for incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation during pregnancy was 0.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.17, two trials, 3902 women; GRADE: low quality evidence); at birth of a Rh-positive infant the RR was 0.42 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.17, two trials, 2297 women); and within 12 months after birth of a Rh-positive infant the average RR was 0.39 (95% CI 0.10 to 1.62, two trials, 2048 women; Tau²: 0.47; I²: 39%; GRADE: low quality evidence). Neither of the trials reported on incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation in subsequent pregnancies. Considering secondary outcomes, in one trial, women receiving anti-D during pregnancy were shown to be less likely to register a positive Kleihauer test (which detects fetal cells in maternal blood) in pregnancy (at 32 to 25 weeks) (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.88; 1884 women; GRADE: low quality evidence) and at the birth of a Rh-positive infant (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.79; 1189 women; GRADE: low quality evidence). No clear differences were seen for neonatal jaundice (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.30; 1882 infants; GRADE: very low quality evidence). Neither of the trials reported on adverse effects associated with anti-D treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Existing studies do not provide conclusive evidence that the use of anti-D during pregnancy benefits either mother or baby in terms of incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation during the pregnancy or postpartum, or the incidence of neonatal morbidity (jaundice) (low to very low quality evidence). However women receiving anti-D may be less likely to register a positive Kleihauer test in pregnancy and at the birth of a Rh-positive infant (low quality evidence). Fewer women who receive anti-D during pregnancy may have Rhesus D antibodies in a subsequent pregnancy, with benefits for the baby, however this needs to be tested in studies of robust design.

Dosage forms and Strength Description Clinical Studies References How Supplied/Storage and Handling 04/2024 INDICATIONS AND USAGE RhoGAM is an immune globulin indicated for use in preventing Rh immunization for: Pregnancy and other obstetrical conditions in Rh-negative women unless the father or baby are. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1. 1 Pregnancy and other obstetrical conditions RhoGAM is indicated for administration to Rh-negative women not previously sensitized Sections or subsections omitted from the full prescribing information are not listed. RhoGAM Rho Immune Globulin is a sterile solution containing immunoglobulin G anti-D for use in preventing Rh immunization. It is manufactured from human plasma containing anti-D from Rh-negative donors immunized with Rh-positive red blood cells. A single dose of RhoGAM contains sufficient. 11747 USA. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.

1 Mechanism of Action RhoGAM acts by suppressing the immune response of Rh-negative individuals to Rh- positive red blood cells. The mechanism of action is unknown. RhoGAM and other Rho Immune Globulin products are not effective in altering the course or. of delivery, has been shown to reduce the Rh immunization rate to about 0. 1–0. 2%. Clinical studies demonstrated that administration of Rh immune globulin within three hours following pregnancy termination was 100% effective in preventing Rh immunization. Multiple studies have been performed that prove the safety and efficacy of RhoGAM in. dose of RhoGAM was shown to suppress anti-D formation after injection of up to 15. 1 mL of Rh-positive red cells. In a companion study, Pollack administered 500 mL of Rh-positive whole blood to 44 Rh-negative male volunteers. Twenty-two subjects received 20 μg RhoGAM per mL of Rh-positive red cells and 22 received no RhoGAM.

None of the RhoGAM-treated subjects developed anti-D; 18/22 control arm subjects developed anti-D.

Prevention of Rh D alloimmunization — management when pregnancy exceeds 40 weeks after antenatal prophylaxis: Anti-D immune globulin appears to persist for approximately 12 weeks in most patients; there is insufficient evidence at this time to make a recommendation for or against administering another dose for a Rh D–negative woman who remains undelivered at 40 weeks of gestation, and a repeat antepartum dose is generally not required at 40 weeks provided the routine antenatal prophylaxis was given no earlier than 28 weeks of gestation.

Routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxis in pregnancy — unsensitized Rh D-negative women: In a meta-analysis of more than 10,000 women, postpartum anti-D immune globulin within 72 hours of birth greatly lowered Rh D alloimmunization 6 months after birth (RR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02–0.06) and in a subsequent pregnancy (RR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.07–0.23), and a bias-adjusted meta-analysis of 10 studies estimated a pooled odds ratio of 0.31 (95% CI, 0.17–0.56) for reduction of sensitization with antenatal regimens. Prophylactic anti-D immune globulin should be offered to unsensitized Rh D-negative women at 28 weeks of gestation, and following a Rh D–positive birth, Rh D-negative women who are not known to be sensitized should receive anti-D immune globulin within 72 hours of delivery.

### Practice bulletin no. 181: prevention of Rh D alloimmunization [^09a32d8b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Prevention of Rh D alloimmunization (Level C) — External cephalic version (regardless of success) is associated with a 2–6% risk of fetal–maternal hemorrhage, and anti-D immune globulin is indicated for unsensitized Rh D-negative patient. It is reasonable to administer anti-D immune globulin to Rh D-negative women who are suspected of molar pregnancy and who undergo uterine evacuation. Although the risk of alloimmunization is low, the consequences can be significant, and administration of Rh D immune globulin should be considered in cases of spontaneous first-trimester miscarriage, especially those that are later in the first trimester. Because of the higher risk of alloimmunization, Rh D-negative women who have instrumentation for their miscarriage should receive Rh D immune globulin prophylaxis. Rh D immune globulin should be given to Rh D-negative women who have pregnancy termination, either medical or surgical. Administration of Rh D immune globulin for all cases of ectopic pregnancy in Rh D-negative women is recommended. Anti-D immune globulin is recommended for Rh D-negative women who experience antenatal hemorrhage after 20 weeks of gestation. Anti-D immune globulin should be administered to Rh D-negative women who have experienced abdominal trauma. Anti-D immune globulin should be administered to Rh D-negative women who experience fetal death in the second or third trimester.

Rh D alloimmunization — weak D phenotype policies and genotyping: The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) recommends that testing for weak D is unnecessary in transfusion recipients, categorizing weak D as Rh D negative for transfusion and, if pregnant, candidates for anti-D immune globulin; however, AABB requires blood donors be assessed for weak D and, if detected, interpreted as Rh D positive to prevent transfusion of Rh D-negative individuals with weak D-positive blood. An approach proposed is molecular genetic RHD typing in weak D phenotype individuals; in serologic weak D type 1, 2, or 3, administration of Rh D immune globulin could be avoided, potentially reducing use by tens of thousands of units per year, but there is a lack of comprehensive cost–benefit analysis, and clinicians are advised to administer Rh D immune globulin to patients with weak D blood type in appropriate clinical situations until further studies are available.

Anti-D immune globulin effect duration and related dosing considerations: The median half-life of anti-D immune globulin is 23 days in the third trimester, and if delivery occurs within 3 weeks of standard antenatal anti-D immune globulin administration the postnatal dose may be obviated. If the results of a Kleihauer–Betke test are positive, an appropriate dose of Rh-immune globulin should be administered.

### Medication abortion up to 70 days of gestation: ACOG practice bulletin, number 225 [^efb1077d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Rh D immune globulin in early medication abortion — Guidelines from ACOG and other societies include recommendations for Rh D immune globulin prophylaxis for Rh D-negative patients undergoing medication abortion within the first 12 weeks of gestation; for patients undergoing medication abortion before 10 weeks of gestation some experts recommend against routine Rh testing and anti-D prophylaxis or advise that forgoing Rh typing and Rh prophylaxis can be considered, yet ACOG recommends Rh D immune globulin prophylaxis for Rh D-negative patients undergoing medication abortion, and when Rh testing and anti-D prophylaxis are not available or would significantly delay medication abortion, shared decision making is recommended.

Potential shortage of anti-D immune globulin — current status and recommendations: Concerns in the 1990s suggested donor numbers might dwindle, but no reports of supply shortages have been published since initial concerns were expressed 20 years ago. Despite these concerns, national guidelines from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada still recommend routine administration of anti-D immune globulin to all Rh D-negative nonsensitized women in the third trimester, within 72 hours of delivery in women giving birth to a Rh-positive infant, or when a sensitizing event occurs (eg, ectopic pregnancy, external cephalic version, or invasive obstetric procedures such as chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis).

Prevention of Rh D alloimmunization — regional prevalence, disease burden without prophylaxis, and impact of immune globulin are detailed: prevalence of Rh D-negative individuals varies "from 5% in India to 15% in North America," and in countries without prophylaxis "14% of affected fetuses are stillborn and one half of live born infants suffer neonatal death or brain injury." The postpartum administration of Rh D immune globulin, "first introduced in the 1970s," "reduced the rate of alloimmunization in at-risk pregnancies from approximately 13–16% to approximately 0.5–1.8%," and "with the addition of routine antepartum administration" the risk "was further reduced to 0.14–0.2%." Despite efficacy, cases still occur "because of failure to follow established protocols."

### Practice bulletin no. 181: prevention of Rh D alloimmunization [^7bd38d67]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Rh D alloimmunization — fetomaternal hemorrhage risks and prophylaxis in pregnancy — are quantified and linked to anti-D immune globulin use. Between 3% and 11% of women with threatened abortion in the first trimester, and approximately 45% giving birth in the third trimester, have a fetal–maternal hemorrhage, and the hemorrhage leading to Rh D alloimmunization can be as small as 0.1 mL or as large as 30 mL. The risk of Rh D alloimmunization is estimated to be 1.5–2% after spontaneous miscarriage and 4–5% after dilation and curettage, and recommendations continue to include administration of anti-D immune globulin after such losses. For ectopic pregnancy, expert advice continues to recommend administration of anti-D immune globulin within 72 hours of suspected breach of the choriodecidual space. Chorionic villus sampling carries a 14% risk of fetal–maternal hemorrhage of 0.6 mL or more and studies support administration of anti-D immune globulin after this procedure. Traditionally, amniocentesis led to a 2–6% rate of fetal–maternal hemorrhage. Other invasive procedures such as cordocentesis warrant anti-D immune globulin prophylaxis, and external cephalic version is associated with a 2–6% risk of fetal-maternal hemorrhage and anti-D immune globulin is indicated for unsensitized Rh D-negative patients.

### Anti-D administration after spontaneous miscarriage for preventing rhesus alloimmunisation [^661276e5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

During pregnancy, a Rhesus-negative (Rh-negative) woman may develop antibodies if her fetus is Rh-positive, which can cause fetal morbidity or mortality in following pregnancies, if untreated.

Objectives

To assess the effects of administering anti-D immunoglobulin (Ig) after spontaneous miscarriage in a Rh-negative woman, with no anti-D antibodies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) in Rh-negative women without antibodies who were given anti-D Ig following spontaneous miscarriage compared with no treatment or placebo treatment following spontaneous miscarriage as control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality. Two review authors extracted data and checked it for accuracy.

Main Results

We included one RCT, involving 48 women who had a miscarriage between eight to 24 weeks of gestation. Of the 19 women in the treatment group, 14 had therapeutic dilatation & curettage (D&C) and five had spontaneous miscarriage; of the 29 women in the control group, 25 had therapeutic D&C and four had spontaneous miscarriage. The treatment group received 300 µg anti-D Ig intramuscular injection and were compared with a control group who received 1 cc homogenous gamma globulin placebo. This review's primary outcomes (development of a positive Kleihauer Betke test (a test that detects fetal cells in the maternal blood; and development of RhD alloimmunisation in a subsequent pregnancy) were not reported in the included study. Similarly, none of the review's secondary outcomes were reported in the included study: the need for increased surveillance for suspected fetal blood sampling and fetal transfusions in subsequent pregnancies, neonatal morbidity such as neonatal anaemia, jaundice, bilirubin encephalopathy, erythroblastosis, prematurity, hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) in subsequent pregnancies, maternal adverse events of anti-D administration including anaphylactic reaction and blood-borne infections. The included study did report subsequent Rh-positive pregnancies in three women in the treatment group and six women in the control group. However, due to the small sample size, the study failed to show any difference in maternal sensitisation or development of Rh alloimmunisation in the subsequent pregnancies.

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient data available to evaluate the practice of anti-D administration in an unsensitised Rh-negative mother after spontaneous miscarriage. Thus, until high-quality evidence becomes available, the practice of anti-D Immunoglobulin prophylaxis after spontaneous miscarriage for preventing Rh alloimmunisation cannot be generalised and should be based on the standard practice guidelines of each country.

Advances in the prevention and treatment of Rh D alloimmunization have been one of the great success stories of modern obstetrics. There is wide variation in prevalence rates of Rh D-negative individuals between regions, for example from 5% in India to 15% in North America (1). However, high birth rates in low prevalence areas means Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn is still an important cause of morbidity and mortality in countries without prophylaxis programs (1). In such countries, 14% of affected fetuses are stillborn and one half of live born infants suffer neonatal death or brain injury (1). The routine use of Rh D immune globulin is responsible for the reduced rate of red cell alloimmunization in more economically developed countries. First introduced in the 1970s, the postpartum administration of Rh D immune globulin reduced the rate of alloimmunization in at-risk pregnancies from approximately 13–16% to approximately 0.5–1.8% (2, 3). The risk was further reduced to 0.14–0.2% with the addition of routine antepartum administration (2, 3). Despite considerable proof of efficacy, there are still a large number of cases of Rh D alloimmunization because of failure to follow established protocols. In addition, there are new data to help guide management, especially with regard to weak D phenotype women. The purpose of this document is to provide evidence-based guidance for the management of patients at risk of Rh D alloimmunization.

### Prevention of RhD alloimmunization: a comparison of four national guidelines [^0fbbb050]. American Journal of Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare national guidelines on the prevention of RhD alloimmunization.

Study Design

We performed a review of four national guidelines on prevention of alloimmunization from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, and The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. We compared the indications/contraindications, timing, dosing, formulation and route of anti-D immune globulin, and management of unique circumstances. The references were compared with regard to the number of randomized control trials, Cochrane Reviews, and systematic reviews/meta-analyses cited.

Results

Variation exists in recommendations on the timing and need for consent prior to routine antenatal anti-D immune globulin administration, prophylaxis for unique circumstances (e.g., threatened abortion < 12 weeks, complete molar pregnancy), and the use of cell-free fetal DNA testing for fetal RhD genotype.

Conclusion

These variations in recommendations reflect the heterogeneity of the literature on the prevention of alloimmunization and highlight the need for synthesis of evidence to create an international guideline on prevention of alloimmunization. This may improve safety, quality, optimize outcomes, and stimulate future trials.

Prevention of Rh D alloimmunization — intrauterine fetal death in the second or third trimester: Because the benefits are thought to outweigh the risk, anti-D immune globulin should be administered to Rh D–negative women who experience fetal death in the second or third trimester, and all such cases should be screened for excessive fetal–maternal hemorrhage at the time of diagnosis of fetal death to determine if additional anti-D immune globulin is required; fetal death occurs in fetal–maternal hemorrhage in up to 13% of cases in which no obvious other cause is found.

Prevention of Rh D alloimmunization — postpartum testing after delivery of a Rh D-positive infant: The risk of excessive fetal–maternal hemorrhage exceeding 30 mL of Rh D-positive fetal whole blood (the amount covered by the standard 300-microgram dose of anti-D immune globulin) at the time of delivery is approximately 2 to 3 per 1,000; screening only pregnancies designated as high risk detects only 50% of patients who require additional anti-D immune globulin. For this reason, it is recommended that all Rh D-negative women giving birth to Rh D-positive infants undergo additional testing initially with a qualitative screening test (such as the rosette assay) and, if indicated, quantitative testing (such as the Kleihauer–Betke test) to determine the number of doses required.

### The continuing burden of Rh disease 50 years after the introduction of anti-Rh (D) immunoglobin prophylaxis: call to action [^6fdac50a]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Severe morbidity and death because of Rh disease have only been reduced by approximately 50% globally during the last 50 years, despite the advent of anti-Rh(D) immunoglobin prophylaxis, which has resulted in > 160,000 perinatal deaths and 100,000 disabilities annually. This apparent failure to take appropriate preventive measures is of great concern. Thus, there is a great need to do much better. We wish to draw attention to the unnecessary continuing burden of Rh disease, to discuss some of the reasons for this failure, and to provide suggestions for a better way forward.

### Is it necessary to administer anti-D to prevent RhD immunization after the transfusion of RhD-positive platelet concentrates? [^92d492d8]. British Journal of Haematology (2000). Low credibility.

Serology for the presence of anti-D after RhD-incompatible platelet transfusions was performed in 24 RhD-negative patients with haematological disease and 59 RhD-negative patients with non-haematological disease. None of the patients were given prophylaxis with anti-D to prevent RhD immunization. Eight out of 59 (13.5%) non-haematology patients developed detectable anti-D, whereas 0 out of 24 (0%) of the haematology patients formed anti-D (P = 0.06). The risk of alloimmunization after RhD-incompatible platelet transfusions using platelet concentrates prepared by modern technical methods appears to be small in patients with haematological disease, but is significant in non-immunocompromised patients.

### Is Rh immune globulin needed in early first-trimester abortion? A review [^12b45285]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

The prophylactic use of Rh immune globulin has been a medical success, protecting women who could be at risk from exposure to the Rh(D) antigen. Thus, it is not surprising that Rh(D) immunoprophylaxis has been extended from women with term pregnancies to all women with miscarriages, abortions, and ectopic pregnancies. In this article we review the existing medical literature to assess the risks of fetomaternal hemorrhage and Rh isoimmunization after complications of a first-trimester pregnancy, induced abortion, or ectopic pregnancy. The evidence to support the use of Rh immune globulin in the first trimester is sparse, but there is theoretic evidence of its necessity. Despite weak evidence to support its use, there is little risk.

### Practice bulletin no. 181: prevention of Rh D alloimmunization [^bbf51ae6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Prevention of Rh D alloimmunization — postpartum screening and dose adjustment: Additional anti-D immune globulin is needed for exposures larger than 30 mL of Rh D-positive fetal whole blood, and rarely, in 2–3 per 1,000 deliveries, a fetal–maternal hemorrhage may be greater than 30 mL; for this reason Rh D-negative women who give birth to Rh D-positive infants should undergo additional testing to assess hemorrhage volume, and it is advised that all women undergo such screening after delivery. Routine screening typically begins with the erythrocyte rosette screen, which can detect greater than 2 mL of fetal whole blood in maternal circulation; a positive rosette test should be followed by Kleihauer–Betke testing or flow cytometry, which is highly sensitive and accurate. In clinical situations not covered by the standard 300 microgram dose (greater than 30 mL of fetal whole blood or 15 mL of fetal red cells) additional vials of Rh immune globulin can be administered.

Despite recommendations, approximately 0.1–0.4% of women at risk become sensitized during pregnancy, with a retrospective New Zealand study finding omission of immune globulin after a recognized sensitizing event in 41% of cases and administration outside recommended guidelines in 13% of cases. An additional small rate (0.1–0.2%) of spontaneous immunization occurs despite adherence, and prophylaxis is not 100% effective.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE RhoGAM is an immune globulin indicated for use in preventing Rh immunization for: The presence of passively acquired anti-D antibodies in the maternal serum may cause a positive antibody screening test. This does not preclude further antepartum or postpartum prophylaxis. A single dose of RhoGAM contains sufficient anti-D to suppress the immune response to up to 15 mL of Rh-positive red blood cells. 7 The anti-D dose is measured by comparison to the RhoGAM in-house reference standard, the potency of which is established relative to the U. S. /World Health Organization/European Pharmacopoeia Standard Anti-D Immunoglobulin Rho Immune Globulin.
8. 12. 2 Pharmacodynamics Use after Rh-Incompatible Transfusion An Rh-negative individual transfused with one unit of Rh-positive red blood cells has about an 80% likelihood of producing anti-D. However, Rh immunization can occur after exposure to < 1 mL of Rh-positive red blood cells.

Protection from Rh immunization is accomplished by administering > 20 μg of RhoGAM per mL of Rh-positive red blood cells within 72 hours of transfusion of incompatible red blood cells. 14, 15, 16. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES Rho Immune Globulin administered at 28 weeks, as well as within 72 hours of delivery, has been shown to reduce the Rh immunization rate to about
0. 1–0. 2%. 15, 16 Clinical studies demonstrated that administration of Rh immune globulin within three hours following pregnancy termination was 100% effective in preventing Rh immunization.
17. A single dose of RhoGAM was shown to suppress anti-D formation after injection of up to
15. 1 mL of Rh-positive red cells. In a companion study, Pollack administered 500 mL of Rh-positive whole blood to 44 Rh-negative male volunteers. Twenty-two subjects received 20 μg RhoGAM per mL of Rh-positive red cells and 22 received no RhoGAM.

None of the RhoGAM-treated subjects developed anti-D; 18/22 control arm subjects developed anti-D 19.

### Rho (D) immune globulin (human) [^869e77d2]. FDA. Low credibility.

Regarding the use of rho(D) immune globulin IM (also known as HyperRHO S/D) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Although Rh0 [D] immune globulin has not been well studied in pregnant women and animal reproduction studies have not been conducted, some of the products are routinely given during pregnancy. Under ideal circumstances, when used to prevent Rh0 [D] isoimmunization from exposure to Rh0[D]-positive blood, Rh0 [D] immune globulin should only be administered to a non-sensitized Rh0 [D]-negative obstetric patient. If there is question about the mother's Rh type or if there is insufficient time to determine fetal Rh typing (as might occur in trauma during pregnancy), then Rh0 [D] immune globulin should be administered as indicated by the clinical situation. Rh0 [D] immune globulin would not be effective in preventing erythroblastosis fetalis in the Rh0 [D]-negative mother who has already formed anti-D IgG antibodies. However, Rh0 [D] negative women who have already been sensitized to the Rh0 [D] erythrocyte factor do not appear to have an increase in adverse reactions if administered the product as a result of unknown Rh status. There is no known obstetric indication for the use of Rh0 [D] immune globulin in women who are Rh0 [D]-positive, as these women are not at risk of isoimmunization from an Rh0 [D]-positive fetus.

Anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis — evidence in Rh-negative patients — lacks randomized trials in pregnant women but shows benefits in observational and experimental data. "The straightforward answer is that no randomized clinical trials to answer that question have been done on pregnant Rh-negative women." In volunteers, "Rh-negative male volunteers were injected with Rh-positive blood, which resulted in 50% immunization." In a Canadian study "of 1,216 Rh-negative patients… receiving anti-D immunoglobulin, there were no cases of immunization at 6 months postpartum," compared with "a 7.3% immunization rate in patients refusing treatment." In a combined Liverpool and Baltimore trial, "58% of patients were treated with anti-D immunoglobulin immediately postpartum and 50% were not," and "The treated patients had a 90% decrease in alloimmunization… when tested at 6 months postpartum." Population-level programs show impact: in the United Kingdom, introduction of "a postpartum rhesus prevention program… in 1969 reduced fetal mortality… from 120 per 100,000 live births to 1.5 per 100,000 by 1989," and "Introduction of antenatal prophylaxis at 28 and/or 34 weeks' gestation reduced the immunization rate another 90%."

### Lessons learnt from many years of experience using anti-D in humans for prevention of RhD immunization and haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn [^de59aca3]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

For 40 years prophylactic anti-D has been given to D-negative women after parturition to prevent haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Monoclonal or recombinant anti-D may provide alternatives to the current plasma-derived polyclonal IgG anti-D, although none of them have yet proved as effective in phase 1 clinical trials. The variation in efficacy of the antibodies may have been influenced by heterogeneity in glycosylation of anti-D produced from different cell lines. Some aspects of the conduct of the human studies, most notably the use of low doses of anti-D and target D positive red cells in vivo, may aid the design of the clinical development of other immunomodulatory drugs in order to minimize adverse effects.

### Management and follow-up of massive fetomaternal hemorrhage requiring high-dose Rh immune globulin: a case report [^2793d7b0]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Massive fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH) is rare and reported to be the cause in approximately 3% of all fetal deaths. Maternal management of massive FMH includes prevention of Rh(D) alloimmunization in Rh(D)-negative mothers by administration of Rh(D) immune globulin (RhIG).

Methods

We describe a case of a 30-year-old O-negative, primigravida woman who presented at 38 weeks of gestation with decreased fetal movements. She underwent an emergency cesarean section and delivered an O-positive baby girl who died shortly after birth.

Results

The patient's FMH screen was positive, with a Kleihauer-Betke test demonstrating 10.7% fetal blood in maternal circulation. The calculated dose of 6,300 µg RhIG was given prior to discharge over 2 days using an intravenous (IV) preparation. Antibody screening a week after discharge showed anti-D and anti-C. The anti-C was attributed to acquired passive immunity from the large dose of RhIG. Anti-C reactivity waned and was negative at 6 months, but the anti-D pattern persisted at 9 months postdelivery. Negative antibody screens were noted at 12 and 14 months.

Conclusions

This case highlights the immunohematology challenges of IV RhIG as well as the success in preventing alloimmunization with IV RhIG given the patient's complete resolution of anti-C and no anti-D formation, with a subsequent healthy pregnancy.

### Cost-benefit analysis of indirect antiglobulin screening in Rh (D)-negative women at 28 weeks of gestation [^5e1a10a3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the potential economic benefit of reduced indirect antiglobulin screening for Rh(D)-negative pregnant women.

Methods

A chart review of all Rh(D)-negative mothers delivering at the University of Washington from 2002 to 2012 was conducted to determine the rate of gestational seroconversion to anti-D antibodies before 28 weeks of gestation. A decision tree was constructed to estimate the economic effects of eliminating the indirect antiglobulin screen at 28 weeks of gestation and instead immunizing all Rh(D)-negative, anti-D antibody-negative women with anti-D immune globulin at that time. A theoretical cohort of 100,000 women was modeled. Probabilities and costs were derived from published literature, chart review, and expert opinion. Univariate sensitivity analyses followed by a Monte Carlo analysis examined assumptions and uncertainties in our model across entire distributions.

Results

The seroconversion rate of development of anti-D antibodies before 28 weeks of gestation in the cohort analyzed was 0.099% (2/2,029 women). From a societal perspective, the expected cost savings from implementing the reduced indirect antiglobulin screening strategy, per 100,000 women, ranged from $6 to $7.7 million. The overall cost savings for implementing this strategy in the United States for 1 year ranged from $34.7 to $35.6 million. This strategy remained cost-beneficial when varying our parameters (eg, anti-D immune globulin, antibody test cost) to their logical extremes. The Monte Carlo analysis verified the cost savings of our strategy.

Conclusion

The updated seroconversion rate and our model suggest that eliminating the 28-week antibody screen would be cost-beneficial from a societal perspective while posing minimal potential harm to the recipients.

3 RECOMMENDATIONS

After summarizing the work of the experts and applying the GRADE methodology, three recommendations were formalized. All recommendations were submitted to the expert group for evaluation using the GRADE method. After a first round of scoring, agreement was reached on 66.6% (2/3) of the recommendations. In the second round of scoring, agreement was reached on the third recommendation, which had been modified following comments made in the first round. For three questions, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low, and two weak recommendations were given. The quality and quantity of the data in the literature were considered insufficient to make a recommendation on the third question.

3.1 Question 1

In a patient who is RhD negative, when the progenitor is RhD positive or unknown, in case of induced or spontaneous abortion before 12 weeks of gestation, does the injection of RhD immune globulin reduce the risk of alloimmunization? (Table S1).

Argumentation

Benefit ofimmune globulin

Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of RhD immune globulin in preventing alloimmunization in the first trimester. A single randomized controlled interventional trial published in 1972 compared administration of RhD immune globulin with no administration of RhD immune globulin. In this previous study of spontaneous abortions, a total of 19 patients (14 with surgical treatment) received prophylaxis (RhD immune globulin μg IM within 72 h) compared with 38 patients (34 with surgical treatment) in the control group. Gestational ages, which were not reported in detail, ranged from eight to 24 weeks of gestation. There were no cases of immunization in this study, but the number of patients involved was small and there was a potential lack of power. There are two other interventional studies, including spontaneous abortion with surgical treatment, that compared administration of RhD immune globulin with no administration. However, these studies contain numerous biases that severely limit the reliability of the results: recruitment bias (RHD phenotype of progenitor not systematically known), selection bias (lack of randomization or randomization not detailed), and detection bias (diagnostic method for alloimmunization not optimal).

### Mechanism of anti-D-mediated immune suppression – a paradox awaiting resolution? [^c8c6129d]. Trends in Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

During pregnancy, women can be immunized by fetal red blood cells (RBCs) of an incompatible blood group. Subsequent transplacental passage of the antibodies can result in fetal morbidity or mortality due to RBC destruction. The administration of anti-D antibodies to D(-) women after delivery of a D(+) infant, and subsequent prevention of Rhesus (Rh) D haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, is the most successful clinical use of antibody-mediated immune suppression. The passive IgG anti-D might prevent immunization to D(+) RBCs by an IgG Fcgamma receptor (Fcgamma R)-dependent mechanism such as crosslinking the D-specific B-cell receptor and inhibitory FcgammaRIIb. However, recent murine studies demonstrate that the suppressive effects of antibodies to heterologous RBCs can be Fcgamma R-independent, suggesting other mechanisms might contribute.

A search for all published and ongoing studies, without restrictions on language or publication status, was performed using the following databases from their inception: EBM Reviews Ovid - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE Ovid (Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily), Embase.com, Popline and Google Scholar. Study types included: randomised controlled trials, controlled trials, cohort and case–control studies from 1971 onwards. The population included women who undergo an abortion (induced, incomplete, spontaneous or septic abortion), medical or surgical < 12 weeks, and isoimmunisation in a subsequent pregnancy. The primary outcomes were: (1) development of a positive Kleihauer–Betke test and (2) development of Rh alloimmunisation in a subsequent pregnancy.

Results

A total of 2652 studies were screened with 105 accessed for full-text review. Two studies have been included with high bias appreciated. Both studies found few women to be sensitised in forming antibodies after an abortion. The limited studies available and heterogeneity prevent the conduction of a meta-analysis.

Conclusions

Rh immunoglobulin has well-documented safety. However, it is not without risks and costs, is a possible barrier to delivering efficient services, and may have limited availability in some countries. The evidence base and quality of studies are currently limited. There is unclear benefit from the recommendation for Rh testing and immunoglobulin administration in early pregnancy. More research is needed as clinical practice guidelines are varied, based on expert opinions and moving away from testing and administration at time of abortion.

Implications

There is limited evidence surrounding medical benefit of Rh testing and immunoglobulin administration in early pregnancy. Further research is needed to define alloimmunisation and immunoglobulin benefit to update standards of care. Additionally, other factors should be considered in forming clinical policies and guidelines such as costs, feasibility and impact on access to care for patients.

### Practice bulletin no. 181: prevention of Rh D alloimmunization [^06d8cf65]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy — alloimmunization has been reported in 24% with ruptured tubal pregnancy, recommended doses up to 12 weeks range from 50 micrograms to 120 micrograms and after 12 weeks 300 micrograms is recommended; one expert group does not recommend anti-D immune globulin for sole medical management but recommends a dose of 50 micrograms for surgical management of unruptured ectopic pregnancy, whereas, until additional data are available, administration for all cases of ectopic pregnancy in Rh D-negative women is recommended.

We decided to address the following three PICO questions with a five‐person working group:

Question 1: In a patient who is RhD negative, when the progenitor is RhD positive or unknown, in case of induced or spontaneous abortion before 12 weeks of gestation, does the injection of RhD immune globulin reduce the risk of alloimmunization?

Question 2: In a patient who is RhD negative, when the progenitor is RhD positive or unknown, in case of bleeding in an ongoing pregnancy before 12 weeks of gestation, does the injection of RhD immune globulin reduce the risk of alloimmunization?

Question 3: In a patient who is RhD negative, when the progenitor is RhD positive or unknown, in case of ectopic pregnancy, does the injection of RhD immune globulin reduce the risk of alloimmunization?

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 200: early pregnancy loss [^9dc9243a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 200 — Level C recommendations for early pregnancy loss specify that accepted treatment options include expectant management, medical treatment, or surgical evacuation, and in women without medical complications or symptoms requiring urgent surgical evacuation, treatment plans can safely accommodate patient treatment preferences; the use of a single preoperative dose of doxycycline is recommended to prevent infection after surgical management; although the risk of alloimmunization is low, the consequences can be significant, and administration of Rh D immune globulin should be considered in cases of early pregnancy loss, especially those that are later in the first trimester; because of the higher risk of alloimmunization, Rh D-negative women who have surgical management of early pregnancy loss should receive Rh D immune globulin prophylaxis.

### A guide to terminology for Rh immunoprophylaxis [^4e7b7760]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Rh immunoprophylaxis for Rh-negative women requires an understanding of terminology used for Rh blood typing laboratory reports. The pathophysiology of Rh hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn was elucidated by studies in rhesus monkeys. Subsequent studies revealed that the human blood group antigen responsible for Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn (D antigen) is related to, but different from, the rhesus monkey antigen. Weak expression of the D antigen on red cells, originally termed D, is currently reported by laboratories as a "serologic weak D phenotype", which can be further defined by RHD genotyping to be either a weak D type or a partial D phenotype. Weak D types 1, 2, or 3 are molecularly defined RHD weak D types, which have an adequate number of intact D antigens to be managed safely as Rh-positive. Partial D phenotypes result from mutations causing loss of one or more D epitopes. Most persons with a partial D phenotype have sufficient D antigen to type as Rh-positive. Some women with a partial D phenotype are detected as serologic weak D phenotypes by routine Rh typing. Whether they type as Rh-positive or serologic weak D phenotype, after being exposed to Rh-positive red cells by transfusion or pregnancy, women with partial D phenotype can form anti-D antibodies and, if they do, are at risk for hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. A pregnant woman with a laboratory report of a serologic weak D phenotype should be further tested for her RHD genotype to resolve whether her case should be managed as Rh-positive or Rh-negative. For more than five decades, the practice of Rh immunoprophylaxis has remained unchanged in terms of the dose of Rh immune globulin and timing of injections. In contrast, advances in the science of Rh blood typing have resulted in a continuously evolving terminology, obliging obstetricians to update their vocabulary to guide their practice. The following review and glossary provide guidance for current Rh terminology and the rationale for changes.

### Practice bulletin no. 181: prevention of Rh D alloimmunization [^f3555a20]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Noninvasive fetal Rh D status assessment with cell-free DNA — accuracy, economics, and current use are as follows: Noninvasive determination of fetal Rh status is now possible through the analysis of cell-free DNA in maternal plasma. Up to 40% of Rh D-negative pregnant women will carry an Rh D-negative fetus, and in this clinical situation, antenatal anti-D immune globulin administration is unnecessary. First-trimester testing has a sensitivity greater than 99% and a specificity of greater than 95%, but inconclusive results range 2–6% and are influenced by race. Despite improved accuracy, cost comparisons with routine anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks have not shown a consistent benefit; four cost analyses found no economic benefit at current test-cost levels, whereas a single report suggested cost effectiveness using a low-cost, high-throughput method. At current costs, noninvasive assessment of fetal Rh D status is not recommended for routine use at present.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for platelet transfusion, more specifically with respect to ABO and RhD matching, ICTMG 2015 guidelines recommend to consider administering Rh immunoglobulin before, immediately after, or within 72 hours of receiving an RhD-positive platelet component (unless antibody testing shows the persistence of anti-D from a previous dose of Rh immunoglobulin) in RhD-negative girls and women of childbearing age/potential with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine statement: RhD immune globulin after spontaneous or induced abortion at less than 12 weeks of gestation [^ebde7735]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the management of first-trimester spontaneous and induced abortion vary in terms of rhesus factor D (RhD) testing and RhD immune globulin (RhIg) administration. These existing guidelines are based on limited data that do not convincingly demonstrate the safety of withholding RhIg for first-trimester abortions or pregnancy losses. Given the adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes associated with RhD alloimmunization, prevention of maternal sensitization is essential in RhD-negative patients who may experience subsequent pregnancies. In care settings in which RhD testing and RhIg administration are logistically and financially feasible and do not hinder access to abortion care, we recommend offering both RhD testing and RhIg administration for spontaneous and induced abortion at < 12 weeks of gestation in unsensitized, RhD-negative individuals. Guidelines for RhD testing and RhIg administration in the first trimester must balance the prevention of alloimmunization with the individual- and population-level harms of restricted access to abortion.

### Rh (D) alloimmunization risk after Rh (D)-incompatible solid organ transplantations in Rh (D)-negative recipients [^4942935a]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Rh(D)-incompatible (Rh-i) solid organ transplantations are not considered for organ matching, but no consensus guidelines exist regarding the need for anti-D immunoglobulin (RhIG) prophylaxis.

Methods

We reviewed 35 Rh(D)-negative patients who had received Rh-i solid organ transplantation. We divided the patients into a RhIG-administered group and a nonadministered group. All patients also underwent an antibody screening test to assess Rh alloimmunization. Graft function was monitored with serum creatinine or bilirubin and kidney or liver biopsy whenever a rejection was suspected. Overall survival was also assessed.

Results

The median (range) age of transplant recipients was 48.5 (4–69) years, and 73.5% of patients were male. Median (range) follow-up time after transplantation was 60 (2–246) months. In the RhIG nonadministered group (n = 16), anti-D was not detected in any of the patients. More rejection episodes occurred in the RhIG-administered group among those undergoing kidney transplant (P = 0.0278).

Conclusions

The low rate of Rh(D) alloimmunization is associated with the immunosuppressive state of the patients. RhIG prophylaxis seems to have no clinical benefit in Rh-i solid organ transplantation.

### Appropriate provision of anti-D prophylaxis to RhD negative pregnant women: a scoping review [^b2897f5c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The included articles offer a glimpse into the management of RhD negative pregnancies in various countries with existing national guidelines. The existing evidence indicates an opportunity for quality improvement in situations where potential sensitizing events are not at routine times in pregnancy, such as miscarriage or fetal demise early in pregnancy. Routine care for the prevention of RhD alloimmunization in pregnancy and postpartum appears to be fairly consistent. The paucity of recent literature in this area leads to a recommendation for further research.

### Emergency transfusion of patients with unknown blood type with blood group O rhesus D positive red blood cell concentrates: a prospective, single-centre, observational study [^7dfac597]. The Lancet: Haematology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency patients with unknown blood type usually receive O Rhesus D negative (RhD-) red blood cell concentrates until their blood group is determined to prevent RhD+ related adverse transfusion reactions. As 85% of individuals are RhD+, this consumption of O RhD- red blood cell concentrates contributes to shortages of O RhD- red blood cell concentrates, sometimes forcing transfusion of known RhD- patients with RhD+ red blood cell concentrates. Here we report the outcome of this transfusion policy transfusing all emergency patients with unknown blood type with O RhD+ red blood cell concentrates.

Methods

In this prospective single-centre observational study done between Jan 1, 2001, and Dec 31, 2015, we assessed all consecutive RhD- patients at the University Medicine Greifswald who received RhD+ red blood cell concentrates (emergency patients with unknown blood type; and RhD- patients receiving RhD+ red blood cell concentrates during RhD- red blood cell concentrate shortages). No patients were excluded. The primary endpoint was anti-D allo-immunisation at 2 months follow-up or later. Patients were followed up and tested for immunisation against red blood cell antigens using the direct antiglobulin test and an antibody screen every 3–5 days for 4 weeks or until death, or hospital discharge. Surviving patients were screened for development of anti-D antibodies for up to 12 months (at the predefined timepoints 2, 3, 6, and 12 months) after RhD+ red blood cell transfusion.

Findings

437 emergency patients, of whom 85 (20%) were RhD-, received 2836 RhD+ red blood cell concentrates. The overall risk of inducing anti-D antibodies (in all 437 recipients) was 17 (4%, 95% CI 2·44–6·14) of 437 (assuming all patients lost to follow-up developed anti-D allo-immunisation). During this period, 110 known RhD- patients received RhD+ red blood cell concentrates during RhD- red blood cell concentrate shortages. Of these, 29 (26%; 95% CI 19·0–35·3) developed anti-D allo-immunisation (assuming all patients lost to follow-up developed anti-D), which was significantly higher than in the emergency patients with unknown blood type (p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

Transfusing emergency patients with unknown blood type with O RhD+ red blood cell concentrates has a low risk of inducing anti-D antibodies (3–6%), but saves more than 10% of the total O RhD- red blood cell concentrate demand, thereby reducing shortage of O RhD- red blood cell concentrates, the need to transfuse known RhD-patients with RhD+ red blood cell concentrates, and thus the overall risk to induce anti-D allo-immunisation in the population. These findings should be considered for transfusion guidelines.

### Rho (D) immune globulin shortages [^156a915e]. ACOG (2024). High credibility.

Rho(D) immune globulin (RhIg) shortage triage — American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) strategies for consideration — In locations where shortages persist despite attempts to secure the product from the four manufacturers, ACOG offers prioritization and conservation strategies for consideration that include confirming neonatal Rh(D) status from umbilical cord blood before administering routine postpartum RhIg, avoiding administering RhIg in Rh(D)-sensitized patients, and, if paternity is certain and the father or sperm donor is known to be Rh(D)-negative, that antenatal prophylaxis is unnecessary. Although current ACOG guidance does not recommend routine use of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to determine fetal Rh(D) status, the use of NIPT to prioritize use of RhIg and conserve supply is a reasonable consideration, and if cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing results confirm an Rh(D)-negative fetus, RhIg would not need to be routinely administered in the antepartum period (for bleeding, abortion, pregnancy loss, or at 28 weeks of gestation). For routine RhIg prophylaxis, prioritize postpartum patients (if indicated), and if additional supply is available, continue to administer the 28-week antepartum dose as well; this approach has been used in the past and shows a reduction in alloimmunization while maximizing conservation of available RhIg. Prioritization of other indications will depend on local specifics, but in general, priority may be given to patients at later gestational durations, and in situations without shortages, ACOG continues to recommend RhIg for indications as noted in existing guidance.

### Society of Family Planning committee consensus on Rh testing in early pregnancy [^d8d3a684]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

Rh immunoglobulin product, timing, and dosing intervals — Rh immunoglobulin is an antibody derived from pooled human plasma extracted from Rh-negative individuals who were born male and have been immunized to the RhO(D) antigen through exposure to the Rh-positive blood, and its mechanism in Rh-negative pregnant individuals is not completely understood but is dose dependent with optimal dosing as close as possible to exposure. Initial studies used a 72hour window due to a study design that did not include weekend visits, although some efficacy is believed to continue even weeks after the bleeding event, and monoclonal extract is not effective and synthetic Rh immunoglobulin is not clinically available. Detection of passive anti-D after administration is dose dependent, and to maintain passively acquired anti-D after repeated events that may lead to fetomaternal hemorrhage and sensitization, we recommend a dosing interval corresponding to dose volume: per event for 50 mcg, 6 weeks for 100 mcg, and 12 weeks for 300 mcg.

### Rh immune globulin after the transfusion of RhD-positive blood in a patient with a partial D antigen [^98c5c04e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with a serologic weak D phenotype may demonstrate variable RhD expression. We present a case in which clinical management would have been simplified if RHD genotyping had been performed previously.

Case

A 33-year-old patient, G11P4155, presented with an incomplete miscarriage and was transfused RhD-positive packed red blood cells after typing RhD-positive. The patient had been historically typed RhD-negative by a different testing methodology. Indirect antiglobulin testing was performed, which revealed a serologic weak D phenotype. The patient was given 9,600 micrograms of Rh immune globulin. Molecular testing revealed a partial D antigen, which was originally thought to be at risk for alloimmunization; however, this has since been disproven.

Conclusion

Although not yet universal practice, prenatal RHD genotyping for partial D antigen could have prevented the characterization of this patient as RhD-positive at the time of transfusion.

### Appropriate provision of anti-D prophylaxis to RhD negative pregnant women: a scoping review [^3fef6164]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

RhD alloimmunization can lead to Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN) or in severe cases fetal demise. This can occur if an RhD negative pregnant woman has a sensitizing event during her pregnancy that causes the development of anti-D antibodies. These antibodies work to destroy fetal red blood cells.

The prophylaxis for the prevention of RhD alloimmunization was developed in the 1960s. Since its discovery, anti-D immunoglobulin has remained the gold standard in the prevention of RhD alloimmunization and consequently HDFN. However, this is under debate in the current literature. Anti-D immunoglobulin is a blood product given to RhD negative pregnant women during pregnancy and after delivery. According to various guidelines, RhD negative women receive the prophylaxis at 28 weeks (and again at 34 weeks if the guideline indicates a two dose regime) and again after the delivery of an RhD positive fetus. Outside of routine provision, RhD negative pregnant women can receive anti-D immunoglobulin during pregnancy when potential sensitizing events occur. A list of potential sensitizing events can be found in an additional file (see Additional file 1). Since the development of anti-D immunoglobulin, the rate of RhD alloimmunization and its consequences has been significantly reduced but the cited RhD alloimmunization rate remains at 6.7/1000 live births, which leaves room for improvement.

In 2012, two retrospective studies were published that examined the delivery of anti-D immunoglobulin to RhD negative pregnant women in appropriate clinical situations within emergency departments. These two studies found that in certain clinical situations the delivery of anti-D immunoglobulin to RhD negative pregnant women was suboptimal. The recent emergence of these two studies led the authors of this review to question whether more research exists on the provision of prophylaxis to RhD negative pregnant women and if there are settings besides emergency departments that contribute to the RhD alloimmunization rate of 6.7/1000 births.

The purpose of this scoping review is to explore the literature on the provision of anti-D prophylaxis to RhD negative pregnant women in appropriate clinical situations in various healthcare settings. The hypothesis is that RhD negative pregnant women receive anti-D immunoglobulin in routine situations, such as within 72 hours after birth, but in situations of potential sensitizing events, such as miscarriage or fetal demise, anti-D immunoglobulin may not always be provided correctly or at all. To date, a knowledge synthesis has not been conducted on this topic.

### Practice bulletin no. 181: prevention of Rh D alloimmunization [^d0e88358]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Prevention of Rh D alloimmunization — effect of prophylaxis and current U.S. practice: Postpartum prophylaxis with a single dose given to susceptible Rh D-negative women within 72 hours of delivery reduced the rate of Rh D alloimmunization by 80–90%. Asymptomatic fetal–maternal hemorrhage in the third trimester triggered alloimmunization in 2% of at-risk women before delivery, but routine antenatal administration at 28 weeks of gestation reduced this to less than 0.2%. Current practice administers a single antenatal dose of 300 micrograms at 28 weeks of gestation followed by a second dose after birth when the newborn is Rh D positive, and this approach is associated with less than a 0.2% rate of Rh alloimmunization.

### Postpartum Rh immunoprophylaxis [^bc9b09ba]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

The postpartum dose of Rh immune globulin varies according to an individual laboratory estimation of fetal red blood cells in each mother's peripheral blood. In the United States, a four-step procedure determines the postpartum dose (number of vials of 300 micrograms; 1,500 international units) of Rh immune globulin (anti-D) for each RhD-negative mother who has delivered an RhD-positive newborn and has not already formed anti-D. The first step is a rosette fetal red blood cell screen to determine whether an excessive (greater than 30 mL fetal whole blood) fetomaternal hemorrhage occurred. If the rosette screen is negative, the mother receives one vial of Rh immune globulin for Rh immunoprophylaxis. If the rosette screen is positive, the blood sample is retested by a quantitative method, typically an acid-elution (Kleihauer-Betke) assay. The result of the acid-elution assay is converted to an estimation of the volume of the fetomaternal hemorrhage, which is the basis for calculating the dose of Rh immune globulin. The acid-elution assay is subjective, imprecise, and poorly reproducible. As a result, the formula for calculating the dose includes a precautionary adjustment, adding an extra vial in borderline situations to prevent underdosing. Flow cytometry is a more precise method for quantifying a fetomaternal hemorrhage. However, few hospitals use flow cytometry, because it is not cost-effective to maintain an expensive, high-technology laboratory service for the relatively few occasions when a precise quantitative determination of fetomaternal hemorrhage is required.

### Prevention of RhD alloimmunization in the first trimester of pregnancy: clinical practice guidelines of the French college of obstetricians and gynecologists [^2b5dadf3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The French College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has decided to update its clinical practices guidelines for preventing RhD alloimmunization in the first trimester of pregnancy. The quality of evidence of the literature was assessed following the GRADE methodology with questions formulated in the Patients, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) format and outcomes defined a priori and classified according to their importance. An extensive bibliographic search was performed using Pubmed, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases. The quality of evidence was assessed (high, moderate, low, very low) and a recommendation was formulated: strong, weak, or no recommendation. The recommendations were reviewed in two rounds by members of the scientific board of the French College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (Delphi survey) in order to select the consensus recommendations. The three recommendations from the PICO questions were agreed upon through the use of the Delphi method. It is not recommended to administer RhD immune globulin before 12 weeks of gestation to reduce the risk of alloimmunization in the event of induced or spontaneous abortion in RhD‐negative patients when the progenitor is RhD‐positive or unknown (weak recommendation, very low‐quality evidence). It is not recommended to administer RhD immune globulin before 12 weeks of gestation to reduce the risk of alloimmunization in the event of bleeding (weak recommendation, very low‐quality evidence). The quality and quantity of literature data are insufficient to determine whether injection of RhD immune globulin can reduce the risk of alloimmunization in ectopic pregnancy, so no recommendation could be made.

### Fetal-maternal hemorrhage detected by sudden disappearance of Rh immune globulin-related anti-D [^77a59077]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fetal-maternal hemorrhage is usually spontaneous and goes undetected but can be associated with adverse perinatal outcomes.

Case

We describe the detection of a fetal-maternal hemorrhage by abrupt disappearance of prophylactic anti-D on antibody screen in an Rh-negative mother with dichorionic twins admitted for atrial flutter of one twin. Both rosette and Kleihauer-Betke tests were positive. The diagnosis was confirmed by anemia in one twin at birth.

Conclusion

Fetal-maternal hemorrhage requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis. An unexpected sudden decline in Rh immune globulin-related anti-D may be an indication of fetal-maternal hemorrhage.

### Prevention of RhD alloimmunization in the first trimester of pregnancy: clinical practice guidelines of the French college of obstetricians and gynecologists [^9348e98c]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSION

Although the quality of evidence from the literature is very low, it is recommended that RhD immune globulin not be administered in case of induced or spontaneous abortion or bleeding before 12 weeks of gestation to reduce the risk of alloimmunization. However, the quality and quantity of literature data was insufficient to determine whether injection of RhD immune globulin can reduce the risk of alloimmunization in ectopic pregnancy and no recommendation can be made.

### Do Rh-negative women with first trimester spontaneous abortions need Rh immune globulin? [^46673e0c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether literature supports the use of Rh immune globulin in Rh-negative women with first trimester spontaneous abortions to prevent maternal sensitization to the fetal Rh antigen and subsequent fetal morbidity and mortality.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (1966–2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE (1990 to 2005), and the reference sections of the articles found. The search is considered updated to December of 2005. Search terms included vaginal bleeding, Rh negative, Rh immune globulin, RhoGAM, isoimmunization, sensitization, first trimester pregnancy, threatened, and spontaneous abortion.

Results

The evidence to support the use of Rh immune globulin for a diagnosis of first trimester spontaneous abortion is minimal. There is a paucity of well-designed research that examines maternal sensitization or hemolytic disease of the newborn as an outcome in patients receiving, versus not receiving, Rh immune globulin in first trimester bleeding. There is significant evidence to demonstrate fetomaternal hemorrhage in first trimester spontaneous abortions; yet, no studies demonstrate subsequent maternal sensitization or development hemolytic disease in the fetus as a result of this hemorrhage.

Conclusion

In summary, there is minimal evidence that administering Rh immune globulin for first trimester vaginal bleeding prevents maternal sensitization or development of hemolytic disease of the newborn. The practice of administering Rh immune globulin to Rh-negative women with a first trimester spontaneous abortion is based on expert opinion and extrapolation from experience with fetomaternal hemorrhage in late pregnancy. Its use for first trimester bleeding is not evidence-based.

### Appropriate provision of anti-D prophylaxis to RhD negative pregnant women: a scoping review [^2f1adac2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

The studies included in this review span twenty-two years, the earliest study dating back to 1992. The last ten years has seen only six studies addressing this topic despite recent guideline development and implementation. These five studies (and one review) continue to find opportunities for improved management of RhD negative pregnancies, particularly in situations for which sensitizing events occur. Guidelines on the prevention of RhD alloimmunization do not provide strong recommendations for situations involving sensitizing events, particularly in the first trimester. This is a result of a paucity of evidence regarding the effectiveness of anti-D immunoglobulin in the first trimester after a sensitizing event. This lack of evidence is one of the reasons guidelines are lacking strong recommendations. Consequently, the delivery of anti-D immunoglobulin continues to be problematic and quality improvement remains suboptimal.

Few studies provide recommendations for an improvement in the delivery of anti-D immunoglobulin. The most recent Canadian study suggests that improved communication and patient education for RhD negative pregnant women would potentially improve adherence. The same study suggests that a checklist system, such as the one described in the results section discussing post-natal administration of anti-D immunoglobulin would be helpful in antenatal situations. A team-based approach involving nurses with specific checklists in place and/or a clinic specific to the administration of anti-D immunoglobulin are other recommendations put forth by Koby et al. These suggestions need to be integrated into the management of RhD negative pregnancies both in hospital and primary care settings. These interventions need to be evaluated for effectiveness and quality improvement.

Conclusions

In conclusion, healthcare providers must prioritize the management of high-risk pregnancies in Rh-negative women. Standardizing protocols for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up is essential. Improving prenatal monitoring and management, maintaining an adequate blood supply, and administering anti-D immunoglobulin are vital steps to safeguarding the health of both the mother and the infant.

### FIGO / ICM guidelines for preventing rhesus disease: a call to action [^03186df8]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The introduction of anti‐Rh(D) immunoglobulin more than 50 years ago has resulted in only a 50% decrease in Rhesus disease globally owing to a low uptake of this prophylactic approach. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, International Confederation of Midwives, and Worldwide Initiative for Rhesus Disease Eradication have reviewed current evidence regarding the utility of anti‐Rh(D) immunoglobulin. Taking into account the effectiveness anti‐Rh(D), the new guidelines propose adjusting the dose for different indications and prioritizing its administration by indication.

### Rhesus isoimmunisation in unsensitised RhD-negative individuals seeking abortion at less than 12 weeks' gestation: a systematic review [^58c2ea4d]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

The administration of rhesus (Rh) immunoglobulin was first introduced in 1968 and significantly reduced immunisation to D-antigen. Evidence is sparse for such intervention after abortion in early pregnancy. Abortion for the purposes of this review included induced (medical or surgical), incomplete, missed, spontaneous or septic abortion at less than 12 weeks' gestation.

There is a movement to forgo Rh testing and anti-D immunoglobulin administration in people presenting for early abortion, miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. For example, the 2019 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on abortion recommend not offering anti-D prophylaxis to people undergoing medical abortion up to and including 10 weeks' gestation. Rationales to forgo Rh testing and anti-D immunoglobulin administration include lack of evidence that anti-D immunoglobulin prevents Rh alloimmunisation in lower gestational ages and immunoglobulin administration is not without risk as it is a blood product with added costs and care complexity. For example, added costs and complexity include testing patient blood type and cold storage required for anti-D immunoglobulin.

A systematic review by Karanth et al (2013) examined anti-D administration after spontaneous miscarriage for preventing Rh alloimmunisation with the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. Karanth et al concluded there is insufficient evidence available to evaluate the current practices of anti-D administration in unsensitised RhD-negative mothers after spontaneous miscarriage.

To date, there has been one systematic review examining subsequent isoimmunisation after abortion at less than 13+6 weeks' gestation in 2019. In preparation for updating the World Health Organization (WHO) 2012 Safe Abortion guidelines, the objective of the review was to systematically review the effect of routine anti-D administration among unsensitised RhD-negative individuals who have an abortion.

### A clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnancy alloimmunized to red blood cell antigens [^534fd6bf]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy alloimmunization guideline — introduction outlines that RhD predominates in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn and that prophylaxis with Rh immune globulin at 28 weeks of gestation and again after delivery is effective though not fail‑safe. It highlights evolving trauma practices using low‑titer, O+ whole blood (LTOWB) without rapid typing, placing D‑negative female trauma patients at risk of exposure to D‑positive red blood cells with alloimmunization occurring in approximately 20% of such patients. It also notes that in 2024 multiple organizations initiated guideline development focused on D‑negative female children, adolescent girls, and women aged 15 to 49 years at risk of red blood cell alloimmunization due to exposure to LTOWB.

### Is the incidence of fetal-to-maternal hemorrhage increased in patients with third-trimester bleeding? [^d9ecfc7e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

If a pregnancy is complicated by third-trimester bleeding, is there a higher risk of fetal-to-maternal hemorrhage that might necessitate the administration of additional anti-D immune globulin to prevent alloimmunization in the patient who is Rh D-negative? The study objective was to analyze prospectively the incidence of fetal-to-maternal hemorrhage in pregnancies that were complicated by third trimester bleeding compared with three control groups.

Study Design

Pregnancies that were complicated by third-trimester bleeding, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, and preterm labor were identified prospectively on admission. A group of preterm patients with no complications was also collected prospectively. Patients with any history and/or clinical evidence of trauma were excluded. Kleihauer-Betke tests were performed with all patients, and the results were blinded until study completion. Sample size calculations were performed to determine the minimum number of cases needed in each group.

Results

A total of 403 patients were collected during the study period: 91 patients had third-trimester bleeding, 101 patients had preterm premature rupture of the membranes, 116 patients had preterm labor, and 95 patients were in the no complication group. There was no statistical difference identified in the Kleihauer-Betke test results between any of the study groups.

Conclusion

The incidence of fetal-to-maternal hemorrhage does not appear to be increased in pregnancies that are complicated by third-trimester bleeding when compared to noncomplicated control subjects or to other obstetrically complicated pregnancies. This information would suggest that the routine administration of additional anti-D immune globulin (beyond the current recommended protocol) to women who are Rh D-negative whose pregnancies are complicated by third-trimester bleeding is not indicated.

### Appropriate provision of anti-D prophylaxis to RhD negative pregnant women: a scoping review [^41fe6790]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Research

The retrospective cohort methodology is an appropriate method in researching the use of anti-D immunoglobulin in clinical settings. It would be helpful to have more studies utilizing population-based data, large multi-center studies involving prospective approaches or retrospective approaches, and more studies in Canada, Australia, and the US. Further research is required to understand the factors associated with suboptimal provision of anti-D immunoglobulin in situations where potential sensitizing events occur. As Koby et al. suggest, errors of omission can occur in situations where the decisions are physician-dependent. However, only one study provided the factors involved in the omission of or late administration of anti-D immunoglobulin. The factors involved poor documentation, misinterpretation of laboratory results, issues with storage of the prophylaxis, and communication between departments. In addition, a better understanding of women's knowledge and experiences with RhD negative pregnancies and its possible implications would provide further insight into RhD alloimmunization. Once there is a basic understanding interventions may be developed and trialed for effectiveness.

Limitations

The limitations of this scoping review lie within the literature retrieved and included. The studies included span across several decades with the first article published in 1992. In addition, these included studies have been conducted in four different countries. The majority of articles were conducted in the UK. This means that the results of these studies are not necessarily generalizable across various countries, amongst varying clinical guidelines, with current clinical guidelines, and within different settings. Due to these limitations conducting a further systematic review of the literature is not recommended.
