## Question

Adequate urine output in heart failure exacerbation diuresis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what constitutes adequate urine output during diuresis for acute decompensated heart failure and how to operationalize it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why "adequate" matters. Then, I should verify what major guidelines and high-quality trials actually recommend. Next, I will examine the evidence for early urine output thresholds and how they relate to natriuresis. After that, I need to check how these metrics integrate with clinical decongestion and safety, including renal function considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, time-based target and outline escalation strategies and exceptions, making sure I cite the best available sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why "adequate" diuresis matters. In acute decompensated heart failure, the primary goal is to relieve congestion and restore euvolemia; inadequate early diuresis is associated with persistent congestion, longer length of stay, and worse outcomes, whereas overly aggressive diuresis can precipitate prerenal azotemia, so I need to balance effectiveness with safety and not jump to conclusions based on a single number without context [^eac07302] [^cb0029b2] [^b252c856].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance on how to judge diuretic response. The ESC Heart Failure Association recommends early assessment of diuretic response within hours using either spot urinary sodium or urine output, with a practical threshold of urine output greater than 100–150 mL/h during the first 6 hours after the initial intravenous loop diuretic dose indicating an adequate response, and spot urinary sodium greater than 50–70 mEq/L at 2 hours suggesting effective natriuresis; if these are not met, escalation is reasonable, so I should keep both metrics in mind rather than relying on urine output alone [^d8a273eb] [^13c90553] [^ca34dfd5].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence behind those thresholds. Observational cohorts and meta-analyses show that lower urine sodium or lower early urine output predicts longer length of stay, diuretic resistance, and worse outcomes, and that natriuresis-guided strategies can increase natriuresis and diuresis without clear increases in adverse events, though randomized outcome data are still maturing; nonetheless, the balance of evidence supports using early urine output of about 100–150 mL/h and/or spot urinary sodium above 50–70 mEq/L at 2 hours to identify responders and guide titration [^533cacb7] [^7f50c60e] [^cb07209e] [^09eeaa13].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single static target. I need to ensure these metrics are integrated with clinical decongestion and safety. Guidelines emphasize titrating diuretics to relieve signs of congestion, accepting modest, transient creatinine rises if decongestion is achieved, and using daily weights and strict intake-output tracking to avoid both under- and over-diuresis; importantly, small to moderate increases in creatinine during effective decongestion are often hemodynamic and not due to tubular injury, so I should confirm congestion status before down-titrating for a creatinine bump [^eac07302] [^cb0029b2] [^2d6eae16] [^177592d3].

> I should double-check how to translate this into a practical, time-based target. A reasonable operational definition of "adequate" early diuresis is urine output exceeding 100–150 mL/h for the first 6 hours after the initial IV loop diuretic dose, with reassessment at 2–6 hours using spot urinary sodium to corroborate natriuresis; if urine output is below 100 mL/h and/or spot urinary sodium is below about 50–70 mEq/L at 2 hours, I should escalate the loop diuretic dose or add a second agent, and if the response remains inadequate after 24–48 hours, I should consider dual nephron blockade or adjuncts such as acetazolamide or SGLT2 inhibition in appropriate patients [^d8a273eb] [^ca34dfd5] [^cc6dcbe2] [^ae4b67c2].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk for diuretic resistance or has CKD? I need to check for modifiers. Lower eGFR, chronic loop diuretic use, and higher neurohormonal activation blunt natriuretic response, so the same urine output threshold may be harder to achieve; in such cases, earlier combination therapy, closer monitoring of electrolytes and renal function, and consideration of natriuresis-guided equations or phenotyping tools like the BAN-ADHF score can help individualize dosing and anticipate resistance, while remembering that fractional excretion of sodium may better reflect true natriuretic response in CKD than spot sodium concentration alone [^8a6aeeea] [^c48c599f] [^8bbe1125].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Adequate urine output in heart failure exacerbation diuresis is best framed as an early, dynamic target of more than 100–150 mL/h for the first 6 hours after IV loop diuretic administration, interpreted alongside spot urinary sodium at 2 hours and, most importantly, clinical evidence of decongestion; if these are not met, prompt escalation is warranted, and if they are met, I should continue to reassess daily to avoid both residual congestion and excessive fluid removal, aligning with contemporary guideline and trial-based practice [^d8a273eb] [^eac07302] [^cb07209e].

---

Adequate urine output during heart failure exacerbation diuresis is **100–150 mL/hour for the first 6 hours** [^d8a273eb] after IV loop diuretics, which corresponds to about 2.4–3.6 L in 24 hours. This target balances effective decongestion with renal safety; outputs below 100 mL/hour suggest diuretic resistance and should prompt escalation [^d8a273eb] [^eac07302]. Persistent low output despite dose escalation warrants adding a thiazide or acetazolamide [^cc6dcbe2] [^ca34dfd5], and SGLT2 inhibitors can be considered to enhance diuresis and reduce loop diuretic requirements [^e9ef3d8c] [^ac318f0f]. Monitor renal function and electrolytes closely, as transient creatinine rises are acceptable if decongestion is achieved [^177592d3] [^2d6eae16].

---

## Clinical targets for urine output

- **Initial target**: 100–150 mL/hour for the first 6 hours after IV loop diuretics [^d8a273eb] [^ca34dfd5].
- **24-hour target**: approximately 2.4–3.6 L, adjusted to patient size and congestion severity.
- **Minimum acceptable**: 100 mL/hour; below this, consider diuretic resistance and escalate therapy [^d8a273eb].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting urine output targets

- **ESC guidance**: spot urine sodium > 50–70 mEq/L at 2 hours or urine output > 100–150 mL/hour indicates adequate response; lower values suggest resistance and guide escalation [^d8a273eb] [^13c90553].
- **ROSE-AHF**: lower urine sodium correlated with longer length of stay and worse outcomes, supporting early natriuresis assessment and escalation when low [^09eeaa13] [^7a7e2a7c].
- **Meta-analysis**: natriuresis-guided strategies increase natriuresis and diuresis without excess adverse events, supporting proactive titration [^b42e6358] [^7f50c60e].

## Factors influencing adequacy of urine output

Several factors influence diuretic response and the **adequacy of urine output**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on urine output** |
|-|-|
| Renal function | Lower eGFR reduces diuretic response and may require higher doses or combination therapy [^8a6aeeea] [^b4541870] |
| Baseline diuretic use | Chronic loop diuretic use causes diuretic resistance and blunts response [^89618c88] [^48b65306] |
| Congestion severity | Severe congestion may require more aggressive diuresis and combination therapy [^cc6dcbe2] [^ca34dfd5] |
| Blood pressure | Hypotension limits diuretic efficacy and may necessitate vasopressor support [^7e998718] [^cf476109] |
| Electrolyte disturbances | Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic alkalosis impair diuretic response and require correction [^b4541870] |

---

## Clinical consequences of inadequate urine output

Inadequate urine output during diuresis is associated with:

- **Persistent congestion**: linked to higher readmission and mortality [^f38c27af] [^cb0029b2].
- **Longer hospital stay**: lower urine sodium/output predicts prolonged LOS [^09eeaa13] [^7a7e2a7c].
- **Worse outcomes**: poor natriuretic response independently predicts mortality [^89618c88] [^17c2a657].

---

## Strategies to achieve adequate urine output

When urine output is inadequate, **clinicians should**:

- **Escalate loop diuretic dose**: double the dose or increase frequency (up to every 8–12 hours) [^0dacd237] [^63dd7050].
- **Add combination therapy**: thiazide-type diuretic (e.g. metolazone) or acetazolamide to overcome resistance [^cc6dcbe2] [^ca34dfd5].
- **Consider SGLT2 inhibitors**: early empagliflozin or dapagliflozin increases urine output and diuretic efficiency without harming renal function [^e9ef3d8c] [^ac318f0f].
- **Monitor and correct electrolytes**: hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis impair response and should be corrected [^b4541870].

---

## Risks associated with excessive urine output

Excessive diuresis can cause:

- **Worsening renal function**: transient creatinine rises are common but often acceptable if decongestion is achieved [^177592d3] [^2d6eae16].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia require monitoring and replacement [^b4541870].
- **Hypotension**: volume depletion can cause hypotension and organ hypoperfusion, especially in patients with autonomic dysfunction or vasodilatory states [^b4541870].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of diuretic therapy

Continuous monitoring and adjustment are essential to balance decongestion with safety:

- **Frequent assessment**: check urine output every 6 hours initially, then daily once stable.
- **Daily weights and clinical signs**: track edema, JVP, and lung exam to gauge decongestion [^0dacd237].
- **Laboratory monitoring**: check renal function and electrolytes daily during active diuresis [^notfound].
- **Individualized targets**: tailor goals to patient size, congestion severity, and comorbidities [^eac07302].

---

Adequate urine output during heart failure exacerbation diuresis is **100–150 mL/hour for the first 6 hours**, with escalation if below 100 mL/hour. This target aligns with natriuresis-guided strategies and balances decongestion with renal safety; persistent inadequate response warrants combination therapy and close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes [^d8a273eb] [^eac07302].

Diuretic therapy (Figure 6) — in hospitalized heart failure, initiate IV loop diuretics early (ED or immediately after admission) with an initial dose usually 1–2.5 times total daily oral loop diuretic agent in furosemide equivalents, and prescribe IV diuretics every 8–12 hrs or continuous while measuring daily weights and urine output and monitoring vital signs and congestion; consider addition of SGLT inhibitors for chronic therapy and consider adjunct diuretic agent such as acetazolamide. For Adequate diuresis, continue diuretics with target relief of congestion and plan for transition to oral therapy. For Inadequate diuresis, usually increase loop diuretic agent dose by 50%-100% and consider other thiazides or additional diuretic agents. For Refractory to diuretics, change course by escalating diuretics, considering additional diuretic agents or other decongestion strategies, and consider hemodynamic monitoring to guide therapy.

### Urinary sodium analysis: the key to effective diuretic titration? European journal of heart failure expert consensus document [^13c90553]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with heart failure, neurohumoral activation leads to increased renal sodium avidity across the entire renal tubules, resulting in a positive sodium and water balance, leading to decompensated heart failure requiring intravenous diuretics. As the dose of diuretic therapy required to achieve euvolaemia is difficult to estimate due to considerable intra- and interindividual differences, the European Society of Cardiology recommends assessment of the diuretic response within hours either via evaluation of the urinary sodium concentration or via urinary volume after initial diuretic administration. All diuretic agents enhance sodium excretion to a different extent depending on their side of action across the renal tubules, and renal adaptation mechanisms due to neurohumoral stimulation. Impaired sodium excretion, even in the presence of fluid loss, is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Therefore, assessing urinary sodium excretion is considered a good and direct marker of the diuretic efficacy. Such natriuresis-guided protocols have been tested prospectively by the Pragmatic Urinary Sodium-based algoritHm in Acute Heart Failure and the Efficacy of a Standardized Diuretic Protocol in Acute Heart Failure study, both demonstrating increased natriuresis and diuresis. Moreover, the Readily Available Urinary Sodium Analysis in Patients with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure study has demonstrated that a nurse-led natriuresis-guided protocol is feasible through the use of a point-of-care urinary sodium sensor, allowing an immediately readable urinary sodium result, enabling fast changes in diuretic therapy. This review summaries the rationale, current evidence and gaps supporting the role of urinary sodium concentration in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

Diuresis for hospitalized patients with acute decompensated heart failure is a routine clinical practice but one that remains reliant on error-prone and resource-intensive intake and output and weight measurements and is subject to wide provider variation. We sought to use quality improvement approaches to implement a data-driven predictive diuresis protocol based on natriuresis using the electronic health record to titrate dosing. Our initiative did not result in significant reductions in length of stay but did demonstrate a significant increase in the use of urine studies to guide diuresis and signals toward more aggressive diuretic dosing without an increase in adverse outcomes.

### Spot urinary sodium as a biomarker of diuretic response in acute heart failure [^533cacb7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ESC recommendations are attractive because the traditional assessment of diuretic response and diuretic therapy guided by fluid‐based metrics involves a combination of symptoms and signs, such as weight loss and urine volume output, to evaluate treatment. This response has shown to be inaccurate or logistically challenging to obtain and may, in part, delay the diuretic titration because these reevaluations are usually possible after 24 hours. According to observational studies, the early UNa‐guided assessment of the diuretic response in the first hours, if protocolized and correctly interpreted, may help to tailor the intensity of diuretic therapy. Indeed, a recent systematic review and meta‐analysis concluded that high UNa after diuretic administration is associated with higher urinary output, greater weight loss, shorter length of stay, and lower odds of death. However, there are several differences between studies, mainly including different time points and cutoffs for defining low UNa (between < 50 and < 89), or different units of measurement. The timing of UNa assessment has not been homogeneous between studies, varying most of them between 2 hours to 6 hours post‐diuretic treatment, and even in others measuring baseline values immediately after entering an emergency department before and not after diuretic infusion.

### Clinical importance of urinary sodium excretion in acute heart failure [^24f5361c]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The treatment of acute heart failure (AHF) has not changed over the last decades and is focused on the alleviation of congestion, volume overload, and shortening the time spent in hospital. 1, 2 As compared with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, prognosis of patients admitted for worsening heart failure is extremely poor, with almost 30–40% of patients dying within the first year, and a substantial number is rehospitalized for heart failure shortly after discharge.

Despite current treatment with loop diuretics, vasodilators and oxygen, 25% of patients with AHF still have residual signs of congestion at discharge. 3 Most of the decongestion that is achieved during hospitalization is actually achieved early after admission, with the effect of therapy decreasing in subsequent days. While loop diuretics are the most important drugs in AHF, it has also proven extremely difficult to assess its treatment effect by evaluating congestion status after start of therapy, but it is clear now that more rigorous and quick diuretic response is associated with better outcomes. 4, 5, 6, 7

Recently, a consensus paper from the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) on diuretic therapy has proposed to investigate either spot urinary sodium and/or diuresis very early after diuretic initiation in AHF. 8 It is proposed to intensify or expand (loop) diuretic treatment if natriuresis or diuresis are insufficient based on these metrics. However, scientific evidence for this recommendation is limited, since there are only scarce contemporary data on urinary sodium concentrations in spot urine in patients admitted for worsening heart failure. To further understand the physiology of natriuresis in AHF, and to put the consensus paper into clinical perspective in a contemporary AHF population, we investigated the clinical importance of urinary sodium excretion in AHF patients.

### Clinical importance of urinary sodium excretion in acute heart failure [^d61ab334]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Median urine output after 6 h was 1400 (860–2150) mL. The total urinary volume was 3725 (2750–5000) mL, 2225 (1523–2775) mL, 1788 (1275–2400) mL and 1750 (1400–2200) mL, during consecutive days 1, 2, 3 and 4. We also calculated urinary sodium concentration based on urinary volume and sodium concentration during the first 6 h. Median urinary sodium concentration after 6 h was 94 (72–114) mmol/L.

Baseline characteristics stratified for tertiles of urinary sodium excretion in the first 6 h are reported in Table 1. Patients with lower urinary sodium excretion in the first 6 h more often had a longer history of heart failure with more diuretic use and lower blood pressure. NT‐proBNP levels were higher, and renal function worse. Changes in urinary sodium excretion in these three groups are shown in Figure 1 B and reveal a significant difference in total urinary sodium excretion at 6 h, 24 h and a trend at 48 h, after which no difference is observed anymore. In contrast, patients with lower urinary sodium excretion in the first 6 h, only had significant lower urinary output up to 24 h, while after 48 h, urinary output was similar (Table 2). The amount of equivalent intravenous furosemide dose given in the first 6 h was slightly higher in patients in the lower tertile of urinary sodium excretion, but the subsequent days this was similar. Online supplementary Table S1 shows the baseline characteristics when stratified above and below a urine output of 900 mL/6 h (which corresponds to 150 mL/h as deemed appropriate diuretic response). Differences in baseline characteristics between poor and adequate diuresis were remarkably similar to differences obtained when stratified for tertiles of urinary sodium.

### Randomized controlled trial of urinE chemiStry guided aCute heArt faiLure treATmEnt (ESCALATE): rationale and design [^bf5d124f]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Diuresis to achieve decongestion is a central aim of therapy in patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). While multiple clinical trials have investigated initial diuretic strategies for a designated period of time, there is a paucity of evidence to guide diuretic titration strategies continued until decongestion is achieved. The use of urine chemistries (urine sodium and creatinine) in a natriuretic response prediction equation accurately estimates natriuresis in response to diuretic dosing, but a randomized clinical trial is needed to compare a urine chemistry-guided diuresis strategy with a strategy of usual care. The urinE chemiStry guided aCute heArt faiLure treATmEnt (ESCALATE) trial is designed to test the hypothesis that protocolized diuretic therapy guided by spot urine chemistry through completion of intravenous diuresis will be superior to usual care and improve outcomes over the 14 days following randomization. ESCALATE will randomize and obtain complete data on 450 patients with acute heart failure to a diuretic strategy guided by urine chemistry or a usual care strategy. Key inclusion criteria include an objective measure of hypervolemia with at least 10 pounds of estimated excess volume, and key exclusion criteria include significant valvular stenosis, hypotension, and a chronic need for dialysis. Our primary outcome is days of benefit over the 14 days after randomization. Days of benefit combines patient symptoms captured by global clinical status with clinical state quantifying the need for hospitalization and intravenous diuresis.

### Spot urinary sodium as a biomarker of diuretic response in acute heart failure [^d8a273eb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Activation of the renin‐angiotensin system in heart failure (HF), a critical adaptation in mammals for survival, is a classic example of maladaptation as it leads to sodium retention‐reabsorption coupled with hyperaldosteronism and increased sympathetic activity. In HF, especially in acute scenarios, neurohormonal activation enhances the kidney reabsorption of sodium, contributing to loop diuretic resistance. Persistent congestion due to an inadequate diuretic response, namely an inadequate quantity of natriuresis, is associated with more severe outcomes.

Urinary sodium (UNa) measured in a timed urine collection sample or spot urine measurement has emerged as a promising biomarker of diuretic response in patients with acute HF (AHF). European Society of Cardiology (ESC) HF guidelinesrecommends an early evaluation of loop diuretic treatment response with a spot UNa analysis in patients with AHF after 2 hours of decongestive therapy initiation. According to this statement, a patient with fluid overload presents a UNa < 50 to 70 mEq/L in a urine spot sample after a 2‐hour diuretic administration or an hourly urine output < 100 to 150 mL during the first 6 hours, generally identifies those with an insufficient diuretic response, and recommends doubling the intravenous loop diuretic dose or adding another diuretic to obtain incremental diuresis/natriuresis. This proactive approach for AHF management is based on findings from observational studies and expert opinion. More controlled studies, especially randomized controlled, are underway to confirm the utility of UNa for monitoring and guiding the intensity of diuretic therapy in fluid overload patients with AHF syndromes. The paucity of randomized controlled trial findings may be one reason that UNa is not yet included in the 2022 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines.

### Diuretic strategies in persons with acute decompensated… [^95390190]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Background: Clinical practice varies widely in the dosing and administration of loop diuretics for patients hospitalized with heart failure. Current guidelines are based primarily on expert opinion, although several small studies have suggested that continuous infusion is more effective than bolus administration in promoting diuresis and reducing the likelihood of renal dysfunction. Felker and colleagues conducted the Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation trial to evaluate various diuretic strategies for acute decompensated heart failure. The Study: The trial prospectively examined diuretic doses and administration modes in 308 patients requiring hospitalization for acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure, despite having been on an oral loop diuretic for at least one month. Patients were excluded if they required intravenous vasodilators or inotropic agents other than digoxin, had hypotension, or had a serum creatinine level greater than 3. 0 mg per dL. The interventions were continued for up to 72 hours, with the treating physician having the option at 48 hours to adjust treatment if clinically warranted. Patients were monitored for 60 days after admission. The primary study outcomes included patients' global assessment of their symptoms, and changes in serum creatinine levels over the first 72 hours. Results: Regardless of intervention, no differences were seen between the groups with regard to median hospital length of stay, 60-day mortality, rehospitalization, or emergency department visits. Similarly, there were no differences in patients' reported symptoms or in mean changes in creatinine level. Patients receiving high-dose furosemide were more likely to be changed to oral diuretics at 48 hours than those assigned to the low-dose strategy. They also had greater levels of fluid loss.

High-dose furosemide was associated with a greater likelihood of a transient increase in serum creatinine of more than 0. 3 mg per dL during the initial 72 hours of treatment, which had resolved by day
60. **Conclusion**: In patients with acute decompensated heart failure, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours when intravenous loop diuretics were given via bolus versus continuous infusion, or with a low-dose versus high-dose strategy.

### Protocolized natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy in acute heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b42e6358]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute heart failure (AHF) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization worldwide. Volume overload plays an important role in these admissions, being the primary cause of a patients signs and symptoms. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines classify the use of loop diuretics in the acute and chronic management of congestion as class 1 A of recommendation. However, the optimal dose and monitoring strategy of loop diuretics to maximize diuresis in AHF remain controversial.

Traditional but imprecise methods of monitoring diuresis, such as weight changes, may overestimate fluid loss, leading to residual volume overload. This has been associated with increased rehospitalization and mortality rates among heart failure (HF) patients. A recent ESC consensus statement highlights that the primary goal of therapy in AHF is to achieve complete decongestion and restore euvolemic state. In this context, urinary sodium measurement has emerged as a potential tool to optimize diuretic therapy, especially within the first 24 h. ESC proposed measurement of urinary sodium two hours after the initial diuretic dose, with a result > 50 mmol indicating an effective dose of loop diuretics.

Most evidence supporting the use of urinary sodium to guide diuresis comes from non-randomized studies or small randomized controlled trials (RCTs), lacking sufficient power to establish definitive clinical benefits. Therefore, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy compared to standard management in patients with AHF.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^4da1be16]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Heart failure hospitalization — diuretic management and ultrafiltration are summarized as follows: Evidence of persistent congestion at discharge has been reported in 25% to 50% of patients, and diuresis should not be discontinued prematurely because elevations in the range of 0.3 mg/dL do not predict worse outcomes except when patients are discharged with persistent congestion. In the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus versus continuous infusion or at a high dose versus a low dose; however, patients in the low-dose group were more likely to require a 50% increase in the dose at 48 hours. Addition of low-dose dopamine to diuretic therapy in the setting of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not improve outcomes overall, although a subset analysis showed increased urine output and weight loss in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40% with significant interaction of effect with LVEF. Bedside ultrafiltration initiated early after admission increased fluid loss, with decreased rehospitalizations in some studies when compared with use of diuretics without systematic escalation, but was also associated with adverse events related to intravenous catheters.

### Management of heart failure in hospitalized patients [^289e24c3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Heart failure affects more than 6 million people in the United States, and hospitalizations for decompensated heart failure confer a heavy toll in morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Clinical trials have demonstrated effective interventions; however, hospitalization and mortality rates remain high. Key components of effective hospital care include appropriate diagnostic evaluation, triage and risk stratification, early implementation of guideline-directed medical therapy, adequate diuresis, and appropriate discharge planning.

### Ultrafiltration in heart failure [^df16bc17]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Fluid overload is a key pathophysiologic mechanism underlying both the acute decompensation episodes of heart failure and the progression of the syndrome. Moreover, it represents the most important factor responsible for the high readmission rates observed in these patients and is often associated with renal function worsening, which by itself increases mortality risk. In this clinical context, ultrafiltration (UF) has been proposed as an alternative to diuretics to obtain a quicker relief of pulmonary/systemic congestion. This review illustrates technical issues, mechanisms, efficacy, safety, costs, and indications of UF in heart failure. The available evidence does not support the widespread use of UF as a substitute for diuretic therapy. Owing to its operative characteristics, UF cannot be expected to directly influence serum electrolyte levels, azotemia, and acid-base balance, or to remove high-molecular-weight substances (eg, cytokines) in clinically relevant amounts. Ultrafiltration should be used neither as a quicker way to achieve a sort of mechanical diuresis nor as a remedy for an inadequately prescribed and administered diuretic therapy. Instead, it should be reserved to selected patients with advanced heart failure and true diuretic resistance, as part of a more complex strategy aiming at an adequate control of fluid retention.

### Clinical importance of urinary sodium excretion in acute heart failure [^f2dfbd1d]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We showed that total lower urinary sodium excretion during the first 6 h after the initiation of intravenous loop diuretic therapy in patients admitted for AHF was associated with lower urine output after 24 h and with a higher risk of mortality during follow‐up. Lower urinary sodium excretion, a marker of poor diuretic response, was especially found in younger patients, preferably males with evidence of renal dysfunction and already on loop diuretic therapy before hospital admission. Finally, we found that excretion of sodium (and water) is greatest during the first 24–48 h and declines afterwards.

The main treatment goals in AHF are early, safe and effective decongestion, and prevention of early rehospitalization and mortality. 1, 2, 8 Many treatments have been investigated to improve clinical outcome, but to date the primary choice of decongestive therapy is still loop diuretics. However, there is a lack of consensus on the guidance of loop diuretic treatment, which may be one reason why residual congestion at discharge is still frequent, and associated with worse clinical outcome. 3, 10 The paucity of data that are available on loop diuretic strategies mainly focus on route and dose of loop diuretic therapy, suggesting only minor differences between treatment strategies. 11 Also, there have been no novel easy, reliable, cheap and stable biomarkers that can serve as response variable in AHF (with or without renal dysfunction), either in plasma or urine, although urinary markers may be better as response variable of diuretic therapy. 12, 13

Effective decongestion achieved by a good diuretic response is associated with favourable outcomes. 5, 7 Diuretic response may be assessed by many different measurements, but generally takes a few days to calculate (i.e. weight change, diuresis or natriuresis per amount of furosemide used over a few days). 6 How to guide effective diuretic treatment to achieve a favourable diuretic response, resulting possibly in improved clinical outcomes, is largely unknown. It is remarkable that no reliable, scientifically validated response variable is available for loop diuretic treatment, in the light of other treatments such as statins and anti‐hypertensives where cholesterol and blood pressure are easy and cheap response variables to guide treatment. 8 Historically, adjustment of diuretic therapy in AHF is mostly based on changes in symptoms and signs, vital signs, diuresis, weight changes and sometimes electrolytes and renal function. However, these estimates are notoriously inaccurate and do not capture the pharmacological effect loop diuretics exert when they are used.

Heart failure results in approximately 1 million hospital admissions annually in the United States and is the leading cause of 30-day readmissions.

Methods

This study explores the impact of a diuresis clinic on heart failure outcomes and cost. Data were collected prospectively on all consecutive patients who received intravenous diuretics and multidisciplinary care in the clinic from its establishment from October 2011 to December 2012, as well as a comparison cohort of patients with heart failure who were admitted to the hospital for < 48 hours. The percentage of hospitalized days was calculated for both cohorts 180 days before and 180 days after each patient's index visit.

Results

In the diuresis clinic group, 106 patients (mean age, 68.2 ± 13 years; 48% were women) were treated over 328 visits (1–22 visits per person), with a mean intravenous furosemide dose of 100 mg, average urine output of 1460 ± 730 mL, and weight loss of 2.3 ± 1.8 kg. Days hospitalized decreased from 38.3 to 31.2 per 1000 patient-days after the index diuresis clinic visit (P < .01). In the comparison group, 143 patients (mean age, 69 ± 16 years; 54% were women) were admitted for < 48 hours. Days hospitalized increased from 14.4 to 21.0 per 1000 patient-days after index admission (P < .01). On multivariate analysis, the diuresis clinic was associated with 3 fewer days in the hospital per 180 days per patient, with an estimated annual savings of $12,113 per patient.

Conclusions

Compared with a brief hospital stay, treatment of mild decompensated heart failure in a diuresis clinic resulted in a substantial and cost-effective decline in the rate of subsequent hospitalization.

### Diuretic treatment in heart failure [^b252c856]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diuretic treatment in heart failure:

- **Definition**: Diuretic treatment in HF is used to promote renal sodium and water excretion, thereby reducing intravascular congestion, pulmonary edema, and elevated filling pressures. Loop diuretics such as furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide are the cornerstone of therapy, with thiazide or potassium-sparing diuretics added for additional effect when needed. The primary goal is to achieve rapid symptomatic relief and restoration of euvolemia while avoiding excessive volume loss, renal dysfunction, or electrolyte imbalance.
- **Pathophysiology**: In HF, neurohormonal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems causes sodium and water retention, leading to increased venous pressures and pulmonary or systemic congestion. Diuretics counteract these effects by lowering preload and reducing ventricular filling pressures, which alleviates dyspnea and edema. However, excessive diuresis can decrease renal perfusion and stimulate further neurohormonal activation, diminishing long-term efficacy.
- **Disease course**: Diuretic therapy provides rapid improvement in symptoms, often within hours of initiation, particularly in acute decompensated HF. Treatment usually begins with intravenous loop diuretics, titrated according to urine output, weight reduction, and renal function. Thiazide-type diuretics may be combined with loop agents in cases of diuretic resistance. Once euvolemia is achieved, therapy is transitioned to the lowest effective oral dose while guideline-directed agents for HF are optimized.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Diuretic therapy is recommended in patients with HF and fluid retention to relieve congestion, improve symptoms, enhance exercise capacity, and reduce the risk of hospital readmission. In HFrEF, early and effective decongestion improves QoL and functional status, although diuretics do not confer a direct survival benefit. Prompt administration in acute HF may shorten hospitalization and lower in-hospital mortality, provided the diagnosis of volume overload is certain. Combination therapy with a thiazide such as metolazone is reserved for patients unresponsive to high-dose loop diuretics to minimize electrolyte disturbances and renal dysfunction.

### Decongestion strategies in patients presenting with acutely decompensated heart failure: a worldwide survey among physicians [^4029045f]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Decongestion strategies for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) characterized by volume overload differ widely. The aim of this independent international academic web-based survey was to capture the therapeutic strategies that physicians use to treat ADHF and to assess differences in therapeutic approaches between cardiologists versus non-cardiologists.

Methods and Results

Physicians were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire, capturing anonymized data on physicians' characteristics and treatment preferences based on a hypothetical clinical scenario of a patient hospitalized with ADHF. A total of 641 physicians from 60 countries participated. A wide variation in the management of the patient was observed. There was conservative use of diuretics, i.e. only 7% started intravenous furosemide at a dose ≥ 2 times the baseline oral dose, and infrequent use of ultrasound in assessing congestion (20.4%). Spot urinary sodium was infrequently or never measured by ≥ 85% of physicians. A third considered a patient with ongoing oedema as being stabilized. There were significant differences between cardiologists and non-cardiologists in the management of ADHF, the targets for daily body weight loss and urine output, diuretic escalation strategies (66.3% vs. 40.7% would escalate diuresis by adding a thiazide) and assessment of response to treatment (27.0% vs. 52.9% considered patients with minimal congestion as stabilized).

Conclusions

There is substantial variability amongst physicians and between cardiologists and non-cardiologists in the management of patients with ADHF, with regard to clinical parameters used to tailor treatment, treatment goals, diuretic dosing and escalation strategies.

### Worsening renal function in patients with acute heart failure undergoing aggressive diuresis is not associated with tubular injury [^2d6eae16]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, N -acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation-Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.

Methods

Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n = 283). WRF was defined as a ≥ 20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.

Results

Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of N -acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both P > 0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (-8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, -169 to 35 ng/mg; P < 0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (P = 0.21), N -acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (P = 0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (P = 0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, N -acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.

### Clinical importance of urinary sodium excretion in acute heart failure [^48b65306]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

We also found that patients with the poorest sodium excretion [arbitrary < 87 mmol (lowest tertile)] did not improve their sodium excretion at 24 h or 48 h, which might be due to intrinsic diuretic resistance, underdosing of diuretics, more severe congestion, or lower eGFR in this patient group. Since this group also comprised patients with more frequent long‐term loop diuretic therapy, also intrarenal alterations such as tubular hypertrophy might limit the response to intravenous diuretics. 20 It is important to note that our study is unique as we evaluated total urinary sodium over 6 h, rather than spot urinary sodium concentration. The latter is a very early and good representation of diuretic and natriuretic response when it is evaluated quickly after initiation (1–2 h), but after more than 5–6 h, the initial peak plasma concentration after a bolus of intravenous diuretic therapy will have subsided. What remains after 6 h in spot urine sodium concentration is still too some extent a measurement of natriuretic response, and associated with clinical outcome, but does not really capture the overall response to initial diuretic therapy. Both entities track well in the lower ranges of urinary sodium, but with more diuresis and more sodium excretion, the limit of urinary sodium concentration (and dilution) is reached at around 150 mmol/L, rarely exceeding this. Sodium excretion beyond this figure is solely dependent on more diuresis (free water excretion/clearance), rather than further increase in sodium concentration of urine. Therefore, on a continuous scale over the entire spectrum, assessment of total urinary sodium excretion might be preferred over urinary sodium concentration. One additional reason might also be the strong association between urinary sodium excretion and subsequent urinary output, in our study after 24 h. The odds of achieving more than 3 L of diuresis in the first 24 h was much higher in patients in the highest tertile of urinary sodium excretion compared with the lowest (94% vs. 27%). Testani et al. 21 already established a formula to estimate 6 h urine output based on a spot urine sodium measurement after 1–2 h in a small number of patients, and our current analysis further support this finding. In contrast to measurement of urinary volume, indices of urinary sodium were independently associated with worse outcome, which may be a reason to use natriuresis rather than diuresis. It has to be acknowledged, however, that to calculate total urinary sodium excretion, measurement of urinary volume is also necessary. In the end, effective natriuresis coupled with effective diuresis with subsequent decongestion is the treatment goal with loop diuretic therapy.

### Intravenous furosemide in decompensated heart failure: do not protocolize dosing but the desired effect! [^863e8f1a]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Palazzuoli and colleagues report on a study comparing continuous versus bolus infusion of furosemide in acute decompensated heart failure. Patients in the continuous infusion group had greater urine output, decreased renal function and increased 6-month mortality.

We feel that, due to the study design, the conclusions drawn are difficult to translate into clinical practice. The decisive advantage of continuous over bolus infusion is the ability to titrate to effect in a gradual and precise manner. This advantage is completely negated when large-step (that is, doubling) dose increases are rigidly protocolized, as was the case in this study. When the advantages of a method are lost, only its comparative harms remain: continuous infusion may have a stronger diuretic effect than bolus infusion (milligram for milligram) and the continuous infusion group in this study seemed overtreated, resulting in renal dysfunction that is associated with poor outcomes.

Future research should focus on the optimal method to attain the clinical goal of inducing sufficient but not excessive diuresis. Comparing outcomes on a protocolized-dose basis is straightforward but cannot elucidate which method is best in practice. Indeed, the authors write that a study utilizing a more tailored dose could further clarify this subject. We suggest that a truly relevant comparison can only be made when treatment in both groups is aimed at individual targets. This would require a large trial with patients optimally treated using either of the two infusion methods, while dosing is completely determined by preset clinically relevant endpoints.

### Effects of early empagliflozin initiation on diuresis and kidney function in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (EMPAG-HF) [^e9ef3d8c]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Effective diuretic regimens using loop diuretics in patients with acute decompensated heart failure are often limited by the development of worsening kidney function. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors induce glucosuria and sodium excretion with nephroprotective effects in patients with stable heart failure but their role in acute decompensated heart failure is unclear.

Methods

In this single-center, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, we randomly assigned patients with acute decompensated heart failure to empagliflozin 25 mg daily or placebo in addition to standard decongestive treatments that included loop diuretics. The primary end point was cumulative urine output over 5 days. Secondary end points included diuretic efficiency, dynamics in markers of kidney function and injury, and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide).

Results

Sixty patients were randomized within 12 hours of hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure. Addition of empagliflozin daily to standard medical treatment of acute decompensated heart failure resulted in a 25% increase in cumulative urine output over 5 days (median 10.8 versus 8.7 L mL in placebo, group difference estimation 2.2 L [95% CI, 8.4 to 3.6]; P = 0.003). Empagliflozin increased diuretic efficiency compared with placebo (14.1 mL urine per milligram furosemide equivalent [95% CI, 0.6–27.7]; P = 0.041) without affecting markers of renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 51 ± 19 versus 54 ± 17 mL/min per 1.73 m²; P = 0.599) or injury (total urinary protein, 492 ± 845 versus 503 ± 847 mg/g creatinine; P = 0.975; and urinary α1-microglobulin, 55.4 ± 38.6 versus 31.3 ± 33.6 mg/g creatinine; P = 0.066) with more pronounced decrease in NT-proBNP in the empagliflozin group compared with placebo (-1861 versus -727.2 pg/mL after 5 days; quotient in slope, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.83–0.95]; P < 0.001). There were no differences in the incidence of safety events between groups.

Conclusions

Early addition of empagliflozin to standard diuretic therapy increases urine output without affecting renal function in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

### Natriuresis-guided therapy in acute heart failure: rationale and design of the pragmatic urinary sodium-based treatment algoritHm in acute heart failure (PUSH-AHF) trial [^73e53040]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

The rationale for using urinary sodium as response variable

In recognition of this problem, several studies have aimed to better understand and early identify insufficient diuretic response over the last years. Initially, these studies used either net fluid balance, urine output or weight loss indexed to administered loop diuretic dose as surrogates of diuretic response. However, all of these are, to a certain extent, unreliable in daily clinical practice. Given the mode of action of loop diuretics, natriuresis might not only be a sensitive, objective, accurate and quantifiable marker of response, but also the most reliable marker to assess response. To date, multiple studies have demonstrated that impaired natriuretic response to loop diuretic treatment is associated with markers of persistent congestion, and with higher rates of HF rehospitalization and mortality., Additionally, even early assessment of natriuresis in a spot urine sample 1 to 2 h after initiation of intravenous loop diuretic treatment has been shown to be an accurate marker of longer term (6 h) natriuretic response. This led to the development of a natriuretic response prediction equation which was additionally validated and tested in a prospective study showing that loop diuretic‐guided treatment based on this natriuretic response predication equation resulted in significant increases in urine output, net fluid loss and weight loss. These findings suggest that natriuresis could be a reliable tool to assess diuretic response, select non‐responders, and consequently titrate diuretic therapy accordingly. To date, the value of natriuresis‐guided therapy and its effect on decongestion or outcomes, has however not been studied in a randomized, controlled setting.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^42a53622]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for heart failure, more specifically with respect to intravenous diuretics, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider intensifying the diuretic regimen with higher doses of IV loop diuretics or adding a second diuretic in patients hospitalized with HF, if diuresis is inadequate to relieve symptoms and signs of congestion.

### Diuretic treatment in high-risk acute decompensation of advanced chronic heart failure-bolus intermittent vs. continuous infusion of furosemide: a randomized controlled trial [^16060ed0]. Clinical Research in Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The study DRAIN was published by Simone Frea and colleagues in 2020 in the journal Clin Res Cardiol. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the DRAIN study, the trial question was: what is the role of continuous infusion of furosemide in patients with acute decompensation of advanced chronic HF and high risk for diuretic resistance? In the DRAIN study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the DRAIN study, the population was: 80 patients (8 female, 72 male). The inclusion criteria were patients admitted for acute decompensation of advanced chronic HF with criteria of high risk for diuretic resistance. The key exclusion criteria were reversible causes of acute HF, cardiogenic shock, chronic renal failure stage V. In the DRAIN study, the interventions were: n = 40 continuous infusion (intravenous infusion of furosemide 120 mg/day or 240 mg/day continuously for up to 72 hours) n = 40 bolus intermittent (intravenous furosemide bolus of 120 mg/day or 240 mg/day every 12 hours for up to 72 hours). In the DRAIN study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in freedom from congestion at 72 hours (48% vs. 25%; OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.05 to 7). In the DRAIN study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in total urinary output after 72 hours (10020,020 mL vs. 8612,020 ml; OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.4) Significant decrease in treatment failure (15% vs. 38%; OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.87) No significant difference in worsening HF after 72 hours (20% vs. 30%; OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.83). In the DRAIN study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in worsening of renal function, heart transplantation, LV assist device implantation, or in-hospital death. significant difference in diuretic response (-1.0 vs. -0.6) and estimated right atrial pressure at echo-Doppler after 72 hours (13.5 mmHg vs. 16.4 mmHg). In the DRAIN study, the conclusion was: in patients admitted for acute decompensation of advanced chronic HF with criteria of high risk for diuretic resistance, continuous infusion was superior to bolus intermittent with respect to freedom from congestion at 72 hours.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on clinical assessment, management, and trajectory of patients hospitalized with heart Failure focused update: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^63dd7050]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Loop diuretic therapy in hospitalized heart failure — dosing and monitoring is outlined as follows: Table 7A provides guidance on timing and dosing for initiation of sacubitril/valsartan based on patient profile as represented in the randomized ARNI trials; subsequent IV diuretic doses are modified to achieve the desired daily response, and doses are often doubled until reaching 400 to 500 mg of furosemide equivalent per day; when the response is brisk but transient, the frequency should be increased to 3 to 4 times daily; the DOSE trial did not demonstrate improved outcomes with continuous infusion of IV furosemide, but patients with chronic furosemide equivalent doses of over 240 mg daily were excluded, while a Cochrane review suggested that loop diuretic agent infusions may produce greater net diuresis and better tolerability at equivalent doses compared with bolus dosing; measurement of urine sodium shortly after the start of therapy can be useful to evaluate diuretic responsiveness, with a spot urine sodium content < 50 mEq/L at 2 hours after the diuretic dose correlated with a poor diuretic response and suggests consideration of dose.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^158500e5]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Fluid overload management

Diuretic therapy

Diuretics, especially loop diuretics, remain a valid therapeutic alternative for relieving symptoms and improving pathophysiological states of fluid overload such as congestive heart failure and in patients with AKI. At this time, there is no evidence that favors ultrafiltration over diuretic use in volume overload patients with or without AKI in terms of less progression of AKI, improved clinical outcomes or reduce incidence of AKI. Despite that more patients developed AKI during diuretic treatment, numerous studies have demonstrated that more aggressive use of loop diuretics to achieve greater volume removal is associated with improved outcomes (Table 2).

Table 2
Studies assessing the effect of diuretics on AKI and mortality

FACTT fluid and catheter treatment trial, sCr serum creatinine, NA non-assessed, OR odds ratio

What should be the goal of urine output when using diuretics to manage fluid overload? Some empirical observations have shown that a urine output of 3–4 ml/kg/h rarely causes intravascular volume depletion as capillary refill can meet such rates in almost all patients. Diuretics could be either administered by bolus or using a continuous infusion. There has been controversy about which of these strategies is better; some authors advocate that diuretic infusion is superior to boluses since urinary output could be maintain easily. In one study diuretic infusion was associated with greater diuresis and this was achieved with a lesser dose; infusion was also associated with fewer adverse events such as worsening AKI, hypokalemia, and ototoxicity. However, in the DOSE-AHF(Diuretic Optimization Strategy Evaluation in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) study, authors found that patients with acute heart failure may benefit from an initial bolus strategy.

### Worsening renal function in acute heart failure in the context of diuretic response [^e095b87b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Limitations include the fact that NT‐proBNP in RELAX‐AHF‐2 and BNP in PROTECT were only measured in (much) smaller subgroups and therefore provided less reliable results. Also, our results are most applicable to patients with an eGFR of approximately 20 to 80 ml/min/1.73 m 2 due to the inclusion criteria for PROTECT and RELAX‐AHF‐2. The retrospective nature of this analysis within clinical trial populations is also a limitation, including the fact that the combined endpoints of the clinical trials were predefined to be established at different time points. Also, findings from clinical trial cohorts might not necessarily translate to real‐world practice where accuracy of weight and urine output measurements might differ. Calculation of diuretic response as indexed per 40 mg of furosemide equivalent might be cumbersome, but dose and route of administration in electronic patient systems could easily circumvent this problem. Moreover, although more convenient, crude weight loss appeared to be a less reliable measurement to determine whether WRF is harmful or not. Application of the STEPP method to a clinical congestion score proved not to be feasible due to the limited range of values of a congestion score. Finally, as WRF and diuretic response were assessed between baseline and day 4 to allow for early risk/benefit indication by clinicians, no claims can be made about later shifts from good to poor diuretic response and vice versa.

Future perspectives and clinical application

Knowledge on how and when WRF is a sign of poor clinical outcomes and when it can be considered as harmless is of paramount importance to prevent down‐titration of diuretic doses leading to residual congestion. The current study might aid physicians by showing that diuretic response is a suitable variable to put WRF into context and provides an estimate of how much diuretic response confers good outcomes. The occurrence of WRF should thus not incontrovertibly lead to the decision to down‐titrate or even cease treatments aimed at achieving decongestion. Further validation is however warranted to determine whether a minimum diuretic response of > 0.35 kg weight loss per dose of 40 mg furosemide equivalent could be a reasonable estimation of a good diuretic response to base treatment decisions on in clinical practice. Research is warranted to investigate whether diuresis/natriuresis‐guided therapy in AHF indeed results in better outcomes for these patients. Currently, the Pragmatic Urinary Sodium‐based Treatment algoritHm in Acute Heart Failure (PUSH‐AHF) study is underway, which compares natriuresis‐guided treatment with standard of care in AHF patients (identifier: NCT04606927).

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^afc4586a]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Diuretic therapy in heart failure — supportive evidence indicates controlled trials increased urinary sodium excretion, decreased physical signs of fluid retention, and improved symptoms, QOL, and exercise tolerance; registry data revealed reduced 30-day all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure with diuretic use compared with no diuretic use after discharge; in outpatients, low-dose therapy is titrated until urine output increases and weight decreases, generally by 0.5 to 1.0 kg daily; diuretic resistance can be addressed by escalation of loop diuretic dose, intravenous bolus or continuous infusion, or combining diuretic classes; combining a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic (e.g., metolazone) with a loop diuretic enhances natriuresis but, in a propensity-score matched analysis of hospitalized heart failure, adding metolazone increased hypokalemia, hyponatremia, worsening renal function, and mortality, whereas higher loop diuretic doses were not found to adversely affect survival; the DOSE trial supports the use of high-dose intravenous loop diuretics.

### Extracorporeal ultrafiltration for fluid Overload in heart failure: current status and prospects for further research [^69b5ea71]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN THE USE OF EXTRACORPOREAL UF IN HEART FAILURE

SELECTION OF POTENTIAL CANDIDATES

The conflicting results from UF studies highlight the fact that patient selection and fluid removal targets are incompletely understood. Practice guidelines suggest that an inadequate response to an initial dose of an intravenous loop diuretic agent be treated with an increased dose of the same drug. If this intervention is ineffective, invasive hemodynamic assessment is recommended. Evidence of persistent fluid excess can then be treated with the addition of thiazide diuretic agents, aldosterone antagonists, or continuous intravenous infusion of a loop diuretic agent. Only if all these measures fail can UF be considered. A similar degree of diuretic agent resistance characterized eligibility for enrollment in CARRESS-HF. In this trial, the poor outcomes of UF in patients with the acute cardiorenal syndrome may be partially related to the lack of therapy adjustment according to individual patients' characteristics. In AVOID-HF, fine-tuning of UF rates in response to vital signs, renal function, or urine output resulted in greater net fluid loss and was associated with fewer 30-day heart failure events without a greater increase in serum creatinine levels than in the adjustable diuretic agent group. These observations underscore the critical need for additional investigation of UF as both first-line and rescue therapies, provided that UF rates are adjusted in each patient in response to changes in vital signs and renal function.

Due to the potential complications and cost of UF, it should not be used indiscriminately in decompensated heart failure. For example, in patients with de novo heart failure or those not receiving daily diuretic agents, fluid overload can be rapidly eliminated with intravenous diuretic agents, which should be used in such cases instead of UF. The unanswered question is which patients who develop heart failure decompensation despite daily oral diuretic agents should be considered for UF instead of intravenous diuretic agents? To date, all studies of UF in patients with heart failure have relied solely on clinical signs and symptoms of fluid excess, both as inclusion criteria and fluid removal targets. This is problematic due to the poor correlation between clinical assessment and objective measures of increased filling pressures. A European consensus statement that graded congestion according to a combination of clinical and laboratory parameters suggested that a score of ≥ 12, together with urine output of < 1,000 ml/24 h, should trigger the use of UF because these values are indicative of diuretic agent resistance. This recommendation has not been prospectively validated and relies on the unproven assumption that the magnitude of fluid excess influences diuretic agent responsiveness.

### The use of diuretics in heart failure with congestion-a position statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^aceba83d]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The vast majority of acute heart failure episodes are characterized by increasing symptoms and signs of congestion with volume overload. The goal of therapy in those patients is the relief of congestion through achieving a state of euvolaemia, mainly through the use of diuretic therapy. The appropriate use of diuretics however remains challenging, especially when worsening renal function, diuretic resistance and electrolyte disturbances occur. This position paper focuses on the use of diuretics in heart failure with congestion. The manuscript addresses frequently encountered challenges, such as (i) evaluation of congestion and clinical euvolaemia, (ii) assessment of diuretic response/resistance in the treatment of acute heart failure, (iii) an approach towards stepped pharmacologic diuretic strategies, based upon diuretic response, and (iv) management of common electrolyte disturbances. Recommendations are made in line with available guidelines, evidence and expert opinion.

### Optimal initial intravenous loop Diuretic Dosing in acute decompensated heart Failure [^9ad63e79]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimizing HF medical therapy from admission to discharge is critical in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with ADHF hospitalizations. Performance and quality benchmarks such as initiating GDMT before discharge and implementing thorough monitoring and follow-up postdischarge have been shown to reduce HF readmissions. While individual strategies for hospital diuretic management can reduce patient-reported congestion and improve urine output, they have not been shown to reduce hospital LOS, readmissions, or mortality. To enhance the quality of care for diuretic management in ADHF patients, a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach is required early in hospital management, akin to the early, goal-directed therapy bundles used in septic shock. The concept of early "door-to-diuretic" has shown promising outcomes, associating with reduced 30-day readmission and mortality. Therefore, a comprehensive approach should include the early administration of optimal initial IV diuretics, coupled with vigilant monitoring and diuretic adjustment based on patient response to both initial and subsequent dosing. The inclusion of key collaborators involved in the first 24 hours of admission is crucial to these time-sensitive efforts and includes first responders, the emergency department team, and any admitting teams (both cardiology and non-cardiology services). The recently concluded Efficacy of a Standardized Diuretic Protocol in Acute Heart Failure and Pragmatic Urinary Sodium-based Treatment Algorithm in Acute Heart Failure trials provide valuable insights into such strategies with standardized natriuresis-guided diuretic strategies in patients admitted for ADHF.

### Diuretic response in acute heart failure-pathophysiology, evaluation, and therapy [^dedca9d8]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

The administration of loop diuretics to achieve decongestion is the cornerstone of therapy for acute heart failure. Unfortunately, impaired response to diuretics is common in these patients and associated with adverse outcomes. Diuretic resistance is thought to result from a complex interplay between cardiac and renal dysfunction, and specific renal adaptation and escape mechanisms, such as neurohormonal activation and the braking phenomenon. However, our understanding of diuretic response in patients with acute heart failure is still limited and a uniform definition is lacking. Three objective methods to evaluate diuretic response have been introduced, which all suggest that diuretic response should be determined based on the effect of diuretic dose administered. Several strategies have been proposed to overcome diuretic resistance, including combination therapy and ultrafiltration, but prospective studies in patients who are truly unresponsive to diuretics are lacking. An enhanced understanding of diuretic response should ultimately lead to an improved, individualized approach to treating patients with acute heart failure.

Diuretics in heart failure — patient selection and dosing advises that diuretics should be prescribed to all patients who have evidence of, and to most patients with a prior history of, fluid retention and should generally be combined with an ACEI and a beta-blocker, as few patients with HF will be able to maintain dry weight without diuretics; for initiation and maintenance, the most commonly used loop diuretic is furosemide, though some respond to torsemide due to superior absorption and longer duration of action; outpatient therapy is commonly started with low doses and increased until urine output rises and weight decreases, generally by 0.5 to 1.0 kg daily, with further dose or frequency escalations (i.e., twice-daily dosing) possibly required; the ultimate goal is elimination of clinical evidence of fluid retention, and diuretics are generally combined with moderate dietary sodium restriction (3 to 4 g daily).

Discussion

The primary treatment goal of patients admitted with acute HF is achieving euvolaemia with the use of loop diuretics. Unfortunately, a large number of patients with acute HF show insufficient response to diuretics, resulting in residual congestion and poor outcomes, such as high rates of HF rehospitalizations. Natriuresis is a sensitive marker of response to loop diuretic therapy and allows for early identification of patients with insufficient diuretic response. Urinary sodium therefore has all the characteristics required for a marker that can be used to actively assess diuretic response and to consequently guide decongestive treatment, using a stepwise approach. The PUSH‐AHF is the first trial to assess the effect of natriuresis‐guided enhanced diuretic therapy compared with standard of care on total natriuresis and clinical outcomes. If the PUSH‐AHF is able to show superiority of natriuresis‐guided therapy over standard of care, this will pave the way for more individualized diuretic therapy in patients with acute HF.

Current treatment of patients with acute heart failure and the rationale for the enhanced diuretic treatment protocol

Acute HF is characterized by signs and symptoms due to redistribution and excessive fluid retention, for which loop diuretics are the first and only guideline‐recommended treatment. Loop diuretics inhibit the sodium–chloride–potassium co‐transporter in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, resulting in sodium and chloride excretion with concomitant water excretion. Several mechanisms, such as impaired resorption, neurohormonal activation and compensatory proximal and distal tubular sodium reabsorption, contribute to loop diuretic resistance in patients with acute HF., Despite it being well known that higher diuretic doses are required in patients with HF, due to the above described mechanisms, increasing diuretic doses will over time become less effective. Insufficient response to diuretics is therefore common and a large number of patients are discharged with residual congestion after an admission for acute HF. Yet, evidence‐based data on dosing and adjustment of loop diuretics in acute HF are currently lacking. The Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation (DOSE) trial failed to show a benefit of high doses of loop diuretics compared with low‐dose loop diuretics using a randomized, double‐blind approach. A possible explanation of the neutral results of the DOSE study might be due to the enrolment and randomization of patients with both a good and an insufficient diuretic response whereas no additional effect of higher doses is expected in patients with a good diuretic response. In contrast, in patients with an insufficient diuretic response, intensification of the diuretic treatment could lead to improved decongestion and consequent better outcomes.

The possible value of natriuresis‐guided enhanced diuretic therapy and thestudy treatment protocol

As illustrated above, natriuresis has all the characteristics required for a marker that can be used to actively guide decongestive treatment and move toward a personalized treatment approach in acute HF. This is important as current treatment is limited, in many cases insufficient and recent studies investigating novel therapies in acute HF were neutral. This might in part be due to patient selection and the timing of initiation of the novel therapies. In these trials, acute HF patients were not enrolled immediately at presentation and irrespective of their response to standard therapy, that is, loop diuretics. In approximately half of acute HF patients, response to this therapy will however be adequate, limiting the potential, additional effect of a novel therapy. Furthermore, we know that early treatment with intravenous loop diuretics, as well as good diuretic response in the first 24 h are associated with better outcomes. By assessing natriuresis early after initiation of loop diuretic therapy, patients with an insufficient response (non‐responders) will be identified and will receive (early) intensified therapy. This could furthermore prove to be a set‐up for future acute HF trials where initial non‐responders will be eligible for novel treatment options early after admission.

Additionally, PUSH‐AHF will implement a treatment protocol that includes combination diuretic therapy in patients with an insufficient natriuretic response. This treatment protocol is an adaptation of the proposed algorithm in the position statement from the HFA of the ESC on the use of diuretics in HF with congestion, which has also been incorporated in the recently published 2021 ESC HF guidelines. Post hoc analyses from the Cardiorenal Rescue Study in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (CARRESS‐HF) suggest that such a stepped pharmacological care approach in acute HF patients with persistent congestion may result in greater decongestion without negative effects on renal function. The PUSH‐AHF will provide additional information on the effects of combination diuretic therapy in increasing natriuretic response and possible side‐effects such as electrolyte disturbances or decreases in renal function, which will be closely monitored throughout the trial. If positive, this could become a validated framework for the intensified treatment of acute HF patients with an initial insufficient response.

### Great debate: in patients with decompensated heart failure, acetazolamide in addition to loop diuretics is the first choice [^ca34dfd5]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

These three randomized studies with combined diuretic treatment regimens (SGLT2i are no classic 'diuretics' but display some diuretic features) are very useful to define the best diuretic strategy in patients with decompensated HF and congestion/diuretic resistance. Clearly, these data remind us that we need to do more than just apply some i.v. furosemide: we need to monitor the diuretic response shortly after the start of therapy (either by determining urinary sodium content after 2 or 6 h and/or by measuring the hourly urine output), although there is no scientific evidence that such an approach improves clinical outcomes of patients. A satisfactory diuretic response can be defined as a urine sodium content > 50–70 mEq/L at 2 h and/or by a urine output > 100–150 mL/h during the first 6 h. In case of an insufficient diuretic response, doubling of the i.v. loop diuretic dose is recommended, with a further assessment of diuretic response. The most important question arising from ADVOR, CLOROTIC, and EMPULSE is now as follows: which diuretic strategy additive to i.v. loop diuretics is the preferred one in contemporary clinical practice? This is the core of the current debate. Two groups of authors share their views and arguments.

While the very early addition of acetazolamide or thiazide diuretics has proved better decongestion, both ADVOR and CLOROTIC did not show improved outcomes after 90 days. EMPULSE showed a reduction in hard clinical endpoints after 90 days; however, patients were randomized mainly after the first days of admission, during which better decongestion is required. A potential approach was suggested combining the administration of loop diuretics with acetazolamide initially followed by the introduction of SGLT2i thereafter.

All regimens for acute and chronic decongestion need to take into account effects on neurohormonal and sympathetic nervous system activation associated with the administration of loop diuretics. Acetazolamide may acutely counteract neurohormonal stimulation with more proximal sodium reabsorption, especially in patients with advanced kidney disease not receiving a renin–angiotensin system blocker and in those patients with increased bicarbonate levels at baseline and/or during monotherapy with loop diuretics. A diuretic agent working more distally in the renal tubular loop may not affect the physiological consequences of increased proximal sodium retention. However, also SGLT2i may act as neurohormonal antagonists and display a similar pattern on cellular signalling and cardiac remodelling such as classical neurohormonal antagonists like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, MRA, and beta-blockers.

### Continuous infusion versus intermittent boluses of furosemide in acute heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b68321a3]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute heart failure is a common cause of hospital admission. This study aims to compare continuous infusion and intermittent boluses of furosemide in treating acute heart failure.

Methods

Electronic searches were performed on PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and EMBASE. English articles comparing intermittent boluses and continuous infusion of furosemide in treating acute heart failure were included. Non-comparative studies or articles, and articles that did not report specific data for acute heart failure patients were excluded. Primary endpoints included post-treatment daily urine output, weight, length of stay, and serum sodium, potassium, and creatinine. Secondary endpoints included other pre-treatment and treatment variables. Post hoc trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed on selected variables.

Results

Ten randomized controlled trials were included with a total of 735 patients (371 with intermittent boluses and 364 with continuous infusion). Mean daily urine output (P < .001) and weight loss (P = 0.04) were significantly higher in the continuous infusion group. Other variables were not significantly different between the two groups. TSA showed that current evidence is sufficient to draw the above conclusions about mean daily urine output, but more studies were required to compare the 2 regimens in terms of weight loss.

Conclusion

Choice of furosemide regime in acute heart failure remains physician preference. Both bolus and continuous infusion yields satisfactory outcomes.

### Spot urine sodium as triage for effective diuretic infusion in an ambulatory heart failure unit [^55e404d6]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Admission for diuresis remains a common and costly event in patients with advanced heart failure (HF). We tested whether spot urine sodium could identify patients likely to respond to ambulatory diuretic infusion without hospitalization.

Methods and Results

We prospectively followed 176 consecutive patients with advanced heart failure receiving intravenous furosemide for congestion in an ambulatory clinic. Spot urine sodium was measured in 1st voided urine after diuretic infusion and compared with 3-hour urine output and subsequent risk of 30-day hospitalization or emergency department (ED) visit. Spot urine sodium was significantly associated with urine output in a model adjusted for age, renal function, and blood urea nitrogen (P = 0.02). Higher urine sodium was associated with lower risk of hospitalization or ED visit within 30 days (odds ratio [OR] 0.82 [95% confidence interval 0.72–0.94] per 10mmol/L increase; P < .001), in a model adjusted for hemoglobin (OR 0.80 [0.66–0.97]; P = 0.02) and systolic blood pressure (OR 0.82 [0.67–1.0]; P = 0.05). Spot urine sodium ≥ 65mmol/L and urine output ≥ 1200mL identified a lower-risk group for outpatient management.

Conclusion

High spot urine sodium after diuretic administration identifies HF patients likely to respond to an ambulatory diuretic infusion with lower rates of hospitalization or ED visits at 30 days.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Dual nephron blockade and adjunct diuretic strategies — when high furosemide doses are not effective, dual nephron blockade with the addition of either a thiazide-like diuretic or a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide) can be considered. In the CLOROTIC trial of patients with acute HF, adding hydrochlorothiazide to an IV loop diuretic resulted in an increased diuretic response and more weight loss without a change in patient-reported dyspnea, although those receiving hydrochlorothiazide exhibited increases in serum creatinine, hypokalemia, and impaired kidney function compared with placebo, and the study was stopped prematurely due to slow enrollment, making clinical safety conclusions difficult to assess. Chlorothiazide has a short elimination half-life but is substantially more expensive, and observational data suggest that it does not increase net 24-hour urine output when compared with oral metolazone. Metolazone can be added to the IV loop diuretic at 2.5- to 5-mg doses once or twice daily. In the ADVOR trial, acetazolamide added to a loop diuretic for 3 days exhibited a greater rate of successful decongestion (42.2% vs 30.5%; P < 0.001) and a shorter duration of hospital stay compared with placebo, with no statistically significant differences in renal safety, hypokalemia, or hypotension between groups. The randomized PUSH-AHF trial showed greater natriuresis when diuretic agents were guided by spot urine sodium concentrations, without a difference in mortality or HF rehospitalization.

### Natriuresis-guided therapy in acute heart failure: rationale and design of the pragmatic urinary sodium-based treatment algoritHm in acute heart failure (PUSH-AHF) trial [^526d76b8]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Study endpoints

The primary endpoint of the PUSH‐AHF trial is a combined endpoint of two distinct co‐primary endpoints, namely (i) total 24‐h natriuresis and (ii) the first occurrence of the combined endpoint of all‐cause mortality or HF rehospitalization at 6 months. Secondary endpoints include total 48‐ and 72‐h natriuresis, length of hospital stay, and percentage change in N‐terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) at 48 and 72 h. Safety endpoints include doubling of serum creatinine at 24 or 48 h, and occurrence of worsening HF, defined as requiring inotropes or vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, or palliative care. The endpoint adjudication committee will adjudicate all rehospitalizations to judge whether a hospitalization is due to HF. The adjudication committee will be blinded to treatment allocation.

Sample size and power calculation

The PUSH‐AHF is powered for its co‐primary endpoint of total 24‐h natriuresis and the first occurrence of all‐cause mortality or HF rehospitalization at 6 months. Based on our previous study in acute HF patients, the mean 24‐h natriuresis was 398 ± 246 mmol. In this population, 36% of patients had an insufficient natriuretic response (defined as urinary sodium < 90 mmol or urine output < 900 ml) 6 h after initiation of loop diuretic. Assuming a 40% improvement in these 36% of patients and a conservative 15% improvement in 24‐h natriuresis in the remaining patients because of closer monitoring, this assumes an overall 24% improvement in 24‐h urinary sodium excretion. Therefore, to obtain a power of at least 80%, at a two‐sided significance level of 0.025 (Bonferroni correction), a sample size of 125 patients in each group would be sufficient for the primary endpoint of 24‐h natriuresis. To prevent being underpowered due to dropout or missing data, which is expected to be higher than average in this patient population and given the delicate nature of urine collections, enrolment will be increased by 10%, therefore requiring 140 patients per group. Based on this sample size, we will have 81% power with a two‐sided significance level of 0.025 to detect a hazard ratio of 0.49 for the other co‐primary endpoint of all‐cause mortality and HF rehospitalization at 6 months. However, also accounting for 10% missing follow‐up data, we will increase the number of patients to 310 (155 patients per group).

SGLT2 inhibition enhances diuresis and has a proven long-term impact in heart failure

The recent introduction of SGLT2i expanded the treatment option for patients with HF, both with reduced and preserved ejection fractions. The SGLT2i act through inhibition of the sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 in the proximal renal tubule, leading to increased glucosuria and diuresis. These effects are noted in prior studies on patients with chronic stable and acute decompensated HF, but also in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated HF. Of note, SGLT2i do not increase the sympathetic or neurohumoral drive in patients with HF and enhance the effects of loop diuretics. The recent EMPAG-HF (Empagliflozin in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) study tested the hypothesis of whether early initiation of SGLT2i in acute decompensated HF would lead to an increase in diuresis without affecting renal function.EMPAG-HF randomized patients to empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo within 12 h of hospital presentation. The study showed an increase in urine production of 2.2 L compared with placebo over the course of 5 days without changes in renal function or other clinical events. This underlines the beneficial safety profile of empagliflozin with nephroprotective effects in patients at risk for and with HF. One might even speculate that this might be of particular value in patients with HF and concomitant renal dysfunction, many of whom may not be on an inhibitor of the renin–angiotensin system or MRA. Further, patients showed a more pronounced decrease in body weight and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide as well as furosemide-sparing effects with higher diuretic efficiency (millilitre urine per milligram furosemide) and lower doses of furosemide equivalent per day in the empagliflozin-treated patients. Cumulative urine output on Day 3 post-randomization is higher in EMPAG-HF and CLOROTIC compared with ADVOR (Figure 4).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors in hospital — "robust evidence supports the use of SGLT inhibitors to further reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic HF across a wide spectrum of left ventricular ejection fractions and with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)," and "evidence now supports initiating or continuing their use in the hospital setting for patients admitted with acute decompensated HF." Multiple trials "have all demonstrated that these medications can be safely started in inpatients." Before initiation, similar clinical stability criteria were used, "consisting of a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 100 mm Hg, no inotropic support for at least 24 hours, no symptoms of hypotension, no increase in intravenous (IV) diuretic agent dose in the previous 6 hours, and no IV vasodilators." Additional trial data "showed that SGLT inhibition augmented urine output and diuretic response," and early initiation "decreased congestion and shortened length of stay; the primary endpoint of diuretic efficiency (cumulative change in weight per cumulative diuretic agent dose) was not met."

### Loop diuretic efficiency: a metric of diuretic responsiveness with prognostic importance in acute decompensated heart failure [^a4c88c15]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Rather than the absolute dose of diuretic or urine output, the primary signal of interest when evaluating diuretic responsiveness is the efficiency with which the kidneys can produce urine after a given dose of diuretic. As a result, we hypothesized that a metric of diuretic efficiency (DE) would capture distinct prognostic information beyond that of raw fluid output or diuretic dose.

Methods and Results

We independently analyzed 2 cohorts: (1) consecutive admissions at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) with a primary discharge diagnosis of heart failure (n = 657) and (2) patients in the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness (ESCAPE) data set (n = 390). DE was estimated as the net fluid output produced per 40 mg of furosemide equivalents, then dichotomized into high versus low DE based on the median value. There was only a moderate correlation between DE and both intravenous diuretic dose and net fluid output (r(2) ≤ 0.26 for all comparisons), indicating that DE was describing unique information. With the exception of metrics of renal function and preadmission diuretic therapy, traditional baseline characteristics, including right heart catheterization variables, were not consistently associated with DE. Low DE was associated with worsened survival even after adjusting for in-hospital diuretic dose, fluid output, in addition to baseline characteristics (Penn: hazards ratio [HR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.78; P = 0.02; ESCAPE: HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.53–5.36; P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Although in need of validation in less-selected populations, low DE during decongestive therapy portends poorer long-term outcomes above and beyond traditional prognostic factors in patients hospitalized with decompensated heart failure.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^cb0029b2]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Hospitalization for heart failure (HF) — hospitalization is a sentinel event that signals worse prognosis and the need to restore hemodynamic compensation but also provides key opportunities to redirect the disease trajectory. During the HF hospitalization, the approach to management should include and address precipitating factors, comorbidities, and previous limitations to ongoing disease management related to social determinants of health, and patients require assessment and management of ischemia, arrhythmia, and other precipitating factors and comorbidities. The presenting profile, reversible factors, appropriate work-up for cause of HF including ischemic and nonischemic causes, comorbidities, disease trajectory, and goals of care should be addressed. Establishment of optimal volume status is a major goal, and patients with residual congestion merit careful consideration for further intervention before and after discharge, because they face higher risk for rehospitalization and death. The disease trajectory for patients hospitalized with reduced EF is markedly improved by optimization of recommended medical therapies, which should be initiated or increased toward target doses once the efficacy of diuresis has been shown.

### Great debate: in patients with decompensated heart failure, acetazolamide in addition to loop diuretics is the first choice [^c14f1bf5]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Contra

Chronic HF and acute decompensated HF belong to the most common hospital admission diagnoses in the Western world. Following an initial cardiac injury and development of myocardial damage, subsequent cardiac decompensations are associated with increased myocardial load responsible for the structural and functional deterioration of the failing myocardium. Clinical hallmarks of acute decompensated HF are congestion, volume overload, and systemic hypoperfusion.

Decongestive strategies in acute heart failure

Decongestion through enhanced diuresis is one of the most important early treatment goals in patients with acute decompensated HF. Diuretic therapies are primarily based on loop diuretics along with additional pharmacotherapeutic options for increasing urine output. This includes primarily loop diuretics but also other pharmacotherapies such as acetazolamide (a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acting in the proximal tubule of the kidney) and HCTZ (a competitor for the sodium–chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to increased natriuresis and urine production).

It has been decades since the introduction of new therapies for acute decompensated HF. Several trials testing in patients with acute decompensated HF failed to show the benefit of novel pharmacotherapies on post-discharge outcomes, thus highlighting a critical unmet need. Administration of natriuretic peptides (nesiritide or ularitide), vasopressin antagonism, and ultrafiltration, in addition to standard diuretic regimens have not shown consistent clinical benefits in patients with acute decompensated HF.

### Acute kidney injury in acute heart failure-when to worry and when not to worry? [^177592d3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, a degree of acute renal impairment would be expected and acceptable while trying to achieve adequate decongestion in patients with acute or decompensated heart failure. If clinicians are not aware that this can hamper the initiation or continuation of heart failure medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEi/ARB), angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. The introduction of RAAS inhibitor medications is associated with efferent arteriolar vasodilatation, drop in intraglomerular filtration pressure and decrease in GFR. The introduction of SGLT2 inhibitors is associated with increased sodium delivery to distal tubule, causing afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and a drop in GFR, which aids in preservation of the kidney function in the long run as shown in the large SGLT inhibitor studies of heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction (Fig. 2). While concerns regarding worsening renal function and hyperkalemia in progressive CKD frequently lead to discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors, the Renin–Angiotensin System Inhibition in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease or STOP – ACEi trial has shown that stopping RAAS inhibitors is not associated with change in the long-term rate of decline in eGFR.

AKI is common in patients at admission with acute heart failure, related to renal arterial hypoperfusion and renal venous congestion. Further AKI happens during hospital admission due to decongestion and further haemodynamic changes. These haemodynamic changes are potentially reversible and do not have long-term adverse consequences, as shown in a meta-analysis of 13 studies where AKI with decongestion was associated with lower mortality and patients who had no AKI and remained congested. AKI can also happen due to non-haemodynamic tubular injury such as sepsis and nephrotoxic drugs, and it is important to distinguish between the two to guide further decongestion therapy and predict prognosis. The rise in serum creatinine and tubular injury markers during adequate decongestion predicts a better prognosis, compared with patients with no decongestion and no rise in creatinine. Hence it is important to achieve rapid and adequate diuresis or decongestion with acute heart failure in hospital, perhaps within first 3 days of admission, accepting minor AKI that usually recovers; however, patients should be closely monitored to identify and treat for sepsis and other non-haemodynamic causes to avoid irreversible AKI. Worsening or persistent congestion despite adequate diuretic therapy characterized by worsening or persistent symptoms of heart failure with concomitant worsening renal impairment would be a cause for concern and may indicate irreversible AKI (Fig. 3).

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors as an early, first-line therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^ee144f5b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) often coexists with HF due to shared risk factors and pathophysiology, and also as a consequence of HF itself.SGLT2 inhibitors may cause an initial decline in eGFR. Concomitant treatment with loop diuretics and thiazides may predispose, especially in patients with acute HF, to excessive diuresis, dehydration, symptomatic hypotension and pre‐renal failure. However, even if evidence is still limited, no excess in acute renal failure was reported in EMPA‐RESPONSE‐AHF and in the larger EMPULSE trial. In EMPA‐RESPONSE‐AHF, diuretic response, measured as weight change per 40 mg furosemide, was similar, whereas urinary output until day 4 was significantly larger, with empagliflozin versus placebo. Diuresis was mostly related with glycosuria and osmotic diuresis, with no increase in natriuresis, both in diabetic and non‐diabetic patients. Overall, these data suggest that the diuretic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is not their main mechanism of action and should not have a major impact on kidney function also in patients with acute HF. In a small study, including 100 diabetic patients hospitalized for decompensated HF, dapagliflozin significantly improved urine output, total fluid loss, and fluid balance, with no significant change in serum potassium or kidney function. Thus, adding a SGLT2 inhibitor may lead to a slight increase in diuresis and may allow a decrease in loop diuretic doses.

### Urinary sodium evaluation: the missing target for diuretic treatment optimization in acute heart failure patients? Reply [^695a137f]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The Authors point to their subanalysis of the small DRAIN study in 80 patients, where they evaluated early (2 h) spot urinary sodium content and surrogate outcome measures and found similar results as compared with our analyses. 2 Our results should be interpreted slightly different, considering we evaluated total urinary sodium content over 6 h, which is probably a better representation of total natriuretic response to a given diuretic dose than spot urinary sodium. 3, 4, 5 With regard to the inotrope/vasopressor regimen not being standardized in our cohort, we consider these therapies only in very selected patients, according to the European Society of Cardiology HF guidelines, where they are only advocated in a small proportion of acute HF patients with severe hypotension. 6 In our study, the prognostic information of urinary sodium content at 6 h was unchanged by adjusting for inotrope/vasopressor use [hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–1.08, P = 0.008, per 10 mmol decrease (n = 146)] or left ventricular ejection fraction [(HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.08, P = 0.003, per 10 mmol decrease (n = 157)]. Change in natriuretic peptide level was only available in a subset of patients at 24 h after admission, and was not different in tertiles of urinary sodium (P = 0.69 and P = 0.67 for absolute and relative change, respectively).

We do not think worsening renal function (WRF), as used by the Authors, is an appropriate surrogate endpoint in acute HF patients without considering natriuretic/diuretic response. WRF in a patient with good natriuresis is not true WRF and should be termed pseudo‐WRF, and cannot directly be compared with WRF in patients with poor natriuresis/diuretic response, according to most recent position papers on how to evaluate renal function in HF. 7, 8 For instance, in our cohort and using different definitions, WRF was consistently more frequent in patients with the highest urinary sodium content at 6 h. Yet, the prognostic information of urinary sodium at 6 h was unaffected by the occurrence of WRF, and WRF itself was not independently associated with clinical outcome. This again highlights not to use serum creatinine/WRF as a response marker during decongestion in acute HF.

### Continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for acute heart failure [^aa2ec465]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute heart failure (AHF) is new onset of, or a sudden worsening of, chronic heart failure characterised by congestion in about 95% of cases or end-organ hypoperfusion in 5% of cases. Treatment often requires urgent escalation of diuretic therapy, mainly through hospitalisation. This Cochrane review evaluated the efficacy of intravenous loop diuretics strategies in treating AHF in individuals with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification III or IV and fluid overload.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intravenous continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for the initial treatment of acute heart failure in adults.

Search Methods

We identified trials through systematic searches of bibliographic databases and in clinical trials registers including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CPCI-S on the Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry platform (ICTRP), and the European Union Trials register. We conducted reference checking and citation searching, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. The latest search was performed on 29 February 2024.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with AHF, NYHA classification III or IV, regardless of aetiology or ejection fraction, where trials compared intravenous continuous infusion of loop diuretics with intermittent bolus injection in AHF. We excluded trials with chronic stable heart failure, cardiogenic shock, renal artery stenosis, or end-stage renal disease. Additionally, we excluded studies combining loop diuretics with hypertonic saline, inotropes, vasoactive medications, or renal replacement therapy and trials where diuretic dosing was protocol-driven to achieve a target urine output, due to confounding factors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened papers for inclusion and reviewed full-texts. Outcomes included weight loss, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission following discharge, and occurrence of acute kidney injury. We performed risk of bias assessment and meta-analysis where data permitted and assessed certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

The review included seven RCTs, spanning 32 hospitals in seven countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. Data collection ranged from eight months to six years. Following exclusion of participants in subgroups with confounding treatments and different clinical settings, 681 participants were eligible for review. These additional study characteristics, coupled with our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, improve the applicability of the body of the evidence as they reflect real-world clinical practice. Meta-analysis was feasible for net weight loss, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission, and acute kidney injury. Literature review and narrative analysis explored daily fluid balance; cardiovascular mortality; B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) change; N-terminal-proBNP change; and adverse incidents such as ototoxicity, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances. Risk of bias assessment revealed two studies with low overall risk, four with some concerns, and one with high risk. All sensitivity analyses excluded trials at high risk of bias. Only narrative analysis was conducted for 'daily fluid balance' due to diverse data presentation methods across two studies (169 participants, the evidence was very uncertain about the effect). Results of narrative analysis varied. For instance, one study reported higher daily fluid balance within the first 24 hours in the continuous infusion group compared to the bolus injection group, whereas there was no difference in fluid balance beyond this time point. Continuous intravenous infusion of loop diuretics may result in mean net weight loss of 0.86 kg more than bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) 0.86 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.28; 5 trials, 497 participants; P < 0.001, I² = 21%; very low-certainty evidence). Importantly, sensitivity analysis excluding trials with high risk of bias showed there was insufficient evidence for a difference in bodyweight loss between groups (MD 0.70 kg, 95% CI -0.06 to 1.46; 3 trials, 378 participants; P = 0.07, I² = 0%). There may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality between continuous infusion and bolus injection (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.90; 5 trials, 530 participants; P = 0.19, I² = 4%; low-certainty evidence). Despite sensitivity analysis, the direction of the evidence remained unchanged. No trials measured cardiovascular mortality. There may be little to no difference in the length of hospital stay between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -1.10 days, 95% CI -4.84 to 2.64; 4 trials, 211 participants; P = 0.57, I² = 88%; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis improved heterogeneity; however, the direction of the evidence remained unchanged. There may be little to no difference in the readmission to hospital between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.16; 3 trials, 400 participants; P = 0.31, I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis continued to show insufficient evidence for a difference in the readmission to hospital between groups. There may be little to no difference in the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse event between continuous infusion and bolus injection of intravenous loop diuretics (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.49; 3 trials, 491 participants; P = 0.92, I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis continued to show that continuous infusion may make little to no difference on the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse events compared to the bolus injection of intravenous loop diuretics.

Authors' Conclusions

Analysis of available data comparing two delivery methods of diuretics in acute heart failure found that the current data are insufficient to show superiority of one strategy intervention over the other. Our findings were based on trials meeting stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure validity. Despite previous reviews suggesting advantages of continuous infusion over bolus injections, our review found insufficient evidence to support or refute this. However, our review, which excluded trials with clinical confounders and RCTs with high risk of bias, offers the most robust conclusion to date.

### Early treatment with a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor in high-risk patients with acute heart failure: rationale for and design of the EMPA-AHF trial [^9878d25c]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

The aim of the EMPA-AHF trial is to clarify whether early initiation of a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor before clinical stabilization is safe and beneficial for patients with acute heart failure (AHF) who are at a high risk of adverse events.

Methods

The EMPA-AHF trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial examining the efficacy and safety of early initiation of empagliflozin (10 mg once daily). In total, 500 patients admitted for AHF will be randomized 1:1 to either empagliflozin 10 mg daily or placebo at 47 sites in Japan. Study entry requires hospitalization for AHF with dyspnoea, signs of volume overload, elevated natriuretic peptide, and at least one of the following criteria: estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2; already taking ≥ 40 mg of furosemide daily before hospitalization; and urine output of < 300 mL within 2 hours after an adequate dose of intravenous furosemide. Patients will be randomized within 12 hours of hospital presentation, with treatment continued up to 90 days. The primary outcome is the clinical benefit of empagliflozin on the win ratio for a hierarchical composite endpoint consisting of death within 90 days, heart failure rehospitalization within 90 days, worsening heart failure during hospitalization, and urine output within 48 hours after treatment initiation.

Conclusion

The EMPA-AHF trial is the first to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early initiation of empagliflozin in patients with AHF considered to be at high risk under conventional treatment.

### Natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy in acute heart failure: a pragmatic randomized trial [^7f50c60e]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Following from the observation that early assessment of spot urinary sodium within 1–2 h after initiation of intravenous loop diuretic treatment was shown to be an accurate marker of subsequent 6 h natriuretic response, a natriuretic response prediction equation (NRPE) was developed. In a prospective pre–post study, the implementation of the NRPE resulted in increased urine output, net fluid loss and weight loss compared with the days preceding this. More recently, the nonrandomized results of the pre–post Effect of a Standardized Diuretic Protocol in Acute Heart Failure Study (ENACT) study were presented at the recent ESC HF congress (Protocolized natriuresis-guided decongestion improves diuretic response: the multicenter ENACT-HF study. Dauw, J. et al. submitted). Using a simplified version of the ESC HF guidelines treatment approach, natriuresis-guided loop diuretic therapy was associated with more natriuresis (282 mmol versus 174 mmol) at 24 h compared with patients treated with SOC. These findings of a significant effect of a natriuresis-guided therapy to increase natriuresis from ENACT are now confirmed with the randomized data from the PUSH-AHF trial.

### Clinical importance of urinary sodium excretion in acute heart failure [^edb5e1a0]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This single‐centre study evaluated consecutive patients with the primary diagnosis of AHF that were prospectively included in an AHF protocol, admitted between 1 July 2017 until 31 December 2018 at the University Medical Center Groningen, a large tertiary cardiology centre in Groningen, The Netherlands. Diagnosis was based on the ESC heart failure guidelines, with patients presenting with signs and symptoms of congestion, requiring intravenous diuretic therapy. 1 Specifically, we imposed an AHF protocol to improve and standardize AHF care at our institution. All patients admitted for AHF were treated for at least 24 h at the coronary care unit, received intravenous vasodilators when systolic blood pressure was > 110 mmHg at admission, and all received bumetanide as the preferred loop diuretic. There was no protocol specifically determining the dose of bumetanide, which was entirely at the discretion of the treating physician. Furthermore, as a measure to improve calculation of fluid balance and urine output, urine collections were done the first 6 h after first intravenous diuretic (0–6 h), followed by 6 to 24 h (6–24 h), and again followed by 24 h urine collections over the next 3 days (24–48, 48–72, and 72–96 h). Measurement from these timed urine collections included urinary creatinine and urinary sodium. All information on urinary volume and urinary measurements were available to the treating physicians.

### Decongestion in acute heart failure [^efbf6bac]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Congestion is a major reason for hospitalization in acute heart failure (HF). Therapeutic strategies to manage congestion include diuretics, vasodilators, ultrafiltration, vasopressin antagonists, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and potentially also novel therapies such as gut sequesterants and serelaxin. Uncertainty exists with respect to the appropriate decongestion strategy for an individual patient. In this review, we summarize the benefit and risk profiles for these decongestion strategies and provide guidance on selecting an appropriate approach for different patients. An evidence-based initial approach to congestion management involves high-dose i.v. diuretics with addition of vasodilators for dyspnoea relief if blood pressure allows. To enhance diuresis or overcome diuretic resistance, options include dual nephron blockade with thiazide diuretics or natriuretic doses of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Vasopressin antagonists may improve aquaresis and relieve dyspnoea. If diuretic strategies are unsuccessful, then ultrafiltration may be considered. Ultrafiltration should be used with caution in the setting of worsening renal function. This review is based on discussions among scientists, clinical trialists, and regulatory representatives at the 9th Global Cardio Vascular Clinical Trialists Forum in Paris, France, from 30 November to 1 December 2012.

Diuretics in hospitalized patients: decongestion strategy (COR/LOE). COR 1, LOE B-NR states that patients with heart failure (HF) admitted with evidence of significant fluid overload should be promptly treated with intravenous loop diuretics to improve symptoms and reduce morbidity. COR 1, LOE B-NR states that for patients hospitalized with HF, therapy with diuretics and other guideline-directed medications should be titrated with a goal to resolve clinical evidence of congestion to reduce symptoms and rehospitalizations. COR 1, LOE B-NR states that for patients requiring diuretic treatment during hospitalization for HF, the discharge regimen should include a plan for adjustment of diuretics to decrease rehospitalizations. COR 2a, LOE B-NR states that in patients hospitalized with HF when diuresis is inadequate to relieve symptoms and signs of congestion, it is reasonable to intensify the diuretic regimen using either a higher doses of intravenous loop diuretics or b. addition of a second diuretic.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^cf476109]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

CARRESS-HF stepped pharmacological care algorithm — For urine output (UO), UO goals are to be assessed daily from randomization to 96 h with tiered actions at UO > 5 L/d (reduce current diuretic regimen if desired), UO 3–5 L/d (continue current diuretic regimen), and UO < 3 L/d (see diuretic grid); at 24-h and 48-h assessments, apply UO recommendations as above and advance to the next step on the grid if UO < 3 L/d, and consider dopamine or dobutamine at 2 μg·kg−1·h−1 if SBP < 110 mm Hg and EF < 40% or RV systolic dysfunction and consider nitroglycerin or nesiritide if SBP > 120 mm Hg (any EF) and severe symptoms; at 72- and 96-h assessments, repeat the same UO-based steps and consider hemodynamic-guided IV therapy, LVAD, dialysis, or ultrafiltration crossover.

### Spot urinary sodium as a biomarker of diuretic response in acute heart failure [^8a6aeeea]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

From a logistical point of view, using a spot baseline and a 2‐hour UNa post‐diuretic assessment instead of a 24‐hour UNa or a partial sample collection has several advantages: (1) early accurate prediction of poor natriuretic response (2) easy to implement in daily clinical practice, and (3) yields a more dynamic assessment, useful for short‐term monitoring, guiding therapy, and early recognition of complications.

In this article, we discuss some limitations, flaws, and aspects not previously discussed in the ESC guidelines that we consider critical for the correct clinical use and interpretation of UNa analysis as a biomarker of diuretic response in AHF.
The current recommendation did not account for the severity or distribution of fluid overload. We speculate that the current recommendation applies to patients with overt fluid overload but probably lacks usefulness in AHF and predominant fluid redistribution, a situation in which an aggressive diuretic strategy may be harmful. Further studies should focus on the influence of fluid overload status at baseline.
UNa as a biomarker loses strength and usefulness after day 1, as high urine output classically turns into hypotonic urine in patients with HF and as the overall urinary sodium excretion tends to decrease rapidly with decongestion. Studies suggest that in AHF, UNa decreases after 24 hours for diverse reasons. The diuretic response, natriuresis, might be more effective in the first hours and after an initially favorable response clinicians might be tempted to decrease the diuretic dosage, thereby limiting natriuresis after 24 hours. The neurohormonal activation and the enhanced tubular sodium reabsorption in other parts of the nephron, other than the loop of Henle, "braking phenomenon" after day 1 may play a role. This means that the high levels of natriuresis after a first dose of diuretics decline over time as a result of both hemodynamic changes at the glomerulus as well as adaptive changes in the distal nephron. Therefore, consecutive doses of diuretics are less effective. Additionally, a dose of loop diuretic increases urinary excretion of sodium chloride for several hours (influenced by its half‐life), but this is followed by a period of very low sodium excretion termed "post‐diuretic sodium retention."Finally, after 24 hours from initiation of treatment, large hypotonic volumes of urine generated contain more free water and proportionally diluted sodium concentration, which is lower when evaluated in a spot urine sample. This might alter measurements of spot UNa concentrations and to a lesser degree in sample urine collections. This overproduction of free water urine with low electrolytes can be highly variable according to their kidney intrinsic response or resistance to diuretics and therefore can be earlier or later in different patients with AHF after diuretic infusion.
The current recommendation on UNa does not account for kidney function: Normal kidney function (glomerular and tubular) is crucial for the kidney management of sodium and its reabsorption. At a normal glomerular filtration rate of 180 L/day filtered with plasma water sodium of 150 mEq/L, the filtered sodium load is 27 000 mEq/day. UNa measured by spot samples can be affected by glomerular filtration rate, by the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), salt intake, intravenous sodium infusion as hypertonic saline solution with furosemide or bicarbonate, and importantly by loop diuretics administered before admission. Concomitant acute kidney injury, particularly acute tubular necrosis, the leading cause of intrinsic renal acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients, is a common complication of admitted patients with AHF. It alters UNa measurements, leading to characteristically high UNa levels of > 50 mEq/L, and patients usually develop anuria, which would be contrary to the ESC recommended approach. CKD is particularly relevant because it affects up to 40% to 70% of individuals with symptomatic HF. The classically described inability of patients with CKD to reabsorb sodium salt wasting state occurs because of osmotic diuresis induced by increased urea excretion per nephron related in part to the decreased number of functioning nephrons, because of the tubular injury due to the underlying disease, and because of the inability to acutely activate the natriuretic mechanisms. Proximal tubule reabsorption dysfunction is common in patients with CKD and HF. Patients with advanced kidney disease and estimated glomerular filtration rate below 25 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 may have a quadruple obligatory sodium excretion when compared with a normal subject (10–40 mEq/day versus 5 mEq/day), making patients with CKD classically less responsive to diuretics and confounding the diuretic titration guided by UNa. These important features, the presence or not of kidney disease, must be taken into account when interpreting UNa in patients with AHF. When the kidneys that, despite intrinsic disease, namely CKD, or diuretics before admission for AHF continue to avidly reabsorb sodium after loop diuretics administration indicates that they still have some preserved tubular function. This highlights the need to study early UNa's utility across CKD categories. Fractional excretion of sodium may be more accurate than spot UNa concentration and short time frame sodium excretion by sample collections because it directly measures sodium management by kidneys with no influence in the amount of urinary volume, unlike UNa concentration, which is affected by the rate of free water reabsorption. For example, large urinary volume output falsely dilutes sodium results if measured by spot urinalysis and not the whole urine sample. A patient who is water but not sodium avid with low urine volume may have high urine sodium concentration despite having little sodium in the urine. Currently, new natriuretic equations are being developed and validated to predict loop diuretic response in patients with heart failure that may address this issue in part with spot urine measures. Thus, we speculate that fractional excretion of sodium and new natriuretic equations may be less biased alternatives to UNa measured in spot sample urine (mmol/L or meq/L) as gold standard measurement of sodium 24‐hour urine is not practical for early titration of diuretic dose.
UNa and its relationship with other surrogates of decongestion: UNa trajectory requires parallel evaluation of signs of decongestion as urinary output or others (eg, weight loss). For example, a decreasing slope of UNa in a patient with adequate diuretic urine output and decongestion could be a favorable response to diuretics inviting the reduction of the diuretic dose. In contrast, a decreasing level of UNa in a patient with persistent low urine output and hydric overload may imply diuretic resistance. Therefore, a hourly urine output must prevail over UNa measures. Unfortunately, also, diuretic titration to urine output has minimal trial evidence and clear limitations, yet substantial clinical experience still exists.
The type of diuretics. Traditional diuretic enhances natriuretic response; however, data on the role of UNa for monitoring response to aquaretics (eg, tolvaptan) or sodium‐glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors are scarce. Theoretically, in this latter setting, UNa will lose clinical usefulness. The osmotic diuresis due to glycosuria rather than natriuresis may also lead to lower spot urinary sodium concentration despite increased urinary output. Because sodium‐glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors have become key in AHF therapy, this interaction is important when using urine sodium‐based diuretic titration guidance. Subjects who have been treated previously with furosemide have a lesser increase in fractional excretion of sodium after the administration of furosemide but have a greater natriuretic response to the addition of chlorothiazide, suggesting increased tubular sodium reabsorption at the thiazide‐sensitive site in the distal tubule when distal sodium delivery is chronically increased by furosemide. Also, both oral and intravenous thiazide diuretics generate higher spot urine sodium as compared with tolvaptan. Thus, further studies are warranted to evaluate the clinical usefullness of UNa with different "combo" diuretic approaches.
Other limitations: UNa is potentially influenced by the amount of sodium of the diet and chronic use of diuretics. Unfortunately, accurate data about the magnitude of this influence are lacking in patients with HF. In patients with HF, other concomitant disorders characterized by reduced effective arterial blood perfusion, such as splanchnic vasodilatation and sequestration of fluid in the peritoneal cavity and arterial shunts (cirrhosis) or low plasma oncotic pressure (in some patients with nephrotic syndrome) can influence UNa. Cirrhotic, hepatorenal syndrome, with characteristic low UNa should be ruled out and excluded from this guided diuretic therapy because of its antagonistic diuretic management.

### Hemoconcentration-guided diuresis in heart failure [^2fe5a830]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

One quarter of patients hospitalized for heart failure are readmitted within 30 days, perhaps related to ineffective decongestion. Limited data exist guiding the extent and duration of diuresis in patients hospitalized for heart failure. The objective of this review was to determine the prognostic value of hemoconcentration, or the relative increase in the cellular elements in blood, in patients hospitalized for heart failure and to clarify its role in guiding inpatient diuretic practices. Six post hoc retrospective studies from 2010 to 2013 were available for review. Hemoconcentration was consistently associated with markers of aggressive fluid removal, including higher diuretic dosing and reduced body weight, but increased risk of in-hospital worsening renal function. Despite this, hemoconcentration was associated with improved short-term mortality and rehospitalization. Hemoconcentration is a practical, readily available, noninvasive, economically feasible strategy to help guide diuresis and monitor congestion relief in patients hospitalized for worsening heart failure. Clinicians should strongly consider using changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit as an adjunct to other available measures of decongestion and clinical acumen in inpatient heart failure care.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in patients with acute heart Failure [^ac318f0f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The primary goals during acute heart failure (AHF) hospitalization are decongestion and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) optimization. Unlike diuretics or other GDMT, early dapagliflozin initiation could achieve both AHF goals.

Objectives

The authors aimed to assess the diuretic efficacy and safety of early dapagliflozin initiation in AHF.

Methods

In a multicenter, open-label study, 240 patients were randomized within 24 hours of hospital presentation for hypervolemic AHF to dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or structured usual care with protocolized diuretic titration until day 5 or hospital discharge. The primary outcome, diuretic efficiency expressed as cumulative weight change per cumulative loop diuretic dose, was compared across treatment assignment using a proportional odds model adjusted for baseline weight. Secondary and safety outcomes were adjudicated by a blinded committee.

Results

For diuretic efficiency, there was no difference between dapagliflozin and usual care (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.41–1.02; P = 0.06). Dapagliflozin was associated with reduced loop diuretic doses (560 mg [Q1-Q3: 260–1,150 mg] vs 800 mg [Q1-Q3: 380–1,715 mg]; P = 0.006) and fewer intravenous diuretic up-titrations (P ≤ 0.05) to achieve equivalent weight loss as usual care. Early dapagliflozin initiation did not increase diabetic, renal, or cardiovascular safety events. Dapagliflozin was associated with improved median 24-hour natriuresis (P = 0.03) and urine output (P = 0.005), expediting hospital discharge over the study period.

Conclusions

Early dapagliflozin during AHF hospitalization is safe and fulfills a component of GDMT optimization. Dapagliflozin was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in weight-based diuretic efficiency but was associated with evidence for enhanced diuresis among patients with AHF. (Efficacy and Safety of Dapagliflozin in Acute Heart Failure [DICTATE-AHF]; NCT04298229).

### Effects of nesiritide and predictors of urine output in acute decompensated heart failure: results from ASCEND-HF (acute study of clinical effectiveness of nesiritide and decompensated heart failure) [^c5861bf5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine if nesiritide increases diuresis in congestive heart failure patients.

Background

In the ASCEND-HF (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide and Decompensated Heart Failure), 7,141 patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) were randomized to receive nesiritide or placebo for 24 to 168 h, in addition to standard care. There were minimal effects of nesiritide on survival, future hospitalizations, and symptoms. However, whether or not nesiritide increases diuresis in ADHF patients is unknown.

Methods

Urine output was measured in 5,864 subjects; of these, 5,320 received loop diuretics and had dose data recorded. Loop diuretics other than furosemide were converted to furosemide equivalent doses. A total of 4,881 patients had complete data. We used logistic regression models to identify the impact of nesiritide on urine output and the factors associated with high urine output.

Results

Median (25th, 75th percentiles) 24-h urine output was 2,280 (1,550, 3,280) mL with nesiritide and 2,200 (1,550, 3,200) mL with placebo (p = NS). Loop diuretic dose (furosemide equivalent) was 80 (40, 140) mg with both nesiritide and placebo. Diuretic dose was a strong predictor of urine output. Other independent predictors included: male sex, greater body mass index, higher diastolic blood pressure, elevated jugular venous pressure, recent weight gain, and lower blood urea nitrogen. The addition of nesiritide did not change urine output. None of the interaction terms between nesiritide and predictors affected the urine output prediction.

Conclusions

Nesiritide did not increase urine output in patients with ADHF. Higher diuretic dose was a strong predictor of higher urine output, but neurohormonal activation (as evidenced by blood urea nitrogen concentration) and lower blood pressure limited diuresis.

### Clinical importance of urinary sodium excretion in acute heart failure [^89618c88]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

Urinary sodium assessment has recently been proposed as a target for loop diuretic therapy in acute heart failure (AHF). We aimed to investigate the time course, clinical correlates and prognostic importance of urinary sodium excretion in AHF.

Methods and results

In a prospective cohort of 175 consecutive patients with an admission for AHF we evaluated urinary sodium excretion 6 h after initiation of loop diuretic therapy. Clinical outcome was all‐cause mortality or heart failure rehospitalization. Mean age was 71 ± 14 years, and 44% were female. Median urinary sodium excretion was 130 (67–229) mmol at 6 h, 347 (211–526) mmol at 24 h, and decreased from day 2 to day 4. Lower urinary sodium excretion was independently associated with male gender, younger age, renal dysfunction and pre‐admission loop diuretic use. There was a strong association between urinary sodium excretion at 6 h and 24 h urine volume (beta = 0.702, P < 0.001). Urinary sodium excretion after 6 h was a strong predictor of all‐cause mortality after a median follow‐up of 257 days (hazard ratio 3.81, 95% confidence interval 1.92–7.57; P < 0.001 for the lowest vs. the highest tertile of urinary sodium excretion) independent of established risk factors and urinary volume. Urinary sodium excretion was not associated with heart failure rehospitalization.

Conclusion

In a modern, unselected, contemporary AHF population, low urinary sodium excretion during the first 6 h after initiation of loop diuretic therapy is associated with lower urine output in the first day and independently associated with all‐cause mortality.

### Extracorporeal ultrafiltration for fluid Overload in heart failure: current status and prospects for further research [^e7001b90]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

UNRESPONSIVENESS TO DIURETIC AGENTS IN HEART FAILURE

Diuretic agents remain the cornerstone of therapy for fluid overload. Although effective early in heart failure, diuretic agents become increasingly ineffective with disease progression due to the development of unresponsiveness in a significant subset of patients. Excellent reviews describe the mechanisms leading to decreased diuretic agent responsiveness. In patients with heart failure, impaired absorption, decreased renal blood flow, azotemia, and proteinuria all result in reduced levels of active diuretic agents in the tubular lumen. Recently proposed definitions of diuretic resistance include persistent congestion, despite adequate and escalating doses of diuretic agents equivalent to ≥ 80 mg/day furosemide; the amount of sodium excretion as a percentage of filtered load below 0.2%; and failure to excrete at least 90 mmol of sodium within 72 h of a 160-mg twice-daily dose of furosemide. Metrics for diuretic agent response have also been proposed, including weight loss per 40 mg of furosemide or equivalent; net fluid loss per milligram of loop diuretic agent; and natriuretic response to furosemide as urinary sodium-to-urinary furosemide ratio.

The clinical hallmarks of diuretic agent resistance are insufficient symptom relief, higher risk of in-hospital worsening of heart failure, increased mortality after discharge, and a 3-fold increase in rehospitalization rates. Among more than 50,000 patients enrolled in the ADHERE (Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry) study, only 33% lost ≥ 2.27 kg (5 lbs), and 16% gained weight during hospitalization. Nearly one-half of hospitalized patients with heart failure are discharged with residual fluid excess after receiving conventional diuretic therapies. Regardless of diuretic strategy, 42% of acutely decompensated heart failure subjects in the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial reached the composite endpoint of death, rehospitalization, or emergency department visit at 60 days. Vasopressin and adenosine-A1 receptor antagonists, exogenous natriuretic peptides, and low-dose dopamine, studied as either a complement or a replacement for conventional diuretic therapies, can decrease fluid overload in the short term but have failed to improve long-term outcomes.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^f38c27af]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Diuretics in hospitalized heart failure: synopsis and supportive context. Intravenous loop diuretic therapy provides the most rapid and effective treatment for signs and symptoms of congestion leading to hospitalization for HF. Titration to achieve effective diuresis may require doubling of initial doses, adding a thiazide diuretic, or adding an MRA that has diuretic effects in addition to its cardiovascular benefits. A major goal of therapy is resolution of the signs and symptoms of congestion before discharge, as persistent congestion scored at discharge has been associated with higher rates of rehospitalizations and mortality. Most patients who have required intravenous diuretic therapy during hospitalization for HF will require prescription of loop diuretics at discharge to decrease recurrence of symptoms and hospitalization. As background, diuretic therapy with oral furosemide was the cornerstone of HF therapy for ≥ 20 years before construction of the modern bases of evidence for HF therapies.

### Natriuresis-guided therapy in acute heart failure: rationale and design of the pragmatic urinary sodium-based treatment algoritHm in acute heart failure (PUSH-AHF) trial [^0abaeb2e]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Baseline loop diuretic dose

Baseline loop diuretic dose (the first in‐hospital dose of loop diuretics administered at the emergency department, irrespective of loop diuretic administration in the pre‐hospital setting) in both groups will be determined based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of the patient at presentation and his/her outpatient loop diuretic dose (Table 2). A maximum bolus dose of 5 mg of bumetanide will be used. The bolus dose will be continued in twice daily dosing (every 12 h). Use of continuous administration of loop diuretics is actively discouraged. In the standard of care group this is not adjusted according to protocol, yet can be altered by the treating physician if clinically indicated, for instance based on congestion status or fluid balance according to best practice consensus. The urinary sodium values (of all spot and timed urine collections) in the standard of care group will be blinded till the end of the study.

Table 2
Determination of loop diuretic starting dose in all patients

Natriuresis‐guided treatment protocol

Based on the spot urinary sodium values obtained from 2 h onwards in the natriuresis‐guided group, decongestive therapy will be adjusted using the PUSH‐AHF treatment algorithm (Figure 3). In brief, if spot urinary sodium is < 70 mmol/L and/or diuresis < 150 ml/h, patients will be eligible (if still congested) for an additional bolus of loop diuretic, which is double the previous dose with a maximum bolus of 5 mg bumetanide. If a patient has received two doses of 5 mg of bumetanide at the two previous time points and has insufficient natriuresis or diuresis at two consecutive time points, the initiation of combination diuretic therapy is indicated (Figure 3A). More details are provided in online supplementary Methods S1. The above protocol will be repeated at 12, 18, 24, and 36 h (Figure 3B). At every time point physicians will first assess the congestion status before administering additional doses of diuretics. After 48 h, adjustment of the decongestive therapy is left at the discretion of the treating physician.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^7e998718]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Cardiorenal syndrome in right heart failure (RHF) — increased central venous pressure (CVP) and consequent rise in renal vein pressure worsen renal function even without decreased cardiac output, and increased CVP has been identified as an independent risk factor for impaired renal function in heart failure; clinical features include decreased urine output, worsening fluid retention, and increased diuretic requirements, with laboratory abnormalities of increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine; elevated and worsening serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen are independent predictors of adverse outcomes unless accompanied by significant decongestion in acute heart failure; these findings may limit aggressiveness in diuresis and using guideline-directed medical therapy, including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system–inhibiting agents, and may promote use of inotropes; increasing evidence of acute kidney injury with elevated right-sided filling pressures may motivate erroneous reduction of loop diuretic therapy, but this action may be deleterious, and if volume status is unclear or isolated RHF is a concern, placement of a PA catheter may be informative.

### Natriuretic equation to predict loop diuretic response in patients with heart Failure [^0adbc70e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most acute decompensated heart failure admissions are driven by congestion. However, residual congestion is common and often driven by the lack of reliable tools to titrate diuretic therapy. The authors previously developed a natriuretic response prediction equation (NRPE), which predicts sodium output using a spot urine sample collected 2 h after loop diuretic administration.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to validate the NRPE and describe proof-of-concept that the NRPE can be used to guide diuretic therapy.

Methods

Two cohorts were assembled: 1) the Diagnosing and Targeting Mechanisms of Diuretic Resistance (MDR) cohort was used to validate the NRPE to predict 6-h sodium output after a loop diuretic, which was defined as poor (< 50 mmol), suboptimal (< 100 mmol), or excellent (> 150 mmol); and 2) the Yale Diuretic Pathway (YDP) cohort, which used the NRPE to guide loop diuretic titration via a nurse-driven automated protocol.

Results

Evaluating 638 loop diuretic administrations, the NRPE showed excellent discrimination with areas under the curve ≥ 0.90 to predict poor, suboptimal, and excellent natriuretic response, and outperformed clinically obtained net fluid loss (p < 0.05 for all cutpoints). In the YDP cohort (n = 161) using the NRPE to direct therapy mean daily urine output (1.8 ± 0.9 l vs. 3.0 ± 0.8 l), net fluid output (-1.1 ± 0.9 l vs. -2.1 ± 0.9 l), and weight loss (-0.3 ± 0.3 kg vs. -2.5 ± 0.3 kg) improved substantially following initiation of the YDP (p < 0.001 for all pre-post comparisons).

Conclusions

Natriuretic response can be rapidly and accurately predicted by the NRPE, and this information can be used to guide diuretic therapy during acute decompensated heart failure. Additional study of diuresis guided by the NRPE is warranted.

### Rationale and design of the DECONGEST (diuretic treatment in acute heart failure with volume overload guided by serial spot urine sodium assessment) study [^9a028b3e]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate whether early-combination diuretic therapy guided by serial post-diuretic urine sodium concentration (UNa +) assessments in acute heart failure (AHF) facilitates safe and effective decongestion.

Methods

The Diuretic Treatment in Acute Heart Failure with Volume Overload Guided by Serial Spot Urine Sodium Assessment (DECONGEST) study is a pragmatic, 2-center, randomized, parallel-arm, open-label study aiming to enroll 104 patients with AHF and clinically evident fluid overload requiring treatment with intravenous loop diuretics. Patients are randomized to receive standard of care or a bundled approach comprising: (1) systematic post-diuretic UNa + assessments until successful decongestion, defined as no remaining clinical signs of fluid overload with a post-diuretic UNa + ≤ 80 mmol/L; (2) thrice-daily intravenous loop diuretic bolus therapy, with dosing according to estimated glomerular filtration rate; (3) upfront use of intravenous acetazolamide (500 mg once daily [OD]); and (4) full nephron blockade with high-dose oral chlorthalidone (100 mg OD) and intravenous canreonate (200 mg OD) for diuretic resistance, defined as persisting signs of fluid overload with a post-diuretic UNa + ≤ 80 mmol/L. The primary endpoint of the DECONGEST study is a hierarchical composite of (1) survival at 30 days; (2) days alive and out of hospital or care facility up to 30 days; and (3) greater relative decrease in natriuretic peptide levels from baseline to day 30.

Conclusion

The DECONGEST study aims to determine whether an intensive diuretic regimen focused on early combination therapy, guided by serial post-diuretic UNa+ assessments, safely enhances decongestion, warranting further evaluation in a larger trial powered for clinical events.

### Natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy in acute heart failure: a pragmatic randomized trial [^cb07209e]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Acute heart failure (AHF) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization in the world and associated with high morbidity and mortality. The main treatment goal in patients presenting with AHF is to reach euvolemia by the use of decongestive therapies, mainly loop diuretics. There is, however, great variation in how monitoring of diuretic response is handled after admission. Often surrogate measures of diuretic response are used such as weight loss, which have been shown to be insensitive, often inaccurate and slowly affected –. Furthermore, a large number of AHF patients display an insufficient diuretic response even early after the start of loop diuretic therapy, which is associated with residual congestion and an increased risk of mortality and heart failure (HF) rehospitalization –. Given the mode of action of loop diuretics, assessment of natriuresis could not only be a sensitive marker to assess response, but also be a potential treatment target to guide decongestive therapy. Several observational studies have shown that insufficient natriuresis following loop diuretic administration is associated with poor diuretic response and an increased risk of all-cause mortality and HF rehospitalization –. Additionally, greater sodium excretion and a net negative sodium balance have been shown to be associated with better clinical outcomes, whereas net negative fluid balance was not. So far, limited, nonrandomized data suggest using natriuresis as a marker to guide decongestive therapy in patients with AHF might be useful to improve diuretic response (Protocolized natriuresis-guided decongestion improves diuretic response: the multicenter ENACT-HF study. Dauw, J. et al. submitted). Despite this, current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) HF guidelines already suggest the early and repeated assessment of spot urinary sodium in patients admitted with AHF to guide diuretic treatment. Therefore, there is need for trial data to support these recommendations, and to provide randomized evidence on the use of a reliable, easily obtainable, inexpensive, readily available and implementable marker to assess response and guide treatment in patients with AHF. In this article, the Pragmatic Urinary Sodium-based algoritHm in Acute Heart Failure (PUSH-AHF) randomized clinical trial investigated the effectiveness of natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy on natriuresis and clinical outcomes in patients with AHF.

Prior studies comparing ultrafiltration with medical management for acute decompensated heart failure have yielded conflicting results. The AVOID-HF trial was designed as a definitive comparison of optimal ultrafiltration versus optimal diuretic-based medical therapy; unfortunately, the trial was terminated prematurely because of slow recruitment. The results of AVOID-HF nevertheless provide a rationale for well-designed, adequately powered trials to determine whether ultrafiltration has a role in the routine management of acute decompensated heart failure.

### Continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics in congestive heart failure [^10d4bf77]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Loop diuretics, when given as intermittent bolus injections in acutely decompensated heart failure, may cause fluctuations in intravascular volume, increased toxicity and development of tolerance. Continuous infusion has been proposed to avoid these complications and result in greater diuresis, hopefully leading to faster symptom resolution, decrease in morbidity and possibly, mortality.

Objectives

To compare the effects and adverse effects of continuous intravenous infusion of loop diuretics with those of bolus intravenous administration among patients with congestive heart failure Class III-IV.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1980 to 2003) and the HERDIN database. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of continuous intravenous infusion versus bolus intravenous administration of loop diuretics in congestive heart failure were included

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, methodological quality and did data extraction. Included studies were assessed for validity. Authors were contacted when feasible. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials.

Main Results

Eight trials involving 254 patients were included. In seven studies which reported on urine output, the output (as measured in cc/24 hours) was noted to be greater in patients given continuous infusion with a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 271 cc/24 hour (95%CI 93.1 to 449; p < 0.01). Electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) were not significantly different in the two treatment groups with a relative risk (RR) of 1.47 (95%CI 0.52 to 4.15; p = 0.5). Less adverse effects (tinnitus and hearing loss) were noted when continuous infusion was given, RR 0.06 (95%CI 0.01 to 0.44; p = 0.005). Based on a single study, the duration of hospital stay was significantly shortened by 3.1days with continuous infusion WMD -3.1 (95%CI -4.06 to -2.20; p < 0.0001) while cardiac mortality was not significantly different in the two treatment groups, RR 0.47 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.69; p < 0.0001). Based on two studies, all cause mortality was not significantly different in the two treatment groups, RR 0.52 (95%CI 0.38 to 0.71; p < 0.0001).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Currently available data are insufficient to confidently assess the merits of the two methods of giving intravenous diuretics. Based on small and relatively heterogenous studies, this review showed greater diuresis and a better safety profile when loop diuretics were given as continuous infusion. The existing data still does not allow definitive recommendations for clinical practice and larger studies should be done to more adequately settle this issue.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA 2005 heart failure — vasopressin receptor antagonists — Arginine vasopressin has cardiovascular and renal effects mediated through at least 2 receptor subtypes (V1a and V2); vasopressin levels are often elevated in HF with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and appear to be associated with adverse outcomes in the setting of low ejection fraction after myocardial infarction (MI). Early studies with 2 vasopressin receptor antagonists showed favorable changes in hemodynamics and urine output without significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate, with reductions in body weight and edema and normalization of serum sodium in hyponatremia, but the duration and significance of these clinical effects are not clear, and longer-term clinical trials are under way in chronic HF.

Results

Our search strategy resulted in 1435 articles. A total of 326 remained after excluding duplicates and irrelevant articles. After removing studies which met our exclusion criteria, 83 articles remained. An additional 41 studies were excluded based on the usage of diuretics, or the absence of a description of the hemodynamic parameters in the CFM arm (Fig. 1). Table 1 shows the characteristics of the remaining 36 randomized controlled trials. Thirteen studies did not target urine output in either GDT or CFM; seven studies only targeted urine output in the CFM protocol; and sixteen studies targeted urine output in both protocols. Hemodynamic monitoring devices and parameters used in the included studies are reported in Table 2. The amount of fluids infused during GDT and CFM in each study is reported in Additional file 1: Table S3. The risk of bias assessment is shown in Fig. 2. Of the 23 studies which included urine output as a target, fifteen studies had a threshold of 0.5 ml/kg/h (Table 2). The data of the limited studies in which the amount of urine output was reported are collected in Additional file 1: Table S4. The data on the six observational studies are reported in Additional file 1: Table S5 and Table S6.

### Clinical importance of urinary sodium excretion in acute heart failure [^79fa9fef]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Urinary sodium assessment has recently been proposed as a target for loop diuretic therapy in acute heart failure (AHF). We aimed to investigate the time course, clinical correlates and prognostic importance of urinary sodium excretion in AHF.

Methods and Results

In a prospective cohort of 175 consecutive patients with an admission for AHF we evaluated urinary sodium excretion 6 h after initiation of loop diuretic therapy. Clinical outcome was all-cause mortality or heart failure rehospitalization. Mean age was 71 ± 14years, and 44% were female. Median urinary sodium excretion was 130 (67–229) mmol at 6 h, 347 (211–526) mmol at 24h, and decreased from day 2 to day 4. Lower urinary sodium excretion was independently associated with male gender, younger age, renal dysfunction and pre-admission loop diuretic use. There was a strong association between urinary sodium excretion at 6 h and 24h urine volume (beta = 0.702, P < 0.001). Urinary sodium excretion after 6 h was a strong predictor of all-cause mortality after a median follow-up of 257days (hazard ratio 3.81, 95% confidence interval 1.92–7.57; P < 0.001 for the lowest vs. the highest tertile of urinary sodium excretion) independent of established risk factors and urinary volume. Urinary sodium excretion was not associated with heart failure rehospitalization.

Conclusion

In a modern, unselected, contemporary AHF population, low urinary sodium excretion during the first 6 h after initiation of loop diuretic therapy is associated with lower urine output in the first day and independently associated with all-cause mortality.

### A phenomapping tool and clinical score to identify low diuretic efficiency in acute decompensated heart failure [^c48c599f]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Individuals with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) have a varying response to diuretic therapy. Strategies for the early identification of low diuretic efficiency to inform decongestion therapies are lacking.

Objectives

The authors sought to develop and externally validate a machine learning-based phenomapping approach and integer-based diuresis score to identify patients with low diuretic efficiency.

Methods

Participants with ADHF from ROSE-AHF, CARRESS-HF, and ATHENA-HF were pooled in the derivation cohort (n = 794). Multivariable finite-mixture model-based phenomapping was performed to identify phenogroups based on diuretic efficiency (urine output over the first 72 hours per total intravenous furosemide equivalent loop diuretic dose). Phenogroups were externally validated in other pooled ADHF trials (DOSE/ESCAPE). An integer-based diuresis score (BAN-ADHF score: blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, natriuretic peptide levels, atrial fibrillation, diastolic blood pressure, hypertension and home diuretic, and heart failure hospitalization) was developed and validated based on predictors of the diuretic efficiency phenogroups to estimate the probability of low diuretic efficiency using the pooled ADHF trials described earlier. The associations of the BAN-ADHF score with markers and symptoms of congestion, length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and global well-being were assessed using adjusted regression models.

Results

Clustering identified 3 phenogroups based on diuretic efficiency: phenogroup 1 (n = 370; 47%) had lower diuretic efficiency (median: 13.1 mL/mg; Q1-Q3: 7.7–19.4 mL/mg) than phenogroups 2 (n = 290; 37%) and 3 (n = 134; 17%) (median: 17.8 mL/mg; Q1-Q3: 10.8–26.1 mL/mg and median: 35.3 mL/mg; Q1-Q3: 17.5–49.0 mL/mg, respectively) (P < 0.001). The median urine output difference in response to 80 mg intravenous twice-daily furosemide between the lowest and highest diuretic efficiency group (phenogroup 1 vs 3) was 3,520 mL/d. The BAN-ADHF score demonstrated good model performance for predicting the lowest diuretic efficiency phenogroup membership (C-index: 0.92 in DOSE/ESCAPE validation cohort) that was superior to measures of kidney function (creatinine or blood urea nitrogen), natriuretic peptide levels, or home diuretic dose (DeLong P < 0.001 for all). Net urine output in response to 80 mg intravenous twice-daily furosemide among patients with a low vs high (5 vs 20) BAN-ADHF score was 2,650 vs 660 mL per 24 hours, respectively. Participants with higher BAN-ADHF scores had significantly lower global well-being, higher natriuretic peptide levels on discharge, a longer in-hospital stay, and a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in both derivation and validation cohorts.

Conclusions

The authors developed and validated a phenomapping strategy and diuresis score for individuals with ADHF and differential response to diuretic therapy, which was associated with length of stay and mortality.

### Urinary composition during decongestive treatment in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^40fb53ad]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The urinary composition, including sodium (Na(+)) and chloride (Cl(-)) concentrations, might provide useful information in addition to urine output during decongestive treatment in heart failure.

Methods and Results

Consecutive patients with heart failure (n = 61), ejection fraction ≤ 45%, worsening symptoms, and scheduled treatment with intravenous loop diuretics were included. Patients received protocol-driven therapy until complete decongestion, assessed clinically and by echocardiography. Three consecutive 24-hour urinary collections were performed. With 2 mg (1–4 mg), 1 mg (0–2 mg), and 1 mg (0–1 mg) bumetanide administered in bolus during consecutive 24-hour intervals, in addition to combinational diuretic therapy in ≈70% and both oral spironolactone and vasodilators in ≈90%, euvolemia was reached, often within 24 hours. Urine output was higher during the first when compared with the second or third 24-hour interval (2700 versus 1550 or 1375 mL, respectively; P < 0.001), but this was no longer significant after correction for diuretic dose (P = 0.263), indicating preserved diuretic efficiency during the study. In contrast, urinary Na(+) and Cl(-) excretion both decreased significantly, even after correction for diuretic dose (P = 0.040 and 0.004, respectively), leading to decreasing urinary concentrations with progressive decongestion. After reaching euvolemia, lower urinary Na(+)/Cr and Cl(-)/Cr ratios were both associated with urine output ≤ 1500 mL (area under the curve, 0.830 and 0.826, respectively; P < 0.001 for both), in contrast to plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels that were not (area under the curve, 0.515; P = 0.735) CONCLUSIONS: The urinary composition during progressive decongestion in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is characterized by a drop in urinary Na(+) and Cl(-) concentrations. The urinary Na(+)/Cr or Cl(-)/Cr ratio might provide insightful information to titrate diuretic therapy.

### Lower urine sodium predicts longer length of stay in acute heart failure patients: insights from the ROSE AHF trial [^09eeaa13]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The major finding of this study is that lower urine sodium concentration predicted less weight loss and longer LOS in a cohort of patients hospitalized with AHF and renal dysfunction who were managed with protocol‐driven loop diuretic. The relationship between urine sodium and outcomes was consistent across the range of urine sodium values, without a clear threshold. Urine sodium concentration was more predictive of LOS than urine volume at 24 hours. These results suggest that lower urine sodium identifies diuretic‐refractory patients who may require escalation of therapy. However, patients with lower urine sodium did not benefit from adjunctive dopamine or nesiritide.

This study is consistent with and extends prior reports demonstrating that urine sodium is a marker of diuretic effectiveness. Testani and colleagues found that a prediction model including urine sodium concentration for 2 hours after diuretic administration, eGFR, and serum/urine creatinine ratio accurately predicted cumulative 6‐hour sodium excretion and urine output. 7 Single‐center cohort studies have demonstrated that lower urine sodium after loop diuretic predicts worsening heart failure, defined in various reports as worsening renal function, delayed symptom improvement, or need for inotrope or mechanical support. 4, 6, 13 Our study adds to this literature in several ways. First, sample size was significantly larger: nearly 300 patients compared with 50 to 100 patients in single‐center studies. Second, loop diuretic was administered according to a standardized protocol — 2.5 times the patient's home furosemide‐equivalent daily dose, divided between two bolus doses — eliminating variation in dose due to patient or provider factors. The prognostic significance of urine sodium concentration was independent of the baseline furosemide‐equivalent diuretic dose. Third, clinical outcomes were adjudicated according to prespecified criteria in the context of a clinical trial.

### Rapid and highly accurate prediction of poor loop diuretic natriuretic response in patients with heart failure [^9163a2b7]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Removal of excess sodium and fluid is a primary therapeutic objective in acute decompensated heart failure and commonly monitored with fluid balance and weight loss. However, these parameters are frequently inaccurate or not collected and require a delay of several hours after diuretic administration before they are available. Accessible tools for rapid and accurate prediction of diuretic response are needed.

Methods and Results

Based on well-established renal physiological principles, an equation was derived to predict net sodium output using a spot urine sample obtained 1 or 2 hours after loop diuretic administration. This equation was then prospectively validated in 50 acute decompensated heart failure patients using meticulously obtained timed 6-hour urine collections to quantify loop diuretic-induced cumulative sodium output. Poor natriuretic response was defined as a cumulative sodium output of < 50 mmol, a threshold that would result in a positive sodium balance with twice-daily diuretic dosing. Following a median dose of 3 mg (2–4 mg) of intravenous bumetanide, 40% of the population had a poor natriuretic response. The correlation between measured and predicted sodium output was excellent (r = 0.91; P < 0.0001). Poor natriuretic response could be accurately predicted with the sodium prediction equation (area under the curve = 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.89–1.0; P < 0.0001). Clinically recorded net fluid output had a weaker correlation (r = 0.66; P < 0.001) and lesser ability to predict poor natriuretic response (area under the curve = 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.63–0.89; P = 0.002).

Conclusions

In patients being treated for acute decompensated heart failure, poor natriuretic response can be predicted soon after diuretic administration with excellent accuracy using a spot urine sample.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Serum albumin and congestion assessment in HF — serum albumin levels should be checked routinely at HF admission, and peripheral edema should be interpreted with caution in the presence of hypoalbuminemia, which has been associated with up to 6-fold higher in-hospital mortality; reduced plasma oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia enhances extravascular fluid accumulation, for which overzealous diuresis may deplete intravascular volume and decrease renal function and blood pressure, particularly with nephrotic syndrome or chronic malnutrition.

### Continuous versus bolus dosing of furosemide for patients hospitalized for heart failure [^cdd9f71c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Intravenous diuretics are the cornerstone of management for patients hospitalized for heart failure. Physiologic data suggest that intermittent high-dose furosemide promotes neurohormonal activation, which a slow continuous infusion might remediate. However, the limited clinical data comparing dosing schemes are confounded. This study was a randomized, open-label, single-center trial of twice-daily bolus injection versus continuous infusion furosemide in patients hospitalized with heart failure and volume overload. The primary outcome was change in creatinine from admission to hospital day 3 or discharge. Twenty-one patients were randomized to bolus injection and 20 patients to continuous infusion. Baseline characteristics were balanced between study arms except for gender, with a mean age of 60 ± 15 years, a mean ejection fraction of 35 ± 19%, and a mean creatinine level of 1.9 ± 1.2 mg/dl. The mean doses of furosemide were similar between arms over the first 48 hours (162 ± 48 and 162 ± 52 mg/24 hours). None of the outcomes differed significantly between bolus and continuous dosing from admission to hospital day 3 or discharge (mean change in creatinine -0.02 vs 0.13 mg/dl, p = 0.18; urine output 5,113 vs 4,894 ml, p = 0.78; length of stay 8.8 vs 9.9 days, p = 0.69). All patients survived to discharge. In conclusion, there were no substantial differences between bolus injection and continuous infusion of equal doses of furosemide for the treatment of patients hospitalized with heart failure. Given the high prevalence of heart failure hospitalization and the disparate results of small studies regarding optimal dosing of loop diuretics to treat these patients, larger multicenter blinded studies are needed.

### Peripheral venous pressure-guided decongestive therapy in heart failure 2 (PERIPHERAL-HF2) [^ebd770d4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Congestive symptoms are the primary cause of hospitalizations in heart failure (HF), and diuretics remain the cornerstone of their management. However, clinical practice varies widely due to a lack of a reliable measure of congestion guiding diuretic use. Consequently, many HF patients are discharged prematurely without adequate decongestion, leading to increased readmissions and mortality. Peripheral venous pressure (PVP) has emerged as a promising noninvasive measure of vascular congestion. This study will enroll 650 patients aged 18–99 years admitted with de novo or acutely decompensated chronic HF. In the standard care arm, diuretic dosing and discharge decisions will be at the physician's discretion. In the PVP-guided arm, the goal is to maintain a PVP of < 9 mmHg, with diuretic dosing adjusted based on daily PVP changes and urine output. The primary outcome is a composite of all-cause mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits, with secondary outcomes including cardiovascular mortality and HF-related readmissions. We hypothesize that PVP-guided diuretic therapy will provide more precise and effective decongestion than standard care, reducing rehospitalizations and mortality. In conclusion, this study will offer valuable insights into the relationship between diuretic therapy, vascular congestion, and cardiac and renal outcomes. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06495892.

### Natriuretic response is highly variable and associated with 6-month survival: insights From the ROSE-AHF trial [^17c2a657]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to describe sodium excretion in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) clearly and to evaluate the prognostic ability of urinary sodium and fluid-based metrics.

Background

Sodium retention drives volume overload, with fluid retention largely a passive, secondary phenomenon. However, parameters (urine output, body weight) used to monitor therapy in ADHF measure fluid rather than sodium balance. Thus, the accuracy of fluid-based metrics hinges on the contested assumption that urinary sodium content is consistent.

Methods

Patients enrolled in the ROSE-AHF (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation-Acute Heart Failure) trial with 24-h sodium excretion available were studied (n = 316). Patients received protocol-driven high-dose loop diuretic therapy.

Results

Sodium excretion through the first 24 h was highly variable (range 0.12 to 19.8 g; median 3.63 g, interquartile range: 1.85 to 6.02 g) and was not correlated with diuretic agent dose (r = 0.06; p = 0.27). Greater sodium excretion was associated with reduced mortality in a univariate model (hazard ratio: 0.80 per doubling of sodium excretion; 95% confidence interval: 0.66 to 0.95; p = 0.01), whereas gross urine output (p = 0.43), net fluid balance (p = 0.87), and weight change (p = 0.11) were not. Sodium excretion of less than the prescribed dietary sodium intake (2 g), even in the setting of a negative net fluid balance, portended a worse prognosis (hazard ratio: 2.02; 95% confidence interval: 1.17 to 3.46; p = 0.01).

Conclusions

In patients hospitalized with ADHF who were receiving high-dose loop diuretic agents, sodium concentration and excretion were highly variable. Sodium excretion was strongly associated with 6-month mortality, whereas traditional fluid-based metrics were not. Poor sodium excretion, even in the context of fluid loss, portends a worse prognosis.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^b4541870]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — diuretic therapy management and risks: Electrolyte imbalances should be treated aggressively and the diuresis continued, and if hypotension or azotemia occurs the physician may elect to slow the rapidity of diuresis, but diuresis should nevertheless be maintained until fluid retention is eliminated, even if this strategy results in mild or moderate decreases in blood pressure or renal function, as long as the patient remains asymptomatic. Once fluid retention has resolved, treatment with the diuretic should be maintained to prevent the recurrence of volume overload, with dose adjustment often accomplished by having patients record their weight each day and make changes in their diuretic dosage if the weight increases or decreases beyond a specified range. Patients may become unresponsive to high doses if they consume large amounts of dietary sodium, are taking agents that can block the effects of diuretics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including cyclo- oxygenase-2 inhibitors), or have a significant impairment of renal function or perfusion, but diuretic resistance can generally be overcome by the intravenous administration of diuretics (including the use of continuous infusions), the use of 2 or more diuretics in combination (e.g., furosemide and metolazone), or the use of diuretics together with drugs that increase renal blood flow (e.g., positive inotropic agents). Diuretics can cause the depletion of potassium and magnesium and can predispose patients to serious cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the presence of digitalis therapy, and the risk of electrolyte depletion is markedly enhanced when 2 diuretics are used in combination; concomitant administration of ACEIs alone or in combination with potassium-retaining agents (such as spironolactone) can prevent electrolyte depletion in most patients with HF who are taking a loop diuretic, and when these drugs are prescribed, long-term oral potassium supplementation is generally not needed and may be deleterious. Excessive use of diuretics can decrease blood pressure and impair renal function and exercise tolerance; if there are no signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia are likely to be related to volume depletion and may resolve after a reduction in diuretic dose, whereas the signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia, are likely to reflect worsening HF and a decline in effective peripheral perfusion, which is an ominous clinical scenario and necessitates considering the measures discussed under Stage D HF.

### Adequacy of loop diuretic dosing in treatment of acute heart failure: insights from the BAN-ADHF diuretic resistance risk score [^8bbe1125]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diuretic resistance (DR) is common among patients admitted with acute heart failure (AHF) and can be estimated by BAN-ADHF scores. Among 317 consecutive patients hospitalized for AHF, BAN-ADHF scores were compared with metrics of DR and composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, HF hospitalization, LVAD, or heart transplantation. The BAN-ADHF score was incorporated into a diuretic dosing calculator and retroactively applied to a patient's diuretic dose to categorize them as adequately dosed or under-dosed (inadequate). The primary outcome studied was attaining > 3 L of urine output within the first 24 hours of admission. The median BAN-ADHF score was 9 (IQR of 7–13). A higher BAN-ADHF score was associated with greater DR based on weight loss and urine output (all p < 0.001). The highest quartile (Q4) had fewer patients achieve the admission urinary output goal (15% vs 32%, p = 0.004) and lower total urine output (2,009 mL vs 2,559 mL, p = 0.029) compared with the first 3 quartiles. In time-to-event analysis, Q4 of BAN-ADHF score was associated with increased risk of the primary composite endpoint (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.04). Compared to those below the calculator's recommended dose, patients receiving loop diuretics at goal doses (37.7% of cohort) had greater 24-hour UOP (3,050 vs 2,050 mL), likelihood of UOP goal (45% vs 19%), and weight loss at discharge (8.95 kg vs 5.94 kg; all p < 0.001). In conclusion, BAN-ADHF score correlated with diuretic resistance and prognosis, and may capture the risk of DR compared traditional measures like CKD or NT-proBNP.

### Fluid volume homeostasis in heart failure: a tale of 2 circulations [^8322210b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of treatment of congestion is commonly based on improvement in symptoms and objective clinical assessment. Change in body weight is a common metric used to assess adequacy of decongestive diuretic therapy. However, while weight loss can reflect clinical decongestion and symptomatic improvement, this metric is not consistently associated with improved survival or fewer hospitalizations. The findings of clinical studies linking diuresis‐related weight loss to decongestion and outcomes such as HF‐related mortality or re‐hospitalizations are mixed., As observed clinically large volume diuresis (multiple liters) can occur promptly (within the first 24 hours) with intravenous diuretic therapy in volume overload patients with decompensated HF which helps recover clinical compensation and symptom improvement, but not necessarily prevent recurrence in follow‐up evaluations. This may in part reflect the observation that fluid loss associated with diuresis‐related weight decrease does not have a substantial net impact on intravascular volume, but rather is primarily a reflection of the transvascular transport pathways that function primarily to reduce interstitial compartment fluid excess. The decongestion of the interstitial compartment thus likely has a lesser impact on determining outcomes relative to the impact of intravascular volume status. Somewhat contrary to clinical expectations, this suggests that there is an importance in distinguishing fluid overload congestion of the interstitial compartment and the contribution of the lymphatic system from that of the intravascular space where volume expansion of the latter may have a separate compensatory role in chronic HF. Thus, discordance between weight loss associated with clinical decongestion and actual intravascular volume status may in part explain outcome disparities observed in clinical studies. Data supporting a greater degree of weight loss as a common metric of clinical decongestion do not necessarily translate into better HF‐related outcomes. Such discordance, however, is not a consistently reported finding with some studies supporting while others failing to demonstrate an association among surrogate markers such as composite scores, signs and symptoms, hemodynamics, or biomarkers of decongestion with clinical outcomes., Further, observational data demonstrate that changes in diuresis‐related weight loss do not bear a significant relationship to changes in intravascular volume. A basis for this observation is that the decrease in weight reflects the predominant draining of fluid from the interstitial compartment while the intravascular PV state is maintained with minimal change in volume. Also, patient‐to‐patient variability in intravascular volume profiles (greater or lesser expansion) appears to have a limited association to the extent of interstitial volume reduction in response to diuretic therapy. Therefore, diuresis‐related changes in body weight reflect significant decreases in interstitial volume which are often observed clinically to be associated with rapid decongestion and symptom relief but not with significant admission to discharge changes in PV even if large PV expansion is present at hospital admission (Figure 3). A plausible hypothesis would be that the volume status of the intravascular compartment, particularly the integrity of the arterial circulation, is more a driver of clinical outcomes than even large changes in interstitial compartment volume.

### Great debate: in patients with decompensated heart failure, acetazolamide in addition to loop diuretics is the first choice [^5f3a46fd]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 4
(A) Comparison of cumulative urine output in patients with acute decompensated heart failure in ADVOR, CLOROTIC, and EMPAG-HF. Cumulative urine output on Day 3 (48 h post-randomization) in each group is calculated based on published data. Per cent change describes group differences compared with placebo in each individual study. (B) Daily urine output under treatment (difference to placebo indexed per day). HCTZ, hydrochlorothiazide.

The trial was different from another recent study, the EMPULSE trial. This study randomized patients hospitalized with acute decompensated HF randomized after 24 h (mean 3 days) following hospital admission followed for up to 90 days. EMPULSE showed significant clinical effects of 10 mg of empagliflozin compared with placebo based on a win ratio analysis. In comparison, EMPAG-HF utilized 25 mg of empagliflozin based on the hypothesis that the glucosuric and diuretic effects are more pronounced under the higher dose compared with only 10 mg of empagliflozin. The study approach and patient cohort of EMPULSE are comparable to the currently ongoing DICTATE-AHF (Efficacy and Safety of Dapagliflozin in Acute Heart Failure) study, i.e. testing the hypothesis that the addition of 10 mg of dapagliflozin in stabilized patients admitted with acute decompensated HF will change clinical outcomes. The study also requires initial stabilization and treatment and will include patients only after 24 h of hospitalization. Both studies exclude the clinically relevant early treatment time where therapies are initiated and the outcome is defined.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the current clinical evidence does not support a broad role for acetazolamide in the treatment algorithms for patients with acute decompensated HF due to the lack of clear clinical effects. In contrast, growing evidence supports the early introduction or even continuation of SGLT2i in patients with acute decompensated HF with comparable diuretic effects, similar safety profiles, and overwhelming evidence for medium- and long-term benefits in HF patients with both reduced and preserved ejection fractions (Figure 5).

### Intravenous diuretic therapy for the management of heart failure and volume overload in a multidisciplinary outpatient unit [^07f957be]. JACC: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous (IV) diuretic treatment for volume management in heart failure (HF).

Background

Limited data exist regarding IV diuretics for the outpatient treatment of volume overload in HF patients.

Methods

We analyzed 60 consecutive patients with chronic HF and clinical evidence of worsening congestion who received a bolus and 3-h IV infusion of furosemide at an outpatient HF clinic. Diuretic dosing was derived from the maintenance oral loop diuretic dose with a standardized conversion algorithm. Outcomes included urine output during the visit, weight loss at 24 h, and hospitalization and mortality at 30 days. Safety outcomes included hypokalemia and worsening of renal function. Outcomes were analyzed across subgroups defined by maintenance diuretic dose and ejection fraction (EF).

Results

The median age of the cohort was 70 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 58 to 80 years), and the median daily loop diuretic dose was 240 mg (IQR: 80 to 800 mg) oral furosemide or equivalent. Twenty-six patients (43.3%) were women, and 36 (60%) had an EF ≤ 45%. For the entire cohort, the median urine output and 24-h weight loss were 1.1 l (IQR: 0.6 to 1.4 l) and 1.1 kg (IQR: 0.2 to 1.9 kg), respectively. Outcomes were similar across patients with varying maintenance diuretic doses (< 40 mg, 40 to 160 mg, 160 to 300 mg, or > 300 mg of furosemide or equivalent) and in patients with reduced or preserved EF. Transient worsening of renal function and hypokalemia occurred in 10 patients (8.9%) and 4 patients (3.5%). Although hospitalization was reported as imminent for 28 patients (52.8%), the observed rate of all-cause hospitalization was 31.7% at 30 days with no deaths.

Conclusions

Short courses of IV diuretics for volume management in patients with HF were safe and associated with significant urine output and weight loss across a wide range of maintenance diuretic doses and EF. This strategy may provide an alternative to hospitalization for the management of selected HF patients.

### Diuretic strategies in patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^b1070fff]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Loop diuretics are an essential component of therapy for patients with acute decompensated heart failure, but there are few prospective data to guide their use.

Methods

In a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned 308 patients with acute decompensated heart failure to receive furosemide administered intravenously by means of either a bolus every 12 hours or continuous infusion and at either a low dose (equivalent to the patient's previous oral dose) or a high dose (2.5 times the previous oral dose). The protocol allowed specified dose adjustments after 48 hours. The coprimary end points were patients' global assessment of symptoms, quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) of the score on a visual-analogue scale over the course of 72 hours, and the change in the serum creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours.

Results

In the comparison of bolus with continuous infusion, there was no significant difference in patients' global assessment of symptoms (mean AUC, 4236 ± 1440 and 4373 ± 1404, respectively; P = 0.47) or in the mean change in the creatinine level (0.05 ± 0.3 mg per deciliter [4.4 ± 26.5 μmol per liter] and 0.07 ± 0.3 mg per deciliter [6.2 ± 26.5 μmol per liter], respectively; P = 0.45). In the comparison of the high-dose strategy with the low-dose strategy, there was a nonsignificant trend toward greater improvement in patients' global assessment of symptoms in the high-dose group (mean AUC, 4430 ± 1401 vs. 4171 ± 1436; P = 0.06). There was no significant difference between these groups in the mean change in the creatinine level (0.08 ± 0.3 mg per deciliter [7.1 ± 26.5 μmol per liter] with the high-dose strategy and 0.04 ± 0.3 mg per deciliter [3.5 ± 26.5 μmol per liter] with the low-dose strategy, P = 0.21). The high-dose strategy was associated with greater diuresis and more favorable outcomes in some secondary measures but also with transient worsening of renal function.

Conclusions

Among patients with acute decompensated heart failure, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus as compared with continuous infusion or at a high dose as compared with a low dose.

### Highlights of innovation and technologies and heart Failure Therapeutics: THT 2023 [^1c58c5d7]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Several devices for monitoring HF patients to guide medical management in anticipation of impending HF exacerbations are discussed. The Acorai SAVE Sensor System is a noninvasive multisensor device for estimating right atrial, pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The iFPx System is a multiparameter subcutaneous sensor which includes a novel method for measuring interstitial fluid pressure (incubated by NXT Medical;), increases of interstitial fluid pressure being a harbinger of fluid overload. Future Cardia has developed a subcutaneous monitor whose novel feature is measurement of heart and lung sounds which, when analyzed in relation to the electrocardiographic time markers, have correlated with changes in volume status and cardiac contractility. Can any of these approaches be as effective in guiding medical therapy to avoid HF exacerbations as invasively measured pulmonary artery pressure; the only approach so far shown to reduce HF hospitalizations?

Other devices discussed are therapeutic in nature, for either acute or chronic HF. Corstasis has developed a formulation of bumetanide that can be delivered via the intranasal route, thus increasing bioavailability over oral dosing and achieving greater urine output in patients with inadequate diuretic responsiveness. Renal Innovations has developed cutaneous patches that deliver low-intensity ultrasound to the kidney and have shown that this can improve urine output in acute HF patients with inadequate response to diuretics. Syntach AB is a novel ventricular assist device that is intended to mechanically restore more normal longitudinal shortening, which has been shown to improve stroke volume and overall cardiac performance in experimental heart failure.

VSling, another device discussed at the THT shark tank but not detailed in this issue, is a device that draws the displaced bases of the papillary muscles together to both improve coaptation of the mitral leaflets and to physically reverse remodel the dilated left ventricular apical region of HFrEF patients.

This limited offering of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches under development exemplifies the intense efforts being devoted to reducing morbidity and mortality in HF. It also underscores the diversity of engineering, pharmacology, medical, and business talent required to translate basic science to clinical practice. This special issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science includes brief reports summarizing the presentations delivered by these companies, along with video links to their presentations and the discussions by the judges. Collectively, these reports highlight the process of translational research and serve to inspire readers to join the quest to develop new devices for the treatment of HF.

### Efficacy and safety of the vasopressin V1A / V2-receptor antagonist conivaptan in acute decompensated heart failure: a dose-ranging pilot study [^42436346]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) involves substantial morbidity and mortality. Current management strategies have major limitations, and there has been little progress in the development of newer therapies. Arginine vasopressin-receptor antagonists may have promise in the treatment of ADHF in view of their ability to facilitate diuresis. This pilot study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous conivaptan, a dual arginine vasopressin V(1A)/V(2)-receptor antagonist, in treating ADHF.

Methods and Results

In a double-blind, multicenter trial, 170 patients hospitalized for worsening heart failure and given standard therapy were randomly assigned to treatment with conivaptan (20-mg loading dose followed by 2 successive 24-hour continuous infusions of 40, 80, or 120 mg/d) or placebo. The conivaptan and placebo groups did not differ significantly in patient or clinician assessments of global and respiratory status at 48 hours. There was no evidence of worsening heart failure in any group. Conivaptan at each dosage increased urine output significantly more than placebo at 24 hours (P ≤ .02), with the difference averaging 1.0 to 1.5 L. Decreases in mean body weight with conivaptan 40 and 80 mg/d (approximately 1–2 kg) paralleled the increases in urine output but did not reach statistical significance. Conivaptan was well tolerated and not associated with clinically important changes in vital signs, electrolyte disturbances, or cardiac rhythm. The most common adverse events were infusion-site reactions.

Conclusion

When added to standard therapy for ADHF, conivaptan safely improves urine output. Further study of this compound in ADHF may be warranted, especially in view of the limitations of current treatment for this syndrome.

### Bedside prognostication in decompensated heart failure: No "Easy button" [^df577666]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Tailoring the management of heart failure to hemodynamics remains a perpetual challenge for the clinician. Although improved understanding of neurohormonal factors in hemodynamic regulation has led to the wider use of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system blockers, β blockers, and vasodilators in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), diuretics remain the mainstay of treatment. Diuresis and natriuresis counter fluid overload, leading to decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure as well as central venous pressure; they relieve pulmonary congestion, and their effects on preload and afterload reduction result in improved hemodynamics. However these effects can also lower the cardiac output (by as much as 20%) and increase neurohormonal activation. ADHF can be perceived as a state of prerenal azotemia signaling reduced perfusion to the kidney and other organs. Although the goal of diuretic therapy is effective decongestion, a delicate balance is needed to sustain renal (and other organ) perfusion in the face of declining intravascular volume. The process of managing ADHF with diuretics is a constant dance to find the sweet spot on the Frank‐Starling curve where increased left ventricular end‐diastolic pressure still leads to maintenance of, or a mild decrease in, cardiac output; normalization of stroke volume is not a realistic goal in the failing heart.

### Spot urinary sodium as a biomarker of diuretic response in acute heart failure [^9823a15a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, cumulative data support the promising role of urine sodium‐based diuretic titration in AHF, but high‐quality evidence and clinical experience remain limited. Prior issues should be clarified in further dedicated studies. We consider spot urinary sodium may be a useful measurement for monitoring and guiding diuretic therapy in patients with true fluid overload. However, further studies in a broad spectrum of patients and clinical situations are required to understand the pros and cons of this parameter. Before we have more evidence, we advocate for using early hospitalization of UNa for monitoring and guiding diuretic approaches as 1 more piece of the puzzle, as stated in the Figure. In addition, we should be aware of some clinical conditions (not overt fluid overload, acute kidney injury, cirrhosis, multiple diuretic therapy) in which the interpretation of urinary sodium excretion may be challenging.

Figure 1
Guided diuretic therapy according to early post‐diuretic spot urinary sodium in acute heart failure.

In AHF, the kidneys shows higher avidity of sodium reabsorption, and consequently low urinary sodium is frequently present and associated with more severe disease. Excluding cirrhotic, in fluid overload patients with AHF, a spot UNa < 50 mEq/L at 2 hours after loop diuretic infusion is associated with worse loop diuretic response (diuretic resistance) using different metrics. Expert consensus recommends early intensification of diuretic therapy in case of low UNa (< 50–70 mEq/L) at 2 hours after the first intravenous loop diuretic administration. We propose a comprehensive interpretation of early UNa after diuretic treatment accounting for other parameters of decongestion, especially in specific cases in which the evidence is scarce and pathophysiology of UNa complex, such as ambiguity about volume overload status, AKI, severe CKD, cirrhotic patients, and use of aquaretics. Equally as ESC guidelines declare and because most studies are observational and use different cutoffs from 50 to 89 mmol, the cutoff used in this figure is based on expert opinion and based in recent released results of the ENACT‐HF study. AHF indicates acute heart failure; AKI, acute kidney injury; CKD, chronic kidney disease; ENACT HF, Efficacy of a Standardized Diuretic Protocol in Acute Heart Failure Study; ESC, European Society of Cardiology; RAAS, renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system; and Una, urinary sodium.

### Influence of titration of neurohormonal antagonists and blood pressure reduction on renal function and decongestion in decompensated heart failure [^a5369a50]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP reduction) during the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure is strongly and independently associated with worsening renal function. Our objective was to determine whether SBP reduction or titration of oral neurohormonal antagonists during acute decompensated heart failure treatment negatively influences diuresis and decongestion.

Methods and Results

SBP reduction was evaluated from admission to discharge in consecutive acute decompensated heart failure admissions (n = 656). Diuresis and decongestion were examined across a range of parameters, such as diuretic efficiency, fluid output, hemoconcentration, and diuretic dose. The average reduction in SBP was 14.4 ± 19.4 mm Hg, and 77.6% of the population had discharge SBP lower than admission. SBP reduction was strongly associated with worsening renal function (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–2.9; P = 0.004), a finding that persisted after adjusting for parameters of diuresis and decongestion (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–3.2; P = 0.002). However, SBP reduction did not negatively affect diuresis or decongestion (P ≥ 0.25 for all parameters). Uptitration of neurohormonal antagonists occurred in > 50% of admissions and was associated with a modest additional reduction in blood pressure (≤ 5.6 mm Hg). Notably, worsening renal function was not increased, and diuretic efficiency was significantly improved with the uptitration of neurohormonal antagonists.

Conclusions

Despite a higher rate of worsening renal function, blood pressure reduction was not associated with worsening of diuresis or decongestion. Furthermore, titration of oral neurohormonal antagonists was actually associated with improved diuresis in this cohort. These results provide reassurance that the guideline-recommended titration of chronic oral medication during acute decompensated heart failure hospitalization may not be antagonistic to the short-term goal of decongestion.

### Lower urine sodium predicts longer length of stay in acute heart failure patients: insights from the ROSE AHF trial [^7a7e2a7c]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Intravenous loop diuretic to relieve congestion is the primary therapy for patients hospitalized with acute heart failure. 1 Persistent congestion, despite treatment with diuretics, is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes. 2, 3, 4, 5 Heart failure clinicians need new biomarkers that accurately and efficiently identify patients failing conventional treatment and new therapies to offer such patients.

Urine sodium is a logical candidate biomarker because loop diuretics inhibit sodium reabsorption in the kidney, and thus increase natriuresis. Neurohormonal systems including natriuretic peptides and the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone axis closely regulate urine sodium. In patients with normal renal perfusion, urine sodium serves as a barometer for the extracellular volume status; when extracellular volume is low, the kidney responds to conserve sodium. However, in heart failure, renal perfusion is low despite high extracellular volume. Activation of the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone axis promotes sodium retention. Thus, lower urine sodium, or persistence of low urine sodium after loop‐diuretic therapy, may reflect more severe heart failure.

Recent single center cohort studies have found that lower urine sodium after loop diuretic administration — either by bolus dosing or continuous infusion — predicts longer length of stay (LOS), worsening renal function, and higher rates of death or rehospitalization for heart failure. 4, 6 Moreover, urine sodium may be a more reproducible measurement of diuretic effectiveness than urine output, which is more commonly used. 7

The Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation Acute Heart Failure (ROSE AHF) trial randomized patients admitted for AHF with renal dysfunction to dopamine vs placebo, or nesiritide vs placebo, in addition to loop diuretic therapy. 8 Renal dysfunction was defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The primary trial found no benefit for either adjunctive therapy or that of the pooled placebo group. Urine was collected cumulatively for the first 24 hours after randomization, during which patients received protocol‐driven loop diuretics. In this cohort, total and net sodium excretion values in this period were highly variable, and lower values were associated with higher 6‐month all‐cause mortality. 9 We hypothesized that patients with lower urine sodium concentration during the first 24 hours after randomization would have longer LOS and might represent a subset of patients who would benefit from dopamine or nesiritide.
