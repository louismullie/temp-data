## Question

How do you evaluate a goitre and what is the management?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage a goitre. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining goitre and establishing the initial clinical assessment. Then, I should verify the laboratory evaluation strategy. Next, I will review imaging with ultrasound and when to add scintigraphy. After that, I need to check indications for fine-needle aspiration and how to choose which nodule to biopsy in multinodular disease. Then, I will consider special populations and compressive symptoms. Finally, I will synthesize management pathways for nontoxic, toxic, and malignant goitres, including surgery, radioiodine, and surveillance, and close with follow-up and patient counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope so I don't miss anything important: goitre is enlargement of the thyroid gland and may be diffuse or nodular, toxic or nontoxic, and can extend substernally. I should remember that substernal extension is typically defined as extension past the sternal notch in the supine position, which has implications for airway risk and surgical planning [^00eca118].

> Next, I should review the initial clinical assessment carefully: I need to check for compressive symptoms such as dysphagia, dyspnea, orthopnea, hoarseness, and positional choking, and I should document goitre size using the WHO grading scheme (Grade 0 to 3) to standardize follow-up and communication. I also need to ask about risk factors for malignancy, including family history, prior neck irradiation, and rapid growth, and I should examine the neck for dominant nodules, fixation, and cervical lymphadenopathy, while remembering that flow-volume loops rarely change management and should be reserved for suspected primary lung pathology rather than routine goitre workup [^f01b775a] [^7abfbd5b].

> I will now examine the laboratory evaluation: serum TSH is the mandatory first test, and if TSH is suppressed I should confirm hyperthyroidism with free T4 and total or free T3, whereas if TSH is elevated I should check free T4 and thyroid peroxidase antibodies to assess for hypothyroidism. I should also consider thyroglobulin antibodies when Hashimoto's is suspected and TRAb when hyperthyroidism is present to help distinguish Graves' disease, and I need to ensure I do not order calcitonin routinely unless medullary carcinoma is suspected [^e2867352] [^8dcae083] [^42199fe6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging: high-resolution neck ultrasound is the cornerstone and should be obtained in essentially all patients with a goitre to characterize gland size, nodule number, size, location, composition, echogenicity, margins, calcifications, shape, and vascularity, and to survey cervical lymph nodes. I should double-check that scintigraphy is not indicated in euthyroid patients, but is appropriate when TSH is low to distinguish hyperfunctioning from nonfunctioning nodules, which changes the need for biopsy and guides therapy selection [^126d5380] [^537e95d3] [^efb49018].

> Wait, let me verify the approach to multinodular goitre: if multiple nodules are 1 cm or larger, each should be evaluated like a solitary nodule, and I should prioritize FNA to the nodule with the most suspicious sonographic features or the largest size if features are similar. If TSH is low, I should obtain a radionuclide scan to identify hyperfunctioning nodules that typically do not require FNA, while nonfunctioning nodules meeting size and feature criteria should be considered for FNA [^496adc46] [^cc390a20].

> I need to ensure I apply FNA thresholds correctly: for nodules 1 cm or larger with intermediate or high suspicion sonographic patterns, FNA is recommended, whereas for low-suspicion nodules I can extend the threshold to 2 cm or observe if smaller. I should avoid FNA for nodules under 5 mm and for hyperfunctioning nodules on scintigraphy, and I should use the Bethesda System for cytology classification to guide next steps, including molecular testing for indeterminate results when available [^0ff9b932] [^d9ba0f05] [^3bb5f3e0].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts so I don't overgeneralize: in older adults, I should balance the lower malignancy risk but higher likelihood of high-risk histology if cancer is present against comorbidities and procedural risks, often favoring less aggressive surveillance. In pregnancy, I should avoid routine FNA for nodules under 1 cm and avoid suppressive levothyroxine, reserving surgery for suspicious or growing nodules after the second trimester when feasible. In children, I should maintain a lower threshold for FNA given higher malignancy risk and use adult sonographic risk patterns despite pediatric-specific guidance gaps [^dc9092ef] [^baa73f59] [^03897343].

> I should confirm how to handle compressive symptoms and substernal goitre: any goitre with compressive symptoms warrants surgical evaluation, and substernal extension increases airway risk and favors surgery even if cytology is benign. Preoperative planning should include careful airway assessment, consideration of CT for substernal extent, and coordination with anesthesia for potential difficult intubation, with outcomes optimized at high-volume centers [^dfc07a35] [^b9938fb6].

> Now, for nontoxic goitre management, I need to balance observation against intervention: if the goitre is small, stable, and asymptomatic, surveillance with periodic exam and ultrasound is reasonable, recognizing that a meaningful minority may grow or develop new nodules over time. Suppressive levothyroxine can reduce goitre size modestly in iodine-deficient settings but is not effective in iodine-sufficient regions and carries risks, so I should avoid routine suppression. Radioiodine is an option for nontoxic multinodular goitre, particularly in older patients or those declining surgery, with typical volume reductions of 40–60% over 1–3 years, though hypothyroidism is common and large goitres respond less [^7c31bc6e] [^698bcaeb] [^0647f5aa].

> For toxic goitre, I should confirm the etiology and severity: Graves' disease is best managed with a 12–18 month course of antithyroid drugs with consideration of TRAb trends, or with radioactive iodine or surgery based on patient preference, goitre size, severity, ophthalmopathy, and comorbidities. Toxic multinodular goitre or toxic adenoma are generally treated with radioactive iodine or surgery, with antithyroid drugs as bridge therapy. I need to remember that RAI can worsen or precipitate thyroid eye disease in a subset, so I should screen for eye disease and consider steroid prophylaxis in at-risk patients [^193d1dee] [^4454438b] [^247638fd].

> But wait, what if malignancy is suspected or diagnosed: I should confirm that suspicious cytology or nodules with high-risk sonographic features warrant surgical consultation, with extent of surgery individualized to nodule size, location, contralateral disease, and patient factors. Lobectomy is often sufficient for low-risk, unifocal disease, whereas total thyroidectomy is preferred for larger tumors, bilateral disease, or high-risk features, and I should counsel on risks including hypoparathyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and ensure preoperative voice assessment when indicated [^71fa4f37] [^24ac2f82].

> I should double-check follow-up protocols: for cytologically benign nodules, ultrasound surveillance at 6–18 month intervals with lengthening if stable is appropriate, with repeat FNA if there is substantial growth or new suspicious features. For patients after surgery or radioiodine, I need to monitor thyroid function regularly and adjust replacement, and in differentiated thyroid cancer I should follow risk-adapted surveillance with neck ultrasound and, when indicated, thyroglobulin and imaging based on response to therapy categories [^0ff9b932] [^cc1a2451].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making and patient counseling: I should explain that most goitres are benign and slow-growing, discuss the risks and benefits of observation versus surgery or radioiodine, and tailor choices to symptoms, cosmetic concerns, comorbidities, and preferences. I should also address anxiety about cancer risk and provide clear return precautions for new compressive symptoms or rapid growth, aligning management with contemporary risk-stratified, patient-centered approaches to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^d32dd489] [^3654f39b].

Evaluation of goitre centers on **history, exam, and TSH-first testing** [^e2867352] to classify function, followed by **ultrasound** [^126d5380] to define anatomy and guide FNA for nodules ≥ 1 cm or with suspicious features [^0ff9b932]. Management is **function-driven**: observe or treat hypothyroidism for nontoxic goitres [^698bcaeb]; use antithyroid drugs, radioiodine, or surgery for toxic goitres [^4454438b] [^193d1dee]; and reserve surgery for compressive symptoms, suspicion of malignancy, or large substernal goitres [^dfc07a35] [^b9938fb6]. Most goitres are benign and stable, so **surveillance is common** [^7c31bc6e]; patient education and shared decision-making are essential [^d32dd489].

## Clinical evaluation

### History

- **Onset and duration**: Gradual enlargement suggests benign disease; rapid growth raises concern for malignancy.
- **Local symptoms**: Dysphagia, dyspnea, hoarseness, or positional choking suggest compression [^dfc07a35].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Weight loss, heat intolerance, palpitations, or anxiety suggest hyperthyroidism; fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance suggest hypothyroidism.
- **Risk factors**: Family history of thyroid disease, prior neck irradiation, iodine deficiency, medications (e.g. lithium, amiodarone) [^00eca118].

---

### Physical examination

Assess **size and consistency** — small, firm, and mobile suggests benign disease, whereas large, hard, fixed, or irregular raises concern for malignancy — and evaluate for **compressive signs**, including stridor, tracheal deviation, or superior vena cava syndrome. Palpate the neck for cervical lymphadenopathy, which increases suspicion for malignancy [^notfound].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| TSH | All patients | - Low: hyperthyroidism <br/> - Normal: euthyroid <br/> - High: hypothyroidism [^e2867352] |
| Free T4, T3 | Low TSH | Confirms hyperthyroidism; distinguishes Graves' from nodular disease [^d08bafee] |
| TPOAb | High TSH | Suggests autoimmune thyroiditis [^5194736d] |
| TRAb | Hyperthyroidism | Confirms Graves' disease [^d08bafee] |
| Calcitonin | Suspicion for MTC | Elevated in medullary carcinoma [^notfound] |

---

## Imaging evaluation

Ultrasound is **first-line** [^126d5380] to assess size, nodules, vascularity, and lymph nodes; use TI-RADS to stratify malignancy risk and guide FNA [^8ab76498]. Obtain **CT/MRI** for large or substernal goitres to define extent and airway risk [^notfound]. Reserve **radionuclide scanning** for low TSH to distinguish hyperfunctioning (low malignancy risk) from nonfunctioning nodules [^efb49018].

---

## Indications for fine-needle aspiration (FNA)

- **Nodules ≥ 1 cm**: Especially with suspicious ultrasound features (hypoechoic, irregular margins, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide) [^3bb5f3e0].
- **Nodules ≥ 2 cm**: Even with low-suspicion features due to size [^3bb5f3e0].
- **Substernal nodules**: Any size due to higher malignancy risk and surgical implications [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Nontoxic goitre

- **Observation**: Small, asymptomatic goitres with stable ultrasound [^7c31bc6e].
- **Levothyroxine**: For hypothyroidism or mild TSH elevation; limited benefit for size reduction [^698bcaeb].
- **Radioiodine**: For moderate enlargement, especially if surgery is high risk or declined [^0647f5aa].
- **Surgery**: For compressive symptoms, cosmetic concern, or suspicion of malignancy [^dfc07a35].

---

### Toxic goitre (hyperthyroidism)

- **Antithyroid drugs**: Methimazole first-line; propylthiouracil in pregnancy or intolerance [^notfound].
- **Radioactive iodine**: Definitive therapy for toxic nodular disease; high response rates [^a0691649].
- **Surgery**: For large goitres, suspicion of malignancy, or patient preference [^193d1dee].

---

### Substernal goitre

Surgery is indicated for **compressive symptoms**, **significant tracheal compression**, or **suspicion of malignancy** [^dfc07a35]. Preoperative evaluation should include CT/MRI and airway assessment, with management at experienced centers to optimize outcomes [^b9938fb6].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

For nontoxic goitres, **ultrasound every 6–12 months** is appropriate until stability is established, then annually. For toxic goitres, monitor thyroid function tests every 1–3 months until stable, then annually. After surgery, monitor for recurrence with periodic ultrasound and TSH.

---

## Patient education and counseling

Explain the **benign nature of most goitres** and the rationale for surveillance versus intervention. Discuss treatment options, risks, and benefits, including potential complications of surgery or radioiodine. Emphasize adherence to follow-up and when to seek care for new symptoms.

---

Evaluation of goitre requires a **structured approach**: history, exam, TSH-first labs, and ultrasound, with FNA for suspicious nodules. Management is function-based, ranging from observation to surgery, and most patients do well with surveillance and shared decision-making.

### Fate of the non-operated, non-toxic goitre in a defined population [^7c31bc6e]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

There is lack of consensus in Europe regarding the management of patients with benign goitre. This study evaluated the long-term results of recommending no surgery for clinically and cytologically benign goitre.

Methods

Some 261 patients (median age 56 years) referred for surgical evaluation for goitre were followed prospectively for a median of 130 months. All hospital and primary care charts were reviewed and living patients interviewed by telephone.

Results

During follow-up, 36.4 per cent of patients were re-referred for a new surgical evaluation, mainly because of growth of the goitre and/or worsening of local symptoms. Fifty-seven (21.8 per cent) of the patients had surgery, and 13 developed thyrotoxicosis. Five patients (1.9 per cent) were diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma, three of whom (all elderly women) died from the disease. Some 95.0 per cent of patients were satisfied with the expectant policy, but 13.1 per cent had been worried about thyroid cancer despite the reassurance of a benign diagnosis.

Conclusion

Patients with benign goitre can be treated conservatively with good results. However, there is a small risk that aggressive carcinoma will develop and about a quarter of patients may need surgery within 10 years of the decision to wait and see.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^d32dd489]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The evaluation and management of patients with thyroid nodules is no longer a 1-size-fits-all proposition. The tailored approach advocated today requires a careful assessment of each nodule to determine the likelihood that it is malignant and the chances that it will cause symptoms. Very few nodules will require an intensive workup that includes cytology and molecular testing of FNAB samples: for the vast majority, a systematic cervical US examination with assessment of clinical risk factors will provide a reliable foundation for identifying the initial management strategy. After an appropriate initial assessment, the frequency of subsequent surveillance visits for most nodules can be safely reduced compared with currently used schedules. This is particularly relevant for frail, elderly individuals, as they are unlikely to be harmed by the thyroid tumor itself, and overmedicalization can cause more harm than good. In these populations, surveillance can safely be confined to a periodic clinical examination. If surgery is needed, resections can often be less extensive. In some cases, minimally invasive, percutaneous approaches are a viable alternative to surgery. When there are multiple options, they should be discussed as frankly as possible with the patient, outlining the advantages, limitations, benefits, and risks of each. The goal is to identify the best strategy for the individual patient, in terms of disease outcomes and quality of life, avoiding the pitfalls of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. For health professionals, this means learning to work with some degree of clinical uncertainty rather than automatically resorting to intensive testing and intervention, and by weighing patients' expectations and demands.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^220ebbbe]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This article describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspeciality physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Thyroid Association in association with the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. The American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. The task force examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to develop the text and a series of specific recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis.

Conclusions

One hundred evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^4ada3aa4]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This document describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspecialty physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) previously cosponsored guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that were published in 2011. Considerable new literature has been published since then, and the ATA felt updated evidence-based guidelines were needed. The association assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. They examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to update the 2011 text and recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting them were rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' orbitopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis. New paradigms since publication of the 2011 guidelines are presented for the evaluation of the etiology of thyrotoxicosis, the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs, the management of pregnant hyperthyroid patients, and the preparation of patients for thyroid surgery. The sections on less common causes of thyrotoxicosis have been expanded.

Conclusions

One hundred twenty-four evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

### Do flow volume loops alter surgical management in patients with a goitre? [^7abfbd5b]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Flow volume loops (FVLs) are considered part of the workup of patients with thyroid enlargement presenting to the endocrinology clinic. They are used to detect upper airway obstruction (UAO) secondary to tracheal compression (TC) from a goitre. Surgical assessment in contrast tends to focus on clinical evaluation supplemented when required by imaging. The aim of this study was to investigate whether FVLs influence the decision to operate in patients with a goitre.

Methods

We identified patients with a goitre referred by the department of endocrinology for FVLs between 2006 and 2011. The results of the FVL were collated, and their impact on patient management was assessed.

Results

Ninety-six patients were referred for FVL. In 38 patients, the indication was specifically to evaluate the effects of a goitre. Of these, 33 were reported as normal. Five FVLs were reported as abnormal (3 suggesting lung pathology and 2 TC). Both patients with TC on FVL presented no CT evidence of TC and underwent surgery due to abnormal cytology. Of the 33 normal FVLs, 7 underwent surgery: 2 for local compression, 4 for abnormal cytology and 1 for Graves' disease. None of the FVLs influenced the decision to operate.

Conclusion

FVLs may detect subradiological TC, but rarely influence management in patients with a goitre. In view of this and the cost of £235 per investigation, FVL should be reserved for goitre patients with suspected primary lung pathology, where the distinction between large and small airway compression is likely to influence management.

Radioiodine therapy for nontoxic nodular goiter — radioiodine treatment is best suited for small- to medium-sized benign goiters and for patients previously treated surgically, with serious comorbid conditions, or who decline surgery, whereas it is not suited for large nodules requiring high doses or when immediate resolution of hyperthyroidism is desired; absolute contraindications are breastfeeding and pregnancy, which should be excluded by a pregnancy test, and there is no consensus on a lowest age limit. Typical outcomes include a 40 to 50% decrease in thyroid size after 1 year and a 50 to 60% decrease after 3 to 5 years, with about half of the reduction seen within 3 months; approximately 20% of patients do not respond, very large goiters (> 100 mL) decrease by only 30 to 40% after 1 year, and an RCT found LT4 had no effect whereas radioiodine decreased goiter size by 50% after 1 to 2 years. Dosing is often adjusted to aim at an absorbed dose of 100 Gy, and radioiodine usually improves symptoms and respiratory function.

### Thyroid disorders: evaluation and management of thyroid nodules [^0ddd484a]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Although thyroid nodules are a common clinical entity, few (5% to 10%) are malignant and require surgical treatment. Most nodules are discovered incidentally in patients undergoing surveillance for medical reasons unrelated to thyroid disorders. Therefore, a systematic approach to their evaluation is important to avoid unnecessary surgery. High-resolution ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration have resulted in substantial improvements in diagnostic accuracy, cost reductions, and higher malignancy yield at the time of surgery. In this article, the authors present practical guidelines and a suggested management strategy for the effective diagnosis and management of incidentally discovered thyroid nodules.

### American Thyroid Association statement on optimal surgical management of goiter [^00eca118]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Statement of clinical problem — For the purposes of this statement article, goiter will be defined as benign enlargement of the thyroid gland; toxic nodular goiter and thyroid carcinoma are beyond the purview of this article and will not be addressed, and substernal goiter will be defined as thyroid extension past the sternal notch with the patient in the supine position, detected either radiologically or clinically. Patients with goiters may be euthyroid, hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid, and the goiter may be simple or a diffuse enlargement without nodules, or may have a uninodular or multinodular pattern. There are various causes for goiter development, which include genetic factors, smoking, natural goitrogens (cassava, etc.), autoimmune thyroid disease (Graves' or Hashimoto's disease), iodine deficiency, malignancy, dyshormonogenesis, and infiltrative disease, and very rare causes of thyroid enlargement are thyrotropin (TSH)-secreting pituitary tumors and thyroid hormone resistance. The medical options for treatment of goiter consist primarily of iodine replacement, thyroid hormone replacement, thyroid hormone suppressive therapy, and radioactive iodine.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^bda0f1ce]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 33 — Thyroid nodules in patients with GD should be evaluated and managed according to recently published guidelines for nodules in otherwise nonthyroidal individuals. Strength of evidence: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Thyroid cancer occurs in GD with a frequency of 2% or less. Thyroid nodules larger than 1–1.5 cm should be evaluated before RAI therapy, and nonfunctioning or hypofunctioning nodules on RAI scan should be considered for fine-needle aspiration; if cytopathology is suspicious or diagnostic of malignancy, surgery is advised after normalization of thyroid function with ATDs. Disease-free survival at 20 years is reported to be 99% after thyroid surgery for GD in patients with small (≤ 1 cm) coexisting thyroid cancers. The use of thyroid ultrasound in all patients with GD identifies more nodules and cancer than palpation and 123I scintigraphy, but further study is required before routine ultrasound (which may lead to surgery) can be recommended; ATA has published updated guidelines for thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^21977a56]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) management guidelines for thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer — scope, methods, and key recommendation areas are outlined, stating that the aim is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on evidence for diagnosis and management. The clinical questions were based on prior guideline versions and stakeholder and task force input, with eligibility limited to published English-language adult articles, and evidence appraisal and recommendation grading for therapeutic interventions used the American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System; competing interests were regularly updated, managed, and communicated. Recommendation areas for thyroid nodules include initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers, and management of benign nodules, while initial thyroid cancer management recommendations include screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and thyrotropin suppression therapy using levothyroxine.

### Evidence-based evaluation of the thyroid nodule [^8da0574f]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

This article reviews the most current literature on thyroid nodule evaluation, with particular attention to the problem of the incidentally identified thyroid nodule. Although traditional risk factors for thyroid cancer, such as age, gender, and familial syndromes, are still important, the manner in which a thyroid nodule comes to attention is of great importance these days when considering how to proceed in a workup. Most thyroid nodules today are discovered through radiologic imaging tests performed for other reasons. This article covers the key considerations that are vital in balancing the risks and benefits of thyroid nodule workup and treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of Grave's disease: a global overview [^ccc003f6]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by goitre, hyperthyroidism and, in 25% of patients, Graves ophthalmopathy. The hyperthyroidism is caused by thyroid hypertrophy and stimulation of function, resulting from interaction of anti-TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAb) with the TSH receptor on thyroid follicular cells. Measurements of serum levels of TRAb and thyroid ultrasonography represent the most important diagnostic tests for Graves disease. Management of the condition currently relies on antithyroid drugs, which mainly inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, or ablative treatments ((131)I-radiotherapy or thyroidectomy) that remove or decrease thyroid tissue. None of these treatments targets the disease process, and patients with treated Graves disease consequently experience either a high rate of recurrence, if receiving antithyroid drugs, or lifelong hypothyroidism, after ablative therapy. Geographical differences in the use of these therapies exist, partially owing to the availability of skilled thyroid surgeons and suitable nuclear medicine units. Novel agents that might act on the disease process are currently under evaluation in preclinical or clinical studies, but evidence of their efficacy and safety is lacking.

### Evaluation of the patient with a suspected thyroid disorder [^a0ba7f23]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The principal types of thyroid disorders described herein can be recognized and evaluated clinically and biochemically by the obstetrician/gynecologist. Most patients with diffuse goiter should be referred for further evaluation and an RAI scan arranged while this consultation is awaited. Patients with solitary thyroid nodules should be referred for FNAB. Primary hypothyroidism without significant goiter can be treated without specialist referral, except in patients at high risk for ischemic coronary disease or arrhythmia. Primary hyperthyroidism, apart from subacute and postpartum thyroiditis, should be referred for specialist evaluation and definitive therapy. An RAI scan and uptake should be ordered, and beta-blocker therapy can be initiated as interim therapy in symptomatic patients. Patients with secondary (i.e., hypothalamic- or pituitary-based) thyroid dysfunction should always be referred for evaluation and treatment of the primary intracranial cause. There are several causes of abnormal thyroid function tests in apparently euthyroid patients, and the clinical context often provides important evidence of their nature. Clinical judgment is an important factor in knowing when to arrange specialist consultation.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^71fa4f37]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

When surgery is indicated, decisions on the extent of resection will depend on multiple factors, including symptoms, the presence of contralateral nodules, thyroid functional status, comorbidities, family history, surgical risk, and patient preferences. Common reasons for surgery are large goiters, local compressive symptoms or progressive nodule or thyroid enlargement, or large toxic multinodular goiters. In most patients with multiple nodules, both lobes of the gland are involved and total thyroidectomy is necessary. Consensus is lacking on the procedure of choice for patients with an asymmetric nodular goiter. In some cases, lobectomy can be considered as a safer alternative to total thyroidectomy. However, it requires long-term follow-up, is associated with nodule recurrence risk, and may subsequently require a second operation.

Indeterminate and suspicious nodules

For cytologically indeterminate nodules that cannot be molecularly classified as benign, lobectomy with isthmusectomy is generally the procedure of choice. However, thyroidectomy may be indicated in patients with larger indeterminate nodules (≥ 3–4 cm), nodules displaying progressive growth and/or worrisome features on ultrasound, or a family history of thyroid cancer or radiation exposure. If preoperative molecular testing is not possible, seeking the opinion of a second pathologist may be worthwhile because thyroid cytology is characterized by substantial inter- and intraobserver variability, especially for nodules classified as indeterminate.

Lobectomy and isthmusectomy (or rarely an isthmusectomy alone) is usually the least extensive procedure that can be considered when malignancy is suspected. (Cases eligible for active surveillance, as discussed previously, are the obvious exception.) In patients with 1- to 4-cm suspicious nodules, lobectomy or total thyroidectomy are both acceptable, whereas patients with large suspicious nodules, suspected extrathyroidal extension, or suspected metastases (locoregional or distant) should undergo total thyroidectomy.

Lobectomy offers several advantages over total thyroidectomy. It virtually eliminates the risks of permanent hypoparathyroidism and bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and substantially reduces the rates of permanent unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (0.6% versus 1.3%). Furthermore, 50% to 80% of the patients who undergo lobectomy do not require thyroid hormone replacement therapy (the likelihood varies according to the preoperative TSH level and the presence of thyroid autoimmunity.). Minimally invasive US-guided ablation techniques are also being proposed by some groups for nonsurgical treatment of small suspicious nodules.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaThyroid disease [^be024263]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are a wide variety of diseases that affect the thyroid gland ranging from hyperplastic to neoplastic, autoimmune, or inflammatory. They can present with functional abnormality or a palpable structural change. Imaging has a key role in diagnosing and characterizing the thyroid finding for management. Imaging is also essential in the management of thyroid cancer. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Rating of the recommendations — GRADE approach and strength labels: The task force elected to rate the recommendations according to the system developed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (Group). The strength of a recommendation is indicated as a strong recommendation (for or against) that applies to most patients in most circumstances with benefits of action clearly outweighing the risks and burdens (or vice versa), or a weak recommendation or a suggestion that may not be appropriate for every patient, depending on context, patient values, and preferences, and the quality of evidence is indicated as low-quality evidence, moderate-quality evidence, or high-quality evidence. In several instances, the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against a test or a treatment, and the task force made a statement labeled "no recommendation", and each recommendation is preceded by a description of the evidence and, in some cases, followed by a remarks section including technical suggestions on issues such as dosing and monitoring.

Management of thyroid nodules is one of the most controversial issues in thyroidology. Different approaches derive from geographical variation in presentation, inadequate or incomplete clinical diagnosis, lack of prospective controlled studies and, frequently, the different cultural backgrounds of physicians. This review aims to offer a practical approach to the management of nodular thyroid disorders, considering the way in which the pathophysiology of the disease provides clues to the correct clinical diagnosis and therapy.

### Graves' ophthalmopathy: the clinical and psychosocial outcomes of different medical interventions-a systematic review [^5535c7df]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Currently, GO-QoL questionnaire is the most frequently used QoL questionnaire in clinical trials. Nevertheless, it is not without its limitations, for example, it does not evaluate a patient's overall QoL score. The TED-QOL however, evaluates the overall QoL as well as visual functioning and appearance. Therefore, it would be recommended for research to be carried out evaluating both questionnaires to identify which disease-specific questionnaire is best correlated with disease severity.

With the growing recognition that quality-of-life outcomes are an essential component of therapeutic efficacy, it is recommended that more trials include disease-specific QoL questionnaires as a primary outcome measure. It is equally as important and recommended for physicians to carry out routine QoL assessments on their patients during consultations. This should be done, to be able to identify patients that may benefit from extra psychological support and to be able to consider psychological wellness scores when planning management. It is also important for patients to be educated on different management options and to be informed that not all clinically effective treatments will improve their QoL.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^5c15f5fa]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### American Thyroid Association statement on optimal surgical management of goiter [^dfc07a35]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Goiter, or benign enlargement of the thyroid gland, can be asymptomatic or can cause compression of surrounding structures such as the esophagus and/or trachea. The options for medical treatment of euthyroid goiter are short-lived and are limited to thyroxine hormone suppression and radioactive iodine ablation. The objective of this statement article is to discuss optimal surgical management of goiter.

Methods

A task force was convened by the Surgical Affairs Committee of the American Thyroid Association and was tasked with writing of this article.

Results/Conclusions

Surgical management is recommended for goiters with compressive symptoms. Symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, and dysphagia are more commonly associated with thyromegaly, in particular, substernal goiters. Several studies have demonstrated improved breathing and swallowing outcomes after thyroidectomy. With careful preoperative testing and thoughtful consideration of the type of anesthesia, including the type of intubation, preparation for surgery can be optimized. In addition, planning the extent of surgery and postoperative care are necessary to achieve optimal results. Close collaboration of an experienced surgical and anesthesia team is essential for induction and reversal of anesthesia. In addition, this team must be cognizant of complications from massive goiter surgery such as bleeding, airway distress, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and transient hypoparathyroidism. With careful preparation and teamwork, successful thyroid surgery can be achieved.

Thyroid nodule management — initial evaluation and laboratory testing — is based on high-resolution ultrasonography (US), sensitive thyrotropin (TSH) assay, and fine-needle aspiration (FNA), with thyroid scintigraphy not necessary for diagnosis in most cases; measurement of serum TSH is the best initial test and should be followed by free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) when TSH is decreased, thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) and FT4 when TSH is above the reference range, and a single serum calcitonin only when medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is suspected due to FNA results or history, noting scintigraphy may be warranted in low TSH or multinodular goiter with low functional autonomy, most common in iodine-deficient areas.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^ca9f6d0d]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### Thyroid nodule evaluation and management in older adults: a Review of practical considerations for clinical endocrinologists [^dc9092ef]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Contextualizing the evaluation of older adults with thyroid nodules is necessary to fully understand which management strategy is the most appropriate. Our goal was to summarize available clinical evidence to provide guidance in the care of older adults with thyroid nodules and highlight special considerations for thyroid nodule evaluation and management in this population.

Methods

We conducted a literature search of PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE from January 2000 to November 2020 to identify relevant peer-reviewed articles published in English. References from the included articles as well as articles identified by the authors were also reviewed.

Results

The prevalence of thyroid nodules increases with age. Although thyroid nodules in older adults have a lower risk of malignancy, identified cancers are more likely to be of high-risk histology. The goals of thyroid nodule evaluation and the tools used for diagnosis are similar for older and younger patients with thyroid nodules. However, limited evidence exists regarding thyroid nodule evaluation and management to guide personalized decision making in the geriatric population.

Conclusion

Considering patient context is significant in the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules in older adults. When making management decisions in this population, it is essential to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of thyroid nodule diagnosis and treatment, in view of older adults' higher prevalence of high-risk thyroid cancer as well as increased risk for multimorbidity, functional and cognitive decline, and treatment complications.

### Thyroiditis: evaluation and treatment… [^5194736d]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

1 In patients who are asymptomatic, HT is usually the incidental finding of the goiter that prompted an evaluation. Other patients may report typical symptoms of hypothyroidism such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, depression, myalgia, menorrhagia, and dry skin. Many of these symptoms overlap with other disorders and may not always correlate with the degree of thyroid dysfunction. 1 Some patients may present with self-limited transient thyrotoxicosis or a hyperthyroid phase caused by destructive inflammation attributed to HT damaging the thyroid follicles, releasing excess thyroid hormone. 18 The thyroid gland is often diffusely enlarged and firm with an irregular surface on examination. 15 Some patients have a small thyroid volume if underlying atrophy of the thyroid gland has occurred. 2 Patients with goiter may have compressive symptoms such as dysphonia, dyspnea, and dysphagia.

1. 3 is not routinely recommended.

The patient's TSH level should be remeasured four to six weeks after initiation and the dose of levothyroxine adjusted to achieve a value in the normal reference range. Clinicians may try to achieve slightly higher TSH levels in older patients. It is reasonable to make dosage adjustments of 12. 5 to 25 mcg of levothyroxine per day at four- to six-week intervals until the intended TSH level is reached. 7 Measurement of thyroid antibodies can help distinguish between postpartum thyroiditis and Graves disease. The presence of thyrotropin receptor antibodies usually indicates Graves disease. Elevated TPO and thyroglobulin antibodies are often found in patients with postpartum thyroiditis, and mildly positive thyrotropin receptor antibodies have also been reported. 12, 20 In postpartum thyroiditis, there is a release of preformed thyroid hormone, and the T₄:T₃ ratio is usually higher than in Graves disease.

21 Postpartum thyroiditis is a destructive process, and antithyroid medications are not indicated. 6, 22 Treatment of the hypothyroid phase with levothyroxine is recommended, especially if the patient is symptomatic, attempting pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Thyroid function testing should be performed every four to eight weeks. 12 Those with a history of postpartum thyroiditis should have an annual TSH test to evaluate for permanent hypothyroidism. 22.

Radioiodine therapy for hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules and toxic multinodular goiter (MNG) — indications, effects, and risks: Radioiodine is indicated for the treatment of hyperthyroidism caused by a hyperfunctioning nodule or a toxic MNG, and aims include ablation of autonomously functioning areas, restoration of euthyroidism, and reduction of goiter size. Radioiodine therapy normalizes thyroid function in 85 to 100% of patients with hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules or toxic MNGs, and after treatment the thyroid volume generally decreases substantially with a median decrease of 35% at 3 months and 45% at 24 months. However, postradioiodine hypothyroidism may develop in up to 60% of patients after 20 years, and immunogenic hyperthyroidism may occur in up to 5% of patients, typically occurring 3 to 6 months after radioiodine treatment.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and associazione medici endocrinologi medical guidelines for clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules [^e3d7ba7b]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common and are frequently benign. Current data suggest that the prevalence of palpable thyroid nodules is 3% to 7% in North America; the prevalence is as high as 50% based on ultrasonography (US) or autopsy data. The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH) assays, the widespread application of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, and the availability of high-resolution US have substantially improved the management of thyroid nodules. This document was prepared as a collaborative effort between the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Associazione Medici Endocrinologi (AME). Most Task Force members are members of AACE. We have used the AACE protocol for clinical practice guidelines, with rating of available evidence, linking the guidelines to the strength of recommendations. Key observations include the following. Although most patients with thyroid nodules are asymptomatic, occasionally patients complain of dysphagia, dysphonia, pressure, pain, or symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Absence of symptoms does not rule out a malignant lesion; thus, it is important to review risk factors for malignant disease. Thyroid US should not be performed as a screening test. All patients with a palpable thyroid nodule, however, should undergo US examination. US-guided FNA (US-FNA) is recommended for nodules ≥ 10 mm; US-FNA is suggested for nodules < 10 mm only if clinical information or US features are suspicious. Thyroid FNA is reliable and safe, and smears should be interpreted by an experienced pathologist. Patients with benign thyroid nodules should undergo follow-up, and malignant or suspicious nodules should be treated surgically. A radioisotope scan of the thyroid is useful if the TSH level is low or suppressed. Measurement of serum TSH is the best initial laboratory test of thyroid function and should be followed by measurement of free thyroxine if the TSH value is low and of thyroid peroxidase antibody if the TSH value is high. Percutaneous ethanol injection is useful in the treatment of cystic thyroid lesions; large, symptomatic goiters may be treated surgically or with radioiodine. Routine measurement of serum calcitonin is not recommended. Suggestions for thyroid nodule management during pregnancy are presented. We believe that these guidelines will be useful to clinical endocrinologists, endocrine surgeons, pediatricians, and internists whose practices include management of patients with thyroid disorders. These guidelines are thorough and practical, and they offer reasoned and balanced recommendations based on the best available evidence.

Recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) prestimulation with radioiodine for nontoxic goiter — the use of rhTSH is currently off-label; radioiodine uptake is doubled with rhTSH doses as small as 0.03 to 0.1 mg, and an interval of at least 24 hours between rhTSH stimulation and radioiodine administration seems optimal. In combination with radioiodine, rhTSH decreases goiter volume 50 to 56% more than nonstimulated therapy and can improve respiratory function, though patient satisfaction effects are unclear. The main adverse effect is transient, dose-dependent hyperthyroidism starting 4 to 8 hours after injection, peaking after 24 to 48 hours, and normalizing within 3 weeks; with rhTSH doses of ≥ 0.1 mg, thyroid hormone levels are maintained within the reference range in most patients. Acute dose-related thyroid swelling has been shown, with an increase in mean thyroid volume of 35% with 0.9 mg rhTSH, 24% with 0.3 mg rhTSH, and 10% with 0.1 mg rhTSH; therefore, the optimal rhTSH dose seems to be ≤ 0.1 mg.

### Hyperthyroidism [^d08bafee]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis causes a variety of symptoms and adverse health outcomes. Hyperthyroidism refers to increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, most commonly from Graves' disease or toxic nodular goitre, whereas thyroiditis (typically autoimmune, viral, or drug induced) causes thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism. The diagnosis is based on suppressed serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), accompanied by free thyroxine and total or free tri-iodothyronine concentrations, which are raised (overt hyperthyroidism) or within range (subclinical hyperthyroidism). The underlying cause is determined by clinical assessment, detection of TSH-receptor antibodies and, if necessary, radionuclide thyroid scintigraphy. Treatment options for hyperthyroidism include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy, whereas thyroiditis is managed symptomatically or with glucocorticoid therapy. In Graves' disease, first-line treatment is a 12-18-month course of antithyroid drugs, whereas for goitre, radioactive iodine or surgery are preferred for toxic nodules or goitres. Evidence also supports long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs as an option for patients with Graves' disease and toxic nodular goitre.

Autoantibodies and thyroglobulin (Tg) — diagnostic scope in thyroid nodules: Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) should be measured in patients with abnormal levels of serum TSH, while thyroglobulin antibody testing should be limited to those with ultrasonography and clinical findings suggestive of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and with normal TPOAb levels. Thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) determination should be performed in patients with hyperthyroidism, noting that 17% of patients in iodine-deficient areas with scintigraphically toxic multinodular goiter test positive for TRAb. Assessment of serum Tg is not recommended in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules, and its use is not recommended in routine clinical practice in the evaluation of thyroid nodules.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^c59de0e6]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the American Thyroid Association's (ATA's) guidelines for the management of these disorders were revised in 2009, significant scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer.

Methods

The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles on adults were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations for therapeutic interventions. We developed a similarly formatted system to appraise the quality of such studies and resultant recommendations. The guideline panel had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members.

Results

The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers, and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and thyrotropin suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using imaging and serum thyroglobulin, thyroid hormone therapy, management of recurrent and metastatic disease, consideration for clinical trials and targeted therapy, as well as directions for future research.

Conclusions

We have developed evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making in the management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. They represent, in our opinion, contemporary optimal care for patients with these disorders.

### Thyroid nodules: diagnostic evaluation based on thyroid cancer risk assessment [^7f395a97]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Thyroid nodules are extremely common and can be detected by sensitive imaging in more than 60% of the general population. They are often identified in patients without symptoms who are undergoing evaluation for other medical complaints. Indiscriminate evaluation of thyroid nodules with thyroid biopsy could cause a harmful epidemic of diagnoses of thyroid cancer, but inadequate selection of thyroid nodules for biopsy can lead to missed diagnoses of clinically relevant thyroid cancer. Recent clinical guidelines advocate a more conservative approach in the evaluation of thyroid nodules based on risk assessment for thyroid cancer, as determined by clinical and ultrasound features to guide the need for biopsy. Moreover, newer evidence suggests that for patients with indeterminate thyroid biopsy results, a combined assessment including the initial ultrasound risk stratification or other ancillary testing (molecular markers, second opinion on thyroid cytology) can further clarify the risk of thyroid cancer and the management strategies. This review summarizes the clinical importance of adequate evaluation of thyroid nodules, focuses on the clinical evidence for diagnostic tests that can clarify the risk of thyroid cancer, and highlights the importance of considering the patient's values and preferences when deciding on management strategies in the setting of uncertainty about the risk of thyroid cancer.

Hyperthyroidism management — radioactive iodine for toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG) or toxic adenoma (TA) — For radioactive iodine treatment of TMNG, sufficient radiation should be administered in a single dose to alleviate hyperthyroidism, and for TA, sufficient radiation to alleviate hyperthyroidism should be administered in a single dose. Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after radioactive iodine therapy for TMNG or TA should include an assessment of free T4, total T3 and TSH, and this should be repeated at 1–2 month intervals until stable results are obtained, then at least annually thereafter according to clinical indication. If hyperthyroidism persists beyond 6 months following 131I therapy for TMNG or TA, retreatment with radioactive iodine is suggested. Nonfunctioning nodules on radionuclide scintigraphy or nodules with suspicious ultrasound characteristics should be managed according to recently published guidelines regarding thyroid nodules in euthyroid individuals.

### The role of nuclear medicine in the clinical management of benign thyroid disorders, part 2: nodular goiter, hypothyroidism, and subacute thyroiditis [^58cec304]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Part 2 of this series of Continuing Education articles on benign thyroid disorders deals with nodular goiter, hypothyroidism, and subacute thyroiditis. Together with Part 1 (which dealt with various forms of hyperthyroidism), this article is intended to provide relevant information for specialists in nuclear medicine dealing with the clinical management of patients with benign thyroid disorders, the primary audience for this series. Goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland, is a common endocrine abnormality. Constitutional factors, genetic abnormalities, or dietary and environmental factors may contribute to the development of nodular goiter. Most patients with nontoxic nodular goiter are asymptomatic or have only mild mechanical symptoms (globus pharyngis). Work-up of these patients includes measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyroid autoantibodies, ultrasound imaging, thyroid scintigraphy, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy of nodules with certain ultrasound and scintigraphic features. Treatment for multinodular goiter includes dietary iodine supplementation, surgery, radioiodine therapy (to decrease thyroid size), and minimally invasive ablation techniques. Hypothyroidism ranges from rare cases of myxedema to more common mild forms (subclinical hypothyroidism). Primary hypothyroidism often has an autoimmune etiology. Clinical presentations differ in neonates, children, adults, and elderly patients. Work-up includes thyroid function tests and ultrasound imaging. Nuclear medicine is primarily used to locate ectopic thyroid tissue in congenital hypothyroidism or to detect defects in iodine organification with the perchlorate discharge test. Treatment consists of thyroid replacement therapy with l-thyroxine, adjusting the daily dose to the individual patient's metabolic and hormonal requirements. Subacute thyroiditis is a self-limited inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland, often associated with painless or painful swelling of the gland and somatic signs or symptoms. Inflammation disrupts thyroid follicles resulting in a rapid release of stored thyroxine and triiodothyronine causing an initial thyrotoxic phase, often followed by transient or permanent hypothyroidism. Although subacute thyroiditis is often related to a viral infection, no infective agent has been identified. Subacute thyroiditis may be caused by a viral infection in genetically predisposed individuals. Work-up includes lab tests, ultrasound imaging, and radionuclide imaging. Thyroid scintigraphy demonstrates different findings depending on the phase of the illness, ranging from very low or absent tracer uptake in the thyroid gland in the hyperthyroid phase to a normal appearance in the late recovery phase. Since subacute thyroiditis is self-limited, treatment is directed toward relief of pain. High-dose nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are usually the first-line treatment. If severe pain persists, a course of corticosteroids may be necessary. Permanent hypothyroidism develops in up to 15% of patients with subacute thyroiditis, even more than 1 y after presentation.

Mild active GO treated with RAI — concurrent glucocorticoids: In the absence of any strong contraindication to GC use we suggest considering them for coverage of GD patients with mild active GO who are treated with RAI, even in the absence of risk factors for GO deterioration. The decision on whether to administer concurrent glucocorticoids in a particular patient choosing RAI therapy should be made in the light of risk–benefit considerations (i.e., their personal risk of worsening GO, balanced against their risk of developing glucocorticoid side effects). Risk factors for deterioration to be considered include active and progressive GO over the preceding 3 months and high serum pretreatment TRAb levels (normal < 1.75 IU/L, high risk for GO progression if > 8.8 IU/L). For prophylaxis, a randomized clinical trial validated prednisone 0.4–0.5 mg/kg per day, started 1–3 days after RAI administration, continued for 1 month, and then tapered over 2 months; a retrospective cohort suggested about 0.2 mg/kg per day for 6 weeks may be equally effective for prevention of GO exacerbation in patients with initially mild or absent eye disease; currently most task force members use a minimum starting dose of 30 mg prednisone daily, tapering off within 6–8 weeks. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

Thyroid nodule evaluation — serum thyrotropin (TSH) and radionuclide scan — With the discovery of a thyroid nodule > 1 cm in any diameter, a serum TSH level should be obtained, and if the serum TSH is subnormal, a radionuclide thyroid scan should be obtained to document whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning, isofunctioning, or nonfunctioning. Since hyperfunctioning nodules rarely harbor malignancy, if one corresponds to the nodule, no cytologic evaluation is necessary, although if overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism is present, additional evaluation is required. A higher serum TSH level, even within the upper part of the reference range, is associated with increased risk of malignancy in a thyroid nodule, as well as more advanced stage thyroid cancer.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^22fb1b8f]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

American Thyroid Association — evaluation of multinodular thyroid glands: Patients with multiple thyroid nodules ≥ 1 cm should be evaluated like solitary nodules ≥ 1 cm, recognizing that each nodule > 1 cm may require fine-needle aspiration (FNA) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). When multiple nodules ≥ 1 cm are present, FNA should be prioritized by nodule sonographic pattern and respective size cutoff (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). If no nodule has a high or moderate suspicion pattern and multiple similar very low or low suspicion nodules coalesce without intervening normal parenchyma, it is reasonable to aspirate the largest nodules (≥ 2 cm) or continue surveillance without FNA (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with low or low-normal serum TSH and multiple nodules, a radionuclide (preferably 123I) thyroid scan should be considered and compared to ultrasound (US) images to determine functionality of nodules ≥ 1 cm, and FNA should then be considered only for isofunctioning or nonfunctioning nodules, prioritizing those with high suspicion sonographic pattern for aspiration.

### The diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules: a review [^3654f39b]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Thyroid nodules are common, being detected in up to 65% of the general population. This is likely due to the increased use of diagnostic imaging for purposes unrelated to the thyroid. Most thyroid nodules are benign, clinically insignificant, and safely managed with a surveillance program. The main goal of initial and long-term follow-up is identification of the small subgroup of nodules that harbor a clinically significant cancer (≈10%), cause compressive symptoms (≈5%), or progress to functional disease (≈5%).

Observations

Thyroid function testing and ultrasonographic characteristics guide the initial management of thyroid nodules. Certain ultrasound features, such as a cystic or spongiform appearance, suggest a benign process that does not require additional testing. Suspicious sonographic patterns including solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications should prompt cytological evaluation. Additional diagnostic procedures, such as molecular testing, are indicated only in selected cases, such as indeterminate cytology (≈20%-30% of all biopsies). The initial risk estimate, derived from ultrasound and, if performed, cytology report, should determine the need for treatment and the type, frequency, and length of subsequent follow-up. Management includes simple observation, local treatments, and surgery and should be based on the estimated risk of malignancy and the presence and severity of compressive symptoms.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most thyroid nodules are benign. A diagnostic approach that uses ultrasound and, when indicated, fine-needle aspiration biopsy and molecular testing, facilitates a personalized, risk-based protocol that promotes high-quality care and minimizes cost and unnecessary testing.

Serum thyrotropin (TSH) testing and radionuclide scan use in thyroid nodules — graded recommendations: "Serum thyrotropin (TSH) should be measured during the initial evaluation of a patient with a thyroid nodule" (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). "If the serum TSH is subnormal, a radionuclide (preferably 123I) thyroid scan should be performed" (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). "If the serum TSH is normal or elevated, a radionuclide scan should not be performed as the initial imaging evaluation" (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence).

### Thyroid nodules: advances in evaluation and management [^d9ba0f05]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodules can be detected by ultrasonography in up to 68% of the general population. They are typically benign and are often discovered incidentally. The primary goal of thyroid nodule evaluation is to determine whether it is malignant. After thyroid ultrasonography has been performed, the next step is measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone. If levels are low, a radionuclide thyroid uptake scan is indicated. Hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely malignant and do not require tissue sampling. Nonfunctioning nodules and nodules in a patient with a normal or high thyroid-stimulating hormone level may require fine-needle aspiration based on ultrasound characteristics and size. Nodules with suspicious features and solid hypoechoic nodules 1 cm or larger require aspiration. The Bethesda System (categories 1 through 6) is used to classify samples. Molecular testing can be used to guide treatment when aspiration yields an indeterminate result. Molecular testing detects mutations associated with thyroid cancer and can help inform decisions about surgical excision vs. continued ultrasound monitoring. Treatment of pregnant women with nonfunctioning thyroid nodules and of children with thyroid nodules is similar to that for nonpregnant adults, with the exception of molecular testing, which has not been validated in these populations.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2015 — Thyroid sonography and lymph node survey (Recommendation 6) states that thyroid sonography with survey of the cervical lymph nodes should be performed in all patients with known or suspected thyroid nodules (Strong recommendation, High-quality evidence). Diagnostic thyroid/neck ultrasound (US) should be performed in all patients with a suspected thyroid nodule, nodular goiter, or a radiographic abnormality suggesting an incidentally detected thyroid nodule (including CT, MRI, or 18FDG-PET uptake). US should evaluate thyroid parenchyma and gland size; nodule size, location, and characteristics; and the presence or absence of suspicious cervical lymph nodes, and the report should document three-dimensional nodule size, location, and detailed features (composition, echogenicity, margins, calcifications, shape if taller than wide, and vascularity). In patients with low serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) who have radionuclide thyroid scintigraphy suggesting nodularity, US should also be performed to identify hyperfunctioning nodules that do not require FNA and nonfunctioning nodules that meet sonographic criteria for FNA.

Graves' hyperthyroidism — factors that favor choosing a particular modality: For 131I (radioactive iodine), favorable situations include females planning a pregnancy in the future in more than 4–6 months following radioiodine therapy provided thyroid hormone levels are normal, individuals with comorbidities increasing surgical risk, and patients with previously operated or externally irradiated necks or lack of access to a high-volume thyroid surgeon or contraindications to ATD use. For antithyroid drugs (ATDs), favorable features include patients with a high likelihood of remission such as especially females with mild disease, small goiters, and negative or low-titer TRAb; the elderly or others with comorbidities increasing surgical risk or with limited life expectancy; individuals in nursing homes or other care facilities who may have limited longevity and are unable to follow radiation safety regulations; patients with previously operated or irradiated necks; and patients with moderate to severe active GO. For surgery, indications include symptomatic compression or large goiters (≥ 80 g), relatively low uptake of radioactive iodine, and when thyroid malignancy is documented or suspected (e.g., suspicious or indeterminate cytology).

### American association of clinical endocrinology and associazione medici endocrinologi thyroid nodule algorithmic tool [^8ab76498]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The first edition of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology/American College of Endocrinology/Associazione Medici Endocrinologi Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Thyroid Nodules was published in 2006 and updated in 2010 and 2016. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology/American College of Endocrinology/Associazione Medici Endocrinologi multidisciplinary thyroid nodules task force was charged with developing a novel interactive electronic algorithmic tool to evaluate thyroid nodules.

Methods

The Thyroid Nodule App (termed TNAPP) was based on the updated 2016 clinical practice guideline recommendations while incorporating recent scientific evidence and avoiding unnecessary diagnostic procedures and surgical overtreatment. This manuscript describes the algorithmic tool development, its data requirements, and its basis for decision making. It provides links to the web-based algorithmic tool and a tutorial.

Results

TNAPP and TI-RADS were cross-checked on 95 thyroid nodules with histology-proven diagnoses.

Conclusion

TNAPP is a novel interactive web-based tool that uses clinical, imaging, cytologic, and molecular marker data to guide clinical decision making to evaluate and manage thyroid nodules. It may be used as a heuristic tool for evaluating and managing patients with thyroid nodules. It can be adapted to create registries for solo practices, large multispecialty delivery systems, regional and national databases, and research consortiums. Prospective studies are underway to validate TNAPP to determine how it compares with other ultrasound-based classification systems and whether it can improve the care of patients with clinically significant thyroid nodules while reducing the substantial burden incurred by those who do not benefit from further evaluation and treatment.

1. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS

1.1. Diagnosis and assessment

Key Point 3.1: Early diagnosis of TED and simple measures to prevent TED development or progression should be pursued.

Key Point 3.2: Endocrinologists managing patients with Graves' disease should identify referral pathways that ensure patient access to TED specialty care.

Key Point 3.3: Ophthalmologists are key to the management of TED and should always be involved in the care of patients with moderate-to-severe and sight-threatening TED.

Key Point 4.1.1: Endocrinologists should be familiar with basic elements of a TED examination enabling assessment of both activity and severity.

Key Point 4.1.2: Assessment of patients with TED should include activity, severity (with particular attention to impaired ocular motility and visual loss), trend across time, and impact on daily living.

Key Point 4.2.1: The physical and psychosocial impact of TED should be assessed for each patient, as it informs treatment decisions. When formal quantification of quality of life (QOL) is deemed appropriate, Graves' orbitopathy-quality of life (GO-QOL) is the preferred instrument.

Key Point 4.4.1: Orbital imaging using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is preferred for atypical or severe cases of TED to help determine activity and to exclude other etiologies that could be confused with TED.

Key Point 4.4.2: Noncontrast CT is the preferred modality in patients with TED who are being considered for surgery.

5 CONCLUSIONS

This is one of only a few studies to report on the characteristics of patients with hyperthyroidism in a UK population managed in an outpatient setting. We present some interesting findings showing the likely clinical response rates to various established treatment modalities. This is intended to aid clinicians counsel patients about benefits and risks of available treatment options and to help guide patients on often difficult treatment choices. In our opinion, this study should encourage the use of accurate record keeping and collection of real world data, facilitating the conduction of now mandatory specialist peer reviews in secondary care endocrine clinics.

### Thyroid physiology and thyroid function testing [^6051ffef]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The art and science of medicine has changed so much in the last 40 years, not only in the manner that physicians treat medical diseases but also in how they diagnose them. Technological advances have made it possible to have a test for almost anything. These technological advances, however, are important contributing factors to the rising cost of healthcare. More than ever, cost containment is an important element in all aspects of patient care. Minimizing costly diagnostic imaging and laboratory tests is essential in keeping healthcare costs reasonable but these tests should not be excluded at the risk of compromising patient care. For patients with thyroid disorders, the multiplicity of tests available do not make diagnoses more accurate or treatment more effective. A single test, the sensitive thyrotropin assay, most eloquently allows an organized, streamlined approach to the diagnoses and management of patients with thyroid disease. Even the most technologically advanced tests that are available cannot replace the clinical skills of the physician. Clinical acumen combined with the judicious use of diagnostic testing is one of the most important elements in diagnosing and treating a patient.

Laboratory evaluation of thyroid nodules — The high sensitivity of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assay makes it the most useful laboratory test in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules, and third-generation TSH chemiluminometric assays, with detection limits of about 0.01 μU/mL, should be used; if the serum TSH level is within the reference range (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism), the measurement of free thyroid hormones adds no further relevant information. To limit unnecessary laboratory testing, the following strategy should be followed for most patients: serum TSH within normal limits — no further testing (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism); increased serum TSH — test FT4 and TPOAb to evaluate for hypothyroidism; decreased serum TSH — test FT4 and total or FT3 to evaluate for hyperthyroidism.

Thyroid nodule management — How to select nodule(s) for ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA): In light of the low clinical risk, nodules with a major diameter < 5 mm should be monitored, rather than biopsied, with US. For nodules with a major diameter 5–10 mm that are associated with suspicious US signs, clinicians should consider either FNA sampling or watchful waiting on the basis of the clinical setting and patient preference. Specifically, US-guided FNA is recommended for subcapsular or paratracheal lesions, suspicious lymph nodes or extrathyroid spread, positive personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and coexistent suspicious clinical findings (e.g., dysphonia). FNA is recommended for high US risk thyroid lesions ≥ 10 mm, for intermediate US risk thyroid lesions > 20 mm, and for low US risk thyroid lesions only when > 20 mm and increasing in size or associated with a risk history and before thyroid surgery or minimally invasive ablation therapy. FNA is not recommended for nodules that are functional on scintigraphy.

Figure 1.
Alluvial flow diagram showing simulated management and outcomes for 1000 newly discovered thyroid nodules. The distributions of ultrasound (US)-defined risk classes, US-defined fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) indications, and Bethesda cytology class were derived from published findings. US risk-stratification is that recommended by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) Guidelines. Nodules not classifiable with the ATA system are included in the intermediate-suspicion category. Nondiagnostic nodules with very-low-suspicion or low-suspicion US findings can be managed with US surveillance, but repeat FNAB is indicated for those with intermediate- or high-suspicion US findings: in this diagram, all are shown as undergoing repeat biopsy. Bethesda II nodules require repeat biopsy only if the US-based risk class increases during surveillance (frequency: ~15% over 5 years of follow-up). The false-negative rate is less than 3% (e.g. sampling error; for high-suspicion nodules with Bethesda II cytology, repeat biopsy is suggested). For illustration purposes, all indeterminate nodules are shown as undergoing molecular testing (regardless of other possible options). The hypothetical molecular testing approach depicted has a benign call rate of 65%, a positive predictive value of 50%, and a negative predictive value of 96%. For high-suspicion nodules classified as benign by molecular testing, repeat biopsy is indicated. All Bethesda V and VI nodules are referred for surgery.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^5c0dbb5c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

After the initial diagnostic workup described, very few of the nodules (10.8%) will be subjected to surgery, but a high percentage of those that are resected will prove be malignant (73.1% of the resected nodules; 7.9% of all nodules). Some nodules (14.5%) will require a repeat biopsy, immediately or during the long-term follow-up, to be classified. For Bethesda II nodules, a second cytological assessment is indicated only if the US-based risk class increases during surveillance (frequency: ~15% over 5 years of follow-up). Three-quarters of all nodules (74.7%) will be classified as benign and managed with long-term sonographic surveillance. False negatives (usually the result of sampling errors) are uncommon (less than 3%), but repeat biopsy should be considered for high-suspicion nodules with Bethesda II cytology. Most of these nodules (≈85%) will remain asymptomatic with no signs of growth and will therefore not require any treatment. This estimate is based on findings from a 5-year prospective study of 1567 benign thyroid nodules, which have subsequently been confirmed by retrospective studies.

### Approach to the pediatric patient with thyroid nodules [^03897343]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Sequential Analysis

The 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and DTC present an evaluation of thyroid nodules without any detail for stratification outside of screening for autonomous function. In patients presenting with a thyroid nodule and a normal TSH, thyroid ultrasound is followed by FNA. This approach does not take advantage of the ATA adult sonographic pattern to predict the risk of malignancy or the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System (TIRADS), 2 models that are being used with increasing frequency in clinical practice since publication of the 2015 ATA pediatric guidelines.

### Management of Grave's disease: a review [^193d1dee]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Graves disease is the most common cause of persistent hyperthyroidism in adults. Approximately 3% of women and 0.5% of men will develop Graves disease during their lifetime.

Observations

We searched PubMed and the Cochrane database for English-language studies published from June 2000 through October 5, 2015. Thirteen randomized clinical trials, 5 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and 52 observational studies were included in this review. Patients with Graves disease may be treated with antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine (RAI), or surgery (near-total thyroidectomy). The optimal approach depends on patient preference, geography, and clinical factors. A 12- to 18-month course of antithyroid drugs may lead to a remission in approximately 50% of patients but can cause potentially significant (albeit rare) adverse reactions, including agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity. Adverse reactions typically occur within the first 90 days of therapy. Treating Graves disease with RAI and surgery result in gland destruction or removal, necessitating life-long levothyroxine replacement. Use of RAI has also been associated with the development or worsening of thyroid eye disease in approximately 15% to 20% of patients. Surgery is favored in patients with concomitant suspicious or malignant thyroid nodules, coexisting hyperparathyroidism, and in patients with large goiters or moderate to severe thyroid eye disease who cannot be treated using antithyroid drugs. However, surgery is associated with potential complications such as hypoparathyroidism and vocal cord paralysis in a small proportion of patients. In pregnancy, antithyroid drugs are the primary therapy, but some women with Graves disease opt to receive definitive therapy with RAI or surgery prior to becoming pregnant to avoid potential teratogenic effects of antithyroid drugs during pregnancy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Management of Graves disease includes treatment with antithyroid drugs, RAI, or thyroidectomy. The optimal approach depends on patient preference and specific patient clinical features such as age, history of arrhythmia or ischemic heart disease, size of goiter, and severity of thyrotoxicosis. Physicians should be familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of each therapy to best counsel their patients.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^baa73f59]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

ATA thyroid and pregnancy guidelines — management of cytologically benign thyroid nodules during pregnancy: Pregnancy is a risk factor for modest progression of nodular thyroid disease, but there is no evidence demonstrating that LT4 decreases size or arrests growth of thyroid nodules during pregnancy; therefore, LT4 suppressive therapy for thyroid nodules is not recommended during pregnancy. Nodules that were benign on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) but show rapid growth or ultrasound changes suspicious for malignancy should be evaluated with a repeat FNA and be considered for surgical intervention, whereas in the absence of rapid growth, benign nodules do not require surgery during pregnancy. Recommendation 60 states that pregnant women with cytologically benign thyroid nodules do not require special surveillance strategies during pregnancy and should be managed according to the 2015 ATA Management Guidelines for Adult Patients with Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Cancer, with Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

What to do with indeterminate results?

As noted, the term "indeterminate cytology" refers to Bethesda class III or class IV findings, which are associated with expected malignancy rates of 10% to 30% and 25% to 40%, respectively. The options suggested for identifying these nodules includes repeat FNAB for cytology and/or molecular testing and diagnostic lobectomy. Some data suggest that a repeat US risk stratification can be useful in predicting malignancy and in planning further steps for the management of indeterminate nodules, or at least those in Bethesda class III. However, if nodules are properly selected beforehand, and the pretest risk of malignancy is high, the utility of this approach may be reduced.

Cytological assessment of a second fine needle aspirate is commonly used, but it provides a definitive diagnosis for only 40% of class I (nondiagnostic) and III nodules. If the second cytological study is still indeterminate, diagnostic surgery (usually lobectomy) has traditionally been the only route to a definitive pathological diagnosis. It is obviously expensive and associated with some risks. And if the nodule proves to be malignant, reoperation (completion thyroidectomy) is often indicated, with added risks and costs. Up to 60% of patients undergoing lobectomy for an indeterminate nodule are likely to be over- or undertreated at initial surgery.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^262398ad]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

1, 5 In one study, 6 30 percent of subjects 19 to 50 years of age had an incidental nodule on ultrasonography. In addition, more than one half of the thyroid glands studied contained one or more nodules, with only about one in 10 being palpable. 6 Approximately 23 percent of solitary nodules are actually dominant nodules within a multinodular goiter. LABORATORY EVALUATION A sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone test should be drawn on patients to determine those with thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. About 69 to 74 percent of specimens are found to be benign. 2 Indeterminate or suspicious results occur in about 22 to 27 percent of all specimens. 2 When specimens contain insufficient material for diagnosis, a repeat FNA should be performed. The incidence of insufficient results can be improved with the use of ultrasound-guided FNA. Finally, about 4 percent of specimens are positive for cancer and most false-positive results usually indicate Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
2.

7, 9 suggest that short-term thyroxine therapy is not superior to placebo in patients with a solitary hypofunctioning colloid nodule. The efficacy of thyroxine is less certain for solitary nodules than for a diffuse or multinodular goiter. However, some patients may benefit, and suppressive therapy is considered an appropriate alternative as long as the patient is followed carefully at six-month intervals. 11, 17. When thyroxine therapy is selected to manage a benign thyroid nodule, the medication should be prescribed in dosages sufficient to suppress the TSH level to
0. 1 to 0. 5 μU per mL for six to 12 months. 11 More prolonged therapy should be reserved for patients in whom a decrease in nodule size is documented by ultrasonography. After 12 months, the dosage of thyroxine should be decreased to maintain the serum concentration of TSH in the low normal range. The patient and physician must weigh the benefits of long-term therapy and the potential risks.

While this option could be considered in younger women, decreased bone density and cardiac side effects, such as atrial fibrillation, present a concern and potential risk in post-menopausal women.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) thyroid surgery — preoperative communication regarding voice and parathyroid issues: Prior to surgery, the surgeon should communicate with the patient regarding surgical risks, including nerve and parathyroid injury, through the informed consent process and communicate with associated physicians, including anesthesia personnel, regarding important findings elicited during the preoperative workup (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). The preoperative consent process should include explicit discussion of the potential for temporary or permanent nerve injury and its clinical sequelae, including voice change, swallowing disability, risk of aspiration, and tracheostomy, as well as hypothyroidism, bleeding, scarring, disease recurrence, need for additional postoperative treatment, and need for thyroid hormone and surveillance thyroid function tests; this conversation should be informed by the operating surgeon's own rates of complications, and results of the preoperative evaluation should include results from imaging, cytology, and physical examination.
