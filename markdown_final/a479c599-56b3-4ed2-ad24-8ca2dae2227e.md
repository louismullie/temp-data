## Question

Is metronidazole appropriate for treating Legionella pneumonia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether metronidazole is appropriate for treating Legionella pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biology and intracellular niche of Legionella and the implications for antibiotic selection. Then, I should review current guideline recommendations and comparative effectiveness data. Next, I will examine metronidazole's antimicrobial spectrum and mechanism to see if it plausibly covers Legionella. After that, I should consider the clinical risks of delayed appropriate therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation with dosing options and address any common confusions that could lead to metronidazole use.

> Let me first confirm the pathogen characteristics because this dictates pharmacologic choices; Legionella species are aerobic gram-negative bacilli that replicate intracellularly in alveolar macrophages, with L. pneumophila serogroup 1 causing most cases, so agents require robust intracellular penetration and activity against aerobic gram-negatives to be effective, which is a key therapeutic principle here [^115juLC9] [^117G9rqS].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines and outcome data; the ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia guideline recommends a macrolide (e.g., azithromycin) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g., levofloxacin) as first-line therapy when Legionella is suspected, with doxycycline as an alternative option in some settings, and HAP/VAP guidance similarly points to macrolides or fluoroquinolones when Legionella coverage is needed, while metronidazole is not listed among effective agents in any of these recommendations [^114NQhP1] [^117KRFW6]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify comparative effectiveness — systematic review and meta-analysis show fluoroquinolones and macrolides have similar mortality and clinical outcomes in Legionella pneumonia, supporting either class as acceptable first-line therapy [^114eApR7]. I will now examine supporting pharmacodynamics; levofloxacin and macrolides demonstrate potent in vitro activity against L. pneumophila, whereas metronidazole is notably absent from active agents in such panels, which is telling [^115yfP93]. Let me also check real-world monotherapy experience; prospective data with azithromycin in hospitalized Legionella pneumonia report high clinical cure rates, further corroborating guideline recommendations [^117G9rqS].

> Wait, let me verify metronidazole's spectrum and mechanism before concluding it is inappropriate; metronidazole is a 5‑nitroimidazole that requires reduction of its nitro group in low-oxygen environments to generate bactericidal radicals, conferring activity against anaerobes and certain protozoa, not obligate aerobes like Legionella, and its FDA‑labeled uses center on anaerobic infections or specific protozoal indications, not aerobic intracellular pathogens or Legionella pneumonia [^111D1X5q] [^1142RLB4] [^111px5kP] [^115xhBud]. I should double-check if any label or guideline lists Legionella for metronidazole — none do, reinforcing that it lacks the requisite activity for this infection [^111D1X5q] [^114NQhP1] [^1122r9WW].

> Let me think about the contrast explicitly; recommended anti‑Legionella agents (macrolides, respiratory fluoroquinolones, and sometimes doxycycline) combine intracellular penetration with proven clinical efficacy and supportive in vitro activity, whereas metronidazole neither covers aerobic gram‑negatives nor has evidence of intracellular efficacy against Legionella, and it is not endorsed by guidelines for this indication, which makes its use here pharmacologically unsound [^114NQhP1] [^114YfSkz] [^115yfP93].

> I should confirm the clinical stakes of getting this wrong; delayed initiation of appropriate Legionella therapy is associated with worse outcomes and higher mortality, whereas early use of active agents like levofloxacin has been associated with faster defervescence and earlier clinical stability, so relying on metronidazole would effectively leave the infection untreated and increase risk of harm [^112XJ4ZF] [^1168jy1B].

> But wait, what if the confusion stems from drug names sounding similar; metronidazole is sometimes conflated with macrolides because of naming familiarity, yet they are unrelated classes with distinct spectra, and only macrolides and fluoroquinolones are recommended for Legionella, with dosing supported by FDA labeling for azithromycin 500 mg daily and levofloxacin 750 mg daily in Legionella pneumonia, none of which applies to metronidazole [^1116XZgB] [^116AsBRF]. Hold on, I should verify levofloxacin label variants; both 500 mg and 750 mg regimens are FDA‑labeled for CAP with Legionella listed, with the higher dose used commonly for severe disease or to optimize PK/PD, which aligns with practice patterns [^116mcFFM] [^116AsBRF].

> Final synthesis: Metronidazole is not appropriate for treating Legionella pneumonia because it lacks activity against aerobic intracellular pathogens and is not recommended by guidelines or supported by clinical data; instead, initiate a macrolide such as azithromycin 500 mg IV/PO daily or a respiratory fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin 750 mg IV/PO daily for at least 5–7 days, tailoring duration to clinical response and severity, with doxycycline as a potential alternative when macrolides/fluoroquinolones are contraindicated, and do so promptly to avoid the harms of delayed therapy [^114NQhP1] [^1116XZgB] [^116AsBRF] [^116mcFFM] [^114eApR7] [^112XJ4ZF].

Metronidazole is ineffective for **Legionella pneumonia** because it has no activity against Legionella species, aerobic intracellular bacteria. The recommended first-line treatments are **fluoroquinolones** (e.g. levofloxacin) or **macrolides** (e.g. azithromycin) [^114NQhP1], which have demonstrated efficacy [^114eApR7] and intracellular penetration [^114YfSkz]. Metronidazole should not be used for Legionella pneumonia; it is reserved for anaerobic or protozoal infections [^111D1X5q].

---

## Pharmacological properties of metronidazole

Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic with **activity against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa** [^111D1X5q]. Its mechanism involves reduction of the nitro group under anaerobic conditions, generating reactive intermediates that damage DNA and lead to cell death. This activity is limited to anaerobic or microaerophilic organisms because aerobic bacteria lack the enzymes needed for nitro group reduction.

---

## Legionella pneumophila: microbiological characteristics

Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative, aerobic, facultative intracellular bacterium that replicates within macrophages and amoebae. It **requires antibiotics with intracellular penetration** and activity in aerobic environments [^117G9rqS]. Standard treatments include fluoroquinolones (e.g. levofloxacin) [^114eApR7] and macrolides (e.g. azithromycin), which have demonstrated efficacy in clinical studies [^114hgaXj].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding metronidazole and Legionella pneumonia

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting metronidazole in Legionella pneumonia. Metronidazole lacks activity against aerobic bacteria, including Legionella species, and is not recommended by guidelines or expert consensus. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines recommend fluoroquinolones or macrolides as first-line therapy for Legionella pneumonia [^114eApR7] and do not mention metronidazole [^114NQhP1].

---

## Comparative effectiveness of metronidazole versus standard treatments

No **clinical trials** or studies have compared metronidazole with standard treatments (fluoroquinolones or macrolides) for Legionella pneumonia. Metronidazole's lack of activity against Legionella precludes its use as an alternative or adjunctive therapy. In contrast, fluoroquinolones and macrolides have demonstrated efficacy [^114eApR7], with fluoroquinolones associated with faster clinical improvement [^1168jy1B] and shorter hospital stays.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations **consistently advise against metronidazole** for Legionella pneumonia [^114NQhP1]. The IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend fluoroquinolones or macrolides as first-line therapy and do not mention metronidazole [^114NQhP1]. Expert reviews and clinical studies emphasize the importance of antibiotics with intracellular activity, such as fluoroquinolones and macrolides [^114eApR7], for effective treatment of Legionella pneumonia [^114hgaXj].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of metronidazole

Metronidazole carries risks and adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances, neurotoxicity, and hematologic abnormalities. These risks **outweigh any potential benefit**, given its lack of activity against Legionella species. Additionally, inappropriate use of metronidazole may contribute to antibiotic resistance and adverse clinical outcomes [^116NEoCU].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Metronidazole is ineffective for **Legionella pneumonia** because it lacks activity against aerobic bacteria. Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations consistently advise against its use [^114NQhP1]. Fluoroquinolones or macrolides remain the recommended first-line treatments for Legionella pneumonia [^114eApR7], while metronidazole should be reserved for anaerobic or protozoal infections [^111D1X5q] — not for Legionella pneumonia.

### Azithromycin in the treatment of Legionella pneumonia requiring hospitalization [^114hgaXj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Azithromycin is highly active against Legionella pneumophila and has been shown to be efficacious in animal models and in clinical studies of patients with Legionnaires' disease. This open, prospective, multicenter trial evaluated azithromycin for the treatment of Legionnaires' disease. Twenty-five hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia and a positive result of an L. pneumophila serogroup 1 urinary antigen assay received monotherapy with intravenous azithromycin (500 mg/day) for 2–7 days, followed by oral azithromycin (1500 mg administered over the course of 3 or 5 days). The mean total duration of intravenous plus oral therapy was 7.92 days. The overall cure rate among clinically evaluable patients was 95% (20 of 21 patients) at 10–14 days after therapy and 96% (22 of 23 patients) at 4–6 weeks after therapy. The results of this study support previously reported data demonstrating that azithromycin is both safe and efficacious for the treatment of hospitalized patients with Legionnaires' disease.

### Are fluoroquinolones or macrolides better for treating Legionella pneumonia? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114eApR7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends either a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide as a first-line antibiotic treatment for Legionella pneumonia, but it is unclear which antibiotic leads to optimal clinical outcomes. We compared the effectiveness of fluoroquinolone versus macrolide monotherapy in Legionella pneumonia using a systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic search of literature in PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to 1 June 2019. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing macrolide with fluoroquinolone monotherapy using clinical outcomes in patients with Legionella pneumonia were included. Twenty-one publications out of an initial 2073 unique records met the selection criteria. Following PRISMA guidelines, two reviewers participated in data extraction. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included clinical cure, time to apyrexia, length of hospital stay (LOS), and the occurrence of complications. The review and meta-analysis were registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019132901).

- **Results**: Twenty-one publications with 3525 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age of the population was 60.9 years and 67.2% were men. The mortality rate for patients treated with fluoroquinolones was 6.9% (104/1512) compared with 7.4% (133/1790) among those treated with macrolides. The pooled odds ratio assessing the risk of mortality for patients treated with fluoroquinolones versus macrolides was 0.94 (95% confidence interval, .71–1.25, I2 = 0%, P = 0.661).

Regarding medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, particularly in the context of empiric antibiotic therapy for MSSA coverage, the ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend considering the administration of antibiotics with activity against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Suitable antibiotics include piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem. These are suggested for the initial empiric treatment of patients with HAP who have no risk factors for MRSA infection and are not at high risk of mortality.

### The association of antibiotic treatment regimen and hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with Legionella pneumonia [^115targL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend azithromycin or a quinolone antibiotic for the treatment of Legionella pneumonia. No clinical study has compared these strategies. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of adults hospitalized in the United States with a diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia in the Premier Perspectives database (1 July 2008–30 June 2013). Our primary outcome was hospital mortality. We additionally evaluated hospital length of stay, development of Clostridium difficile colitis, and total hospital cost. We used propensity-based matching to compare patients treated with azithromycin vs. a quinolone. All analyses were repeated on a subgroup of more severely ill patients, defined as requiring intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation, or having a predicted probability of hospital mortality in the top quartile for all patients.

Legionella pneumonia was diagnosed in 3,152 adults across 437 hospitals. Quinolones alone were used in 28.8%, azithromycin alone was used in 34.0%, and 1.8% received both. Crude hospital mortality was similar: 6.6% (95% confidence interval, 5.0%-8.2%) for quinolones vs 6.4% (95% CI, 5.0%-7.9%) for azithromycin (P = 0.87); after propensity matching (n = 813 in each group), mortality remained similar (6.3% [95% CI, 4.6%-7.9%] vs 6.5% [95% CI, 4.8%-8.2%], P = 0.84 for the whole cohort, and 14.9% [95% CI, 10.0%-19.8%] vs 18.3% [95% CI, 13.0%-23.6%], P = 0.36 for the more severely ill). There was no difference in hospital length of stay, development of C. difficile, or total hospital cost.

### Epidemiology and clinical management of Legionnaires' disease [^115juLC9]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Legionnaires' disease is an important cause of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Although uncommon, Legionnaires' disease continues to cause outbreaks of public health significance. The disease is caused by any species of the Gram-negative aerobic bacteria belonging to the genus Legionella; Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 is the causative agent of most cases in Europe. In this review, we outline the global epidemiology of Legionnaires' disease, summarize its diagnosis and management, and identify research gaps and priorities.

Early clinical diagnosis and prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotics for Legionella spp. in all patients with community-acquired or hospital-acquired pneumonias is a crucial measure for management of the disease. Progress in typing and sequencing technologies might additionally contribute to understanding the distribution and natural history of Legionnaires' disease and inform outbreak investigations. Control of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks relies on rapid ascertainment of descriptive epidemiological data, combined with microbiological information to identify the source and implement control measures.

Further research is required to define the actual burden of disease, factors that influence susceptibility, key sources of infection, and differences in virulence between strains of Legionella species. There is also a need for improved, specific, sensitive, and rapid diagnostic tests to accurately inform management of Legionnaires' disease, along with controlled clinical trials to ascertain the optimum antibiotics for treatment.

### In vitro activity of levofloxacin against contemporary clinical isolates of Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae from North America and Europe [^115yfP93]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

To assess the activities of levofloxacin and the comparator agents erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, and doxycycline against atypical respiratory pathogens, various isolates were obtained and analyzed. A total of 146 Legionella pneumophila, 41 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and nine Chlamydia pneumoniae isolates were procured from culture collections across North America and Europe and tested for susceptibility using broth microdilution. These isolates were mainly from clinical sources collected between 1995 and 1999.

Against Legionella pneumophila, levofloxacin demonstrated the highest activity, with an MIC(90) of 0.03 mg/L. It was twice as active as clarithromycin (0.06 mg/L), 16 times more active than erythromycin and azithromycin (0.5 mg/L), and 64 times more active than doxycycline. For Mycoplasma pneumoniae, while azithromycin was effective (MIC(90) ≥ 4 mg/L), levofloxacin also showed susceptibility with an MIC of 0.25 mg/L. The geographic origin of L. pneumophila and M. pneumoniae did not influence the MIC range for any tested antimicrobial agents. Concerning Chlamydia pneumoniae, clarithromycin was noted as the most active agent, with an MIC range of ≤ 0.008–0.03 mg/L.

Levofloxacin exhibited comparable activity to the other agents tested against these atypical respiratory pathogens, supporting its potential as an alternative for empirical therapy of community-acquired pneumonia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114NQhP1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of community-acquired pneumonia and more specifically empiric antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting for patients with comorbidities, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend administering combination therapy. This involves a β-lactam (such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg PO on the first day and 250 mg PO daily thereafter, clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO once daily) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (such as levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg PO daily). This is recommended for outpatients with CAP who have comorbidities such as chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, or asplenia.

### Acquired Fanconi syndrome in patients with Legionella pneumonia [^114dJDC4]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Because the electrolyte abnormalities disappeared after treatment for Legionella pneumonia and there was no evidence of other causes of Fanconi syndrome, it is most likely that Fanconi syndrome was associated with Legionella pneumonia in our cases. This is the first report of acquired Fanconi syndrome caused by infectious diseases.

Hyponatremia is known as a relatively common electrolyte abnormality in patients with Legionella pneumonia. The responsible mechanism of hyponatremia is thought to be SIADH. In accordance with this mechanism, the hyponatremia in Patient 1 was accompanied by improperly high levels of ADH and improved following the recovery from Legionella pneumonia.

However, other electrolyte abnormalities are uncommon in patients with Legionella pneumonia, and the precise mechanism remains to be clarified. In our cases, the laboratory findings at admission also showed hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypouricemia. In addition, remarkably increased urinary excretion of low-molecular-weight proteins such as β2-MG, decreased %TRP, increased FEK and FEUA, panaminoaciduria, and glycosuria coexisted. Therefore, our cases suggest that the proximal tubular dysfunction caused these serum electrolyte abnormalities.

A relationship has recently been proposed between mitochondrial disorders and Fanconi syndrome. For instance, it is known that patients with mitochondrial disorders, including mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), Kearns-Sayre syndrome, and anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody-positive primary biliary hyperactivity disorder, exhibit symptoms akin to those observed in Fanconi syndrome.

### Severe pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila: Differential diagnosis and therapeutic considerations [^117G9rqS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Severe Legionella pneumonia poses a diagnostic challenge and requires early intervention. Legionnaire's disease can have several presenting signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities that suggest that Legionella pneumophila is the pathogen, but none of these are sufficient to distinguish L. pneumophila pneumonia from other respiratory pathogens. L. pneumophila is primarily an intracellular pathogen and needs treatment with antibiotics that efficiently enter the intracellular space.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown.

Treatment of CAP has evolved due to changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Risk factors, management, and outcomes of Legionella pneumonia in a large, nationally representative sample [^1127AqX9]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

The American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend against routine Legionella pneumophila testing. However, they suggest that hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia receive empiric treatment covering Legionella. Testing, empiric treatment, and outcomes for patients with Legionella have not been well described.

- **Research question**: Is testing for Legionella pneumophila appropriate, and could it impact treatment?

- **Study design and methods**: We conducted a large retrospective cohort analysis using Premier Healthcare Database data from 2010 to 2015. We included adults with a principal diagnosis code for pneumonia (or a principal diagnosis of respiratory failure or sepsis with a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia) if they also received treatment for pneumonia on hospital days 1–3. We categorized Legionella-tested patients by test result, identified patient characteristics associated with testing and test result, and examined seasonal and regional patterns of Legionella pneumonia (LP) diagnoses. Empiric therapy for LP was defined as a macrolide, quinolone, or doxycycline, administered on each of the first two hospital days.

- **Results**: Of 166,689 eligible patients, 43,070 (26%) were tested for Legionella, and 642 (1.5%) tested positive. Although only 36% of tests were ordered from June to October, 70% of positive test results occurred during this time. Only 30% of patients with hyponatremia, 32% with diarrhea, and 27% in the ICU were tested. Of patients with positive test results, 495 of 642 (77%) had received empiric Legionella therapy.

### Atypical pneumonias: Current clinical concepts focusing on Legionnaires' disease [^113XZFyt]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

This review provides clinicians with an overview of the clinical features of atypical pneumonias. Atypical community-acquired pneumonia pathogens can cause systemic infections, including pneumonia. The key to the clinical diagnosis of atypical pneumonias lies in recognizing the characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement, which varies for each pathogen. As Legionella is likely to present as severe pneumonia and does not respond to beta-lactams, it is crucial to diagnose Legionnaires' disease clinically in order to include Legionella coverage in empiric therapy.

- **Recent findings**: Case reports and outbreaks have enhanced our understanding of Legionnaires' disease transmission. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophilia pneumoniae may contribute to asthma. Antimicrobial therapy targeting Chlamydophilia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae is essential to reduce person-to-person spread and potential long-term sequelae.

- **Summary**: Atypical pulmonary pathogens result in systemic infections with distinctive extrapulmonary features. Clinically, Legionnaires' disease can be differentiated from other typical or atypical pneumonias. Rapid clinical diagnosis of atypical pathogens, especially Legionnaires' disease, is important for selecting effective empiric therapy and initiating definitive laboratory testing.

### Legionnaires' disease caused by Legionella pneumophila serogroups 5 and 10, China [^111SWRQ4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

In China, Legionnaires' disease is often overlooked in the differential diagnosis of pneumonia because many clinicians lack experience with this condition. This case emphasizes the need to familiarize physicians with diagnostic methods for identifying Legionella pneumonia in clinics across China. It also underscores the importance of further epidemiologic surveillance to monitor the disease and enhance public health disease control strategies.

### Legionella pneumonia due to non-Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1: Usefulness of the six-point scoring system [^113ZNg98]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For laboratory findings, hepatic dysfunction, hyponatremia, and CPK elevation were indicated as more significant findings in Legionella pneumonia patients than in those with pneumonia from other etiologies. Almost half of our patients (5/11, 45.5%) had normal liver enzymes, no patient had serum sodium < 130 mEq/L, and only 2 of 4 had CPK elevation. The number of patients who did not have liver enzyme elevation and hyponatremia was 5 of 11 patients (45.5%). From these patterns of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, Legionella pneumonia seemed difficult to predict in these patients.

The usefulness of the six-point scoring system proposed by Fiumefreddo et al. in predicting Legionella pneumonia was validated by Haubitz et al. They showed that a score of ≥ 5 had a very high specificity of 99.0% (95% CI, 98.4–99.4) and a high positive predictive value of 17.4% (95% CI, 5.0–38.8), whereas a score of < 2 had high sensitivity of 94.4% (95% CI, 81.3–99.3) and a high negative predictive value of 99.6% (95% CI, 98.6–100). In this study, at a cut-off value of ≥ 2 points, the sensitivity of this scoring system was 54.5% (6/11) for non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients and 95.7% (22/23) for L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients. This finding indicated that we can rule out Legionella pneumonia due to L. pneumophila serogroup 1 by using this scoring system, whereas about half of the patients with Legionella pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 could have been misdiagnosed by this scoring system. Namely, Legionella pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 cannot be ruled out.

### Atypical pathogens and respiratory tract infections [^112KT3ri]. The European Respiratory Journal (2004). Low credibility.

The atypical respiratory pathogens Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are now recognized as a significant cause of acute respiratory tract infections. They are implicated in community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, asthma, and less frequently, upper respiratory tract infections. Chronic infection with C. pneumoniae is common among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and may also play a role in the natural history of asthma, including exacerbations.

The lack of a gold standard for diagnosing these pathogens still hinders the understanding of their true prevalence and role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic respiratory infections. While molecular diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, offer improvements in sensitivity, specificity, and rapidity over culture and serology, the need remains for a consistent and reproducible diagnostic technique available to all microbiology laboratories.

Treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia recognize the importance of atypical respiratory pathogens in its etiology, for which macrolides are considered suitable first-line agents. The value of atypical coverage in antibiotic therapy for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and exacerbations of asthma is less clear, while there is no evidence to suggest that atypical pathogens should be covered in the antibiotic treatment of upper respiratory tract infections.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting for patients with comorbidities, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend administering a combination therapy of a β-lactam (such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and doxycycline 100 mg PO BID as an option.

### Pneumococcal and legionella urinary antigen tests in community-acquired pneumonia: Prospective evaluation of indications for testing [^117VjPdd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) include indications for urinary antigen tests (UATs) for Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) and Legionella pneumophila (LP). These recommendations were based on expert opinions and have not been rigorously evaluated.

- **Methods**: We used data from a multicenter, prospective surveillance study of adults hospitalized with CAP to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the IDSA/ATS UAT indications for identifying patients who test positive. SP and LP UATs were completed on all included patients. Separate analyses were completed for SP and LP using 2-by-2 contingency tables, comparing the IDSA/ATS indications (UAT recommended vs. not recommended) and UAT results (positive vs. negative). Additionally, logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of each individual criterion in the IDSA/ATS indications with positive UAT results.

- **Results**: Among 1941 patients, UATs were positive for SP in 81 (4.2%) and for LP in 32 (1.6%). IDSA/ATS indications had 61% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 49–71%) and 39% specificity (95% CI 37–41%) for SP, and 63% sensitivity (95% CI 44–79%) and 35% specificity (95% CI 33–37%) for LP. No clinical characteristics were strongly associated with positive SP UATs, while features associated with positive LP UATs were hyponatremia, fever, diarrhea, and recent travel.

- **Conclusions**: Recommended indications for SP and LP urinary antigen testing in the IDSA/ATS CAP guidelines have poor sensitivity and specificity.

Hyponatremia is often observed in patients with Legionella pneumonia. However, other electrolyte abnormalities are uncommon, and the mechanism remains to be clarified.

- **Case presentation**: We experienced two male cases of acquired Fanconi syndrome associated with Legionella pneumonia. Laboratory findings at admission showed hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypouricemia, and/or hyponatremia. In addition, they had generalized dysfunction of the renal proximal tubules, presenting decreased tubular reabsorption of phosphate (%TRP), increased fractional excretion of potassium (FEK) and uric acid (FEUA), low-molecular-weight proteinuria, panaminoaciduria, and glycosuria. Therefore, they were diagnosed with Fanconi syndrome. Treatment for Legionella pneumonia with antibiotics resulted in the improvement of all serum electrolyte abnormalities and normalization of the %TRP, FEK, FEUA, low-molecular-weight proteinuria, panaminoaciduria, and glycosuria, suggesting that Legionella pneumophila infection contributed to the pathophysiology of Fanconi syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating Fanconi syndrome associated with Legionella pneumonia.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: Rapid evidence review [^116EUyQ5]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, particularly in the context of empiric antibiotic therapy for patients in outpatient settings without comorbidities, the AAFP 2022 guidelines recommend administering high-dose amoxicillin, doxycycline, or a macrolide. The use of a macrolide is contingent upon local macrolide resistance rates for pneumococcus being less than 25%, applicable to adult outpatients with CAP without comorbid conditions.

### Is activity against "atypical" pathogens necessary in the treatment protocols for community-acquired pneumonia? Issues with combination therapy [^115HnUNv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The "atypical pathogens" reviewed include Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Urinary antigen tests are the most frequently used tests for Legionella species and show good specificity and reasonable sensitivity. For M. pneumoniae, detection of immunoglobulin M, used for the past decade, has substantially improved diagnostic specificity and has simplified testing. For C. pneumoniae, there is no consensus on a simplified test that can be commonly used, and the reported results, using tests that have not been well-validated for diagnostic accuracy, show great variation in prevalence.

With regard to therapeutic trials, three meta-analyses have recently addressed the issue of clinical outcome with or without antibiotics directed against atypical pathogens (macrolides or fluoroquinolones vs. beta-lactam agents). These analyses have not been able to demonstrate any clinical benefit except in a subset analysis of infections caused by L. pneumophila. Nevertheless, multiple studies from the 1950s and 1960s supported a clinical benefit of tetracycline or erythromycin treatment for infections caused by M. pneumoniae.

The largest uncontrolled review of antibiotic treatment for hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia demonstrated a clear benefit from the use of macrolides plus cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, compared with the use of beta-lactams alone. Although these data support a potential role for atypical agents, other potential explanations make drawing conclusions difficult.

### Severe pneumonia due to concurrent Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii infections: a case report [^115hoqfw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Legionella pneumophila is an uncommon pathogen causing community-acquired atypical pneumonia. Acinetobacter baumannii is a major pathogen responsible for hospital-acquired pneumonia, but it rarely causes serious infections in a community setting. Without prompt and appropriate treatments, infection from either of these two pathogens can lead to a high mortality rate. Coinfection from both L. pneumophila and A. baumannii can cause serious outcomes, but it has rarely been reported previously.

- **Case presentation**: A 45-year-old male presented to our hospital with a productive cough and fever after staying in a local hotel. His chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral lower-lobe infiltration and left pleural effusion. Empirical antibiotics, including piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, meropenem, and doxycycline, were administered to treat community-acquired pneumonia. However, his condition deteriorated very rapidly, and he required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for respiratory support. Finally, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of his bronchoalveolar lavage fluid identified L. pneumophila and A. baumannii. The sputum culture demonstrated multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. He was diagnosed with pneumonia by coinfections from both L. pneumophila and A. baumannii. After careful consideration of the antibiotic susceptibility results and the antibacterial mechanism of each antibiotic, we switched the antibiotics to omadacycline and cefoperazone/sulbactam. His clinical symptoms gradually subsided.

Ofloxacin is not active against Treponema pallidum (see WARNINGS). Many strains of other streptococcal species, Enterococcus species, and anaerobes are resistant to ofloxacin.

- **Other microorganisms**: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Ureaplasma urealyticum.

- **Dilution techniques**: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC values). These MIC values provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MIC values should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (broth or agar) or equivalent, with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of ofloxacin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to specific criteria:

	- For testing Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
	- **For testing Haemophilus influenzae**: The absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any results other than "Susceptible". Strains yielding MIC results suggestive of a "nonsusceptible" category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
	- For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
	- For testing Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes.

A report of "Susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable. A report of "Intermediate" indicates that the…

### Legionnaires' disease [^113WuBa9]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Since first identified in early 1977, bacteria of the genus *Legionella* are recognized as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and a rare cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Legionella bacteria have multisystem manifestations that mainly affect susceptible patients due to age, underlying debilitating conditions, or immunosuppression. Water is the major natural reservoir for Legionella, and the pathogen is found in many different natural and artificial aquatic environments, such as cooling towers or water systems in buildings, including hospitals. The term given to the severe pneumonia and systemic infection caused by Legionella bacteria is Legionnaires' disease.

Over time, the prevalence of legionellosis or Legionnaires' disease has risen, which might indicate a greater awareness and reporting of the disease. Advances in microbiology have led to a better understanding of the ecological niches and pathogenesis of the condition. Legionnaires' disease is not always suspected because of its non-specific symptoms, and the diagnostic tests routinely available do not offer the desired sensitivity. However, effective antibiotics are available. Disease notification systems provide the basis for initiating investigations and limiting the scale and recurrence of outbreaks. This report reviews our understanding of this disease.

### Azithromycin [^113xXLZv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Community-acquired pneumonia**: In a controlled trial conducted in the US, azithromycin (administered as 500 mg single daily dose intravenously for 2 to 5 days, followed by 500 mg/day orally to complete a 7 to 10 days therapy) was compared to cefuroxime (2,250 mg/day in three divided doses intravenously for 2 to 5 days, followed by 1,000 mg/day in two divided doses orally to complete a 7 to 10 days therapy), with or without erythromycin. For the 291 patients evaluable for clinical efficacy, the clinical outcome rates (cure, improved, and success, defined as cure + improved) among the 277 patients seen at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were assessed.

	- In a separate, uncontrolled clinical and microbiological trial conducted in the US, 94 patients with community-acquired pneumonia who received azithromycin in the same regimen were evaluated for clinical efficacy. The clinical outcome rates (cure, improved, and success) among the 84 patients seen at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were assessed.

	- Microbiological determinations in both trials were conducted at the pre-treatment visit and, where applicable, reassessed at later visits. Serological testing was performed on specimens from baseline and final visits. The combined presumptive bacteriological eradication rates for the evaluable groups were as follows:

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^113i3MJ9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend the use of macrolides in patients with moderate to severe CAP to provide coverage of atypical pathogens and for their immunomodulatory effects. However, at a population level, we found no evidence that empirical macrolide combination therapy provided any benefit over β-lactam monotherapy, and atypical pathogens were rarely identified. Furthermore, in subgroup analyses by severity, we found no evidence of, or even a trend towards, greater potential benefits in the more severe subgroups. Conversely, previous evidence has shown that macrolide use is associated with increased antibiotic resistance and a higher risk of adverse outcomes.

For example, previous macrolide use has been associated with macrolide resistance among S. pneumoniae within individuals and in population-based studies; in children, mass dose azithromycin administration was associated with resistance in S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and Escherichia coli. Several large cohort studies reported that azithromycin and clarithromycin were associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events, on which basis the US Food and Drug Administration subsequently published warnings on the use of azithromycin. A meta-analysis on 183 RCTs reported an increased rate of gastrointestinal adverse events with macrolide use. Macrolide use can also affect microbiome composition in healthy adults. Given the known risks associated with macrolides, routine empirical use of macrolides should be carefully balanced. Nevertheless, developing better diagnostic tools to accurately identify causative pathogens would be beneficial to mitigate these risks.

### Legionella micdadei infection presenting as severe secretory diarrhea and a solitary pulmonary mass [^115fYmom]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Sixty percent of infections with non-pneumophila species of Legionella are caused by Legionella micdadei. Although diarrhea is a common symptom of legionellosis, including that due to L. micdadei infection, severe, life-threatening diarrhea is rare. We describe a patient with profound secretory diarrhea (secretion rate, up to 8 L/day) that was secondary to culture-proven L. micdadei pneumonia. In addition, a 3-cm pulmonary nodule was detected, which completely resolved after proper treatment for Legionella infection. Resolving pulmonary nodules have been previously reported in association with treatment of L. micdadei infections.

### Empiric antibiotic coverage of atypical pathogens for community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults [^114dGdnT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by various pathogens, traditionally divided into 'typical' and 'atypical' categories. Initial antibiotic treatment of CAP is usually empirical, customarily covering both typical and atypical pathogens. At the time of writing, no sufficient evidence exists to support this broad coverage. Limiting coverage is bound to reduce toxicity, resistance, and expense.

- **Objectives**: The main objective was to estimate the mortality and proportion of patients with treatment failure using regimens containing atypical antibiotic coverage compared to those that had typical coverage only. Secondary objectives included the assessment of adverse events.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 3, 2012, which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to April week 1, 2012), and EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult patients hospitalized due to CAP, comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical coverage (quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, streptogramins, or ketolides) to a regimen without atypical antibiotic coverage.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from included trials. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed heterogeneity using a Chi² test.

- **Main results**: We included 28 trials, encompassing 5939 randomized patients. The atypical antibiotic was administered as monotherapy…

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^112ZbpHr]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed by clinical features such as cough, fever, and pleuritic chest pain, and by lung imaging, usually an infiltrate seen on chest radiography. Initial evaluation should determine the need for hospitalization versus outpatient management, using validated mortality or severity prediction scores. Selected diagnostic laboratory testing, such as sputum and blood cultures, is indicated for inpatients with severe illness but is rarely useful for outpatients.

Initial outpatient therapy should include a macrolide or doxycycline. For outpatients with comorbidities or those who have used antibiotics within the previous three months, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, or moxifloxacin) or an oral beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide should be used. Inpatients not admitted to an intensive care unit should receive a respiratory fluoroquinolone or a beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide.

Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia, or those admitted to the intensive care unit, should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, plus azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Those with risk factors for Pseudomonas should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic (piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, doripenem, or cefepime), plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin or an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin). Those with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid.

Hospitalized patients may be switched from intravenous to oral antibiotics once they demonstrate clinical stability.

### Weather-dependent risk for Legionnaires' disease, United States [^117Ef1g6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The antimicrobial drugs most commonly used to treat Legionnaires' disease (LD) include either a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide with a β-lactam, and resistance has increased for both. Thus, treating LD only when and where risk is higher, along with increased diagnostic testing and good clinical judgment, may help reduce antimicrobial drug use, providing a new antimicrobial drug stewardship target. The temporal, climatologic, and geographic variations in LD risk emphasize the potential importance of regionally relevant guidelines. Basing treatment guidelines on estimates in high- or low-risk areas will lead to overuse or underuse of LD treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

However, future work with more detailed clinical information is required to determine when and where antimicrobial drug use may be initially restricted and in which patients, without significantly impairing the quality of care. Specifically, future work will need to determine under which conditions and in which patients initial monotherapy with a β-lactam will not be inferior to combination therapy. Furthermore, future work will need to consider and incorporate diagnostic testing for LD and the patient's clinical status, such as intensive care unit admission.

### An update on Legionella [^114BQbxJ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Legionella pneumophila is increasingly recognized as a significant cause of sporadic and epidemic community-acquired and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia. This review focuses on the latest literature concerning the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of Legionnaires' disease.

- **Recent findings**: A significant increase in the incidence of Legionnaires' disease in the United States has been documented over the last few years. L. pneumophila has recently been found to be a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized and ambulatory patients in Germany. Recent studies provide insight into the understanding of the pathogenesis of Legionnaires' disease and the relevance of biofilm formation. The clinical manifestations of Legionnaires' disease are not specific, and diagnostic scores are of limited use. Several recent studies offer useful information concerning Legionnaires' disease in immunosuppressed patients. A systematic review of English literature performed to assess the test characteristics of the Legionella urinary antigen test found the pooled sensitivity to be 0.74 and specificity to be 0.991. Improved clinical response has been observed in patients with Legionnaires' disease treated with highly active antimicrobial agents against Legionella.

- **Summary**: Legionnaires' disease is a significant health problem in many countries. The clinical manifestations are unreliable for diagnosing Legionnaires' disease; therefore, diagnostic laboratory tests for Legionella, including the urinary antigen test, are essential.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^117Nooa3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

During therapy with metronidazole, known or previously unrecognized candidiasis may present more prominent symptoms and requires treatment with an antifungal agent. As with other antibiotics, the use of tetracycline hydrochloride may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, discontinue bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules and institute appropriate therapy.

- **Photosensitivity**: Photosensitivity, manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction, has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients who may be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs. Instruct patients taking bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules to avoid exposure to the sun or sun lamps. Treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.

- **Darkening of the tongue and/or black stool**: Bismuth subsalicylate may cause a temporary and harmless darkening of the tongue and/or black stool, generally reversible within several days after treatment is stopped. Stool darkening should not be confused with melena.

- **Use in patients with blood dyscrasias**: Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole and should be used with caution in patients with evidence of, or history of, blood dyscrasia. Mild leukopenia has been observed during its administration; however, no persistent hematologic abnormalities have been reported.

### Clinical outcomes for hospitalized patients with Legionella pneumonia in the antigenuria era: The influence of levofloxacin therapy [^1168jy1B]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Although the reduction in case-fatality rate recently observed among patients with Legionella pneumonia has been largely attributed to the progressive utilization of urine antigen testing, other factors, such as changes in empirical antibiotic therapy, may also have contributed. We have analyzed more recent outcomes of Legionella pneumonia in an institution where urine antigen testing was reflexively performed in cases of community-acquired pneumonia without an etiological diagnosis.

- **Methods**: From a prospective series of 1,934 consecutive cases of community-acquired pneumonia in nonimmunocompromised adults, 139 cases of Legionella pneumophila pneumonia were selected for observational review. Legionella cases were analyzed for outcome with respect to antibiotic treatment, mortality, complications, length of stay, time to defervescence, and stability.

- **Results**: The early case-fatality rate was 2.9% (4 of 139 patients), and the overall case-fatality rate was 5% (7 of 139 patients). One hundred twenty patients (86.3%) received an appropriate initial therapy, which included macrolides (i.e. erythromycin or clarithromycin) in 80 patients and levofloxacin in 40. Levofloxacin progressively replaced macrolides as the initial therapy during the study period. Compared with patients who received macrolides, patients who received levofloxacin had a faster time to defervescence (2.0 vs. 4.5 days; p < 0.001) and to clinical stability (3 vs. 5 days; p = 0.002). No differences were found regarding the development of complications (25% vs. 25%; p = 0.906) and case-fatality rate (2.5% vs. 5%).

### Multiplex real-time PCR in non-invasive respiratory samples to reduce antibiotic use in community-acquired pneumonia: a randomised trial [^111nfvn8]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

Antibiotic therapy, follow-up, and outcomes assessment

Initial empirical antibiotic therapy was administered in the emergency department in accordance with participating hospitals' guidelines, which recommended the administration of a β-lactam agent with or without a macrolide or fluoroquinolone. Initial empirical combination antimicrobial therapy was recommended for patients with severe CAP and/or those without any positive microbiological test. Levofloxacin monotherapy was indicated for Legionella pneumonia and for selected patients such as those with β-lactam allergy. Carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, and cefipime were considered broad-spectrum antibiotics. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics were generally considered when penicillin or ceftriaxone was used. All decisions regarding empirical and definitive antibiotic therapy, de-escalation, switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy, and duration of treatment were made by the attending clinicians. The investigators were not involved in any decisions regarding antibiotic treatment.

All participants were seen daily during their hospital stay by their attending physicians and by at least one of the study investigators. The investigators recorded all outcome measures. DOTs were calculated as the days elapsed from the initial dose of antimicrobial until the last dose of antimicrobial therapy for the CAP episode. The DOT for a given patient on multiple antibiotics was the sum of DOT for each antibiotic that the patient received. All antibiotics administered to patients for an episode of CAP and its related complications were recorded by the investigators.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^116NEoCU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the article titled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia: An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America". We congratulate the authors on their comprehensive review of the evidence. Although we understand that they are limited in their ability to establish recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system process, we believe it would be helpful for the practicing clinician to understand how to interpret the guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship (AS) lens. Below, we discuss three AS-guided recommendations that should be considered when interpreting the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines.

### Legionella and community-acquired pneumonia: A review of current diagnostic tests from a clinician's viewpoint [^111ZbQpG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Many physicians are unaware of the limitations of the available tests for diagnosing infections with Legionella organisms. Geographic differences in the importance of non-pneumophila Legionella species as pathogens are underrecognized, in part because available diagnostic tests are biased toward the detection of pneumophila serogroup 1. Routine laboratory practices reduce the likelihood of culturing Legionella species from clinical isolates.

Failure of seroconversion is common, particularly with non-pneumophila species; even when seroconversion occurs, it may take much longer than four weeks. Urinary antigen testing has insufficient sensitivity to affect clinical management in most regions of the United States, as it can reliably detect only L. pneumophila serogroup 1 infections. Polymerase chain reaction-based techniques offer hope of providing highly sensitive, rapid diagnostic tests for all Legionella species, but limitations in the tests will make validating them difficult.

### Azithromycin [^117JZqN7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In 14 clinical studies focused on community-acquired pneumonia, azithromycin was evaluated for its efficacy.

- **Community-acquired pneumonia**: In a controlled trial conducted in the US, azithromycin was compared to cefuroxime. Azithromycin was administered at a dosage of 500 mg as a single daily dose via the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days. This was followed by a 500 mg daily dosage via oral administration to complete a 7 to 10-day therapy. Cefuroxime was administered at 2,250 mg per day in three divided doses intravenously for 2 to 5 days, followed by 1,000 mg per day in two divided doses orally to complete the same duration of therapy. Erythromycin was also considered an option alongside cefuroxime. Among the 291 patients evaluated for clinical efficacy, 277 patients were assessed for outcomes such as cure, improvement, and overall success (cure + improvement) at 10 to 14 days post-therapy.

Additionally, in a separate uncontrolled clinical and microbiological trial conducted in the US, 94 patients received azithromycin through a similar regimen. Among those, 84 patients were assessed for clinical efficacy at 10 to 14 days post-therapy, with outcomes measured for cure, improvement, and success.

Microbiological determinations in both trials were performed at the pre-treatment visit and, where applicable, reassessed at subsequent visits. Serological testing was conducted on baseline and final visit specimens. The combined presumptive bacteriological eradication rates for the evaluable groups were as follows:

- **Combined bacteriological eradication rates for azithromycin**: The presumed bacteriological outcomes at 10 to 14 days post-therapy for patients treated with azithromycin were determined.

### Emergency management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: What is new since the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines [^113ED6Wg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major health problem in the United States and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Patients with CAP commonly present to emergency departments where physicians must make critical decisions regarding the diagnosis and management of pneumonia in a timely fashion, with an emphasis on efficient and cost-effective diagnostic choices. This includes consideration of emerging antimicrobial resistance, timely initiation of antibiotics, and appropriate site-of-care decisions.

In light of the burden that pneumonia places on health care systems and the emergency department in particular, this article reviews significant developments in the management of CAP in the United States five years since the publication of the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of CAP in adults. The focus is on recent studies and recommendations for managing CAP, the primary bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP, trends in resistance, new diagnostic technologies, and newer antimicrobials approved for the treatment of CAP. These new data and additional guidelines pertaining to the treatment of CAP further our knowledge and understanding of this challenging infection. Furthermore, appreciation of the availability of new diagnostic testing and therapeutic options will help meet the demand for improved management of CAP.

### Atypical pathogens and challenges in community-acquired pneumonia [^1152MwK6]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are implicated in up to 40% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotic treatment is empiric and includes coverage for both typical and atypical organisms.

- **Outpatient treatment for immunocompetent adults**: Doxycycline, a fluoroquinolone with enhanced activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, or a macrolide is appropriate.

- **Hospitalized adults**: Treatment should include cefotaxime or ceftriaxone combined with a macrolide, or a fluoroquinolone alone. Fluoroquinolone monotherapy is not recommended for adults in intensive care units; alternatives such as ampicillin-sulbactam or piperacillin-tazobactam can be used instead of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone.

- **Outpatient treatment for children (two months to five years old)**: High-dose amoxicillin given for seven to ten days. A single dose of ceftriaxone can be administered to infants if there is a likelihood of delay or non-absorption of the first antibiotic dose. Older children may be effectively treated with a macrolide.

- **Hospitalized children**: A macrolide combined with a beta-lactam inhibitor is recommended.

In cases of a bioterrorist attack, pulmonary illness may result from organisms that cause anthrax, plague, or tularemia. Sudden acute respiratory syndrome begins with a flu-like illness, followed by cough, dyspnea, and, in some instances, acute respiratory distress within two to seven days.

### Weather-dependent risk for Legionnaires' disease, United States [^113HXGga]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Legionellosis is associated with a mild febrile illness, Pontiac fever, or Legionnaires' disease (LD), a cause of severe, atypical, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Legionella spp. are aerobic, gram-negative bacilli common in the environment, identified as pathogenic after an outbreak among attendees of a 1976 American Legion convention. Although there are several species of Legionella and different serotypes, L. pneumophilia causes most LD cases. The case-fatality rate for LD among community-dwelling persons is as high as 10%. Delayed initiation of appropriate antimicrobial drug therapy further increases death rates, and the severity of LD drives the rationale for covering atypical organisms in the guidelines for empiric treatment of CAP. In developed countries, Legionella causes 1%–4% of CAP cases. Thus, because the rate of LD is low, many persons with CAP may be unnecessarily treated for LD. In fact, a recent noninferiority study, which included aggressive diagnostic testing, showed similar outcomes when treating and not treating for atypical organisms.

A striking epidemiologic feature of Legionella-associated CAP is its seasonality; more cases are reported during the summer. In contrast, hospital-associated cases do not exhibit seasonality. Seasonality has been described in the mid-Atlantic United States, England as well as Wales, and the Netherlands. Changes in the use of cooling towers or additional testing for pneumonia during the summer have been hypothesized as causes of this seasonality. However, strong evidence indicates that weather, particul

### Legionella pneumonia due to non-Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1: Usefulness of the six-point scoring system [^115Vvh46]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Legionella pneumonia is a type of pulmonary infection caused by Gram-negative bacilli and is an important cause of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The most frequently identified causative pathogen of Legionella pneumonia is Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, probably because it can be quickly diagnosed by the urinary antigen test. However, about 20% of Legionella pneumonia cases due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 are diagnosed not by the urinary antigen test but by culture using Wadowsky-Yee-Okuda (WYO)-α or Buffered Charcoal Yeast Extract (BCYE)-α medium. Legionella pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 can range from severe to mild to moderate.

At the time of writing, there have been few reports summarizing the clinical characteristics of such cases, including symptoms, laboratory findings, radiologic findings, pneumonia severity, treatment, and prognosis. To predict the probability of Legionella pneumonia, Fiumefreddo et al. proposed a six-point scoring system using dichotomized routine clinical and laboratory variables. Haubitz et al. validated the usefulness of this scoring system using a large multinational database. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports evaluating the usefulness of this scoring system in predicting non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 Legionella pneumonia. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of Legionella pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 and the usefulness of the six-point scoring system in predicting such cases compared with those of L. pneumophila serogroup 1.

### Legionnaire's pneumonia: Is there really an interstitial disease [^112b53dx]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Legionella pneumonia is usually classified as "atypical pneumonia", which suggests a predominance of interstitial patterns in chest X-rays. Based on a selection of recent clinical cases and a brief review of the literature, the aim of the study is to clarify how far the actual radiological findings would be consistent with these expectations.

- **Patients and methods**: A retrospective analysis of 18 epidemic personal cases and a review of the literature data were performed to describe the chest X-ray findings of Legionella pneumophila (LP) community-acquired pneumonia. X-ray review was performed simultaneously and in consensus by two radiologists (J.P.T. E.C.) and a physician (C.G.).

- **Results**: From our series, 17 patients had an abnormal chest X-ray on admission. Among these pathological X-ray cases, infiltrates were more often confluent (n = 16) or patchy (n = 7), rather than interstitial (n = 1). Fifteen patients had infiltrates involving the lower lung fields. Bilateral distribution of abnormalities and pleural effusion were each observed in three cases. Radiological findings deteriorated between the second and seventh days following admission, particularly in the form of patchy infiltrates with pleural effusion. The review of the literature is consistent with these findings, reporting prevalent confluent or patchy infiltrates.

- **Conclusions**: These findings are consistent with the physiopathological particularity of this affection and incite us to avoid the classification "atypical pneumonia" in radiologic terminology. This term is more appropriate for clinical considerations.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^116dQnL5]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Low credibility.

HCP may reasonably consider empiric antibiotic treatment when a patient exhibits new symptoms, such as a new fever after initial defervescence, changes in lung imaging, signs of production of purulent sputum, dense lobar consolidation on radiograph, or rapid progression to severe COVID-19 requiring intubation and pressor support. Since bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP often colonize the upper airway and opportunistically infect the lung, it is speculated that these same bacteria should be considered in patients with respiratory virus–related pneumonia, including COVID-19, within the first days of hospitalization. Guidelines for CAP treatment should be followed.

- **Cap-associated pathogens**: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the pathogen most frequently associated with influenza, followed mainly by S. aureus and Hemophilus influenzae. Recent studies have identified S. pneumoniae and S. aureus as the main causative agents of community-acquired coinfection at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis.

- **Bacterial coinfections in immunosuppressed patients**: Data are sparse, but there may be scenarios, such as patients with febrile neutropenia, in which empiric antibiotic therapy at the time of COVID-19 or other respiratory viral diagnosis is justified.

It is important that HCP also consider the possibility of coinfection with viruses other than the pandemic strain. Nonpharmacologic interventions, such as mask use and social distancing, significantly disrupted the transmission of non–SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Empiric antibiotic coverage of atypical pathogens for community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults [^113YejwN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by various pathogens, traditionally divided into "typical" and "atypical" categories. Initial antibiotic treatment of CAP is usually empirical, customarily covering both typical and atypical pathogens. At the time of writing, no sufficient evidence exists to support this broad coverage, while limiting coverage is bound to reduce toxicity, resistance, and expense.

- **Objectives**: Assess the efficacy and need for adding antibiotic coverage for atypical pathogens in hospitalized patients with CAP, in terms of mortality and successful treatment.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's specialized register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to January Week 2, 2005); and EMBASE (January 1980 to January Week 2, 2005).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of adult patients hospitalized due to CAP, comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical antibiotic coverage to a regimen without atypical antibiotic coverage.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently appraised the quality of each trial and extracted the data from included trials. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, assuming an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis for the outcome measures.

- **Main results**: Twenty-four trials were included, encompassing 5015 randomized patients. There was no difference in mortality between the atypical arm and the non-atypical arm (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.54). The atypical arm showed an insignificant trend.

### Cavitary pulmonary nodules in an immunocompromised patient with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder [^114YfSkz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Cavitation is not common with Legionella pneumonia, but it has been reported, especially in immunocompromised patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy. With respect to treatment, Legionella species are facultative intracellular bacteria and require agents with high intracellular activity, such as azithromycin or levofloxacin. In conclusion, physicians should maintain a high suspicion for L. micdadei infection in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia to ensure that appropriate diagnostic testing is performed, and they should consider this organism in the differential diagnosis of infection by acid-fast staining organisms.

### Legionella pneumonia due to non-Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1: Usefulness of the six-point scoring system [^114Ltqnh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Because of a limited number of reports, we aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with Legionella pneumonia due to non-Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 and the diagnostic usefulness of the six-point scoring system for such patients compared with patients with pneumonia caused by L. pneumophila serogroup 1.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analysed patients diagnosed with Legionella pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 between March 2001 and June 2016. We examined the clinical characteristics, including symptoms, laboratory findings, radiologic findings, pneumonia severity, initial treatment, and prognosis. We also calculated scores using the six-point scoring system in these patients. Furthermore, we compared the clinical characteristics and six-point scores between non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients among hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia patients enrolled prospectively between October 2010 and July 2016.

- **Results**: Eleven patients had pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1; their median age was 66 years and 8 patients (72.7%) were male. The most common pathogen was L. pneumophila serogroup 3 (6/11), followed by L. pneumophila serogroup 9 (3/11), L. pneumophila serogroup 6 (1/11), and L. longbeachae (1/11). Non-specific symptoms, such as fever and cough, were common. Six patients (54.5%) had liver enzyme elevation, but no patient developed hyponatraemia at < 130 mEq/L. Nine patients (81.8%) showed lobar pneumonia, and 7 patients (63.6%) manifested with consolidation.

### Changes in antimicrobial utilization during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic after implementation of a multispecialty clinical guidance team [^1117iM3J]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Low credibility.

A DiD evaluation of azithromycin use in the pre–COVID-19 period versus the first 3 weeks of admitting COVID-19 patients showed a significant weekly increase of 48.7 DOT per 1,000 days (95% CI, 21.7–75.7) compared to a significant weekly increase of 47.9 DOT per 1,000 days (95% CI, 12.6–83.2) for ceftriaxone use for internal medicine teams. In the second post–COVID-19 period, there was a significant decrease in azithromycin weekly antimicrobial use of 58.2 DOT per 1,000 days (95% CI, −78.0 to −38.3) and a non-statistically significant increase in ceftriaxone weekly antimicrobial use of 13.6 DOT per 1,000 days (95% CI, −12.4 to 39.6), adjusted for week and team (supplementary figure online).

Azithromycin use and cefepime use for MICU teams over the same period showed no statistically significant difference in DOT per 1,000 days for the first 3 weeks or the later 8 weeks of the defined COVID-19 period compared to the pre–COVID-19 period when adjusted for week and team (supplementary figure online).

### Acquired Fanconi syndrome in patients with Legionella pneumonia [^112AnYGM]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is often observed in patients with Legionella pneumonia; however, other electrolyte abnormalities are uncommon, and the mechanism remains to be clarified.

- **Case presentation**: We experienced two male cases of acquired Fanconi syndrome associated with Legionella pneumonia. The laboratory findings at admission showed hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypouricemia, and/or hyponatremia. In addition, they had a generalized dysfunction of the renal proximal tubules presenting decreased tubular reabsorption of phosphate (%TRP), increased fractional excretion of potassium (FEK) and uric acid (FEUA), low-molecular-weight proteinuria, panaminoaciduria, and glycosuria. Therefore, they were diagnosed with Fanconi syndrome. Treatment for Legionella pneumonia with antibiotics resulted in the improvement of all serum electrolyte abnormalities and normalization of the %TRP, FEK, FEUA, low-molecular-weight proteinuria, panaminoaciduria, and glycosuria, suggesting that Legionella pneumophila infection contributed to the pathophysiology of Fanconi syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating Fanconi syndrome associated with Legionella pneumonia.

### Legionnaires' disease at a Dutch flower show: Prognostic factors and impact of therapy [^112XJ4ZF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Increased deaths associated with delay of adequate treatment for Legionnaires' disease have been reported earlier; in patients suspected of having Legionnaires' disease, adequate therapy should therefore be started as soon as possible. To ensure coverage of potential L. pneumophila infections in every patient, the recommendations for treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia have been expanded. The new guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend an extended-spectrum cephalosporin plus a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone alone for every hospitalized patient in whom no pathogen is defined. This approach may lead to overtreatment since 2%–13% of community-acquired pneumonia is caused by L. pneumophila; therefore, this approach is costly and may contribute to macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance.

The results of our study suggest that a more tailored approach for patients with community-acquired pneumonia may be possible. When Legionnaires' disease is considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, a urinary antigen test should be done on admission. If test results are positive, the patient should be treated immediately with a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide, as a positive urinary test on admission identifies the patients with Legionnaires' disease caused by L. pneumophila serogroup 1 and a high risk for ICU admission or death. If the urinary antigen test gives negative results, deferring anti-Legionella therapy for the first 24 hours after admission, pending the diagnostic work-up, may be considered.

### Role of environmental surveillance in determining the risk of hospital-acquired legionellosis: a national surveillance study with clinical correlations [^117DbCcc]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired Legionella pneumonia has a fatality rate of 28%, and the source is the water distribution system. Two prevention strategies have been advocated: one approach is clinical surveillance for disease without routine environmental monitoring, and another approach recommends environmental monitoring even in the absence of known cases of Legionella pneumonia. We determined the Legionella colonization status of water systems in hospitals to establish whether the results of environmental surveillance correlated with the discovery of disease. None of these hospitals had previously experienced endemic hospital-acquired Legionella pneumonia.

- **Design**: Cohort study.

- **Setting**: Twenty US hospitals in 13 states.

- **Interventions**: Hospitals performed clinical and environmental surveillance for Legionella from 2000 through 2002. All specimens were shipped to the Special Pathogens Laboratory at the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Medical Center.

- **Results**: Legionella pneumophila and Legionella anisa were isolated from 14 (70%) of 20 hospital water systems. Of 676 environmental samples, 198 (29%) were positive for Legionella species. High-level colonization of the water system (30% or more of the distal outlets were positive for L. pneumophila) was demonstrated for 6 (43%) of the 14 hospitals with positive findings. L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was detected in 5 of these 6 hospitals, whereas 1 hospital was colonized with L. pneumophila serogroup 5. A total of 633 patients were evaluated for Legionella pneumonia from 12 (60%) of the 20 hospitals: 377 by urinary antigen testing.

### International perspective on the new 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline: A critical appraisal by a global expert panel [^115NsVZp]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued a substantial revision of the 2007 guideline on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the fact that generalization of infectious disease guidelines is limited because of substantial geographic differences in microbiologic etiology and antimicrobial resistance, the ATS/IDSA guideline is frequently applied outside the United States. Therefore, this project aimed to give a perspective on the ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations related to the management of CAP outside the United States.

For this, an expert panel composed of 14 international key opinion leaders in the field of CAP from 10 countries across five continents, who were not involved in producing the 2019 guideline, was asked to subjectively name the five most useful changes, the recommendation viewed most critically, and the recommendation that cannot be applied to their respective region. There was no formal consensus process, and the article reflects different opinions.

- **Recommendations welcomed**: These included the abandonment of the concept of "health-care-associated pneumonia", the more restrictive indication for empiric macrolide treatment in outpatients, the increased emphasis on microbiologic diagnostics, and addressing the use of corticosteroids.

- **Main criticisms**: The somewhat arbitrary choice of a 25% resistance threshold for outpatient macrolide monotherapy was a point of contention. Experts from areas with elevated mycobacterial prevalence particularly opposed the recommendation of fluoroquinolones.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, particularly with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting for patients without comorbidities, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend administering a macrolide. This may include azithromycin (500 mg PO on the first day and 250 mg daily thereafter), clarithromycin (500 mg PO BID), or clarithromycin extended-release (1,000 mg PO daily), in areas where pneumococcal resistance to macrolides is less than 25%.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^111bvyr5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). High credibility.

The ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines on medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, specifically regarding empiric antibiotic therapy for Pseudomonas coverage, recommend considering the administration of antibiotics from two different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa. This is particularly advised for patients with HAP who are at high risk of mortality or who possess risk factors for Pseudomonas or other Gram-negative infections, such as prior intravenous antibiotic use within the past 90 days.
