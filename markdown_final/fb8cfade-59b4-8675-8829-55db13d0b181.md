## Question

what is first-line treatment for acute gout flare

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the first-line treatment options are for an acute gout flare and how to choose among them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which guidelines carry the highest authority and what they actually recommend. Then, I should verify the comparative evidence base for NSAIDs, colchicine, and glucocorticoids. Next, I will consider patient-specific factors that shift the balance of benefit and risk, including comorbidities and timing of onset. After that, I should confirm dosing details and safety caveats, especially for colchicine and in chronic kidney disease. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and note what to do if first-line options are contraindicated or ineffective.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative sources. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline strongly recommends using oral colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intramuscular, or intra-articular) as appropriate first-line therapy for gout flares, and it advises choosing low-dose colchicine over high-dose when colchicine is selected due to similar efficacy with fewer adverse effects [^526db9c4] [^44adb76c] [^a2ca3215]. The 2016 EULAR recommendations similarly endorse early anti-inflammatory therapy with colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids, tailored to comorbidities and patient factors, and emphasize starting treatment as early as possible [^53f529f0] [^d6940733]. The British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) aligns with NSAIDs or colchicine as first-line, with corticosteroids as alternatives when first-line agents are unsuitable [^4369ae21].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative efficacy among the three classes. Moderate-quality evidence shows NSAIDs and glucocorticoids have similar pain relief, while NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors are probably comparable in benefit but NSAIDs have more adverse events and withdrawals. Low-dose colchicine is effective versus placebo and has a better safety profile than high-dose regimens, though head-to-head trials versus NSAIDs or glucocorticoids are limited and heterogeneous [^560eed0d] [^e43ae695] [^4f70a8a2] [^5138ace2]. I should double-check that the ACR explicitly places all three on equal footing as first-line choices, which it does, reinforcing that selection should be individualized rather than hierarchical [^526db9c4] [^44adb76c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check patient-specific modifiers that change the default choice. In chronic kidney disease, NSAIDs are less favored due to nephrotoxicity, so low-dose colchicine or glucocorticoids are preferred, with dose-adjusted colchicine in advanced CKD and careful monitoring. Early treatment is still encouraged when feasible [^ad5ebc0e] [^ec5628dd]. In cardiovascular disease or high GI risk, NSAIDs may be avoided and COX-2 selective agents or non-NSAID options considered. In diabetes or infection risk, systemic glucocorticoids may be less desirable. In monoarticular flares, intra-articular corticosteroids are reasonable. And if oral therapy is not feasible, intramuscular or intravenous glucocorticoids are appropriate alternatives [^ea2ddd5f] [^dcf30ea6] [^e43ae695].

> I should confirm dosing specifics, especially for colchicine, because this is easy to misstate. The FDA-labeled acute flare regimen is 1.2 mg orally once, followed by 0.6 mg one hour later, with additional 0.6 mg doses every 12–24 hours as needed until the flare resolves, not to exceed 1.8 mg total in 24 hours. ACR also advises low-dose over high-dose given similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects, which aligns with the FDA approach [^8fd7583b] [^44adb76c]. Earlier I almost said "500 mcg 2–4 times daily", but wait, that BSR phrasing reflects a different, lower prophylactic dosing context and should not be conflated with the acute flare regimen; I need to correct that and stick to the FDA acute dosing for flares [^4369ae21] [^8fd7583b].

> Next, I should review timing and adjuncts. Treat as early as possible after symptom onset to maximize benefit. Topical ice can be used as an adjunct. And if the patient is already on urate-lowering therapy, continue it during the flare and ensure adequate anti-inflammatory coverage, as stopping ULT can worsen outcomes; if ULT is being initiated, starting during a flare is conditionally acceptable with concurrent anti-inflammatory therapy, though some clinicians still prefer waiting until the flare abates [^d6940733] [^44adb76c] [^4f057803] [^f00b1b6c].

> But wait, what if first-line agents are contraindicated or ineffective? I need to ensure I cover second-line options. IL-1 inhibitors such as canakinumab, rilonacept, or anakinra can be considered for patients with contraindications to or intolerance of standard therapies, with moderate-quality evidence supporting canakinumab's superiority to a single intramuscular triamcinolone dose for pain and swelling but at the cost of more adverse events and high expense; anakinra has shown noninferiority to usual care in a small RCT and may be a reasonable alternative in selected patients [^d564c1b6] [^904441cb] [^ac647dae]. I should confirm that these are reserved for refractory cases or when standard options are not feasible, which is consistent with ACR and EULAR positions [^d564c1b6] [^3d0ffebe].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For most patients, choose among NSAIDs, low-dose colchicine, or glucocorticoids based on comorbidities, prior response, and patient preference, and start as early as possible. In CKD, prefer colchicine or glucocorticoids and avoid NSAIDs. In high GI risk, consider COX-2 inhibitors or non-NSAID options. In monoarticular disease, consider intra-articular steroids. If oral therapy is not possible, use parenteral glucocorticoids. And if standard agents fail or are contraindicated, consider IL-1 blockade in appropriate candidates [^526db9c4] [^ad5ebc0e] [^ea2ddd5f] [^d564c1b6].

> Finally, I should confirm that my bottom line matches the evidence. First-line treatment for an acute gout flare is an anti-inflammatory agent from one of three classes: NSAIDs, low-dose colchicine, or glucocorticoids, with the choice individualized to comorbidities, safety, and patient factors. Early initiation improves outcomes, and low-dose colchicine is preferred over high-dose when colchicine is chosen due to better tolerability with similar efficacy [^526db9c4] [^44adb76c] [^d6940733].

---

First-line treatments for acute gout flares are **NSAIDs, colchicine, or glucocorticoids** [^526db9c4], with the choice tailored to comorbidities and patient preference [^d6940733]. NSAIDs are preferred if there is no contraindication [^notfound]; use a COX-2 inhibitor or add a PPI if GI risk is high [^4369ae21]. Colchicine is effective at low dose (1.2 mg then 0.6 mg in 1 hour) [^44adb76c] [^8fd7583b] and is safer than high-dose regimens [^5138ace2]. Glucocorticoids (oral, intra-articular, or intramuscular) are preferred when NSAIDs or colchicine are contraindicated or ineffective [^ea2ddd5f] [^dcf30ea6]. Treat early [^d6940733], continue prophylaxis if on ULT [^58d2085f], and reserve IL-1 inhibitors for refractory cases or when standard therapies are contraindicated [^d564c1b6] [^3d0ffebe].

## First-line pharmacologic options

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- **Efficacy**: NSAIDs are highly effective for acute gout flares, providing rapid pain relief and reducing inflammation [^e43ae695].
- **Safety**: NSAIDs have a higher risk of gastrointestinal adverse events compared to COX-2 inhibitors; consider gastroprotection (PPIs) in patients at risk [^e43ae695] [^4369ae21].
- **Contraindications**: Avoid in patients with significant renal impairment, cardiovascular disease, or gastrointestinal bleeding risk [^notfound].

---

### Colchicine

- **Efficacy**: Low-dose colchicine (1.2 mg followed by 0.6 mg one hour later) is effective and has fewer adverse effects than high-dose regimens [^44adb76c] [^5138ace2].
- **Safety**: Gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, diarrhea) are common but generally mild; avoid in severe renal or hepatic impairment and with strong CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors [^893983d0].
- **Timing**: Initiate within 12 hours of flare onset for optimal efficacy [^53f529f0].

---

### Glucocorticoids

- **Efficacy**: Oral, intra-articular, or intramuscular glucocorticoids are effective alternatives, particularly when NSAIDs or colchicine are contraindicated [^526db9c4] [^e8020e0d].
- **Safety**: Short-term use is generally safe; monitor for hyperglycemia, hypertension, and infection risk [^notfound].
- **Intra-articular injection**: Useful for monoarticular flares, providing rapid local relief [^dcf30ea6].

---

## Clinical considerations and patient-specific factors

- **Comorbidities**: Choose therapy based on renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal conditions [^ad5ebc0e].
- **Patient preference**: Engage in shared decision-making to improve adherence and satisfaction [^cbb6c3f8].
- **Early treatment**: Initiate therapy within 24 hours of symptom onset for best outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and prophylaxis

- **Ice application**: Topical ice can reduce pain and inflammation [^44adb76c].
- **Prophylaxis**: Use low-dose colchicine or NSAIDs during ULT initiation to prevent flares [^58d2085f] [^60cff61c].
- **IL-1 inhibitors**: Consider for refractory flares or when standard therapies are contraindicated [^d564c1b6] [^3d0ffebe].

## Summary of first-line treatment options

| **Treatment option** | **Efficacy** | **Safety considerations** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | High | GI bleeding, renal, CV risk | First-line if no contraindications |
| Colchicine | Moderate | GI upset, myelosuppression | Early flares, NSAID contraindications |
| Glucocorticoids | High | Hyperglycemia, infection | Contraindications to NSAIDs/colchicine |

---

NSAIDs, colchicine, and glucocorticoids are **first-line therapies** for acute gout flares, with selection individualized to comorbidities, patient preference, and timing of onset [^526db9c4] [^d6940733].

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^cbb6c3f8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Prophylaxis for acute gout flares after initiation of urate-lowering therapy [^60cff61c]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

This review summarizes evidence relating to prophylaxis for gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT). We searched MEDLINE via PubMed for articles published in English from 1963 to 2013 using MEsH terms covering all aspects of prophylaxis for flares. Dispersion of monosodium urate crystals during the initial phase of deposit dissolution with ULT exposes the patient to an increased rate of acute flares that could contribute to poor treatment adherence. Slow titration of ULT might decrease the risk of flares. According to the most recent international recommendation, the two first-line options for prophylaxis are low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice a day) or low-dose NSAIDs such as naproxen 250 mg orally twice a day. They can be given for up to 6 months. If these drugs are contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) might be used. Recently, reports for four trials described the efficacy of canakinumab and rilonacept, two IL-1 inhibitors, for preventing flares during the initiation of allopurinol therapy. Prophylaxis for flares induced by ULT is an important consideration in gout management. Low-dose colchicine and low-dose NSAIDs are the recommended first-line therapies. Although no IL-1 blockers are approved as prophylactic treatment, this class of drug could become an interesting option for patients with gout with intolerance or contraindication to colchicine, NSAIDs or corticosteroids.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^5138ace2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases from inception to April 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism (2010 until 2013) and reference lists of identified studies. We searched the clinical trials register clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials register.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (active or placebo) in acute gout. The primary benefit outcome of interest was pain, defined as a proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain, and the primary harm outcome was study participants withdrawal due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened search results for relevant studies, extracted data into a standardised form and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled data if deemed to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Two RCTs (124 participants) were included in this updated review, including one new RCT. We considered one trial to be at low risk of bias, while we considered the newly included trial to be at unclear risk of bias. Both trials included a placebo and a high-dose colchicine arm, although the colchicine regimens varied. In one trial 0.5 mg colchicine was given every two hours until there was either complete relief of symptoms or toxicity and the total doses were not specified. In the other trial a total of 4.8 mg colchicine was given over six hours. The newly identified trial also included a low-dose colchicine arm (total 1.8 mg over one hour). Based upon pooled data from two trials (124 participants), there is low-quality evidence that a greater proportion of people receiving high-dose colchicine experience a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours compared with placebo (35/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 12/50 in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.65), with a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 12). However, the total number of adverse events (diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea) is greater in those who receive high-dose colchicine versus placebo (62/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 11/50 in the placebo group (RR 3.81, 95% CI 2.28 to 6.38), with a number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) of 2 (95% CI 2 to 5). Only one trial included reduction of inflammation as part of a composite measure comprising pain, tenderness, swelling and erythema, each graded on a four-point scale (none 0 to severe 3) to derive a maximum score for any one joint of 12. They reported the proportion of people who achieved a 50% reduction in this composite score. Based upon one trial (43 participants), there was low-quality evidence that more people in the high-dose colchicine group had a 50% or greater decrease in composite score from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours than people in the placebo group (11/22 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 1/21 in the placebo group (RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38) and 45% absolute difference). Based upon data from one trial (103 participants), there was low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is more efficacious than placebo with respect to the proportion of people who achieve a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline to 32 to 36 hours (low-dose colchicine 31/74 versus placebo 5/29 (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.64)), with a NNTB of 5 (95% CI 2 to 20). There are no additional harms in terms of adverse events (diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting) with low-dose colchicine compared to placebo (19/74 and 6/29 respectively (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.79)). Based upon data from one trial (126 participants), there is low-quality evidence that there are no additional benefits in terms of the proportion of people achieving 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine compared to low-dose (19/52 and 31/74 respectively (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36). However, there were statistically significantly more adverse events in those who received high-dose colchicine (40/52 versus 19/74 in the low-dose group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.98 to 4.54)), with a NNTH of 2 (95% CI 2 to 3). No trials reported function of the target joint, patient-reported global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life or withdrawals due to adverse events. We identified no studies comparing colchicine to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other active treatments such as glucocorticoids (by any route).

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon only two published trials, there is low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is likely to be an effective treatment for acute gout. We downgraded the evidence because of a possible risk of selection and reporting biases and imprecision. Both high and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo. While there is some uncertainty around the effect estimates, compared with placebo, high-dose but not low-dose colchicine appears to result in a statistically significantly greater number of adverse events. Therefore low-dose colchicine may be the preferred treatment option. There are no trials about the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as NSAIDs and glucocorticoids.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^4f70a8a2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated Cochrane Review, first published in 2006 and updated in 2014. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To update the available evidence of the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We updated the search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICTRP registries to 28 August 2020. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (quasi-RCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (placebo or active) in acute gout; low-dose colchicine at clinically relevant doses compared with placebo was the primary comparison. The major outcomes were pain, participant global assessment of treatment success (proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours), reduction of inflammation, function of target joint, serious adverse events, total adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane in this review update.

Main Results

We included four trials (803 randomised participants), including two new trials, in this updated review. One three-arm trial compared high-dose colchicine (52 participants), low-dose colchicine (74 participants) and placebo (59 participants); one trial compared high-dose colchicine with placebo (43 participants); one trial compared low-dose colchicine with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (399 participants); and one trial compared low-dose colchicine with Chuanhu anti-gout mixture (traditional Chinese Medicine compound) (176 participants). We did not identify any trials comparing colchicine to glucocorticoids (by any route). The mean age of participants ranged from 51.2 to 70 years, and trial duration from 48 hours to 12 weeks. Two trials were at low risk of bias, one was possibly susceptible to selection bias (random sequence generation), reporting bias and other bias, and one open-label trial was at high risk of performance and detection bias. For the primary comparison, low-quality evidence from one trial (103 participants, downgraded for imprecision and bias) suggests low-dose colchicine may improve treatment outcome compared to placebo with little or no increased risk of adverse events. The number of people who reported treatment success (50% or greater pain reduction) at 32 to 36 hours was slightly larger with low-dose colchicine (418 per 1000) compared with placebo (172 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 5.64; absolute improvement 25% more reported success (7% more to 42% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important and unimportant benefit); relative change of 143% more people reported treatment success (5% more to 464% more). The incidence of total adverse events was 364 per 1000 with low-dose colchicine compared with 276 per 1000 with placebo: RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.56; absolute difference 9% more events with low-dose colchicine (9% fewer to 43% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important effect and no effect); relative change of 32% more events (32% fewer to 156% more). No participants withdrew due to adverse events or reported any serious adverse events. Pain, inflammation and function were not reported. Low-quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision and bias) from two trials (124 participants) suggests that high-dose colchicine compared to placebo may improve symptoms, but with increased risk of harms. More participants reported treatment success at 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine (518 per 1000) compared with placebo (240 per 1000): RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.65, absolute improvement 28% (8% more to 46% more); more also had reduced inflammation at this time point with high-dose colchicine (504 per 1000) compared with placebo (48 per 1000): RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38; absolute improvement 45% greater (22% greater to 68% greater); but more adverse events were reported with high-dose colchicine (829 per 1000 compared with 260 per 1000): RR 3.21, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.11, absolute difference 57% (26% more to 74% more). Pain and function were not reported. Low-quality evidence from a single trial comparing high-dose to low-dose colchicine indicates there may be little or no difference in benefit in terms of treatment success at 32 to 36 hours but more adverse events associated with the higher dose. Similarly, low-quality evidence from a single trial indicates there may also be little or no benefit of low-dose colchicine over NSAIDs in terms of treatment success and pain reduction at seven days, with a similar number of adverse events reported at four weeks follow-up. Reduction of inflammation, function of target joint and withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported in either of these trials, and pain was not reported in the high-dose versus low-dose colchicine trial. We were unable to estimate the risk of serious adverse events for most comparisons as there were few events reported in the trials. One trial (399 participants) reported three serious adverse (one in a participant receiving low-dose colchicine and two in participants receiving NSAIDs), due to reasons unrelated to the trial (low-quality evidence downgraded for bias and imprecision).

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine may be an effective treatment for acute gout when compared to placebo and low-quality evidence that its benefits may be similar to NSAIDs. We downgraded the evidence for bias and imprecision. While both high- and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo, low-quality evidence suggests that high-dose (but not low-dose) colchicine may increase the number of adverse events compared to placebo, while low-quality evidence indicates that the number of adverse events may be similar with low-dose colchicine and NSAIDs. Further trials comparing colchicine to placebo or other treatment will likely have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimates and may change the conclusions of this review. There are no trials reporting the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as glucocorticoids.

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^6577200c]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and to 'cure' the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practice and barriers to effective care, and how these barriers might be overcome. To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Current perspectives are changing towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout. Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and ensuring adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^647133e7]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

The range of drug treatment options to treat acute and chronic gout has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. Yet, there is general consensus that drug therapy selection, dosing and dose titration, of both traditional and novel agents is far from optimally delivered in clinical practice. Updated guidelines disseminated in the last 5 years, from the American College of Physicians, the European League Against Rheumatism, and the American College of Rheumatology, provide clear guidance to the medical community on how and when to optimally integrate these therapeutic options into practice to improve the medical management of gout.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^d109f4d6]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

To enhance usability of a DA in daily practice, it is essential to adhere to national and/or international recommendations (EULAR/ACR). The distinction in the current DA between the first-line (allopurinol) and second-line (febuxostat and benzbromaron) ULT options, advice on lifestyle changes, need for prophylaxis on ULT initiation and the role of a sUA target are all supported in national as well as international recommendations.

The development of the DA posed some challenges, especially regarding evidence-based information on the risk of flares with and without ULT. Flares, the most important indicator of effectiveness for patients, are not or inconsistently reported in RCTs and follow-up is often too short to provide meaningful data on risks and benefits for clinical care. Fortunately, observational studies on the relation between sUA and flares with and without ULT were helpful, the discussion on sUA as biomarker for gout is ongoing. An advantage of this approach was that we could 'personalise' the DA, by presenting different risk for future flares depending on the initial sUA level while keeping the relative effectiveness of ULT. Some studies suggest that febuxostat has exacerbation of acute gout flares at the start of treatment, which is less the case for allopurinol, but evidence is weak. In other words, while febuxostat is more effective in sUA target achievement compared with allopurinol at the recommended dose, this does not translate into better effectiveness on flare reduction. Yet, the relationship between sUA and gout flares is complex.

### Initiation of allopurinol at first medical contact for acute attacks of gout: a randomized clinical trial [^1d76900b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Streamlining the initiation of allopurinol could result in a cost benefit for a common medical problem and obviate the perception that no treatment is required once acute attacks have resolved. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in patient daily pain or subsequent attacks with early versus delayed initiation of allopurinol for an acute gout attack.

Methods

A total of 57 men with crystal-proven gout were randomized to allopurinol 300 mg daily or matching placebo for 10 days. All subjects received indomethacin 50 mg 3 times per day for 10 days, a prophylactic dose of colchicine 0.6 mg 2 times per day for 90 days, and open-label allopurinol starting at day 11. Primary outcome measures were pain on visual analogue scale (VAS) for the primary joint on days 1 to 10 and self-reported flares in any joint through day 30.

Results

On the basis of 51 evaluable subjects (allopurinol in 26, placebo in 25), mean daily VAS pain scores did not differ significantly between study groups at any point between days 1 and 10. Initial VAS pain scores for allopurinol and placebo arms were 6.72 versus 6.28 (P = 0.37), declining to 0.18 versus 0.27 (P = 0.54) at day 10, with neither group consistently having more daily pain. Subsequent flares occurred in 2 subjects taking allopurinol and 3 subjects taking placebo (P = 0.60). Although urate levels decreased rapidly in the allopurinol group (from 7.8 mg/dL at baseline to 5.9 mg/dL at day 3), sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels did not differ between groups at any point.

Conclusions

Allopurinol initiation during an acute gout attack caused no significant difference in daily pain, recurrent flares, or inflammatory markers.

### Implementing Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^f5a935bc]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and intervention

We performed a prospective cohort study at a large teaching hospital in South London, UK, which serves a population of over 1 million people. We evaluated outcomes after implementation of a strategy designed to optimize care for people hospitalized for gout flares, and compared these outcomes with a retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients from before implementation.

The intervention package consisted of two key components: (i) an in-hospital gout management pathway (Supplementary Data S1, available at Rheumatology online), based on British Society for Rheumatology (BSR), European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) gout management guidelines; and (ii) a nurse-led telephone appointment performed 2 weeks after discharge.

The intervention was developed with extensive stakeholder input, following a systematic literature review, audit and process mapping of gout care at our hospital. The management pathway was designed as a quick-reference guide on optimal gout care for use by frontline clinicians and rheumatologists. This included recommendations on: diagnostic tests (including serum urate levels and joint aspiration); rheumatologist input; flare treatments (NSAIDs, colchicine and/or corticosteroids, where appropriate); offering ULT (allopurinol first-line) to all patients unless contraindicated; initiating ULT during the acute flare; considering prophylaxis against flares during ULT initiation and titration; admission-avoidance strategies (e.g. ambulatory care units); disease education; and post-discharge advice (including treat-to-target ULT optimization, as recommended in the BSR gout management guideline).

Treatment

Medical Treatment

The goal of medical treatment of gout is acutely to control inflammation from flares and chronically to lower uric acid levels. Gout flares are usually treated with NSAIDs (naproxen, indomethacin, or selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors), colchicine, and oral or intra-articular corticosteroids, either individually or in combination. Patients whose gout flares are refractory to these traditional treatments or have medical contraindications may be considered for monoclonal antibodies against IL1 or adrenocorticotropic hormone. Table 2 provides recommendations for treatment of acute gout flares.

Table 2
Medications for Gout Flares

The first-line treatment for lowering uric acid is with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, which stop the synthesis of uric acid from hypoxanthine and include allopurinol and febuxostat. Next, consideration is given to medications that promote uric acid excretion (uricosuric) such as probenecid and those that promote uric acid degradation such as pegloticase, an intravenously administered recombinant uricase. Newer therapeutics include arhalofenate, which has been shown to have both uricosuric and anti-inflammatory effects in clinical trials, and oral recombinant uricases.

Finally, lifestyle modifications such as weight loss and limiting the intake of purine-rich foods should also be recommended in addition to medications for decreasing inflammation and uric acid levels.

Surgical Treatment

Surgical treatment for gout is generally reserved for cases of damage to the surrounding soft tissue, concomitant septic arthritis, symptomatic cartilage loss, or neurologic deficits. The following sections will describe surgical treatment for gout in the upper and lower extremities and spine and outcomes in patients with gout after total hip, knee, and ankle arthroplasty.

### Gout [^fcbd57e1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Gout is a chronic disease caused by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Gout typically presents as an acute, self-limiting inflammatory monoarthritis that affects the joints of the lower limb. Elevated serum urate level (hyperuricaemia) is the major risk factor for MSU crystal deposition and development of gout. Although traditionally considered a disorder of purine metabolism, altered urate transport, both in the gut and the kidneys, has a key role in the pathogenesis of hyperuricaemia. Anti-inflammatory agents, such corticosteroids, NSAIDs and colchicine, are widely used for the treatment of gout flare; recognition of the importance of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and bioactive IL-1β release in initiation of the gout flare has led to the development of anti-IL-1β biological therapy for gout flares. Sustained reduction in serum urate levels using urate-lowering therapy is vital in the long-term management of gout, which aims to dissolve MSU crystals, suppress gout flares and resolve tophi. Allopurinol is the first-line urate-lowering therapy and should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation. Low-dose anti-inflammatory therapies can reduce gout flares during initiation of urate-lowering therapy. Models of care, such as nurse-led strategies that focus on patient engagement and education, substantially improve clinical outcomes and now represent best practice for gout management.

### Gout: an update [^ffd5097a]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Arthritis caused by gout (i.e., gouty arthritis) accounts for millions of outpatient visits annually, and the prevalence is increasing. Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues leading to arthritis, soft tissue masses (i.e., tophi), nephrolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. The biologic precursor to gout is elevated serum uric acid levels (i.e., hyperuricemia). Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is common and usually does not progress to clinical gout. Acute gout most often presents as attacks of pain, erythema, and swelling of one or a few joints in the lower extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed if monosodium urate crystals are present in synovial fluid. First-line therapy for acute gout is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids, depending on comorbidities; colchicine is second-line therapy. After the first gout attack, modifiable risk factors (e.g., high-purine diet, alcohol use, obesity, diuretic therapy) should be addressed. Urate-lowering therapy for gout is initiated after multiple attacks or after the development of tophi or urate nephrolithiasis. Allopurinol is the most common therapy for chronic gout. Uricosuric agents are alternative therapies in patients with preserved renal function and no history of nephrolithiasis. During urate-lowering therapy, the dose should be titrated upward until the serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg per dL (355 micromol per L). When initiating urate-lowering therapy, concurrent prophylactic therapy with low-dose colchicine for three to six months may reduce flare-ups.

### Discordant American College of Physicians and international rheumatology guidelines for gout management: consensus statement of the gout, hyperuricemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) [^af19a095]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

In November 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute and recurrent gout. This guideline differs substantially from the latest guidelines generated by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative, despite reviewing largely the same body of evidence. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) convened an expert panel to review the methodology and conclusions of these four sets of guidelines and examine possible reasons for discordance between them. The G-CAN position, presented here, is that the fundamental pathophysiological knowledge underlying gout care, and evidence from clinical experience and clinical trials, supports a treat-to-target approach for gout aimed at lowering serum urate levels to below the saturation threshold at which monosodium urate crystals form. This practice, which is truly evidence-based and promotes the steady reduction in tissue urate crystal deposits, is promoted by the ACR, EULAR and 3e Initiative recommendations. By contrast, the ACP does not provide a clear recommendation for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients with frequent, recurrent flares or those with tophi, nor does it recommend monitoring serum urate levels of patients prescribed ULT. Results from emerging clinical trials that have gout symptoms as the primary end point are expected to resolve this debate for all clinicians in the near term future.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^f013602e]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is a common arthritic condition that results from monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Urate-lowering treatment (ULT) is important for patients with gout. Previous guidelines have provided conflicting recommendations on whether ULT could be initiated during an acute gout flare. Generally, ULT should be initiated after an acute flare has resolved to avoid prolongation of symptoms. The incidence of gout flares has been positively correlated with the reduction of serum uric acid (sUA) levels in the first few months after initiating ULT.

However, ULT could be initiated during an acute flare to reduce the number of outpatient treatment visits required, and hence increase patient compliance. The 2016 EULAR Gout Management Recommendations have not provided clear guidance on this. In addition, the 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the management of gout have conditionally recommended that pharmacological urate-lowering therapy could be initiated during an acute gout flare based on anti-inflammatory treatment. However, this recommendation was graded moderate based on two small randomized clinical trials and an observational study.

Two small randomized clinical trials observed that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. Febuxostat (40 mg/day) had a superior urate-lowering effect compared with limited allopurinol doses (maximum 200–300 mg/day). At present, no studies have been published regarding the initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flares. Our objective of this study was to determine whether the initiation of febuxostat during an acute gout flare prolongs the current episode.

### Interleukin-1 inhibitors for acute gout [^904441cb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute gout flares cause significant pain and disability and it is important to provide quick and effective pain relief. Traditional options for managing acute flares include colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of interleukin-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab, rilonacept) in acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE on 19 June 2013. We applied no date or language restrictions. We performed a handsearch of the abstracts from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) (2009 to 2012) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (2009 to 2011) conferences and of the references of all included trials. We also screened the Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization and Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the US National Institutes of Health.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised clinical trials (controlled clinical trials (CCTs)) assessing an interleukin-1 inhibitor (anakinra, canakinumab or rilonacept) against placebo or another active treatment (colchicine, paracetamol, NSAIDs, glucocorticoids (systemic or intra-articular), adrenocorticotropin hormone, a different interleukin-1 blocking agent or a combination of any of the above) in adults with acute gout.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. If appropriate, we pooled data in a meta-analysis. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included four studies (806 participants) in the review. The studies had an unclear risk of selection bias and low risk of performance and attrition biases. One study each had an unclear risk of detection and selection bias. Three studies (654 participants) compared subcutaneous canakinumab compared with intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg in the treatment of acute gout flares of no more than five days' duration. Doses of canakinumab were varied (10 to 150 mg), but most people (255/368) were treated with canakinumab 150 mg. None of the studies provided data on participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that canakinumab 150 mg was probably superior to triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg in terms of pain relief, resolution of joint swelling and in achieving a good treatment response at 72 hours following treatment, but was probably associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Mean pain (0- to 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS), where 0 mm was no pain) was 36 mm after triamcinolone acetonide treatment; pain was further reduced by a mean of 11 mm with canakinumab treatment (mean difference (MD) -10.6 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -15.2 to -5.9). Forty-four per cent of participants treated with canakinumab had resolution of joint swelling at 72 hours compared with 32% of participants treated with triamcinolone (risk ratio (RR) 1.39, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.74, number needed to treat for an addition beneficial outcome (NNTB) 9); 65% of participants treated with canakinumab assessed their response to treatment as good or excellent compare with 47% of participants treated with triamcinolone acetonide (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.61, NNTB 6). Function or health-related quality of life were not measured. In both groups, 0.7% of participants withdrew from treatment (RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.2 to 7.2); there was one death and one alteration of laboratory results in each of the treatment groups. Adverse events were more frequent in participants receiving canakinumab (61%) compared with triamcinolone acetonide (51%; RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4, number needed to treat for an addition harmful outcome (NNTH) 10). Low-quality evidence from one study (152 participants with an acute gout flare of no more than 48 hours' duration and affecting fewer than four joints) comparing rilonacept 320 mg with indomethacin (50 mg three times a day for three days followed by 25 mg three times a day for up to nine days) indicated that indomethacin may improve pain more than rilonacept at 24 to 72 hours, and there may be no evidence of a difference in withdrawal rates or adverse events. The mean change (improvement) in pain from baseline with indomethacin was 4.3 points (measured on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale, where 0 was no pain); pain was improved by a mean of only 2.5 points with rilonacept (MD 2.52, 95% CI 0.29 to 4.75, 25% less improvement in absolute pain with rilonacept). Inflammation, function health-related quality of life and participant global assessment of treatment success were not measured. Rates of study withdrawals due to adverse events were low in both groups: 1/75 (1%) participants in the rilonacept group compared with 2/76 (3%) participants in the indomethacin group (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.5). Adverse events were reported in 27/75 (36%) participants in the rilonacept group and 23/76 (30%) in the indomethacin group (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.9).

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence indicated that compared with a single suboptimal 40-mg dose of intramuscular injection of triamcinolone acetonide, a single subcutaneous dose of 150 mg of canakinumab probably results in better pain relief, joint swelling and participant-assessed global assessment of treatment response in people with an acute gout flare but is probably associated with an increased risk of adverse events. The cost of canakinumab is over 5000 times higher than triamcinolone acetonide; however, there are no data on the cost-effectiveness of this approach. We found no studies comparing canakinumab with more commonly used first-line therapies for acute gout flares such as NSAIDs or colchicine. Low-quality evidence indicated that compared with maximum doses of indomethacin (50 mg three times a day), 320 mg of rilonacept may provide less pain relief with a similar rate of adverse events.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^d097b803]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The response rate of patients with gout is about 80% within 7 days of using traditional non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with maximum 'days to resolution' being 28 days. Hence, diclofenac was continued for 4 weeks in this study. We found that initiation of febuxostat administration during an acute gout flare did not prolong acute flares, and the rate of 'treat to target' was higher in the febuxostat group. This may increase patient compliance.

Two randomized clinical trials demonstrated that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. In one of the trials, allopurinol was initiated at 100 mg daily for the first 14 days and then increased to 200 mg daily for the next 14 days. The investigators observed that the days to resolution were 15.4 days for the allopurinol group and 13.4 days for the placebo group (P = 0.05). However, the sample cohort used in the study was small (17 in the placebo and 14 in the allopurinol group), and the type of anti-inflammatory drugs used in the study increased the experimental uncertainty. In addition, the days to resolution coincided with the time it takes to spontaneously resolve inflammation during typical gout flares. In another published study, patients presenting within the first 7 days of onset of an acute gout flare were evaluated. The mean daily visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores did not differ significantly between the study groups at any point between days 1–10. However, allopurinol was initiated at 300 mg daily, which was not consistent with the recommended guidelines, and inflammation was reflected only using VAS, and not by joint swelling, tenderness and erythema.

### How would you manage this patient with gout? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^8071efc0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In 2012, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued a guideline, which was followed in 2017 by one from the American College of Physicians (ACP). The guidelines agree on treating acute gout with a corticosteroid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or colchicine and on not initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for most patients after a first gout attack and in those whose attacks are infrequent (< 2 per year). However, they differ on treatment of both recurrent gout and problematic gout. The ACR advocates a "treat-to-target" approach, and the ACP did not find enough evidence to support this approach and offered an alternative strategy that bases intensity of ULT on the goal of avoiding recurrent gout attacks ("treat-to-avoid-symptoms") with no monitoring of urate levels. They also disagree on the role of a gout-specific diet. Here, a general internist and a rheumatologist discuss these guidelines; they debate how they would manage an acute attack of gout, if and when to initiate ULT, and the goals for ULT. Lastly, they offer specific advice for a patient who is uncertain about whether to begin this therapy.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of gout [^a14aeae8]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is characterized by painful joint inflammation, most commonly in the first metatarsophalangeal joint, resulting from precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in a joint space. Gout is typically diagnosed using clinical criteria from the American College of Rheumatology. Diagnosis may be confirmed by identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid of the affected joint. Acute gout may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, or colchicine. To reduce the likelihood of recurrent flares, patients should limit their consumption of certain purine-rich foods (e.g., organ meats, shellfish) and avoid alcoholic drinks (especially beer) and beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup. Consumption of vegetables and low-fat or nonfat dairy products should be encouraged. The use of loop and thiazide diuretics can increase uric acid levels, whereas the use of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan increases urinary excretion of uric acid. Reduction of uric acid levels is key to avoiding gout flares. Allopurinol and febuxostat are first-line medications for the prevention of recurrent gout, and colchicine and/or probenecid are reserved for patients who cannot tolerate first-line agents or in whom first-line agents are ineffective. Patients receiving urate-lowering medications should be treated concurrently with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, or low-dose corticosteroids to prevent flares. Treatment should continue for at least three months after uric acid levels fall below the target goal in those without tophi, and for six months in those with a history of tophi.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment of acute gout [^413976cd]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) associated with better outcomes than cyclooxygenase inhibitors, glucocorticoids, IL-1 inhibitors or placebo in the treatment of acute gout?

Bottom Line

NSAIDs are not significantly associated with a difference in pain reduction compared with cyclooxygenase inhibitors and glucocorticoids for treating acute gout. However, NSAIDs are associated with higher rates of adverse events and higher rates of withdrawal due to adverse events compared with cyclooxygenase inhibitors.

### Anakinra for the treatment of acute gout flares: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, non-inferiority trial [^ac647dae]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anakinra in treating acute gout flares in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active comparator, non-inferiority (NI) trial.

Methods

Patients with a crystal-proven acute gout flare were randomized (1: 1) to treatment with anakinra or treatment as usual (free choice: either colchicine, naproxen or prednisone). The primary end point was the change in pain between baseline and the averaged pain score on days 2–4 measured on a five-point rating scale. NI of anakinra would be established if the upper bound of the 95% CI of the numeric difference in changed pain scores between treatment groups did not exceed the NI limit of 0.4 in favour of treatment as usual, in the per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) populations, assessed in an analysis of covariance model. Secondary outcomes included safety assessments, improvement in pain, swelling, tenderness and treatment response after 5 days, assessed using linear mixed models and binary logistic regression models.

Results

Forty-three patients received anakinra and 45 treatment as usual. Anakinra was non-inferior (mean difference; 95% CI) to treatment as usual in both the PP (-0.13; -0.44, 0.18) and ITT (-0.18; -0.44, 0.08) populations. No unexpected or uncommon (serious) adverse events were observed in either treatment arm. Analyses of secondary outcomes showed that patients in both groups reported similar significant reductions in their gout symptoms.

Conclusion

Efficacy of anakinra was shown to be non-inferior to treatment as usual for the treatment of acute gout flares, suggesting that anakinra is an effective treatment alternative for acute gout flares.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^bea6ab4b]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology gout guideline — strong recommendations included initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage ≥ 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (≤ 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended, and for management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

### An appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the management of gout [^c87d10a9]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the Management of Gout.

Recent Findings

The ACRs first clinical practice guidelines for the management of gout focus on recommendations for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to hyperuricaemia and the treatment and prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology employed assessed risks and benefits of alternative treatments for efficacy, safety and quality but not for cost-effectiveness. Novel recommendations include the use of either allopurinol or febuxostat for first-line urate-lowering drug therapy (ULT), screening for HLA-B✱5801 prior to initiation of allopurinol in Asians at relatively high risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity, and the use of pegloticase for patients with severe, symptomatic, tophaceous gout refractory to, or intolerant of, appropriately dosed ULTs. Appraisal and comparison with other guidelines using Guidelines International Network and Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) criteria showed good scores for scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, editorial independence and, overall quality, but not for applicability.

Summary

The ACR guidelines provide comprehensive, up-to-date, good-quality, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for the management of gout in clinical practice but score poorly for applicability. To improve the management of gout in the community a summary of key recommendations, criteria for audit and standards of care are now required.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — acute gout management in chronic kidney disease (CKD): For symptomatic treatment of acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glucocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Administration early after symptom onset is encouraged. For colchicine, the US Food and Drug Administration–approved dosing is 1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing anti-inflammatory therapy until the flare has resolved; dose adjustment should be considered for CKD G5. NSAIDs can cause toxicity in CKD and need to be used cautiously, and short courses of oral glucocorticoids such as 30 mg prednisone orally for 3–5 days could be used as an alternative.

Outcomes

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was the 'days to resolution' from enrolment to the resolution of an acute gout flare. The resolution of an acute gout flare was determined if the patient had an absence of joint pain, swelling, tenderness and erythema. Flares were defined as one or more than one manifestation of joint pain, swelling, tenderness and erythema.

Secondary outcomes

Clinical observers assessed joint pain (5-point Likert scale: 0 = no pain, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe), joint swelling (4-point Likert scale: 0 = no swelling, 1 = probable swelling, 2 = visible, 3 = bulging beyond the joint margins), joint tenderness (3-point Likert scale: 0 = no tenderness, 1 = patient declares pain, 2 = patient declares pain and withdraws limbs) and joint erythema (3-point Likert scale: 0 = normal, 1 = suspect, 2 = redness) at baseline. Due to rapid changes in inflammation of goutand it was difficult for the subjects to come to the hospital every day for the first 7 days, we assessed joint inflammation on days 1, 3, 5 and 7, and we assessed joint inflammation on days 2, 4 and 6 by video calls in order to ensure the accuracy of the primary outcome (days to resolution). Other outcomes that were evaluated included sUA, ESR, CRP at baseline and day 7, and adverse effects on day 28.

### Difficult-to-treat gout flares: eligibility for interleukin-1 inhibition in private practice is uncommon according to current EMA approval [^450fdd0a]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective was to determine the proportion of patients with difficult-to-treat or difficult-to-prevent acute gout attacks eligible for IL-1 inhibition.

Methods

Participants included in the French cross-sectional GOSPEL cohort (n = 1003 gout patients) were examined for contraindications and intolerance to standard of care (SoC) drugs of gout flares (colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and systemic glucocorticoids). Patients were classified as definitely eligible for first-line IL-1 inhibition (canakinumab) according to European summary of product characteristics (contraindications/intolerance to SoC and at least three flares per year) without any other anti-inflammatory options (contraindications/intolerance only), or potentially eligible (precaution of use). Eligibility to receive IL-1 during an on-going flare related to insufficient efficacy was assessed (second-line eligibility).

Results

Definite first-line eligibility for IL-1 therapy was found in 10 patients (1%) and contraindication to all SoC therapies in nine patients who had presented < 3 flares in the past 12 months. At least precaution of use for SoC therapies was noted for 218/1003 patients (21.7%). Of 487 patients experiencing flares at baseline, 114 (23.4%) were still experiencing pain scored ⩾4/10 numeric scale on day 3, one of whom could not receive further SoC drugs. Only nine of them had three or more flares in the past year and were eligible for second-line IL-1 inhibition.

Conclusion

Despite significant numbers of patients without any SoC anti-inflammatory therapeutic options for gout flares, eligibility for IL-1 inhibition therapy according to current European approval is rare.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^7537059a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Colchicine is regarded as beneficial in the treatment of acute gout, but has a high frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of colchicine for relief of the signs and symptoms of acute gouty arthritis, compared to placebo and other treatment interventions.

Search Strategy

We searched the following electronic databases to March 2006: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1980), CINAHL (from 1982), AMED (from 1985), Web of Science (from 1945) and Current Controlled Trials.

Selection Criteria

Published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials evaluating symptom relief and adverse outcomes of colchicine therapy in acute gout were considered for this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently screened search results for inclusion, collected the data in a standardized form and assessed the methodological quality of the trial using validated criteria. Results for continuous outcome measures were expressed as weighted mean differences. Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk. The number needed to treat was calculated for significant outcomes.

Main Results

One RCT (N = 43) comparing colchicine to placebo for the treatment of acute gout was included in this review. The results favour the use of colchicine over placebo with an absolute reduction of 34% for pain and a 30% reduction in clinical symptoms such as tenderness on palpation, swelling, redness, and pain. The number needed to treat (NNT) with colchicine versus placebo to reduce pain was 3 and the NNT to reduce clinical symptoms was 2. All participants treated with colchicine experienced gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea and/or vomiting) and the number needed to harm (NNH) with colchicine versus placebo was 1. No studies comparing colchicine to NSAIDs or other treatments such as corticosteroids or ACTH were identified.

Authors' Conclusions

Colchicine is an effective treatment for the reduction of pain and clinical symptoms in patients experiencing acute attacks of gout, although in the regimen studied its low benefit to toxicity ratio limits its usefulness. It should be used as a second line therapy when NSAIDs or corticosteroids are contraindicated or ineffective. More evidence is needed to compare the efficacy of colchicine to that of NSAIDs or corticosteroids, the current first line therapy for acute gout.

### Treating to target: a strategy to cure gout [^84e0df15]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute gout attacks and the long-term complications of gout are associated with the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) monohydrate crystals in the joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. The aim of long-term treatment is to reduce the serum urate (sUA) level to 6 mg/dl (≤ 360 micromol/l), below the saturation point of MSU, so that new crystals cannot form and existing crystals are dissolved. Serial joint aspiration studies confirmed the disappearance of crystals with effective urate-lowering therapy. There is good evidence that achieving sUA < 6 mg/dl (360 micromol/l) results in freedom from acute gout attacks, and shrinkage and eventual disappearance of tophi. Gout patients must be informed about their diagnosis and educated about gout management including the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Patients starting urate-lowering therapy need to understand the importance of prophylactic therapy with colchicine or NSAIDs to reduce the risk of 'mobilization flares' in the first few months. In the long term, reduction in the sUA below the target level will result in gout being effectively cured.

### Update on gout: new therapeutic strategies and options [^94de9e78]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Gout, a disease recognized since antiquity, has increased in prevalence in recent years and the clinical profile of this disease has become increasingly complex, owing to large numbers of cases with iatrogenic factors, multiple comorbidities, advanced age, and hyperuricemia and arthritis refractory to treatment. In this Review, key advances in gout research made during the past decade are summarized. Revised strategies for safe and effective employment of dietary measures and pharmacologic treatments for active gouty arthritis, prevention of gout flares and urate lowering are also reviewed, with an emphasis on dosing of colchicine and allopurinol, and the evidence-based approach to systemic glucocorticosteroid treatment of acute gout. Also discussed are new and emerging treatments for gout and hyperuricemia, and the potential influence of dual energy CT imaging on treatment. In this context, the therapeutic role of febuxostat, and clinical development of pegylated uricase urate-lowering therapy and interleukin 1 antagonism for gouty inflammation are reviewed. Collectively, novel approaches will hopefully lead to improved management of hyperuricemia and gout, and also to improvements in patient-centered outcomes, even for those who have previously failed to respond to treatment.

### Recommendations in clinical practice guidelines on gout: systematic review and consistency analysis [^e2c99f4c]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare and analyse the recommendations from clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on gout worldwide, examine the consistency across CPGs, and provide suggestions to develop and update gout guidelines.

Methods

We conducted systematic searches in MEDLINE, CBM, GIN, NICE, NGC, WHO, SIGN, DynaMed, UpToDate, and Best Practice databases, from their inception to August 2019 to identify and select CPGs related to gout. We used the search terms "gout", "hyperuricaemia" and "guideline". After two rounds of screening, we included the eligible CPGs of gout according to the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Methodological quality of included guidelines was assessed with the AGREE-II instrument. The general characteristics of included guidelines and the recommendations were extracted, and the consistency of recommendations across guidelines was compared and analysed.

Results

A total of 15 gout guidelines including 359 recommendations were retrieved. The main topics covered by the recommendations were diagnosis, pharmacologic treatment of gout flares, pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy (ULT) of chronic gouty arthritis, lifestyle interventions, prophylaxis, and management of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia. The results of AGREE-II appraisal showed that only two guidelines achieved high scores (≥ 50%) in all six domains. There was substantial discrepancy between the guidelines in recommendations covering the value of computed tomography (CT) and x-rays for diagnosis, the use of corticosteroids as a first-line treatment for flare, the use of colchicine, indications for ULT, the use of febuxostat as first-line ULT, the administration of allopurinol, and the timing of ULT initiation.

Conlusions

A number of countries are devoting themselves to the development of gout guidelines, but the process of updating guidelines is slower than that suggested by the WHO. Methodological quality is not satisfactory in most guidelines, and recommendations between guidelines are not consistent.

### What makes gouty inflammation so variable? [^ba809735]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Intersecting effects of therapeutics on gouty inflammation

The mechanisms of action of the primary treatment options for prophylaxis and treatment of acute gout clearly intersect with many of the novel inflammation-mediating pathways cited above. Specifically, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and certain other NSAIDs activate PPAR-γ.

Corticosteroids, which inhibit transcription of many inflammatory genes, also regulate annexin A1. However, corticosteroids also paradoxically induce NLRP3, which may contribute to rebound flares of acute gout after steroid therapy is stopped. Low doses of colchicine suppress not simply neutrophil and endothelial function, but also multiple inflammatory effects in macrophages, transduced in large part by colchicine-induced activation of AMPK.

With respect to investigational agents, randomized clinical trials of the IL-1β-specific monoclonal antibody canakinumab have demonstrated superiority compared to a single dose of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide in reducing pain in acute gout and delaying time to next acute gout flare. Canakinumab is approved in Europe as an option for acute gout therapy. Multiple retrospective case series have reported on the efficacy of anakinra (recombinant IL-1ra) in acute gout in many but not all patients. Failure in acute gout (but not for anti-inflammatory flare prophylaxis) of the IL-1 blocker rilonacept may have been due to binding of rilonacept to IL-1ra. Finally, the partial PPAR-γ agonist arhalofenate, which is a uricosuric, has been reported to be associated with a decreased frequency of acute gout flares in comparison to allopurinol in a Phase II randomized controlled trial comparing ULT strategies and flare prophylaxis.

### Colchicine and the heart [^3a0f9faa]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Colchicine is a sophisticated anti-inflammatory agent that has been used for centuries for the treatment and prevention of gout, and for over 50 years for the prevention of acute inflammatory flares in patients with FMF. Almost 35 years ago, the observed benefits of colchicine in the prevention and treatment of polyserositis in patients with FMF led to its introduction into CV medicine for the treatment and prevention of pericarditis. Subsequent randomized trials in over 1600 patients confirming its safety and efficacy have resulted in it being adopted in the European guidelinesand registered in some countries (e.g. Italy, Austria) as first-line therapy for this indication. Over the last 15 years, clinical trials in > 11 000 patients with coronary disease have shown that long-term low-dose colchicine can be safely used on top of lipid-lowering and antiplatelet therapy in the absence of advanced renal or liver disease to improve disease-free survival. Over the next 3–5 years, ongoing trials will add information about the benefits of colchicine in CV disease in a further 9000 patients.

### Updates in the management of gout [^b56ff43f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with gout are cared for by primary care physicians. Although both the physician and patient may easily recognize the acute arthritis of gout, errors in selecting the most appropriate medication and proper dose are common. The clinical stages of gout include asymptomatic hyperuricemia, intermittent gouty arthritis, and chronic tophaceous gout. Treatment of gout is usually considered after the first attack of arthritis, typically podagra. The aims of treatment are to alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with acute attacks, prevent future attacks, and decrease uric acid levels. Confusion frequently arises because certain medications such as colchicine may have dual purposes: to treat an acute attack and to suppress future attacks. The purpose of this management update is to provide practical advice about prescribing the proper medication considering both treatment goals and patient comorbidities.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^e43ae695]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis that is characterised by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid and other tissues. The natural history of articular gout is generally characterised by three periods: asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, episodes of acute gout and chronic gouty arthritis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. Published guidelines recommend their use to treat acute attacks, using maximum recommended doses for a short time.

Objectives

To assess the benefit and safety of NSAIDs (including COXIBs) for acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies to 7 October 2013, the 2010 and 2011 ACR and EULAR abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of articles. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trial register and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials that compared NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy (including non-pharmacological therapies) for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain (proportion with 50% or more reduction in pain or mean pain when the dichotomous outcome was unavailable), inflammation (e.g. measured by joint swelling/erythema/tenderness), function of target joint, participant's global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted the data, performed a risk of bias assessment and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 23 trials (2200 participants). One trial (30 participants) of low-quality evidence compared an NSAID (tenoxicam) with placebo. It found that significantly more participants had more than 50% reduction in pain after 24 hours (11/15 participants) compared with those taking placebo (4/15 participants) (risk ratio (RR) 2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 6.72). A similar outcome was seen for more than 50% improvement in joint swelling after 24 hours (5/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 2/15 participants taking placebo; RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.57 to 10.93). The trial did not measure function, participant global assessment of treatment success and health-related quality of life. There were no adverse events reported with the use of tenoxicam; two adverse events (nausea and polypuria) were reported in the placebo group. No between-group differences in outcome were observed after four days. Moderate-quality evidence based upon four trials (974 participants) indicated that NSAIDs and COXIBs produced similar benefits in terms of pain, swelling and global improvement, but COXIBs were associated with fewer adverse events. Pain reduction was 1.9 points on a 0- to 10-point scale with COXIBs (0 was no pain) while pain reduction with NSAIDs was 0.03 points lower or better (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.13). Joint swelling in the COXIB group was 1.64 points on a 0- to 3-point scale (0 is no swelling) and 0.13 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.34). Function was not reported. Participant-reported global assessment was 1.56 points on a 0- to 4-point scale with COXIBs (0 was the best score) and was 0.04 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.20). Health-related quality of life assessed using the 36-item Short Form showed no evidence of a statistically significant between-group difference (MD 0.49, 95% CI -1.61 to 2.60 for the physical component). There were significantly fewer withdrawals due to adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (3%) compared with NSAIDs (8%) (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.28). There was a significantly lower number of total adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (38%) compared with NSAIDs (60%) (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86). There was moderate-quality evidence based on two trials (210 participants) that oral glucocorticoids did not differ in pain reduction, function or adverse events when compared with NSAIDs. Pain reduction was 9.5 on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, pain reduction with NSAIDs was 1.74 higher or worse (MD 1.74, 95% CI -1.44 to 4.92). The trials did not assess inflammation. Function measured as walking disability was 17.4 points on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, function with NSAIDs was 0.1 lower or better (MD -0.10, 95% CI -4.72 to 4.52). The trials did not measure participant-reported global assessment and health-related quality of life. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events. There was no evidence of a difference in total number of adverse events with glucocorticoids (31%) versus NSAIDs (49%) (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.28).

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence supported the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute gout. One placebo-controlled trial provided evidence of benefit at 24 hours and little or no harm. We downgraded the evidence due to potential selection and reporting biases, and imprecision. While these data were insufficient to draw firm conclusions, they did not conflict with clinical guideline recommendations based upon evidence from observational studies, other inflammatory arthritis and expert consensus, which support the use of NSAIDs in acute gout. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial although COX-2 inhibitors are likely to be associated with significantly fewer total and gastrointestinal adverse events. We downgraded the evidence due to an unclear risk of selection and reporting biases. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that systemic glucocorticoids and NSAIDs were also equally beneficial in terms of pain relief. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events were similar between groups. We downgraded the evidence due to unclear risk of selection and reporting bias. There was low-quality evidence that there was no difference in function. We downgraded the quality due to unclear risk of selection bias and imprecision.

Management

Treatment of a gout flare should be commenced as soon as possible, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine or glucocorticoids being first-line options for treatment. An open-label randomised trial comparing low-dose colchicine 500 mg three times per day for 4 days with naproxen 750 mg immediately, then 250 mg every 8 hours for 7 days found that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of pain intensity over 7 days although side effects were more common in the colchicine group, mainly diarrhoea and headache. Another randomised trial comparing oral prednisone and naproxen for monoarticular gout found that either prednisolone 35 mg once a day or naproxen 500 mg two times a day for 5 days were equally effective, and adverse effects were similar between groups. Symptomatic treatment for a gout flare includes immobilisation of the joint and use of cold packs. Anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibodies have also been found to be effective for relief of gout flaresand are generally recommended for patients experiencing gout flares where other drugs have caused side effects or were ineffective.

Long-term use of urate-lowering therapy leads to crystal dissolution, resulting in suppression of gout flares, regression of tophiand prevention of progressive joint damage. Rheumatology societies strongly recommend urate-lowering therapy for patients with tophi, evidence of radiographic damage attributable to gout or frequent gout flares. Urate-lowering therapy may also have benefit earlier in the disease course. Allopurinol is the preferred and most commonly prescribed first-line urate-lowering therapy. Second-line treatments include febuxostat, another xanthine oxidase inhibitor, probenecid, a uricosuric agent and pegloticase, a recombinant uricase administered intravenously.

A treat-to-target serum urate approach is recommended by the ACR guidelinesand EULAR recommendations. Serum urate monitoring allows the dose of medication to be titrated to a target serum urate of below 6 mg/dL (360 µmol/L) in those with symptomatic gout and often below 5 mg/dL (300 µmol/L) in those with features of severe gout such as tophi.

### Corticosteroid or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for the treatment of acute gout: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^e8020e0d]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) are used as first-line agents to treat acute gout. Recent trials suggest a possible first-line role for corticosteroids.

Methods

We conducted a metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating corticosteroid versus NSAID therapy (nonselective and selective) as treatment for acute gout. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were systematically searched through August 2016. Outcomes included pain, bleeding, joint swelling, erythema, tenderness, activity limitation, response to therapy, quality of life, time to resolution, supplementary analgesics, and adverse events. Evidence quality was summarized using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system.

Results

Six eligible trials (817 patients) were identified. The mean study followup was 15 days (range 4–30). Risks of bias were generally low. In low- to moderate-quality evidence, corticosteroids did not have different effects on pain score at < 7 days [standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.09, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.08] or at ≥ 7 days (SMD 0.32, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.92) when compared with NSAID. There was no evidence of different risks of gastrointestinal bleeding [relative risk (RR) 0.09, 95% CI 0.01–1.67]. There was no evidence of different responses to therapy on pain at < 7 days (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.80–1.44) and ≥ 7 days, time to disease resolution, or number of supplementary analgesics used (MD 2.10 drugs, 95% CI -1.01 to 5.21). There was a lower risk of indigestion (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27–0.92), nausea (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11–0.54), and vomiting (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02–0.56) with corticosteroid therapy.

Conclusion

There is no evidence that corticosteroids and NSAID have different efficacy in managing pain in acute gout, but corticosteroids appear to have a more favorable safety profile for selected adverse events analyzed in existing RCT.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^2f075291]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

In a retrospective study of patients hospitalized for gout flares while receiving allopurinol (n = 59), dose reductions (or discontinuations) of allopurinol during admissions were associated with higher rates of flares in the 3 months following discharge than admissions during which allopurinol doses were unchanged or increased (53% vs 22%; P = 0.03). The primary reason provided for the allopurinol dose reductions/discontinuations was acute kidney injury, which was present in a higher proportion of this group than that of the comparator group (60% vs 36%). Patients in the dose-reduced/discontinued cohort were less likely to have received flare prophylaxis at discharge than the dose-unchanged/increased cohort (60% vs 27%; P -value not specified), which may have contributed to the observed differences in post-discharge flares.

Whether to initiate ULT during a gout flare has been evaluated in three studies that included participants recruited from EDs and inpatient settings. In an RCT, 31 participants were recruited from EDs and rheumatology clinics within 72 h of initial therapy for a gout flare and randomized to receive allopurinol 100 mg daily (up-titrated to 200 mg daily after 14 days) or placebo. Treatment for the flare was determined by the treating physician, with corticosteroids utilized in over 80% of participants. Both study arms received prophylactic low-dose colchicine. The primary end point of time to resolution of the flares was not significantly different between the allopurinol and the placebo arms (15.4 days vs 13.4 days, respectively; P = 0.50). It is of note, however, that post-hoc power calculations suggested 116 subjects per arm were required in order to have demonstrated a significant difference in this end point. Pain and physician global assessment scores declined rapidly in both study arms. As might be expected, SU levels were significantly lower in the allopurinol arm than the placebo arm at study completion (6.4 mg/dl vs 8.3 mg/dl; P = 0.012).

### Gout: will the "King of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured? [^189a75ce]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines, treat-to-target serum urate, and new drugs for gout

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged since the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout, but one that has been brought to center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL, namely (1) associated benefits of reduction of gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target; (2) the fact that this sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL; and (3) the use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome in gout randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the drug approval of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) by the regulatory authorities. Since there is no way to achieve the sUA target without monitoring or reassessing sUA, rheumatologists monitor sUA and aim for an sUA target level of less than 6 mg/dL. Therapeutic doses of allopurinol (100–800 mg/day) or febuxostat (40–80 mg/day) or a combination with uricosurics is often needed to achieve target sUA. Allopurinol maximum dose need not be reduced, even in the presence of renal failure, since adverse events are related to initial, and not final, allopurinol dose; pegloticase is another option. Appropriately titrated ULT doses can help achieve a near cure for gout by resolving all urate crystals.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^b8c7bf4e]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Intervention, randomization and blinding

One hundred and forty patients who met the study criteria were randomized at a 1:1 ratio without stratification. Patients were administered febuxostat 40 mg daily (febuxostat group) or placebo (placebo group). All patients were administered diclofenac (150 mg/day) for 7 days and then open-labelled on day 8. Febuxostat 40 mg daily and diclofenac 75 mg daily were administered from day 8 through 28 for patients in remission. The dose of diclofenac was 150 mg/day before remission in both arms, the original protocol was maintained until remission.

A pre-allocated blocked randomization schedule was implemented using a block size of four. Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the febuxostat or the placebo group. Patients were enrolled by study site personnel. Each centre (hospital) recruited study participants by means of competition. The College of Public Health Management of Southern Medical University was designated as the 'random centre' to manage and perform the randomization process. To ensure representativeness, each centre enrolled at least 28 subjects. Each centre had a principle investigator (PI) who knows the treatment code, and another doctor who did not know the treatment code was responsible for assessing inflammation and recording the data. Before any of the study subjects were assigned to a group, the PI requested a randomized number from the 'random centre'. Medications were self-administered at home and participants were blinded to the treatments assigned.

### Management of gout: a systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^5168a7c3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis in patients seen by primary care physicians.

Purpose

To review evidence about treatment of acute gout attacks, management of hyperuricemia to prevent attacks, and discontinuation of medications for chronic gout in adults.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases from January 2010 to March 2016, reference mining, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Study Selection

Studies of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and commonly prescribed by primary care physicians, randomized trials for effectiveness, and trials and observational studies for adverse events.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Study quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. Strength-of-evidence assessment was done by group discussion.

Data Synthesis

High-strength evidence from 28 trials (only 3 of which were placebo-controlled) shows that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids reduce pain in patients with acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose colchicine and causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) reduces long-term risk for acute gout attacks after 1 year or more. High-strength evidence shows that prophylaxis with daily colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks by at least half in patients starting urate-lowering therapy, and moderate-strength evidence indicates that duration of prophylaxis should be longer than 8 weeks. Although lower urate levels reduce risk for recurrent acute attacks, treatment to a specific target level has not been tested.

Limitation

Few studies of acute gout treatments, no placebo-controlled trials of management of hyperuricemia lasting longer than 6 months, and few studies in primary care populations.

Conclusion

Colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout. Urate-lowering therapy decreases serum urate levels and reduces risk for acute gout attacks.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^d95935e3]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of joint pain and swelling, which can necessitate hospital admission when severe. Highly effective, low-cost medications are available for the treatment of gout flares: colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Flares can be prevented by urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), of which allopurinol is the most widely used. British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidelines recommend offering ULT to all patients with gout, with up-titration to achieve serum urate (SU) levels of 300–360 micromol/l (5–6 mg/dl), to facilitate crystal dissolution. The ACR gout management guideline was recently updated to conditionally recommend initiation of ULT during flares, rather than delayed initiation of ULT after flare resolution.

Despite effective treatments, hospitalizations for gout flares have increased dramatically: doubling in the USA between 1993 and 2011, from 4.4 to 8.8 admissions per 100 000 adults, respectively; doubling in Canada between 2000 and 2011, from 3.8 to 7.6 admissions per 100 000 adults; and increasing by 58.4% in England between 2006 and 2017, from 7.9 to 12.5 admissions per 100 000 adults. This contrasts with the decline in hospitalizations from RA. There are multiple contributing factors to the epidemic of gout hospitalizations: the prevalence of gout has increased in Western countries in recent years on a background of an ageing population with rising prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome; the management of gout is frequently suboptimal in primary care, rheumatology clinics and inpatient settings, and only a minority of patients achieve the SU levels required to prevent flares.

Hospital admissions provide a unique opportunity to engage patients in shared decision-making and begin the process of establishing optimal ULT. What is not known is how best to implement evidence-based treatments during hospitalizations for gout. Such strategies are essential if the rising number of gout admissions is to be countered. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in patients hospitalized with gout.

Gout — starting dose and titration of ULT — starting treatment with low-dose allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day and lower in patients with CKD [stage ≥ 3]) and febuxostat (≤ 40 mg/day) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is strongly recommended; starting treatment with low-dose probenecid (500 mg once to twice daily) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is conditionally recommended. A lower starting dose of any ULT reduces the risk of flare associated with initiation, and lower initial allopurinol doses (e.g., ≤ 50 mg/day) are noted as examples.

### Can racial disparities in optimal gout treatment be reduced? Evidence from a randomized trial [^ac2f3b9a]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in the U.S. that affects 4% of the general U.S. population. The prevalence of gout is increasing in the U.S., related at least partially to a rising rates of obesity and hypertension. Based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007–2008, it is estimated that 6 million Caucasians and 1.2 million African-Americans in the U.S. have gout. Gout presents with an extremely painful intermittent inflammatory arthritis, which over time, progresses to a chronic, deforming arthritis similar to rheumatoid arthritis. In addition to causing musculoskeletal morbidity and urate kidney stones, gout is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

The treatment of gout includes two approaches, treatment of acute episodes with medications that are anti-inflammatory including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine or corticosteroids (oral, systemic or intra-articular) and the long-term treatment of hyperuricemia with medications that either reduce the production of uric acid (urate-lowering therapy (ULT) with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol or febuxostat) or increase the excretion of urate (uricosurics such as probenecid [available in U.S.]; benzbromarone and sulfinpyrazone [not available in U.S.]). Due to a higher efficacy regardless of urate overproducer versus underexcretor status, allopurinol or febuxostat is used far more commonly than uricosurics. Despite availability of efficacious treatments, less than 50% patients treated with allopurinol, the commonest ULT, achieve the target serum urate < 6 mg/dl that is associated with lower risk of gout flares, tophi and medical care costs.

### Colchicine for prophylaxis of acute flares when initiating allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis [^7ea3bc09]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of colchicine to prevent acute gout flares during initiation of allopurinol therapy is widely practiced despite lack of proven benefit. We investigated if colchicine administration during initiation of allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis reduces the frequency and/or severity of acute gout flares.

Methods

Patients starting allopurinol for crystal-proven chronic gouty arthritis were randomized to receive colchicine 0.6 mg po bid or placebo in a randomized, prospective, double blind, placebo controlled trial. Subjects were followed for evidence of acute gout flares and remained on study drug for 3 months beyond attaining a serum urate concentration < 6.5 mg/dl. Treatment arms were analyzed regarding frequency of flares, likelihood of any flare or multiple flares, severity of flares on the visual analog scale (VAS), and length of flares in days.

Results

Forty-three subjects were studied. Subjects treated with colchicine experienced fewer total flares (0.52 vs 2.91, p = 0.008), fewer flares from 0 to 3 months (0.57 vs 1.91, p = 0.022), fewer flares 3–6 months (0 vs 1.05, p = 0.033), less severe flares as reported on VAS (3.64 vs 5.08, p = 0.018), and fewer recurrent gout flares (p = 0.001). Colchicine was well tolerated.

Conclusion

Colchicine prophylaxis during initiation of allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis reduces the frequency and severity of acute flares, and reduces the likelihood of recurrent flares. Treating patients with colchicine during initiation of allopurinol therapy for 6 months is supported by our data.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^07208b99]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

In another single-centre RCT, 57 participants recruited from EDs, wards and outpatient clinics within 7 days of onset of gout flares were randomized to receive allopurinol 300 mg daily or placebo for 10 days. After day 10, all participants received open-label allopurinol 300 mg daily. All participants received indomethacin 50 mg three times daily for 10 days and colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily for 90 days. The co-primary end point of participant-reported joint pain normalized rapidly in both study arms, with no significant differences between arms from days 1 to 10. Self-reported new or recurrent gout flares did not differ significantly between study arms by day 30 (7.7% in the early initiation group vs 12.0% in the delayed initiation group; P = 0.61), despite rapid decreases in SU levels in the early initiation group. Similarly, in a retrospective study involving patients recruited from hospital or outpatient settings, more rapid attainment of target SU levels was observed with immediate vs delayed initiation of ULT (2.5 vs 3.8 months, respectively; P = 0.004). Repeat flares occurred more frequently in the immediate commencement cohort than in the delayed commencement cohort in the 12 weeks after the initial flare, but were comparable beyond this point.

### Progress in the pharmacotherapy of gout [^67fe0718]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize new knowledge on approved and emerging drugs used to treat hyperuricemia or the clinical manifestations of gout.

Recent Findings

Results of several clinical trials provide new data on the efficacy and safety of the approved urate-lowering drugs, allopurinol and febuxostat. New recommendations have been presented on appropriate dosing of colchicine for acute gout flares and potential toxicities of combining colchicine with medications such as clarithromycin. Emerging therapies, including pegloticase, the uricosuric agent RDEA596, and the interleukin-1 inhibitors, rilonacept and canakinumab, have shown promise in early and late phase clinical trials.

Summary

Recent publications demonstrate an opportunity to use existing gout therapies more effectively in order to improve both efficacy and safety. Emerging therapies for gout show promise for unmet needs in selected gout populations.

### Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy and hospitalizations for gout: results from a nationwide cohort study in england [^2cc7964f]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our finding that ULT associates with an increased risk of flares requiring hospitalization in the first 6 months after initiation is in keeping with the results of studies in community settings. In a UK primary care-based RCT of people with gout (n = 517), treat-to-target ULT increased the frequency of gout flares within the first year when compared with usual care, but reduced flares at 2 years. In the NOR-Gout study of treat-to-target ULT, flares were more frequent during the first year after initiation (particularly at 3–6 months after initiation), but reduced greatly in the second year.

Changes in SU levels when initiating ULT may precipitate flares through dissolution and remodelling of intra-articular urate crystal deposits. Guidelines recommend considering prescription of prophylaxis against flares when initiating and titrating ULT, with low-dose colchicine (500 micrograms once or twice daily for ≥ 3 months) recommended as first-line prophylaxis. In our cohort, only 10% of people initiating ULT were prescribed the equivalent of colchicine 500 micrograms once daily for ≥ 3 months. In age and sex-adjusted models, we observed an association between increased hospitalizations and the prescription of colchicine prophylaxis; however, this association was not statistically significant following multivariable adjustment. Our finding contrasts RCTs that have reported fewer flares when initiating ULT with colchicine prophylaxis. The differences may represent confounding by indication in our cohort; for example, prescription of colchicine to people with more severe gout at greater risk of hospitalization. We explored the use of propensity models to account for differences in colchicine-receiving vs non-receiving groups; however, differences between these groups precluded this. Other potential contributing factors could include repeated acute prescriptions for colchicine for flares being misclassified as prophylaxis, and low adherence to prophylaxis during ULT titration.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^560eed0d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis resulting from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in and around joints. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs)) for acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for studies to 28 August 2020. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain, inflammation, function, participant-reported global assessment, quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events, and total adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included in this update 28 trials (3406 participants), including 5 new trials. One trial (30 participants) compared NSAIDs to placebo, 6 (1244 participants) compared non-selective NSAIDs to selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs), 5 (712 participants) compared NSAIDs to glucocorticoids, 13 compared one NSAID to another NSAID (633 participants), and single trials compared NSAIDs to rilonacept (225 participants), acupuncture (163 participants), and colchicine (399 participants). Most trials were at risk of selection, performance, and detection biases. We report numerical data for the primary comparison NSAIDs versus placebo and brief results for the two comparisons - NSAIDs versus COX-2 inhibitors and NSAIDs versus glucocorticoids. Low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) from 1 trial (30 participants) shows NSAIDs compared to placebo. More participants (11/15) may have a 50% reduction in pain at 24 hours with NSAIDs than with placebo (4/15) (risk ratio (RR) 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 6.7), with absolute improvement of 47% (3.5% more to 152.5% more). NSAIDs may have little to no effect on inflammation (swelling) after four days (13/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 12/15 participants taking placebo; RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.5), with absolute improvement of 6.4% (16.8% fewer to 39.2% more). There may be little to no difference in function (4-point scale; 1 = complete resolution) at 24 hours (4/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 1/15 participants taking placebo; RR 4.0, 95% CI 0.5 to 31.7), with absolute improvement of 20% (3.3% fewer to 204.9% more). NSAIDs may result in little to no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (0 events in both groups) or in total adverse events; two adverse events (nausea and polyuria) were reported in the placebo group (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.0, 3.8), with absolute difference of 10.7% more (13.2% fewer to 38% more). Treatment success and health-related quality of life were not measured. Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) from 6 trials (1244 participants) shows non-selective NSAIDs compared to selective COX-2 inhibitors (COXIBs). Non-selective NSAIDs probably result in little to no difference in pain (mean difference (MD) 0.03, 95% CI 0.07 lower to 0.14 higher), swelling (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.07 lower to 0.22 higher), treatment success (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.04 lower to 0.2 higher), or quality of life (MD -0.2, 95% CI -6.7 to 6.3) compared to COXIBs. Low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) suggests no difference in function (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.25) between groups. Non-selective NSAIDs probably increase withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.1) and total adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.8). Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) based on 5 trials (712 participants) shows NSAIDs compared to glucocorticoids. NSAIDs probably result in little to no difference in pain (MD 0.1, 95% CI -2.7 to 3.0), inflammation (MD 0.3, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.6), function (MD -0.2, 95% CI -2.2 to 1.8), or treatment success (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.2). There was no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events with NSAIDs compared to glucocorticoids (RR 2.8, 95% CI 0.5 to 14.2). There was a decrease in total adverse events with glucocorticoids compared to NSAIDs (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.5).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence from 1 placebo-controlled trial suggests that NSAIDs may improve pain at 24 hours and may have little to no effect on function, inflammation, or adverse events for treatment of acute gout. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that COXIBs and non-selective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial with regards to improvement in pain, function, inflammation, and treatment success, although non-selective NSAIDs probably increase withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that systemic glucocorticoids and NSAIDs probably are equally beneficial in terms of pain relief, improvement in function, and treatment success. Withdrawals due to adverse events were also similar between groups, but NSAIDs probably result in more total adverse events. Low-certainty evidence suggests no difference in inflammation between groups. Only low-certainty evidence was available for the comparisons NSAID versus rilonacept and NSAID versus acupuncture from single trials, or one NSAID versus another NSAID, which also included many NSAIDs that are no longer in clinical use. Although these data were insufficient to support firm conclusions, they do not conflict with clinical guideline recommendations based upon evidence from observational studies, findings for other inflammatory arthritis, and expert consensus, all of which support the use of NSAIDs for acute gout.

### The impact of gout guidelines [^c1ebc32e]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients.

Recent Findings

Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade including those from the British Rheumatism Society; the European League Against Rheumatism; the Multinational Evidence, Expertise, Exchange Initiative; the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism; the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout. However, despite the extant guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations and uptake have been slow and initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate is infrequent. Greater education in proper management as well as increased awareness of new treatment strategies appear to be the primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management as well as areas for further research.

Summary

Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers are struggling with appropriate management of the disease. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

### Casebook consults: improving outcomes in gout (multimedia activity) [^438cd63e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a chronic, potentially debilitating condition characterized by an inflammatory process in the joints or periarticular tissues that results from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment can lead to the development of tophi and chronic arthropathy. A presumptive diagnosis of gout can be made on the basis of the clinical presentation as well as risk factors such as metabolic syndrome. Key conditions to rule out in the differential diagnosis are septic arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (pseudogout), fracture, and rheumatoid arthritis. Acute flares of gout should be managed with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or corticosteroids. With a diagnosis of gout, if urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is required, prophylaxis should be considered with low-dose colchicine or an NSAID, followed by the addition of ULT. The goal of ULT is to reach a serum uric acid (SUA) level ≤ 6.0 mg/dL. Measurements of SUA should be obtained after resolution of an acute attack, then periodically to facilitate titration of the ULT dose to achieve the target SUA level. Studies have confirmed significant reductions in gout attacks among patients who have attained SUA levels ≤ 6.0 mg/dL with ULT. Patient education concerning the disease and its treatment is essential to ensure close adherence with recommended therapies. Patients should also understand that ULT is intended as long-term, and for most patients, lifelong therapy to maximize the prospects for control of the disease. Clinicians should feel confident in making a presumptive diagnosis and choosing a therapeutic regimen for gout while effectively communicating with and educating patients about their disease.

### Safety and efficacy of colchicine in crystal-induced arthritis flare in 54 patients with severe chronic kidney disease [^1cd05f4e]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colchicine has been widely used since its first isolation in 1884. Therapeutic indications are constantly increasing, but its main indication remains the management of crystal-induced arthritis flare. Most of its therapeutic effects would be due to its ability to prevent the assembly of microtubules tubulin, thereby inhibiting their polymerisation and interfering with their cellular functions. In vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that a more important anti-inflammatory mechanism is colchicine's ability to hinder NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3) intracellular transportation and spatial arrangement, thereby inhibiting inflammasome activation within macrophages. Colchicine exhibits complex pharmacokinetics with extensive tissue uptake, especially within erythrocytes. Renal clearance accounts for 10% of total elimination, influenced by factors like cyclosporine, which inhibits tubular secretion through P-glycoprotein. Colchicine metabolism is influenced by hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450 3A4). In patients without comorbidities, the management of gouty arthritis is consensual. According to the 2016 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations for the management of gout, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) and parenteral/oral glucocorticoids are recommended as first-line treatment options for managing flares. In 2010, the Acute Gout Flare Receiving Colchicine Evaluation trial showed, after 24 hours of early management of gout flare, a better safety profile in the 'low-dose' colchicine group (1.8 mg) similar to that of the placebo group than in the 'high dose' colchicine group (4.8 mg), with no difference in efficacy between the two colchicine arms, superior to placebo. In calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition disease (CPPD), the efficacy of colchicine was recently evaluated in the COLCHICORT trial, which showed that colchicine and prednisone were equally effective in the short term.

### Gout and NLRP3 inflammasome biology [^a1a71167]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Once gout flare has been effectively treated in the acute setting, long‐term gout management is also required. For people with frequent gout flares (two or more over 12 months), tophaceous gout, or joint damage related to gout, long‐term urate‐lowering therapy is strongly recommended to maintain a serum urate level below 6 mg/dL and dissolve deposited MSU crystals, which ultimately treats the underlying cause of gout flare and prevents ongoing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In the first months of initiating urate‐lowering therapy, gout flares are common, and these flares can be prevented by low doses of oral colchicine or other anti‐inflammatory medications. Consistent with the central role of IL‐1β in the initiation of acute MSU crystal–induced inflammation, canakinumab significantly prevented recurrent gout flares over 24 weeks in a randomized controlled trial.

### Implementing Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^f597d6f1]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Of pre- and post-implementation cohorts, 93.3% and 98.1%, respectively, received a guideline-recommended flare treatment. After implementation, more patients were prescribed colchicine (62.2% vs 79.6%; aOR 2.30; 95% CI 1.23, 4.31; P = 0.009), corticosteroids (21.0% vs 37.0%; aOR 2.20; 95% CI 1.21, 4.02; P = 0.010) or multiple flare treatments (17.6% vs 45.4%; aOR 4.10; 95% CI 2.20, 7.67; P < 0.001). Use of intra-articular corticosteroids increased modestly from a low baseline (1.7% vs 8.3%; aOR 5.53; 95% CI 1.15, 26.7; P = 0.033). There was no significant difference in the use of NSAIDs (31.9% vs 31.5%; aOR 1.18; 95% CI 0.61, 2.28; P = 0.63).

The proportion of patients initiated and/or up-titrated on ULT prior to discharge increased markedly following implementation, from 17.6% to 62.0% (aOR 7.69; 95% CI 4.12, 14.4; P < 0.001). After implementation, more patients were provided with gout-specific management recommendations on discharge (58.8% vs 86.1%; aOR 4.33; 95% CI 2.21, 8.48; P < 0.001). Documented evidence of disease education provision prior to discharge was low in both cohorts (22.7% vs 22.2%; aOR 1.00; 95% CI 0.53, 1.90; P = 0.99).
