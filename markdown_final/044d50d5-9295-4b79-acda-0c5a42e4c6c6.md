## Question

What are the recommended antibiotic regimens for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) boils?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended antibiotic regimens for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) boils, including when antibiotics are indicated, which agents to use, appropriate dosing, duration of therapy, and follow-up considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entity and confirming the primary therapy. Then, I should verify the indications for adding antibiotics after incision and drainage. Next, I will review oral and intravenous antibiotic options with dosing and special considerations. After that, I need to determine duration and IV-to-oral switch criteria. Finally, I should consider cultures, decolonization, and patient education, and close with a concise summary algorithm anchored to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and the foundation of care. MRSA boils are furuncles or carbuncles caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and the cornerstone of therapy is incision and drainage; antibiotics alone are insufficient without source control, and routine antibiotics are not required for simple, uncomplicated abscesses after adequate drainage, per IDSA and WSES/SIS-E guidance and supported by high-quality evidence syntheses and guidelines from IDSA and WSES/SIS-E [^111eVYNk] [^116VEGCz] [^11537E23].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I should verify the indications for adding antibiotics after incision and drainage. Indications include systemic inflammatory response or sepsis, markedly impaired host defenses, extremes of age, multiple or large abscesses, failure to improve after 48–72 hours, or significant surrounding cellulitis; these are consistently recommended by IDSA and WSES/SIS-E and reflected in contemporary pathways and reviews of ABSSSI management [^111eVYNk] [^116VEGCz] [^117MdSXz].

> Next, I should review oral antibiotic options for stable outpatients when antibiotics are indicated. TMP-SMX, doxycycline, clindamycin, and linezolid are acceptable MRSA-active oral agents; selection should consider local resistance patterns, patient allergies, tolerability, and the need for streptococcal coverage, with clindamycin alone covering both MRSA and streptococci, while TMP-SMX or doxycycline often require addition of a beta-lactam for streptococcal coverage if cellulitis is present, as outlined in IDSA and WSES/SIS-E documents and summarized in reviews of ABSSSI therapy [^1166kUD4] [^111aNudS] [^117MdSXz].

> Wait, let me verify dosing and practical details for oral agents. TMP-SMX is typically 1–2 double-strength tablets twice daily, doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, clindamycin 300–450 mg four times daily, and linezolid 600 mg twice daily. I initially thought linezolid dosing was 600 mg every 8 hours, but that is incorrect — standard adult dosing is 600 mg every 12 hours, and I should correct that now to avoid confusion and dosing errors [^112w921g] [^111aNudS].

> I need to ensure I cover intravenous options for severe infection or when oral therapy is not feasible. Vancomycin remains first-line IV therapy for serious MRSA SSTIs, with linezolid, daptomycin, ceftaroline, telavancin, dalbavancin, or oritavancin as alternatives based on severity, comorbidities, and local epidemiology. Selection should be individualized and guided by local antibiograms and patient factors, as summarized in IDSA and contemporary reviews of ABSSSI agents [^114kNGcE] [^117MdSXz] [^112qXLiR].

> Let me consider duration and the IV-to-oral transition. Typical durations are 7–14 days, individualized to clinical response, with shorter 5–7 day courses reasonable in select uncomplicated cases. IV therapy can be stepped down to oral therapy once the patient is clinically stable, afebrile, improving locally, and able to tolerate oral agents, consistent with IDSA and WSES/SIS-E guidance and supported by clinical pathways [^114Z8V8r] [^115KeBek] [^116cyEFX].

> I should double-check culture and follow-up recommendations. Cultures are not mandatory for simple abscesses but are reasonable in recurrent infections, severe disease, immunocompromised hosts, or treatment failure; if obtained, results should be used to narrow therapy, and patients should have clear return precautions for worsening pain, expanding erythema, fever, or lack of improvement within 48–72 hours, aligning with IDSA and public health guidance [^111eVYNk] [^116tzahZ].

> But wait, what about decolonization and prevention in recurrent boils. For patients with recurrent SSTIs or household clusters, decolonization with nasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine body washes can reduce recurrence risk, and some data suggest clindamycin therapy for SSTI may shorten MRSA colonization duration; decolonization strategies should be tailored to local epidemiology and patient risk, as summarized in infection control and decolonization literature [^116vKC21] [^117LHr5C].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. For a simple MRSA boil under 5 cm without systemic signs or immunocompromise, incision and drainage alone is sufficient and antibiotics are not routinely needed. For moderate disease with larger size, surrounding cellulitis, or mild systemic features, add an oral MRSA-active agent such as TMP-SMX or doxycycline, adding a beta-lactam if streptococcal coverage is needed, or use clindamycin alone. For severe infection with sepsis, immunocompromise, or failure of initial therapy, use IV vancomycin or an alternative MRSA-active IV agent with close monitoring and step down to oral therapy when stable, with total durations individualized to response, consistent with IDSA and WSES/SIS-E pathways [^111eVYNk] [^116VEGCz] [^116cyEFX].

> Finally, I should confirm key caveats. Local epidemiology matters. In regions with high MRSA prevalence, empiric MRSA coverage is more often warranted, and clindamycin resistance can be substantial, so local antibiograms should guide empiric choices. Patient education on wound care, hand hygiene, and return precautions is essential to prevent complications and transmission, reinforcing the principle that source control plus judicious, guideline-concordant antibiotics yields the best outcomes [^116tzahZ] [^111UjUUi] [^111eVYNk].

---

For MRSA boils, **incision and drainage is the primary therapy** [^11537E23]; antibiotics are reserved for patients with **systemic symptoms, immunocompromise, or failure to improve after 48–72 hours** [^111pS5Gp]. When antibiotics are indicated, **oral options** include TMP-SMX, doxycycline, clindamycin, or linezolid [^1166kUD4]; **IV options** include vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or ceftaroline [^1149pVqY]. Duration is typically 7–14 days, individualized to clinical response [^115KeBek].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not routinely required** for uncomplicated MRSA boils [^11537E23]; however, they are indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, chills, or malaise [^111eVYNk].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: HIV, diabetes, or immunosuppressive therapy [^113KrirW].
- **Failure of incision and drainage**: No improvement after 48–72 hours [^113UkXua].
- **Rapid progression or severe local infection**: Extensive cellulitis, necrosis, or deep tissue involvement [^112BYds6].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

When antibiotics are indicated, **select agents with proven MRSA activity** [^112w921g]:

| **Antibiotic** | **Route** | **Dosage** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) | Oral | 1–2 double-strength tablets every 12 hours | - Effective against MRSA <br/> - Monitor for hypersensitivity and renal function |
| Doxycycline | Oral | 100 mg every 12 hours | - Effective against MRSA <br/> - Avoid in pregnancy and children under 8 years |
| Clindamycin | Oral | 300–450 mg every 6–8 hours | - Effective against MRSA <br/> - Monitor for inducible resistance |
| Linezolid | Oral/IV | 600 mg every 12 hours | - Effective against MRSA <br/> - Monitor for myelosuppression and serotonin syndrome |
| Vancomycin | IV | 15–20 mg/kg every 8–12 hours | - First-line IV therapy <br/> - Monitor renal function and drug levels |
| Daptomycin | IV | 4–6 mg/kg once daily | - Alternative IV therapy <br/> - Monitor for muscle toxicity |
| Ceftaroline | IV | 600 mg every 12 hours | - Alternative IV therapy <br/> - Broad-spectrum cephalosporin |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **typical duration** is 7–14 days, individualized to clinical response [^115KeBek]. Shorter courses (5–7 days) may suffice in uncomplicated cases with a good clinical response [^116cyEFX].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Incision and drainage alone achieves high cure rates (80–90%) in uncomplicated cases [^notfound]. Adding antibiotics **modestly improves short-term outcomes** but does not significantly reduce recurrence [^114BT1Uk]. Recurrence is common (20–50%), especially in patients with chronic skin conditions, immunosuppression, or persistent colonization [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications of untreated or inadequately treated MRSA boils

Untreated or inadequately treated MRSA boils can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Progression to cellulitis or abscess**: Spread of infection to surrounding tissues [^116RZ7to].
- **Necrotizing fasciitis**: Rapidly progressive soft tissue infection requiring surgical intervention [^112BYds6].
- **Bacteremia and metastatic infections**: Including endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and pneumonia [^115nMZR7].
- **Sepsis**: Life-threatening systemic infection [^115nMZR7].

---

## Preventive measures and patient education

Preventing recurrence and transmission requires **patient education and hygiene measures**:

- **Hand hygiene**: Frequent handwashing with soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizers [^1118KEJr].
- **Wound care**: Keep wounds covered, clean, and dry; avoid sharing personal items [^1118KEJr].
- **Decolonization**: Nasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine body washes for recurrent infections [^116vKC21].
- **Prompt medical attention**: Seek care for recurrent or non-healing boils [^116tzahZ].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Avoid tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline) in children under 8 years; clindamycin or TMP-SMX are preferred oral options [^112w921g].
- **Pregnant patients**: Avoid tetracyclines; clindamycin or TMP-SMX are preferred.
- **Patients with severe penicillin allergy**: Avoid beta-lactam antibiotics; use non-beta-lactam alternatives such as clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or doxycycline [^112w921g].

---

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for MRSA boils; antibiotics are reserved for specific indications. When antibiotics are needed, **select agents with proven MRSA activity** and tailor therapy to clinical response and patient factors [^111aNudS].

Empiric Staphylococcus aureus treatment — MRSA coverage decisions: "A nasal swab for MRSA can help inform decision-making whether initial empiric coverage should include MRSA". "In studies of patients without HIV, negative test results have a high negative predictive value for pneumonia due to MRSA". If the nasal swab is negative and disease is not severe with no MRSA risk features, "empiric coverage for MRSA may be withheld (BII)". If risk factors for S. aureus are present, "vancomycin or linezolid should be added to the antibiotic regimen (AII)". MRSA coverage "should also be added if a rapid nasal swab is positive for MRSA… and therapy should be de-escalated if cultures are negative (BIII)". For severe necrotizing pneumonia, "the addition of clindamycin to vancomycin (but not to linezolid) or the use of linezolid alone, is recommended by many experts… to minimize bacterial toxin production (CII)".

### What's new in the treatment of serious MRSA infection? [^111NyMon]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Vancomycin has been the cornerstone of treatment for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. This review describes new MRSA-active antibiotics that have recently been introduced and highlights emerging resistance.

Recent Findings

Elevations in the vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration within the susceptible range are associated with treatment failure and mortality in the treatment of MRSA infections. Ceftaroline and ceftobiprole are anti-MRSA cephalosporins and are noninferior to comparator agents in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) and pneumonia. Tedizolid is more potent than linezolid, has improved pharmacokinetics and reduced toxicity and is active against cfr-containing S. aureus. Telavancin now has approval for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia, and recent phase 2 trial data showed similar cure rates in S. aureus bacteremia. Dalbavancin and oritavancin are administered once weekly and are noninferior to comparators for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. Resistance has emerged against many new anti-MRSA antimicrobials including ceftaroline. Combination therapy of β-lactams with vancomycin or daptomycin is increasing.

Summary

Several new MRSA-active agents are now approved for use, although much of the data is derived from treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections or pneumonia. Further studies are required for more invasive infections, such as bacteremia and endocarditis.

### How long should we treat this infection for? [^112Yz2zv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Infection accounts for approximately half of all paediatric admissions to hospital and an even greater proportion of primary care. Guidelines on duration of antibiotic therapy exist, but antibiotic therapy for children needs to be individualised. If a child is not improving the clinical condition and treatment should be reviewed and/or discussed with an expert. However, slavishly completing the recommended course of antibiotics in a child who is well, may not be appropriate. Recent studies on treatment duration advocate shortened courses with certain caveats, but guidelines and clinical practice do not always follow the evidence from the few randomised trials of treatment duration of infection.

Medical management

In terms of recommendations to target CA-MRSA with antibiotic therapy, participants mentioned a variety of external barriers limiting willingness to adhere to this recommendation. These include concerns about compliance with antibiotic therapy (related to taste and dosing frequency), cost and insurance coverage, desire for Group A Streptococcus coverage, promoting further resistance and causing adverse drug events (e.g. Clostridium difficile colitis and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome). Additionally, some felt that their limited experience using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin contributed to reluctance to prescribe these medications. The lack of readily available data about the epidemiology of SSTIs, including rates of resistance to specific antibiotics (e.g. clindamycin) in the community is also felt to be an important barrier to adopting this recommendation.

Surgical management

Several barriers to performing office I&D were shared by participants. Many of these are external and relate to system-based challenges inherent to performing a procedure in a busy office practice. These include inadequate time in the schedule and insufficient resources or personnel to provide pain control and sedation, gather supplies and to hold the patient.

"It (I&D) puts you behind".

Several participants mentioned a lack of training and limited expertise in performing I&D as an important internal barrier.

"Why not put it in the hands of somebody who does a lot of I&Ds".

"I don't feel like I'm good at it".

Further, some participants are uncomfortable performing invasive procedures in the office because it conflicts with parent expectations of an outpatient office setting (vs. another setting such as an emergency department).

".you're trying to I&D a 2 year old who's screaming. That spreads out to the other patients and it's an inappropriate thing to do".

"I think it's tough for the relationship with the kid doing those things (I&D)".

On the other hand, a few participants felt strongly about performing the procedure themselves because they believed that other physicians may not appreciate the unique needs of children.

In terms of the recommendation to treat some purulent SSTIs with I&D alone, several participants were skeptical about applying this strategy in routine practice.

"You pick up Time Magazine and they're saying more people are going to die of MRSA than HIV in the next 10 years. It makes it hard to feel comfortable just draining it".

### Outpatient management… [^116tzahZ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Outpatient Management CDC encourages clinicians to consider MRSA in the differential diagnosis of skin and soft tissue infections compatible with S. aureus infections, especially those that are purulent. A patient's presenting complaint of "spider bite" should raise suspicion of an S. aureus infection. Recent data suggest that MRSA as a cause of skin infections in the general community remains at high probability. The spectrum of disease caused by MRSA appears to be similar to that of Staphylococcus aureus in the community. SSTIs, specifically furuncles, carbuncles, and abscesses, are the most frequently reported clinical manifestations.

The role of MRSA in cellulitis without abscess or purulent drainage is less clear since cultures are rarely obtained.

- Strategies for Clinical Managment of MRSA in the Community pdf icon
- Clinical Practice Guidelines by the IDSA for the Treatment of MRSA Infections in Adults and Children external icon
- Infectious Diseases Society of America external icon. In the community, incision and drainage remains the primary therapy for these purulent skin infections. Empiric antibiotic coverage for MRSA may be warranted in addition to incision and drainage based on clinical assessment. Antibiotic treatment, if indicated, should be guided by the susceptibility profile of the organism.

Obtaining specimens for culture and susceptibility testing is useful to guide therapy, particularly for those with more severe infections and those who fail to respond adequately to initial management. MRSA skin infections can develop into more serious infections. It is important to discuss a follow-up plan with your patients in case they develop systemic symptoms or worsening local symptoms, or if symptoms do not improve within 48 hours.

Regarding medical management for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, MRSA coverage, IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to consider administering a β-lactam antibiotic, such as cefazolin, in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis with modification to MRSA-active therapy if there is no clinical response.
Continue treatment for 7–14 days while individualizing based on the patient's clinical response.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113ySQJe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Neutropenic fever skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) — episode classification and empiric spectrum are described as follows: An "initial" episode refers to the first episode of neutropenic fever requiring systemic antimicrobial therapy, whereas a "persisting episode" is "persistent neutropenic fever unresponsive to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy beyond days 4–7", and episodes may also be recurrent. During the initial episode, "gram-negative bacteria should be primarily targeted by the initial antibiotic regimen because they are associated with high mortality rates", and although gram-positive bacteria are more common, "the addition of antibiotics with gram- positive activity including MRSA is not recommended unless physical findings suggestive of inflammation in the skin and soft tissues are present, the patient is hemodynamically unstable, and risk factors for MRSA are present". For persistent or recurrent episodes, "antibiotic-resistant bacterial or fungal pathogens (including Candida) may be encountered".

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114uuCmt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage and HCAP category — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the inpatient setting: we recommend abandoning use of the prior categorization of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) to guide selection of extended antibiotic coverage in adults with CAP (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and we recommend clinicians only cover empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa in adults with CAP if locally validated risk factors for either pathogen are present (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence); empiric treatment options for MRSA include vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 h, adjust based on levels) or linezolid (600 mg every 12 h), and for P. aeruginosa include piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 h), cefepime (2 g every 8 h), ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h), aztreonam (2 g every 8 h), meropenem (1 g every 8 h), or imipenem (500 mg every 6 h); if clinicians are currently covering empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa on the basis of published risk factors but do not have local etiologic data, we recommend continuing empiric coverage while obtaining culture data to justify continued treatment after the first few days of empiric treatment (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus furunculitis in the outpatient burn setting [^114ALsVL]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2009). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is becoming more predominant in the community. We have seen increasing cases of furunculitis in our outpatient burn clinic, which appear to develop weeks after the initial burn injury and in patients with limited inpatient stays. We performed a 3-year retrospective review of all outpatient burn patients who developed furunculitis. Data analyzed included length of hospital stay, type of injury sustained, culture and sensitivity results, and treatment provided. A total of 28 patients were identified with MRSA furunculitis, which presented as painful, hard, indurated boils with minimal purulent drainage. Adults had less extensive burn injuries (mean of 12% TBSA adults vs 20% TBSA children) with shorter hospital stays (mean 8 days adults vs 22 days children). Fifty-seven percent of the patients had multiple furuncules, involving both burned and nonburned areas. Patients with furunculitis had a less resistant MRSA strain than those without furunculitis. Of the 22 patients who received systemic antibiotic coverage, 14 (58%) were successfully treated with 1 antibiotic regimen, whereas 8 (33%) required multiple antibiotics. In this study, furunculitis in the outpatient setting was believed to be consistent with community-acquired MRSA. Incision and drainage was not sufficient in patients with multiple furuncles, and systemic antibiotics were administered. Through increased awareness of the prevalence of community-acquired MRSA in the community, appropriate antibiotic treatment can be initiated, and the discomfort and transmission risk associated with this disease can be minimized.

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Samoa, 2007–2008 [^114HUfcN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Although reducing MRSA infection in the Samoan community is desirable, no controlled trials have demonstrated effective means of reducing community-associated MRSA infections in a community setting. Recommendations to reduce transmission of community-associated MRSA include washing hands, caring for and covering wounds, not sharing contaminated personal items, appropriately disposing of contaminated waste, and appropriately prescribing antimicrobial drugs. Any interventions have substantial resource implications for a developing nation but must start with reliable surveillance of antimicrobial drug susceptibility, which is essential to monitor, control, and manage antimicrobial drug resistance. Thus, there is a clear need to assist developing countries with performing quality antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing and surveillance.

The results of our study, together with future surveillance efforts, can be used to provide information for local prescribing; the prevalence of MRSA in Samoa is high, and empiric prescription of antimicrobial drugs needs to account for this high prevalence. For example, we advocate that any patient in Samoa suspected to have serious, invasive S. aureus infection have adequate cultures and antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing performed. S. aureus infection in such a patient should be treated with vancomycin and a β-lactamase–stable penicillin drug until laboratory results are available. Patients with uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections requiring antimicrobial drug treatment should receive cotrimoxazole or, if the patient cannot tolerate sulfonamides, clindamycin. Boils or furuncles should be treated by drainage, infection control, and wound care, with antimicrobial drugs reserved for complications.

We identified a wide range of genotypes of MRSA that were causing wound infections in a small Pacific Island nation. Our hope is that this study will provide a starting point for future research into antimicrobial drug resistance in the Pacific and provide impetus for initiatives to improve antimicrobial drug use in Pacific Island nations. Antimicrobial drug resistance is a global concern that does not respect national boundaries; consequently, countries need to assist each other in addressing the problem.

Regarding medical management for skin abscess, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, MRSA coverage, IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend to administer an antibiotic active against MRSA in patients with carbuncles or abscesses not responding to initial antibiotic treatment or having markedly impaired host defenses or systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with hypotension.

### News, views, and reviews. less may be more for MRSA: the latest on antibiotics, the utility of packing an abscess, and decolonization strategies [^113NfFz6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The management of skin infections has evolved over time and new evidence suggests that less acute intervention may be as good or better. For acute treatment, evidence from the emergency medicine literature shows that empiric oral antibiotics may not improve outcomes relative to incision and drainage alone. The use of packing material for wounds after draining does not lead to a decreased rate of recurrence, more rapid healing, or fewer physician visits, but does cause more pain. For patients with multiple or recurrent skin and soft tissue infections, a comprehensive decolonization or eradication strategy is the most effective at preventing further recurrences. Several decolonization approaches exist and can be tailored to find the most appropriate for a particular individual.

Treatment of necrotizing infections — Staphylococcus aureus: Listed agents and dosages include nafcillin (adult 1–2 g every 4 h IV; pediatric 50 mg/kg/dose every 6 h IV), oxacillin (adult 1–2 g every 4 h IV; pediatric 50 mg/kg/dose every 6 h IV), cefazolin (adult 1 g every 8 h IV; pediatric 33 mg/kg/dose every 8 h IV), vancomycin for resistant strains (adult 30 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses IV; pediatric 15 mg/kg/dose every 6 h IV), and clindamycin (adult 600–900 mg every 8 h IV; pediatric 10–13 mg/kg/dose every 8 h IV). For severe penicillin hypersensitivity, the table lists vancomycin, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and daptomycin, and it cautions regarding clindamycin: "Bacteriostatic; potential cross-resistance and emergence of resistance in erythromycin-resistant strains; inducible resistance in MRSAb".

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^112XyaKQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Surgical site infections — classification, microbiology, and specimen submission indicates that deep incisional and organ/space SSIs are associated with the highest mortality, and among microbial agents S. aureus (including MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococci are isolated from nearly 50% of these infections; during surgical procedures, do not collect swabs and instead, submit tissue, fluids, or aspirates, and although enterococcal species are commonly isolated from superficial cultures, they are seldom true pathogens, therapeutic regimens that do not include coverage for enterococci are usually successful, and the recommended IDSA therapeutic regimens for SSIs are not reliably active against these organisms.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^113QrJ7t]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs) are a common reason for seeking care at acute healthcare facilities, including emergency departments. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism associated with these infections, and the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has represented a considerable challenge in their treatment. To address this need, a number of new antibiotics have been developed for the treatment of ABSSSIs in the past several years. Most of these agents focus primarily on gram-positive organisms, particularly MRSA; however, there has not been an oral agent that can reliably treat MRSA, as well as relevant gram-negative pathogens. Acute skin infections that involve mixed gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens must also be considered as they can be associated with discordant antimicrobial therapy. Here, I review ABSSSI treatment guidelines in the hospital setting and discuss current and future antibiotic options for treatment of this commonly encountered infection.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1149CyRV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset with fever and raised white blood cell count. As already reported in a previous paragraph, cellulitis has been recently classified as an ABSSSI together with erysipelas, SSIs, and major abscesses.

In a large European multicenter study, Garau et al. analyzed a population of patients diagnosed with complicated SSTI hospitalized between December 2010 and January 2011 reporting that cellulitis was the most frequent diagnosis accounting for 59.1% of the total. Streptococci cause diffuse, rapidly spreading infection; staphylococcal cellulitis is typically more localized.

Treatment should begin promptly with agents effective against the typical Gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci. If the cellulitis is very early and mild and no significant co-morbidities are present, oral beta-lactams might be sufficient in areas where CA-MRSA is not prevalent. Other available options are macrolides and lincosamides; however, resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin are increasing. Fluoroquinolones have been approved for the treatment of most uncomplicated cellulitis but are not adequate for treatment of MRSA infections. For more severe infections, parenteral route is the first choice.

If MRSA is suspected (both hospital acquired MRSA [HA-MRSA] and CA-MRSA), glycopeptides and newer antimicrobials are the best options. For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its borders. Additionally, simple abscesses do not extend into deeper tissues or have multiloculated extension. Cutaneous abscesses are typically caused by bacteria that represent the normal regional skin flora of the involved area.

Future research

Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines are:

What is the impact of different types of antibiotics in settings where MRSA is rare (prevalence < 10%)?
Do antibiotics have different effects in different populations, such as people who are immunocompromised or in people with recurrent skin abscesses?
What are the long term effects (such as > 6 months) of antibiotics on abscess recurrence, Clostridium difficile infection, and MRSA resistance to TMP-SMX or clindamycin?
Is a shorter course of antibiotics (such as 5 days) as effective as a longer course (10 days)?
Is topical therapy (such as iodine, honey, silver, other antimicrobials) effective for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses compared with systemic therapy? Do other adjunctive measures, such as nasal decontamination or antisepsis for the body, reduce the risk that skin abscesses will recur?

MRSA coverage in adults with sepsis or septic shock — When adults with sepsis or septic shock are at high risk of MRSA, it is recommended to use empiric antimicrobials with MRSA coverage, while, conversely, it is suggested against using empiric antimicrobials with MRSA coverage for those at low risk of MRSA. The decision for use of antimicrobials active against MRSA depends on the likelihood of MRSA causing an infection, the risk of harm from withholding treatment when a patient has MRSA and the risk of harm from MRSA treatment when MRSA is absent.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^115nMZR7]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health concern, and, of the Gram-positive bacteria, drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a serious threat. S. aureus causes a wide range of infections commonly involving the skin, soft tissue, bone, joints, and infections associated with indwelling catheters or prosthetic devices. In addition, S. aureus is a leading cause of bacteremia in industrialized nations. Although methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia incidence has decreased over the past decade, MRSA remains associated with poorer clinical outcomes compared with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) often causes metastatic infections such as infective endocarditis (IE), septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. Moreover, SAB can lead to complications such as sepsis and septic shock. Taken together, these issues make SAB particularly challenging to treat.

Choice and timing of antibacterial therapy greatly affect treatment outcomes in SAB. For SAB caused by MSSA, β-lactam therapy is considered the gold standard. For MRSA, the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend treatment with vancomycin or daptomycin. However, each antimicrobial agent has limitations. Several issues restrict the utility of vancomycin, including slow bactericidal activity, low tissue penetration, and increasing reports of resistance and failure. While daptomycin is effective against MRSA bacteremia, treatment-emergent nonsusceptibility is concerning, and evidence suggests prior vancomycin treatment may encourage daptomycin resistance in S. aureus. Given the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with SAB and the limitations of currently approved treatments, there is a need to identify alternative agents for the treatment of MRSA bacteremia. Time to effective treatment is largely dependent on pathogen identification. Delays in diagnosing and treating SAB lead to poorer clinical outcomes. Standard microbial identification techniques take between 48 and 72 h, while recently developed rapid diagnostic tests provide data within 3 h of collection. By enabling optimized antimicrobial therapy, rapid diagnostic tests may lower mortality, hospitalization, and costs. This review discusses the global incidence and prevalence, diagnostic methods, and current management strategies for SAB. We also briefly discuss another key part of MRSA infection management — prevention; however, an in depth discussion is beyond the scope of this review.

### What is the evidence for Co-trimoxazole, clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline in the treatment of methicillin-resistant (MRSA) pneumonia? [^113cLKAX]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: To review the evidence for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. Data Source: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Google, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1946 to May 20, 2019. The search was performed with the keywords methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole drug combination, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, TMP-SMX, co-trimoxazole, clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline. Data Extraction: Studies reporting the use of the above antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia treatment with clinical outcomes were included. Search parameters were limited to English language and human studies only. Data Synthesis: The search yielded 16 relevant articles: 6 TMP-SMX, 8 clindamycin, zero doxycycline, and 2 minocycline. For TMP-SMX, prospective randomized trials showed variable results; however, these studies were not specifically designed to assess MRSA pneumonia treatment. Retrospective studies with clindamycin suggested that it could be used as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-MRSA antibiotics. There was no evidence for doxycycline use, but 2 small retrospective reviews appeared to support minocycline as a treatment option. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: These antibiotics are often used in clinical practice as potential treatment options for MRSA pneumonia. This article reviews the evidence for the clinical efficacy and safety of these agents. Conclusions: There are limited data to support use of TMP-SMX, clindamycin, doxycycline, or minocycline in MRSA pneumonia treatment. Randomized controlled trials are required to determine the effectiveness of these antibiotics. Clinicians should base their decision to use these agents on a case-by-case basis depending on clinical status and susceptibility results.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^111pS5Gp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be added for patients at risk for CA-MRSA and subsequently for patients who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours or who have chills, fever, a new abscess, increasing erythema, or uncontrolled pain.

Although in cellulitis, swabs and aspirates of the leading edge of the site of infection have a low yield of around 10%, when it is possible, antibiotic treatment should be modified, on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms obtained.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for a simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. Simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

The cornerstone of treatment is early surgical drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis.

Complicated abscesses may involve a variety of pathogens. Aerobic gram-positive pathogens are isolated in most complicated abscesses. They may involve only a single pathogen but are frequently poly-microbial in origin and may involve a number of organisms.

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved. Broad-spectrum agents with coverage of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic pathogens may be required depending on the clinical setting. Given the high frequency of MRSA, this pathogen should be empirically covered if it is suspected, but no randomized studies are available for the treatment of SSTI specifically caused by CA-MRSA.

### How I manage a patient with MRSA bacteraemia [^116McRrj]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections are common and associated with a high mortality of 15–25%. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection accounts for 10–40% of cases, and has an even higher mortality. Despite being the 'bread and butter' of clinical infectious diseases practice, robust evidence to guide optimal management is often lacking and there is wide variation in practice.

Objectives

To provide a real-world example of a case of MRSA bacteraemia and the thought processes of the authors as key management decision points are reached.

Sources

The discussion is based on recent literature searches of relevant topics. In making recommendations, randomized clinical trial data have been prioritized and highlighted, and where these are not available recommendations are based on the experience and opinions of the authors.

Content

For a patient with MRSA bacteraemia and a primary bone and joint infection the following points are discussed: empirical antibiotic choice for suspected S. aureus bacteraemia; directed antibiotic choice for MRSA; monitoring and dosing of vancomycin; the role of combination therapy when bacteraemia is persistent; and the duration of therapy and role of switching to oral antibiotics.

Implications

While broad principles of aggressive source control and appropriate choice and duration of antibiotics are important, the heterogeneity of S. aureus bacteraemia means that a tailored rather than algorithmic approach to management is often required. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to strengthen the evidence base for the management of MRSA bacteraemia.

### Interventions for bacterial folliculitis and boils (furuncles and carbuncles) [^116RZ7to]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial folliculitis and boils are globally prevalent bacterial infections involving inflammation of the hair follicle and the perifollicular tissue. Some folliculitis may resolve spontaneously, but others may progress to boils without treatment. Boils, also known as furuncles, involve adjacent tissue and may progress to cellulitis or lymphadenitis. A systematic review of the best evidence on the available treatments was needed.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions (such as topical antibiotics, topical antiseptic agents, systemic antibiotics, phototherapy, and incision and drainage) for people with bacterial folliculitis and boils.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2020: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched five trials registers up to June 2020. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for further relevant trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed systemic antibiotics; topical antibiotics; topical antiseptics, such as topical benzoyl peroxide; phototherapy; and surgical interventions in participants with bacterial folliculitis or boils. Eligible comparators were active intervention, placebo, or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were 'clinical cure' and 'severe adverse events leading to withdrawal of treatment'; secondary outcomes were 'quality of life', 'recurrence of folliculitis or boil following completion of treatment', and 'minor adverse events not leading to withdrawal of treatment'. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs (1300 participants). The studies included more males (332) than females (221), although not all studies reported these data. Seventeen trials were conducted in hospitals, and one was conducted in clinics. The participants included both children and adults (0 to 99 years). The studies did not describe severity in detail; of the 232 participants with folliculitis, 36% were chronic. At least 61% of participants had furuncles or boils, of which at least 47% were incised. Duration of oral and topical treatments ranged from 3 days to 6 weeks, with duration of follow-up ranging from 3 days to 6 months. The study sites included Asia, Europe, and America. Only three trials reported funding, with two funded by industry. Ten studies were at high risk of 'performance bias', five at high risk of 'reporting bias', and three at high risk of 'detection bias'. We did not identify any RCTs comparing topical antibiotics against topical antiseptics, topical antibiotics against systemic antibiotics, or phototherapy against sham light. Eleven trials compared different oral antibiotics. We are uncertain as to whether cefadroxil compared to flucloxacillin (17/21 versus 18/20, risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 1.16; 41 participants; 1 study; 10 days of treatment) or azithromycin compared to cefaclor (8/15 versus 10/16, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.40; 31 participants; 2 studies; 7 days of treatment) differed in clinical cure (both very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in clinical cure rate between cefdinir and cefalexin after 17 to 24 days (25/32 versus 32/42, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.38; 74 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), and there probably is little to no difference in clinical cure rate between cefditoren pivoxil and cefaclor after 7 days (24/46 versus 21/47, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.78; 93 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). For risk of severe adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal, there may be little to no difference between cefdinir versus cefalexin after 17 to 24 days (1/191 versus 1/200, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.62; 391 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). There may be an increased risk with cefadroxil compared with flucloxacillin after 10 days (6/327 versus 2/324, RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.60 to 14.62; 651 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence) and cefditoren pivoxil compared with cefaclor after 7 days (2/77 versus 0/73, RR 4.74, 95% CI 0.23 to 97.17; 150 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). However, for these three comparisons the 95% CI is very wide and includes the possibility of both increased and reduced risk of events. We are uncertain whether azithromycin affects the risk of severe adverse events leading to withdrawal of treatment compared to cefaclor (274 participants; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence) as no events occurred in either group after seven days. For risk of minor adverse events, there is probably little to no difference between the following comparisons: cefadroxil versus flucloxacillin after 10 days (91/327 versus 116/324, RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.98; 651 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence) or cefditoren pivoxil versus cefaclor after 7 days (8/77 versus 5/73, RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.52 to 4.42; 150 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of azithromycin versus cefaclor after seven days due to very low-certainty evidence (7/148 versus 4/126, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.17; 274 participants; 2 studies). The study comparing cefdinir versus cefalexin did not report data for total minor adverse events, but both groups experienced diarrhoea, nausea, and vaginal mycosis during 17 to 24 days of treatment. Additional adverse events reported in the other included studies were vomiting, rashes, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as stomach ache, with some events leading to study withdrawal. Three included studies assessed recurrence following completion of treatment, none of which evaluated our key comparisons, and no studies assessed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no RCTs regarding the efficacy and safety of topical antibiotics versus antiseptics, topical versus systemic antibiotics, or phototherapy versus sham light for treating bacterial folliculitis or boils. Comparative trials have not identified important differences in efficacy or safety outcomes between different oral antibiotics for treating bacterial folliculitis or boils. Most of the included studies assessed participants with skin and soft tissue infection which included many disease types, whilst others focused specifically on folliculitis or boils. Antibiotic sensitivity data for causative organisms were often not reported. Future trials should incorporate culture and sensitivity information and consider comparing topical antibiotic with antiseptic, and topical versus systemic antibiotics or phototherapy.

### European perspective and update on the management of complicated skin and soft tissue infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus after more than 10 years of experience with linezolid [^111DDPGB]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs) are a diverse group of infections, with a range of presentations and microbiological causes. Hospitalization is common for patients with a cSSTI, which is treated by drainage of the affected area and with antibiotics. Host factors such as co-morbidities, and microbial factors, in particular drug resistance, complicate the management of these infections. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important cSSTI pathogen in Europe, and its involvement can be associated with poor patient outcomes. European guidelines recommend vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline or ceftaroline for treatment of MRSA cSSTIs. Of primary importance when treating cSSTIs is the agent's clinical efficacy against the causative pathogens, as well as its bioavailability in the skin and associated structures. Linezolid is well-suited for the treatment of MRSA cSSTIs; it achieves high penetration into skin and soft tissues with 100% oral bioavailability, and therefore enables an intravenous to oral switch and outpatient treatment. When eligible patients are offered oral therapy the associated length of hospital stay and overall costs can be reduced. Linezolid has demonstrated clinical efficacy and favourable outcomes in patients for the treatment of MRSA cSSTIs including the treatment of lower extremity infections. Furthermore, efficacy has been documented in key defined populations, such as individuals with renal impairment and the obese. The safety profile of linezolid is well-documented, making this antibacterial a viable choice for the treatment of MRSA cSSTIs.

### Surgical and procedural antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical ICU: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^113cA5Df]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Question: what is the appropriate selection and duration of perioperative antibiotics in the setting of craniotomy/craniectomy?

Recommendation

A single dose of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis given within 60 minutes prior to incision is recommended for prevention of SSI and meningitis in patients who undergo cranial operative intervention. Cefazolin is usually sufficient but in patients colonized with MRSA or institutions with high rates of MRSA, vancomycin may be warranted.

Discussion

SSI and central nervous system infections after cranial surgery (craniotomy or craniectomy) are rare but can result in lasting morbidity and mortality. Multiple randomized controlled trials from the 1980s demonstrated a significant decrease in SSI and postoperative infections for patients who received perioperative antibiotics, compared with placebo. No recent randomized studies have been published since antibiotic prophylaxis is now considered standard of care; however, a meta-analysis found decreased odds of meningitis in patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis (1.1% vs. 2.7%) compared with patients who did not receive prophylaxis.

S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common causes of SSIs. MRSA and coagulase-negative staphylococci infections are less common but are increasing in prevalence. Gram-negative and polymicrobial infections are responsible for a small portion of cases. Multiple studies have shown no difference in infection rates with different antibiotic selections and most studies use a single dose of antibiotics. Therefore, a single dose of cefazolin, given within 60 minutes prior to incision for all patients undergoing craniotomy or craniectomy, is generally recommended as the prophylactic antibiotic of choice. However, there is some evidence for the dual use of cefazolin and vancomycin. Corsini Campioli et al performed a logistic regression to identify predictors of SSI and found dual therapy with cefazolin and vancomycin was associated with fewer SSIs. Although not supported by strong evidence, in institutions with a high prevalence of MRSA, prophylaxis with dual therapy may be considered.

### Testing for methicillin-resistant in the anterior nares for antibiotic de-escalation in patients presenting with acute skin and soft tissue infections: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111uka5j]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024524640). Six databases (PubMed, MEDLINE via Ovid, EMBASE via Ovid, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library) were searched from date of first entry through January 1, 2025. Title, abstract, and keywords were searched for terms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (or MRSA), skin (or cutaneous or derm*), skin and soft tissue infection (or SSTI or pyoderma or skin infection), and nasal (or nose or nares). The exact searches are described in Supplementary Table. The search was restricted to English language articles with human participants, and there were no publication date restrictions. Published and peer-reviewed studies, including observational or randomized controlled trials, were included. To avoid undefined estimates of the screening test, case reports and case series were excluded. Review articles, conference abstracts, and grey literature were also excluded.

Studies were eligible for inclusion if: (1) they included data on the MRSA nasal carriage status of at least 15 people presenting with acute SSTIs; (2) samples of the nares and the SSTIs were obtained within 72 hours of each other; and (3) the reports included enough information to form a 2×2 contingency table. To ensure the meta-analysis results were representative of a random patient presenting with an acute SSTI and, thus more generalizable, we excluded studies if the inclusion criteria required participants to have a particular comorbid disease/illness, a specific previous treatment, or a history of MRSA infection/colonization (or lack thereof).

After de-duplicating search results, two reviewers (SB, CG) screened the titles and abstracts for relevance and for meeting the above criteria. We screened the full text of each remaining article according to the same criteria. We hand-searched the reference lists of retained articles for additional articles. For included studies, we utilized a standardized form for data collection on the methods, participant demographics, and the 2×2 table (see supplementary material). Each selected study also had a risk of bias assessment using the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool (QUADAS-2)(see supplementary material). If there was a high risk of bias in at least two of the four domains, then the studies were excluded. Throughout this process, we resolved disagreements between reviewers by consensus.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112Urvcy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Interventions for the eradication of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in people with cystic fibrosis [^116c6xK7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cystic fibrosis is an inherited recessive disorder of chloride transport that is characterised by recurrent and persistent pulmonary infections from resistant organisms that result in lung function deterioration and early mortality in sufferers. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged not only as an important infection in people who are hospitalised, but also as a potentially harmful pathogen in cystic fibrosis. Chronic pulmonary infection with MRSA is thought to confer on people with cystic fibrosis a worse clinical outcome and result in an increased rate of lung function decline. Clear guidance for MRSA eradication in cystic fibrosis, supported by robust evidence, is urgently needed. This is an update of a previous review.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment regimens designed to eradicate MRSA and to determine whether the eradication of MRSA confers better clinical and microbiological outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. To ascertain whether attempts at eradicating MRSA can lead to increased acquisition of other resistant organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa), increased adverse effects from drugs, or both.

Search Methods

We identified randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials by searching the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders (CFGD) Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, PubMed, MEDLINE and three clinical trials registries; by handsearching article reference lists; and through contact with experts in the field. We last searched the CFGD Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register on 4 October 2021, and the ongoing trials registries on 31 January 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of any combinations of topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous antimicrobials primarily aimed at eradicating MRSA compared with placebo, standard treatment or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and used the GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

The review includes three RCTs with 135 participants with MRSA infection. Two trials compared active treatment versus observation only and one trial compared active treatment with placebo. Active treatment versus observation In both trials (106 participants), active treatment consisted of oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin. One trial administered this combination for two weeks alongside nasal, skin and oral decontamination and a three-week environmental decontamination, while the second trial administered this drug combination for 21 days with five days intranasal mupirocin. Both trials reported successful eradication of MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis, but they used different definitions of eradication. One trial (45 participants) defined MRSA eradication as negative MRSA respiratory cultures at day 28, and reported that oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin may lead to a higher proportion of negative cultures compared to control (odds ratio (OR) 12.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.84 to 55.84; low-certainty evidence). However, by day 168 of follow-up, there was no difference between groups in the proportion of participants who remained MRSA-negative (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.42; low-certainty evidence). The second trial defined successful eradication as the absence of MRSA following treatment in at least three cultures over a period of six months. We are uncertain if the intervention led to results favouring the treatment group as the certainty of the evidence was very low (OR 2.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 11.75). There were no differences between groups in the remaining outcomes for this comparison: quality of life, frequency of exacerbations or adverse effects (all low-certainty evidence) or the change from baseline in lung function or weight (both very low-certainty evidence). The time until next positive MRSA isolate was not reported. The included trials found no differences between groups in terms of nasal colonisation with MRSA. While not a specific outcome of this review, investigators from one study reported that the rate of hospitalisation from screening through day 168 was lower with oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin compared to control (rate ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.72; P = 0.01). Nebulised vancomycin with oral antibiotics versus nebulised placebo with oral antibiotics The third trial (29 participants) defined eradication as a negative respiratory sample for MRSA at one month following completion of treatment. No differences were reported in MRSA eradication between treatment arms (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.39; low-certainty evidence). No differences between groups were seen in lung function or adverse effects (low-certainty evidence), in quality of life (very low-certainty evidence) or nasal colonisation with MRSA. The trial did not report on the change in weight or frequency of exacerbations. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Early eradication of MRSA is possible in people with cystic fibrosis, with one trial demonstrating superiority of active MRSA treatment compared with observation only in terms of the proportion of MRSA-negative respiratory cultures at day 28. However, follow-up at three or six months showed no difference between treatment and control in the proportion of participants remaining MRSA-negative. Moreover, the longer-term clinical consequences - in terms of lung function, mortality and cost of care - remain unclear. Using GRADE methodology, we judged the certainty of the evidence provided by this review to be very low to low, due to potential biases from the open-label design, high rates of attrition and small sample sizes. Based on the available evidence, we believe that whilst early eradication of respiratory MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis is possible, there is not currently enough evidence regarding the clinical outcomes of eradication to support the use of the interventions studied.

Summary of Recently Approved Antibiotics for the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Structure Infection

The emergence of community-associated MRSA strains has greatly influenced the selection of empirical antibiotic therapy for ABSSSIs. To provide adequate empirical coverage for MRSA, an understanding of local microbial epidemiologic patterns and susceptibility patterns is essential. For the treatment of an abscess, the IDSA guidelines recommend, in addition to incision and drainage, administration of an antibiotic active against MRSA when the initial antibiotic treatment has failed or when the patient has immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or hypotension. For cellulitis and erysipelas, including an antibiotic with activity against MRSA and group A streptococcus is recommended when the infection is associated with penetrating trauma or when there is evidence of MRSA infection, MRSA colonization, injecting drug use, or SIRS. Further, including an antimicrobial agent active against MRSA in the treatment of surgical wound infections is recommended in patients with risk factors for infection by this microorganism (nasal colonization or prior infection, hospitalization, or recent antibiotic administration). Anti-MRSA agents for ABSSSIs include vancomycin, which is considered the first-line parenteral treatment of serious MRSA infections in hospitalized patients, as well as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline (Table 3). Other agents with reliable MRSA activity that have been approved for ABSSSIs include ceftaroline, tedizolid, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin. Additional factors for administering these medications include tolerability, formulation, cost, and dosing limitations associated with these agents, such as vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity and linezolid-associated myelosuppression.

### Antibiotic therapy in necrotizing soft tissue infections: a narrative review of the greater paris SURFAST consortium [^113c5LRo]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection

The presence of at least one of the following criteria is at risk for MRSA: residency in post-acute care facility, chronic hemodialysis, long-term transcutaneous intravascular devices, MRSA colonization or infection in the last twelve months, exposure to ß-lactams or fluoroquinolones in the previous 3 months, immunosuppression (such as ongoing malignancy, transplantation, chemotherapy, corticosteroids (prednisone ≥ 25 mg/day), splenectomy, immunosuppressive therapies, autoimmune diseases), complex home care and chronic wound.

In the US, risk factors for community-acquired MRSA are as follows: neonates, children beyond the neonatal period, athletes, household contacts of MRSA skin and soft tissue infection patients, emergency department patients, urban undeserved communities, indigenous populations, detainees in jail or prison, cystic fibrosis patients, military personnel, men who have sex with men, HIV patients, veterinarians, livestock handlers, and pet owners. Travelers from America, North Africa, Western Asia, Southern Europe, Asia and Oceania are also at risk for MRSA colonization for twelve months following return. In settings with high endemicity of CA-MRSA, empirical antibiotic coverage targeting MRSA is warranted, in line with previous guidelines. Healthcare-associated infections are considered as risk factors in settings where the prevalence of MRSA is high.

In pediatric population, approximately 30% of Panton-Valentin leucocidin (PVL)-producing strains are MRSA and the higher prevalence of community-acquired MRSA in children supports the inclusion of anti-MRSA coverage in empirical antibiotic therapy for this specific population.

Severe allergy to β-lactams

Defined by anaphylaxis and/or severe delayed hypersensitivity cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction (or rash) with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, bullous exanthemas, or maculopapular exanthema.

Sepsis

Defined by a Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score > 2 in adults. In children, it is assessed using the Phoenix sepsis score ≥ 2.

Septic shock

Defined, in adults, by a serum lactate level ≥ 2 mmol/L and the need for vasopressor therapy to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg. In children, it is defined by a Phoenix hemodynamic score ≥ 1 point (need for vasoactive treatment, lactate level ≥ 5 mmol/L, or age-specific hypotension).

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: decolonization and prevention prescribing practices for children treated with skin abscesses / boils in a pediatric emergency department [^114gUKEB]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to describe methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) eradication/prevention practices of clinicians managing patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), specifically, in those patients undergoing abscess incision and drainage (I&D) in a pediatric emergency department (ED).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed for children aged 0 to 18 years old undergoing I&D of cutaneous abscess between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2011, in the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center ED.

Results

Five hundred seventy-five patients underwent abscess I&D during our study period. Approximately 25% of our population had previous history of MRSA, SSTI, or boil/abscess; in addition, 26% of our population had a household family member with a previous history of MRSA, SSTI, or boil/abscess. Wound cultures were obtained in 399 (69%) of 575 of I&D abscesses, and of these, 57% of the I&D abscesses grew MRSA. Of all patients, only 3.7% (21 patients) had documentation of MRSA eradication/prevention instructions for patient/family.

Conclusions

Methicillin-resistant S aureus eradication/prevention discussions are not commonly included in discharge instructions for patients undergoing abscess I&D. Given the significant proportion with previous MRSA infection, the ED may be a setting to provide instructions to patients/families with recurrent infections.

Therapy for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections

The guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend treatment with a beta-lactam or clindamycin for mild/moderate, non-purulent ABSSSIs and vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam for severe, non-purulent ABSSSIs. Treatment of purulent ABSSSIs should cover MRSA empirically with doxycycline or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in moderate cases and vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or ceftaroline in severe cases. With the increase of clinical MRSA isolates with decreased susceptibility or resistance to these drugs, treatment of ABSSSIs, especially SSIs, is now challenged by antibiotic resistance, toxicity, few oral options, and greater need for hospitalization and its associated costs. Dalbavancin, a recent addition to the antimicrobial armamentarium that could meet these challenges, is a novel lipoglycopeptide approved by the FDA in May 2014 and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in February 2015 for ABSSSIs caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms.

- TMP/SMX

- a tetracycline in combination with a β-lactam, such as amoxicillin

- linezolid alone.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — cutaneous abscess and inflamed epidermoid cyst management emphasizes that aspiration was successful in only 25% of cases overall and < 10% with MRSA infections, and accordingly, this form of treatment is not recommended. Simply covering the surgical site with a dry dressing is usually the easiest and most effective treatment of the wound, and one small study found that packing caused more pain and did not improve healing when compared to just covering the incision site with sterile gauze. The addition of systemic antibiotics to incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses does not improve cure rates, even in those due to MRSA, but systemic antibiotics should be given to patients with severely impaired host defenses or signs or symptoms of systemic infection; multiple abscesses, extremes of age, and lack of response to incision and drainage alone are additional settings in which systemic antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

### Editorial commentary: duration of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a question with many answers [^113vLRKc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Finally, it is important to point out that Cluzet et al censored duration of colonization based on documentation of clearance defined as 2 consecutive sampling periods with no positive MRSA surveillance cultures. This is important as prior studies have suggested that 1 out of 10 MRSA-colonized patients may have 2 or more consecutive negative screenings with a later positive result, at times 6–12 months later. While one study found identical MRSA colonizing strains separated in time by negative results, this is an area where more investigation is needed in order to understand whether recurrence of colonization represents recurrence of an old strain or colonization with a new strain.

In terms of the finding that SSTI treatment with clindamycin was associated with earlier clearance, I agree with the authors that the scientific explanation for this finding remains unclear and deserves further study. Prior work has more commonly linked the receipt of antibiotics to MRSA acquisition and longer (rather than shorter) MRSA colonization, although one group questioned the link between antibiotics and MRSA acquisition due to confounding by indication. As referenced by Cluzet et al, a prior published study showed that antibiotics to treat a clinical infection were associated with a shorter duration of MRSA colonization. I agree with the authors, though, that it is not clear why only clindamycin shortened duration in the present study and not trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, which was prescribed a near equal number of times for treatment. It is worth noting that clindamycin was more commonly prescribed to index cases aged < 18 years; however, Cluzet et al found no interaction between age and clindamycin treatment in their model that predicted time to clearance of MRSA colonization.

Background

Infections of the skin and soft tissues are caused most frequently by Staphylococcus aureus (also referred to as "Staph") or Streptococcus pyogenes (also referred to as "Strep" or Group A strep; refer to the Streptococcal infections section), and other less common bacteria. Staph infections may be caused by staph strains that are very susceptible to antibiotics or by MRSA (see MRSA section above). Sometimes the specific bacteria can indicate the type of skin infection (e.g. impetigo, cellulitis, and abscess), the events leading to the infection (e.g. unknown, trauma, and animal bite), and the individual's underlying risk factors (e.g. previous history of skin infections and immune compromise).

Many skin infections are easily treated with oral antibiotics. Some skin infections, especially those caused by Staph, may require a minor surgical procedure to drain pus from an abscess (also called a boil), if present. If the infection is severe, it may require hospital admission for intravenous (IV) antibiotics.

The ways these bacteria spread depends on the type of skin infection and the specific bacteria. Staph, including MRSA, transmit easily through direct contact with infected fluids, such as pus and through respiratory secretions from a person with pneumonia (see MRSA section). People can minimize the risk of transmission by avoiding direct contact with infected fluids, careful hand hygiene and using dressings to cover skin infections with draining fluid and changing dressings frequently.

Individuals also can be colonized with these bacteria, meaning the bacteria live in their nose, throat, or on their skin, but they do not have symptoms of illness.

### A European survey of antibiotic management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection: current clinical opinion and practice [^117XshGh]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Although the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) varies across Europe, healthcare-associated MRSA infections are common in many countries. Despite several national guidelines, the approach to treatment of MRSA infections varies across the continent, and there are multiple areas of management uncertainty for which there is little clinical evidence to guide practice. A faculty, convened to explore some of these areas, devised a survey that was used to compare the perspectives of infection specialists from across Europe on the management of MRSA infections with those of the faculty specialists. The survey instrument, a web-based questionnaire, was sent to 3840 registered delegates of the 19th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, held in April 2009. Of the 501 (13%) respondents to the survey, 84% were infection/microbiology specialists and 80% were from Europe. This article reports the survey results from European respondents, and shows a broad range of opinion and practice on a variety of issues pertaining to the management of minor and serious MRSA infections, such as pneumonia, bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections. The issues include changing epidemiology, when and when not to treat, choice of treatment, and duration and route of treatment. The survey identified areas where practice can be improved and where further research is needed, and also identified areas of pan-European consensus of opinion that could be applied to European guidelines for the management of MRSA infection.

### Current paradigms of combination therapy in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia: does it work, which combination, and for which patients? [^113pZkPC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The last several years have seen an emergence of literature documenting the utility of combination antimicrobial therapy, particularly in the salvage of refractory methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Recent clinical data are shaping conundrums of which regimens may be more beneficial, which can be potentially harmful, and which subset of patients stand to benefit from more aggressive treatment regimens than called for by current standards. In addition, the incorporation of combination therapy for MRSA bacteremia should be accompanied by the reminder that antimicrobial therapy does not need to be uniform for the entire duration, with an early intensive phase in high inoculum infections (eg, with combination therapy), followed by a consolidation phase (ie, monotherapy). This review and perspective consolidates the recent data on this subject and directs future goals in filling the knowledge gaps to methodically move forward towards improving patient outcomes.

### MRSA: treating people with infection [^113isEmX]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has a gene that makes it resistant to methicillin as well as to other beta-lactam antibiotics including flucloxacillin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), especially in the nose, but it can cause infection, especially in people with prolonged hospital admissions, with underlying disease, or after antibiotic use. About 20% of S aureus in blood cultures in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is resistant to methicillin.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatment for MRSA infections at any body site? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 11 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: clindamycin, daptomycin, fusidic acid, glycopeptides (teicoplanin, vancomycin), linezolid, macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), quinupristin-dalfopristin, pristinamycin, rifampicin, tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline), tigecycline, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole).

Skin Infection Characterization

A total of 391 skin infections occurred during the 3.6-year follow-up. Of these, 246 (62.9%) presented as a single furuncle; 85 (21.7%) were multiple furuncles; 50 (12.8%) had evidence of cellulitis; 4 (1.0%) were diagnosed as folliculitis; and 6 (1.5%) were deep abscesses. One hundred thirteen (45.9%) single boils occurred in the buttocks/low back/thigh area; 35 (41.2%) multiple boil infections occurred on the buttocks/low back/thigh area. Thirty-three (66.0%) of the cellulitis infections occurred on the extremities.

For all skin infections on which antimicrobial drug data were available, 264 of 382 (69.1%) patients were prescribed antimicrobial drugs. We found no difference in the mean number of antimicrobial drug treatment prescribed over the study period to S. aureus carriers compared with non– S. aureus carriers (12.0 vs. 10.4, respectively; p = 0.12) or for MRSA carriers (mean 13.6) as compared with MSSA carriers (mean 11.3, p = 0.17).

During the entire course of follow-up, 79/383 (21%) of infections (7 with an unknown culture status) were cultured. The proportion of skin infections cultured was similar for MRSA carriers (22%), MSSA carriers (22%), and non– S. aureus carriers (20%). In the 3.6 year follow-up period, 70 (89%) skin infections cultured were MRSA, 6 (8%) were MSSA, and 3 (4%) were other pathogens. Over the entire study period, 12/41 (29%) of MRSA carriers had a MRSA confirmed skin infection, compared with 12/85 (14%) of MSSA carriers and 30/190 (16%) of non– S. aureus carriers (p = 0.05 for MRSA vs. MSSA carriers, p = 0.004 for MRSA vs. non– S. aureus carriers, and p = 0.72 for MSSA vs. non– S. aureus carriers).

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^114VkSSW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of mortality by bloodstream infections worldwide, and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is the leading cause of mortality attributable to antimicrobial resistance. Despite its global distribution and an incidence of approximately 30 per 100 000 person-years, the optimal approach to S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) is poorly understood. Despite the fact that SAB has been a major theme in the medical literature for decades, basic treatment elements such as the optimal antibiotic regimen, the role of adjunct and oral antibiotics, the optimal treatment duration, and the definition of persistent SAB remain fundamentally unknown. Even less is known about global differences in treatment practices for SAB.

The aim of this study was to identify global variation in management, diagnostics, and definitions of SAB. To do this, we used a variety of social media platforms to reach a large number of clinicians throughout the world for a survey on SAB treatment practices.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^117XWsQz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Glycopeptides have been for many years the microbiological agents of choice used in complicated Gram-positive infections. Fortunately, staphylococcal resistance to glycopeptides remains rare, although rising minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of glycopeptides may affect the efficacy of these antibiotics.

Increased resistance to glycopeptides has encouraged the development of new agents active against Gram-positive bacteria, particularly for severe soft-tissue infections where aggressive antimicrobial management is always recommended, such as linezolid and daptomycin. Linezolid has been considered an agent of choice in complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs). It has the advantages of early intravenous-to-oral switch with the oral preparation having very high bioavailability and excellent tissue penetration.

In 2010, an open-label study compared oral or intravenous linezolid with intravenous vancomycin for treatment of cSSTIs caused by MRSA. Patients receiving linezolid had a significantly shorter length of stay and duration of intravenous therapy than those receiving vancomycin. Both agents were well tolerated. Adverse events were similar to each drug's established safety profile.

Recently, a Cochrane meta-analysis included all randomized controlled trials comparing linezolid with vancomycin in the treatment of SSTIs. Linezolid was associated with a significantly better clinical (risk ratio [RR] = 1.09, 95% CI, 1.03–1.16) and microbiological cure rate in adults (RR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.16). For infections caused by MRSA, linezolid was significantly more effective than vancomycin in clinical (RR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03–1.17) and microbiological cure rates (RR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04–1.32).

The daily cost of outpatient therapy was less with oral linezolid than with intravenous vancomycin. Although inpatient treatment with linezolid cost more than inpatient treatment with vancomycin per day, the median length of hospital stay was 3 days shorter with linezolid.

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1176MarX]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection, also known as bacteraemia, is one of the most common and serious community-acquired and hospital-acquired bacterial infections worldwide. When S aureus enters the bloodstream it can disseminate to cause metastatic, deep-seated infection of almost any organ, with an associated mortality of approximately 20%. Despite the frequency and severity of S aureus bacteraemia, the optimal antibiotic treatment is uncertain. Fewer than 1600 participants have been enrolled in randomised trials of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of this infection over the past 50 years. Most treatment recommendations are therefore based on observational studies and clinical experience. Opinions on best management vary widely, but current guidelinesrecommend S aureus bacteraemia be treated with at least 14 days of an intravenous β-lactam antibiotic, or a glycopeptide if the bacteria are resistant to meticillin. Combination antibiotic therapy is generally not recommended, except in severe meticillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) infections (eg, endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections); however, evidence in support of its use in such cases is weak.

Treatment of Skin Infections

Bacterial Infections

Effective management of recurrent skin infections involves identifying and treating the underlying microbiologic agent, and implementing infection prevention measures. If left untreated, skin infections can become systemic and lead to life-threatening complications.

Topical and systemic antibiotics may be necessary to treat bacterial infections. However, antibiotics should only be used in clinically affected AD, as indiscriminate use increases the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant strains, which poses a therapeutic challenge. Choice of treatment depends on local patterns of antibacterial resistance, particularly the prevalence of MRSA. Culture of the causative pathogen is recommended to guide therapy, but empiric therapy is reasonable in uncomplicated cases or before culture results become available.

Table 2 summarises the guideline-recommended antibacterial options for empiric treatment of skin infections and when they are indicated. Topical antibacterial agents can be used for the treatment of localised skin infections and decolonisation. For uncomplicated, non-purulent skin infections, preferred empiric antibacterial treatments are usually oral β-lactam antibiotics, such as a penicillin or cephalosporin. In patients with AD and a skin abscess, oral antibiotics such as clindamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or linezolid can be considered. Infections occurring in countries/regions with a high prevalence of MRSA require treatment with agents that are active against MRSA (e.g. trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, clindamycin, tetracyclines [doxycycline or minocycline], vancomycin or linezolid) and complicated infections may require agents active against Gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam). MRSA-associated AD flares are difficult to treat with TCS because of corticosteroid resistance induced by staphylococcal superantigens. In such a situation, prolonged use of corticosteroids may lead to skin atrophy and adrenal insufficiency, so alternative AD therapy should be considered.

### Staphylococcus aureus-associated skin and soft tissue infections in ambulatory care [^112uKtxe]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is the almost-universal cause of furuncles, carbuncles, and skin abscesses and worldwide is the most commonly identified agent responsible for skin and soft tissue infections. S. aureus skin and soft tissue infections frequently begin as minor boils or abscesses and may progress to severe infections involving muscle or bone and may disseminate to the lungs or heart valves (i.e. endocarditis). Treatment of early infections consists of incising and draining the lesion, often accompanied by β-lactam antimicrobial drugs, which are also effective against β-hemolytic streptococci.

Strains resistant to β-lactam antimicrobial drugs, termed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), were recognized from the 1960s through the 1990s as healthcare-associated (HA) pathogens. In the late 1990s, MRSA disease without established healthcare risk factors, called community-associated (CA)–MRSA, was increasingly reported in the literature. A study conducted in 2004 in emergency departments in 11 US cities found that MRSA was isolated from 59% of patients with skin and soft tissue infections. The biology of CA-MRSA appears to differ from that of HA-MRSA and CA–methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), perhaps allowing CA-MRSA to cause disease other than that expected from MSSA. As HA-MRSA emerged, it likely did not merely replace HA-MSSA but led to an overall increase in S. aureus infections in healthcare settings.

Because most skin and soft tissue infections are treated in outpatient settings with empiric antimicrobial therapy, few studies have attempted to estimate the number of S. aureus skin and soft tissue infections, and none have evaluated the antimicrobial drugs prescribed for these conditions. Therefore, with regard to skin and soft tissue infections likely caused by S. aureus, we 1) estimated the number and rate of ambulatory care visits in the United States during 2 periods and examined any changes in these estimates between these periods; 2) described patient demographic characteristics; and 3) characterized antimicrobial and outpatient surgical therapy provided. Our results are based on a secondary data analysis of the 1992–1994 and 2001–2003 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (NHAMCS).

Simple abscess

Cutaneous abscesses are collections of pus within the dermis and deeper tissues.

To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its the borders of the abscess. Additionally, simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Epidermoid cysts, often named "sebaceous cysts", are usually due to infection of pilosebaceous gland and are present anywhere in the body lined by squamous epithelium.

Furuncles also named "boils" are superficial infections with suppuration of the hair follicle, usually caused by S. aureus. They extend through the dermis into the subcutaneous tissue, where form a small abscess. Furuncles can occur anywhere on hairy skin. A group of infected hair follicles with pus is named carbuncle. Carbuncles are larger and deeper than furuncles. Furuncles often rupture and drain spontaneously or following treatment with moist heat. Most large furuncles and all carbuncles should be treated with incision and drainage. Excision of carbuncle with primary split-thickness skin grafting is an alternative treatment modality.

A recurrent abscess at a site of previous infection may be caused by local causes such as a pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa, or foreign material. Therefore, it always requires research of a local cause.

Treatment
Incision and drainage
Antibiotic therapy only in selected patients for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7–10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days

Incision, evacuation of pus and debris, and probing of the cavity to break up loculations provide effective treatment of cutaneous abscesses. The resultant wound should be left open and lightly packed with roll gage soaked with antiseptic solution.

Antibiotic therapy should be prescribed for abscesses greater than 5 cm, in an area difficult to drain (e.g. face, hand, and genitalia), if there is lack of response to incision and drainage alone, if there are multiple localizations and in patients with immunosuppression.

### Editorial commentary: duration of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a question with many answers [^117LHr5C]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Emergency room visits and hospital admissions for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) have been increasing, with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cultured from the site of infection. By recent estimates, approximately 7% of patients in US hospitals are colonized with MRSA. This includes an increase in colonization with community-acquired strains commonly associated with SSTIs.

According to the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the duration of colonization remains an unresolved issue. Data have shown that individuals remain at increased risk of MRSA infection and death until they are no longer colonized. However, there is a wide range of estimates for the median time to clearance, ranging from 7 to 9 months to well beyond a year. Thus, many US hospitals recommend waiting 6 months or more prior to screening for clearance of MRSA colonization.

In this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, the study by Cluzet et al adds to the debate on the duration of MRSA colonization, looking at clearance following diagnosis of an SSTI with a positive MRSA culture. In this longitudinal sampling study, MRSA surveillance cultures were collected from nares, axilla, and groin every 2 weeks for up to 6 months on both index cases and their household members. The first finding of interest was a median duration of MRSA colonization of only 21 days, far less than what has been noted in prior studies. I will point out, however, that 92% of the index cases received a systemic anti-MRSA antibiotic as treatment for their SSTI, and around 20% were prescribed topical nasal mupirocin and/or chlorhexidine/bleach baths in the 2 weeks following SSTI diagnosis. The second finding of interest was that SSTI treatment with clindamycin was associated with earlier clearance of MRSA colonization. To my knowledge, this is the first time that this has been suggested in the literature.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^113FPdYC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

When to administer antibiotics for MRSA in cSSTI?

We recommend to administer antibiotics directed against MRSA as an adjunct to incision and drainage based on local epidemiology (area with more than 20% of MRSA in invasive hospital isolates or high circulation of MRSA in the community), specific risk factors for MRSA, and clinical conditions (recommendation 1C).

The majority of SSTIs involving healthy skin are caused by aerobic Gram-positive cocci, specifically S. aureus and streptococci. Strains of S. aureus and GAS can produce a variety of toxins that may both potentiate their virulence and affect the soft tissues and allow invasion of the dermis. SSTIs management has recently become more complicated because of the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens.

Considerable variation in the resistance rates of S. aureus to methicillin (or oxacillin) in patients with SSTIs has been noted between continents, with the highest rates in North America (35.9%), followed by Latin America (29.4%) and Europe (22.8%). Although MRSA has been usually acquired during exposure in hospitals and other healthcare facilities, there has been a recent increase in MRSA infections presenting in the community (CA-MRSA). CA-MRSA strains are genetically and phenotypically distinct from HA-MRSA. CA-MRSA infections are becoming increasingly common. They can have a rapid and devastating course and may produce the pathogenic Panton–Valentine leucocidin toxin (PVL), which destroys white blood cells and is an important virulence factor. They may be susceptible to a wider range of anti-staphylococcal antibiotics (some are resistant only to beta-lactams). Populations at increased risk for CA-MRSA are listed below:
Children < 2 years old.
Athletes (mainly contact-sport participants).
Injection drug users.
Homosexual males.
Military personnel.
Inmates of correctional facilities, residential homes, or shelters.
Vets, pet owners, and pig farmers.
Patients with post-flu-like illness and/or severe pneumonia.
Patients with concurrent SSTI.
History of colonization or recent infection with CA-MRSA.
History of antibiotic consumption in the previous year, particularly quinolones, or macrolides.

### Current guidelines and recommendations for the management of skin and soft tissue infections [^117MabCv]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence of severe skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) has significantly increased over the last years. In addition, major ecological changes have been reported with the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), involved in a large proportion of these cases. A large number of expert opinions, guidelines, and recommendations for the management of SSTIs have been published over the last decade. The purpose of this review is to compare these guidelines.

Recent Findings

A total of six official publications have presented recommendations for the management of SSTIs. During the same period, other guidelines for the management of MRSA infections have also been published, including some recommendations for SSTIs.

Summary

The applicability of the guidelines is questionable in many ways. The distinction between necrotizing/nonnecrotizing infections is valuable but difficult to apply prior to surgical management. The prescribers should choose a pragmatic approach to empirical antibiotic therapy, taking into account the patient's initial severity, the extent of infection and risk factors for resistant microorganisms essentially related to healthcare-associated circumstances.

### IDSA guidelines on the treatment of MRSA infections in adults and… [^1131cRoq]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Options for treating both β-hemolytic streptococci and community-associated MRSA include clindamycin alone, TMP/SMX or a tetracycline in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic, or linezolid alone. Rifampin is not recommended for use as a single agent or adjunctive therapy. Empiric therapy options include intravenous vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or clindamycin. A beta-lactam antibiotic may be considered in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. MRSA-active therapy may be modified if there is no clinical response. Treatment for seven to 14 days is recommended, but should be individualized to the patient's clinical response.

Cultures from abscesses and other purulent infections are recommended in patients who have received antibiotic therapy, those with severe local infection or signs of systemic illness, and those who have not responded adequately to initial treatment. Cultures are also recommended if there is concern of a cluster or outbreak. Recommended treatment for adults with uncomplicated bacteremia includes vancomycin or daptomycin at a dosage of 6 mg per kg intravenously once per day for at least two weeks. For adults with complicated bacteremia, four to six weeks of therapy is recommended, depending on the extent of infection. Some experts recommend higher dosages of daptomycin. In patients with MRSA pneumonia complicated by empyema, antimicrobial therapy should be used with drainage procedures.

Antibiotic options for parenteral administration include intravenous vancomycin and daptomycin. Antibiotic options with parenteral and oral routes of administration include the following: TMP/SMX in combination with rifampin, linezolid, and clindamycin.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^113u4pih]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) versus methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) coverage is guided by on-admission risk factors and mortality risk. For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have either a risk factor for MRSA infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant, or the prevalence of MRSA is not known), or who are at high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MRSA (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. For patients with HAP who require empiric coverage for MRSA, we recommend vancomycin or linezolid rather than an alternative antibiotic (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have no risk factors for MRSA infection and are not at high risk of mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MSSA; when empiric coverage for MSSA (and not MRSA) is indicated, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem, and oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin are preferred for the treatment of proven MSSA, but are not necessary for empiric coverage of HAP if one of the above agents is used (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). The 20% threshold for deciding whether or not to target MRSA or MSSA was chosen in an effort to balance the need for effective initial antibiotic therapy against the risks of excessive antibiotic use; when implementing these recommendations, individual units may elect to modify this threshold.

The guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with MRSA infections. The guidelines discuss the management of a variety of clinical syndromes associated with MRSA disease, including skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), bacteremia and endocarditis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, and central nervous system (CNS) infections. Recommendations are provided regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring, management of infections due to MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin treatment failures.

### Treatment of MRSA soft tissue infections: an overview [^111mRWsg]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

MRSA is becoming increasingly common worldwide. With the emergence of new highly spreadable strains (community associated or CA-MRSA) novel presentation skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) are being seen. Recurrent SSTI, including folliculitis, furunculosis and abscesses account for an increasing proportion of SSTI seen in the emergency department. Empirical antimicrobial management choices can be difficult, but clues to the nature of the MRSA may be gleaned from the history and clinical presentation. More severe SSTI due to necrotising fasciitis and purpura fulminans are emerging and warrant the broadest possible empirical Gram-positive cover, ideally with antimicrobials that stop exotoxin production, and sometimes intravenous immunoglobulin to neutralise exotoxins already produced.

ICU infections

Ventilator-associated pneumonia

Question

What is the appropriate treatment approach for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)?

Recommendation

Initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics for VAP requires consideration of patient-specific culture data, recent antibiotic exposure, the local antibiogram, and timing of when infection developed. Common regimens for hospital-acquired infections are vancomycin plus either cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam or in cases of severe penicillin allergy, aztreonam, although no specific regimen is generally superior. Empiric anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended. We recommend de-escalation of antibiotic treatment when culture data are available. Seven days of treatment is sufficient for most patients. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) nasal swab testing should be used to determine the need for empiric coverage.

Discussion

Evidence suggests mortality is lower when the initial antibiotic therapy is effective, even when switched to adequate therapy after culture data become available. Therefore, it is important to initiate appropriate antibiotics when there is strong clinical suspicion of VAP. There is no evidence of superiority of one specific empiric regimen over another and appropriateness is targeted in context of the hospital antibiogram and specific patient risk factors.

Trauma is a risk factor for staphylococcal infections, specifically traumatic head injury and road traffic injuries.MRSA nasal swab testing is useful because of its high negative predictive value for MRSA carrier status and if negative can obviate the need for MRSA coverage, as evidenced by recent data in the trauma population. Anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended due to lack of evidence of benefit and some evidence of harm. Empiric coverage is specifically tailored to S. aureus, Pseudomonas, and Gram-negative bacilli.

High-level evidence shows no benefit with treating longer than 7 days in most patients with exceptions limited to severe lung disease, severe immunosuppression, concomitant ARDS, and multidrug resistance. To de-escalate an antibiotic regimen, it is important that culture data be obtained at the time of diagnosis. Duration of therapy of 7 days and antibiotic de-escalation recommendations are consistent with the ATS/IDSA guidelines of 2016.

Context includes that "MRSA accounts for approximately 5% of culture-positive infections among critically ill patients", varies by region "ranging from ~2% in Western Europe to 10% in North America", and among patients with documented MRSA infections, delays of " > 24–48 hours" to antibiotics "are associated with increased mortality", whereas in undifferentiated pneumonia or sepsis, broad-spectrum regimens including anti-MRSA agents "were associated with higher mortality, particularly among patients without MRSA".

### Antibiotic therapy for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in surgical wounds [^116HKYxm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection after surgery is usually rare, but incidence can be up to 33% in certain types of surgery. Postoperative MRSA infection can occur as surgical site infections (SSI), chest infections, or bloodstream infections (bacteraemia). The incidence of MRSA SSIs varies from 1% to 33% depending upon the type of surgery performed and the carrier status of the individuals concerned. The optimal antibiotic regimen for the treatment of MRSA in surgical wounds is not known.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of various antibiotic treatments in people with established surgical site infections (SSIs) caused by MRSA.

Search Methods

In February 2013 we searched the following databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); NHS Economic Evaluation Database; Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one antibiotic regimen with another antibiotic regimen for the treatment of SSIs due to MRSA. All RCTs irrespective of language, publication status, publication year, or sample size were included in the analysis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently decided on inclusion and exclusion of trials, and extracted data. We planned to calculate the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for comparing the binary outcomes between the groups and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for comparing the continuous outcomes. We planned to perform the meta-analysis using both a fixed-effect and a random-effects model. We performed intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

We included one trial involving 59 people hospitalised because of MRSA SSIs. Thirty participants were randomised to linezolid (600 mg either intravenously or orally every 12 hours for seven to 14 days) and 29 to vancomycin (1 g intravenously every 12 hours for seven to 14 days). The type of surgical procedures that were performed were not reported. The trial reported one outcome, which was the eradication of MRSA. The proportion of people in whom MRSA was eradicated was statistically significantly higher in the linezolid group than in the vancomycin group (RR 1.80; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.68).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence to recommend any specific antibiotic in the treatment of MRSA SSIs. Linezolid is superior to vancomycin in the eradication of MRSA SSIs on the basis of evidence from one small trial that was at high risk of bias, but the overall clinical implications of using linezolid instead of vancomycin are not known. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary in this area.

### How do you treat an abscess in the era of increased community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)? [^111T2v86]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the era of increased prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), there have been a number of questions and several recent studies that address the clinical management of uncomplicated abscesses in the emergency department (ED).

Discussion

We examine the historical and clinical predictors for MRSA in patients with an uncomplicated abscess and review the evidence behind the use of wound cultures, decolonization, antibiotics, irrigation, and packing after incision and drainage. We found that current recommendations and treatment guidelines are often based on limited data, expert opinion, and anecdotal experience.

Conclusion

In light of the data currently available, antibiotics and decolonization should be used selectively, not routinely, for treatment of most uncomplicated abscesses. Wound cultures are generally not necessary in the ED, and all patients should be given return precautions for worsening symptoms.

### Eradication of community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus carriage: a narrative review [^116vKC21]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization increases infection risk in both patients and healthy individuals. Decolonization therapy has been proven to reduce S. aureus infections, but data on the effectiveness of individual decolonization strategies in community-onset MRSA carriage are scarce.

Objectives

The aim of this narrative review was to summarize the evidence on strategies for the elimination of MRSA colonization in community-onset MRSA carriers.

Sources

PubMed database was searched for studies on MRSA eradication, from inception to July 2023.

Content

Topical therapy is proven to be effective in nasal-only carriage and in temporary load reduction. Mupirocin nasal ointment in combination with chlorhexidine body wash is highly effective in nasal-only MRSA carriers in the community as well. In patients with extra-nasal colonization, addition of orally administered antibiotics likely increases success rates compared with topical therapy alone. Studies on systemic treatment of extra-nasal MRSA decolonization are subject to a high heterogeneity of antimicrobial agents, treatment duration, and control groups. The majority of evidence supports the use of a combination of topical therapy with rifampin and another antimicrobial agent. Decolonization treatment with probiotics is a promising novel non-antibiotic strategy. However, achieving long-term decolonization is more likely in countries with low MRSA prevalence, given the risk of recolonization in a context of high MRSA prevalence.

Implications

The decision to pursue community-onset MRSA eradication treatment in the individual patient should be based on the combination of the treatment objective (short-term bacterial load reduction in health care settings vs. long-term eradication in community settings), and the likelihood of successful decolonization. The latter is influenced by both individual risk factors for treatment failure, and the risk of recolonization. The addition of a combination of systemic antibiotics is rational for extra-nasal long-term decolonization. To determine the most effective systemic antimicrobial agents in MRSA decolonization, more research is needed.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^116GWo9y]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Daptomycin has proven efficacy in patients with Gram-positive complicated ©SSTIs, including those caused by S. aureus resistant to methicillin. Daptomycin has been shown to achieve very good concentrations in the skin and soft tissues. In 2010, a meta-analysis compared effectiveness and toxicity of daptomycin with that of other antimicrobials for the treatment of SSTIs. Four studies were included in the analysis (three were randomized RCTs). Vancomycin and semisynthetic penicillins were used in the comparator arm. Three studies reported on patients with cSSTIs. Daptomycin tissue penetration supports its use in the treatment of cSSTIs, and it has been shown to be non-inferior to vancomycin and semisynthetic penicillins.

Ceftaroline is an oxyimino advanced-generation broad-spectrum cephalosporin which has in vitro activity against S. aureus and MRSA, both of which are associated with cSSTIs. Ceftaroline fosamil has been found to be effective in the treatment of cSSTI when compared with vancomycin plus aztreonam for the treatment of cSSTI. Ceftaroline fosamil was also well tolerated and had a safety profile concordant with other antibiotics in the cephalosporin class.

More recently, new drugs have been approved for ABSSSI and have an important activity against MRSA, especially dalbavancin and tedizolid. Tedizolid, a novel oxazolidinone with Gram-positive activity including MRSA, is promising because it can be administered daily in oral or intravenous forms, and dalbavancin, a second-generation lipoglycopeptide that covers MRSA, can be administered as infrequently as once weekly.

Antibiotics recommended for MRSA infections are listed below.

Oral options:
Minocycline100 mg q12h
Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg q12h
Doxycycline 100 mg q12h
Clindamycin 300–600 mg q8h (high resistance rate)

### New drugs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infections [^112qXLiR]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogen incriminated in skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) becoming the predominant cause and representing a significant burden to the healthcare system. The last updated Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines concerning MRSA infections and SSTIs management were published in 2011 and 2014, respectively. The UK updated guidelines for MRSA infection treatment were published in 2021. Older treatment options may be associated with toxicity and require frequent dosing. There is a paucity of recent reviews on the armamentarium of new agents for MRSA SSTIs treatment.

Recent Findings

Since 2005, several new antibiotics received a fast-track approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for SSTI treatment. These drugs include delafloxacin, omadacycline, tedizolid, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin. In this manuscript, we will review the data that led to these new drugs approval and discuss their advantages and disadvantages in MRSA SSTIs management.

Summary

MRSA is a major cause of SSTIs. Several novel therapies covering MRSA were FDA-approved for SSTIs. However, the current IDSA guidelines for MRSA infection and SSTIs as well as the recently published UK guidelines on MRSA treatment only consider these drugs as alternative choices or do not mention them at all.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) related complications in surgical patients [^114kidTv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection after surgery is generally low, but affects up to 33% of patients after certain types of surgery. Postoperative MRSA infection can occur as surgical site infections (SSIs), chest infections, or bloodstream infections (bacteraemia). The incidence of MRSA SSIs varies from 1% to 33% depending upon the type of surgery performed and the carrier status of the individuals concerned. The optimal prophylactic antibiotic regimen for the prevention of MRSA after surgery is not known.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of all methods of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of postoperative MRSA infection and related complications in people undergoing surgery.

Search Methods

In March 2013 we searched the following databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library); NHS Economic Evaluation Database (The Cochrane Library); Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared one antibiotic regimen used as prophylaxis for SSIs (and other postoperative infections) with another antibiotic regimen or with no antibiotic, and that reported the methicillin resistance status of the cultured organisms. We did not limit our search for RCTs by language, publication status, publication year, or sample size.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified the trials for inclusion in the review, and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for comparing binary outcomes between the groups and planned to calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for comparing continuous outcomes. We planned to perform meta-analysis using both a fixed-effect model and a random-effects model. We performed intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

We included 12 RCTs, with 4704 participants, in this review. Eleven trials performed a total of 16 head-to-head comparisons of different prophylactic antibiotic regimens. Antibiotic prophylaxis was compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis in one trial. All the trials were at high risk of bias. With the exception of one trial in which all the participants were positive for nasal carriage of MRSA or had had previous MRSA infections, it does not appear that MRSA was tested or eradicated prior to surgery; nor does it appear that there was high prevalence of MRSA carrier status in the people undergoing surgery. There was no sufficient clinical similarity between the trials to perform a meta-analysis. The overall all-cause mortality in four trials that reported mortality was 14/1401 (1.0%) and there were no significant differences in mortality between the intervention and control groups in each of the individual comparisons. There were no antibiotic-related serious adverse events in any of the 561 people randomised to the seven different antibiotic regimens in four trials (three trials that reported mortality and one other trial). None of the trials reported quality of life, total length of hospital stay or the use of healthcare resources. Overall, 221/4032 (5.5%) people developed SSIs due to all organisms, and 46/4704 (1.0%) people developed SSIs due to MRSA. In the 15 comparisons that compared one antibiotic regimen with another, there were no significant differences in the proportion of people who developed SSIs. In the single trial that compared an antibiotic regimen with placebo, the proportion of people who developed SSIs was significantly lower in the group that received antibiotic prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav (or cefotaxime if allergic to penicillin) compared with placebo (all SSI: RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.65; MRSA SSI RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.83). In two trials that reported MRSA infections other than SSI, 19/478 (4.5%) people developed MRSA infections including SSI, chest infection and bacteraemia. There were no significant differences in the proportion of people who developed MRSA infections at any body site in these two comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav decreases the proportion of people developing MRSA infections compared with placebo in people without malignant disease undergoing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion, although this may be due to decreasing overall infection thereby preventing wounds from becoming secondarily infected with MRSA. There is currently no other evidence to suggest that using a combination of multiple prophylactic antibiotics or administering prophylactic antibiotics for an increased duration is of benefit to people undergoing surgery in terms of reducing MRSA infections. Well designed RCTs assessing the clinical effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens are necessary on this topic.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^11537E23]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Identifying the infecting pathogen may not be necessary for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses, but cultures can provide helpful information in patients with recurrent abscesses or systemic illness. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, most often methicillin-resistant (MRSA), and several other bacteria, most originating from the skin flora.MRSA accounts for a substantial number of visits by patients with skin and soft tissue infections.

Table 1 summarises current management guidelines, which do not recommend antibiotics for uncomplicated skin abscesses.

Current recommendations for antibiotics in patients with skin abscesses*

IDSA = Infectious Diseases Society of America; EBM = Evidence-Based Medicine; NHG = Nederlands Huisartsen Genootschap; ESCMID = European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

How the recommendation was created

The scope of the recommendation and the outcomes important to patients were defined by an international guideline panel consisting of two adults with lived experience of skin abscesses, one adult with lived experience as a carer for a child with skin abscess, five general practitioners, three paediatric or adult infectious disease physicians, four general internists, a general paediatrician, a dermatologist, and several health research methodologists. They requested a systematic review on the benefits and harms of different antibiotics to inform the recommendation. The panel then met online to discuss the evidence and to formulate specific recommendations. As with all BMJ Rapid Recommendations, no panel member had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).

The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including using the GRADE approach to critically appraise the evidence and to move from evidence to recommendations (appendix 2 on bmj.com). The panel initially identified patient-important outcomes and subgroup hypotheses needed to inform the recommendation. When creating the recommendation, the panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, costs, burdens of the treatments, the quality of evidence for each outcome, typical patient values and preferences and their expected variations, as well as acceptability. Recommendations can be strong or weak, for or against a course of action. The recommendations take a patient-centred perspective which de-emphasises public health, societal, and health payer point of view.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^116VEGCz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^112BYds6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

Diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections

11) A rapidly progressive soft tissue infection should be always treated aggressively as a necrotizing soft tissue infection (Recommendation 1 C)

12) Both CT and MRI may be useful for diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infections. However MRI may be difficult to perform under emergency situations. (Recommendation 2 C).

13) In unstable patients, ultrasound may be useful to differentiate simple cellulitis from necrotizing fasciitis (Recommendation 2 C).

Management of patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

14) Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock caused by NSTI require early source control, antimicrobial therapy, and supportive treatment (Recommendation 1 C).

Source control in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

15) Surgical source control must be early and aggressive to halt progression of the inflammatory process caused by NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

Hyperbaric oxygen in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

16) Although the benefit of adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy remains controversial, it may be considered where it is available (Recommendation 2 C).

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115bxj19]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — risk assessment for MRSA and P. aeruginosa and local validation — The most consistently strong individual risk factors for respiratory infection with MRSA or P. aeruginosa are prior isolation of these organisms, especially from the respiratory tract, and/or recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics; unfortunately, no validated scoring systems exist to identify patients with sufficiently high positive predictive value, and no scoring system has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes or reduce overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We propose that clinicians need to obtain local data on whether MRSA or P. aeruginosa is prevalent in patients with CAP and what the risk factors for infection are at a local level and we recommend analyzing the frequency of MRSA or P. aeruginosa as a CAP pathogen relative to the number of all cases of CAP; we refer to this process as "local validation". Finally, routine cultures in patients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa allow deescalation to standard CAP therapy if cultures do not reveal a drug-resistant pathogen and the patient is clinically improving at 48 hours, and deescalation of antibiotic therapy at 48 hours in accord with microbiological results that do not yield MRSA or P. aeruginosa is described as safe and reduces duration of antibiotic treatment, length of hospitalization, and complications of broad-spectrum therapy. Our recommendation against using the former category of HCAP as a basis for selecting extended-spectrum therapy is based on high-quality studies of patient outcomes.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111eVYNk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — purulent skin and soft tissue infections (abscesses, furuncles, carbuncles, inflamed epidermoid cysts) recommendations are as follows: Gram stain and culture of pus from carbuncles and abscesses are recommended, but treatment without these studies is reasonable in typical cases (strong, moderate). Gram stain and culture of pus from inflamed epidermoid cysts are not recommended (strong, moderate). Incision and drainage is the recommended treatment for inflamed epidermoid cysts, carbuncles, abscesses, and large furuncles (strong, high). The decision to administer antibiotics directed against S. aureus as an adjunct to incision and drainage should be based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria such as temperature ≥ 38°C or < 36°C, tachypnea > 24 breaths per minute, tachycardia > 90 beats per minute, or white blood cell count > 12 000 or < 4000 cells/µL (moderate; Figure 1) (strong, low), and an antibiotic active against MRSA is recommended for patients with carbuncles or abscesses who have markedly impaired host defenses and in patients with SIRS (Figure 1, Table 2) (strong, low).

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111aNudS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^114BT1Uk]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The evidence

To inform the recommendations, the guideline panel requested a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of adjuvant antibiotic therapy compared with no antibiotic therapy in addition to incision and drainage in patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses.

A large RCT published in March 2016 suggested that TMP-SMX treatment resulted in a higher cure rate than placebo among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess. Another RCT published in June 2017 found that, compared with incision and drainage alone, clindamycin or TMP-SMX in addition to incision and drainage improved short term outcomes in patients who had an uncomplicated skin abscess. The Rapid Recommendations team believed these two trials, in addition to the existing body of evidence, might change practice.

Figure 1 gives an overview of the characteristics of patients and trials included in the systematic review of the effects of antibiotics on uncomplicated skin abscesses. There were 14 RCTs: eight included a comparison of antibiotics versus no antibiotics, and seven included a comparison of two different antibiotics. Explicit descriptions of abscess definitions, for each trial, were summarised in the accompanying systematic review (table C of appendix 2). The largest trial specifically focused on small abscesses (all < 5 cm diameter and about half ≤ 2 cm) in patients who had no signs of systemic infection. The RCTs included participants with skin abscesses anywhere on the body.

Fig 1
Characteristics of patients and trials included in systematic review of the effects of antibiotics on uncomplicated skin abscesses. (MRSA = meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; MSSA = meticillin susceptible S aureus)

Eleven trials reported study setting, of which nine were conducted in emergency departments, one in outpatient dermatology clinics, and one in an Integrated Soft Tissue Infection Services (ISIS) clinic involving patients with high rates of comorbidity, such as infection with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, or HIV. The RCTs included children and adults. Almost all patients underwent incision and drainage for their skin abscess. The most common pathogen was MRSA (49–88%) followed by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 9–18%).

### Antibiotic therapy for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in non surgical wounds [^116xfUbm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Non surgical wounds include chronic ulcers (pressure or decubitus ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, ischaemic ulcers), burns and traumatic wounds. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonisation (i.e. presence of MRSA in the absence of clinical features of infection such as redness or pus discharge) or infection in chronic ulcers varies between 7% and 30%. MRSA colonisation or infection of non surgical wounds can result in MRSA bacteraemia (infection of the blood) which is associated with a 30-day mortality of about 28% to 38% and a one-year mortality of about 55%. People with non surgical wounds colonised or infected with MRSA may be reservoirs of MRSA, so it is important to treat them, however, we do not know the optimal antibiotic regimen to use in these cases.

Objectives

To compare the benefits (such as decreased mortality and improved quality of life) and harms (such as adverse events related to antibiotic use) of all antibiotic treatments in people with non surgical wounds with established colonisation or infection caused by MRSA.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 13 March 2013); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (2013, Issue 2); NHS Economic Evaluation Database (2013, Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February Week 4 2013); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, March 12, 2013); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 2013 Week 10); EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 8 March 2013).

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic treatment with no antibiotic treatment or with another antibiotic regimen for the treatment of MRSA-infected non surgical wounds. We included all relevant RCTs in the analysis, irrespective of language, publication status, publication year, or sample size.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified the trials, and extracted data from the trial reports. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for comparing the binary outcomes between the groups and planned to calculate the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for comparing the continuous outcomes. We planned to perform the meta-analysis using both fixed-effect and random-effects models. We performed intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

We identified three trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review. In these, a total of 47 people with MRSA-positive diabetic foot infections were randomised to six different antibiotic regimens. While these trials included 925 people with multiple pathogens, they reported the information on outcomes for people with MRSA infections separately (MRSA prevalence: 5.1%). The only outcome reported for people with MRSA infection in these trials was the eradication of MRSA. The three trials did not report the review's primary outcomes (death and quality of life) and secondary outcomes (length of hospital stay, use of healthcare resources and time to complete wound healing). Two trials reported serious adverse events in people with infection due to any type of bacteria (i.e. not just MRSA infections), so the proportion of patients with serious adverse events was not available for MRSA-infected wounds. Overall, MRSA was eradicated in 31/47 (66%) of the people included in the three trials, but there were no significant differences in the proportion of people in whom MRSA was eradicated in any of the comparisons, as shown below.1. Daptomycin compared with vancomycin or semisynthetic penicillin: RR of MRSA eradication 1.13; 95% CI 0.56 to 2.25 (14 people).2. Ertapenem compared with piperacillin/tazobactam: RR of MRSA eradication 0.71; 95% CI 0.06 to 9.10 (10 people).3. Moxifloxacin compared with piperacillin/tazobactam followed by amoxycillin/clavulanate: RR of MRSA eradication 0.87; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36 (23 people).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no trials comparing the use of antibiotics with no antibiotic for treating MRSA-colonised non-surgical wounds and therefore can draw no conclusions for this population. In the trials that compared different antibiotics for treating MRSA-infected non surgical wounds, there was no evidence that any one antibiotic was better than the others. Further well-designed RCTs are necessary.

### Recommended treatments for community-acquired MRSA infections… [^113BHvRB]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

S. aureus treatments such as antistaphylococcal penicillins and cephalosporins, U. S. physicians have prescribed a variety of other antibiotics to treat these infections *. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the agent most commonly used to treat adults with community-acquired MRSA infections in the United States. In vitro evidence suggests TMP/SMX has greater bactericidal activity against community-acquired MRSA than linezolid, rifampin, clindamycin, or minocycline. Long-acting tetracyclines were successfully used in Japan for MRSA infections before the availability of vancomycin.

A clinical review found response rates between 80 to 100 percent with these agents, and one small prospective trial reported a 100 percent response rate in doxycycline-treated patients after incision and drainage of MRSA abscesses. However, resistance of community-acquired MRSA to these agents has been reported on both coasts in the United States. Rifampin has excellent in vitro activity against community-acquired MRSA, but it cannot be used by itself because of rapid development of resistance, which can occur during active treatment. Combining rifampin with TMP/SMX, or fusidic acid where available, may be more effective than using either agent alone. Linezolid is the only oral agent with demonstrated effectiveness against MRSA in controlled trials, but its use has been restricted because it is expensive. Parenteral therapy is available for serious community-acquired MRSA infections. Vancomycin remains the first choice for MRSA therapy.

There have been reports of resistance to vancomycin through a heteroresistance mechanism, but this is not easily identified with clinical microbiology testing and requires special detection techniques. Although daptomycin has not been widely studied for treatment of community-acquired MRSA, it has recently been approved for treating bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis caused by.

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: vascular surgeons should fight back [^111WgvqT]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is now the commonest cause of serious vascular wound and graft infection in the U.K., and vascular departments in many other countries are similarly affected. There are no randomised trials that provide information about how to deal with this epidemic. There are, however, a number of clinical series that provide data that can be used to mount a logical and coherent response to the problem of preventing and managing MRSA infection. The risks and problems are different in every hospital and co-operation with local microbiologists is essential in creating individual protocols. Stratifying the risk to each patient is the first step; established antiseptic and surgical procedures are usually adequate as primary prevention. Studies into the role of targeted antibiotic therapy and isolation techniques are needed.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^114idjKL]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacteria that have become resistant to the common antibiotics are referred to as multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Some people may have an MDRO living on their skin or in their bodies but they are not ill. This is called being "colonized" with an MDRO. People can be colonized with an MDRO intermittently or consistently.

People with chronic medical conditions (e.g. cancer, kidney failure, and transplant recipients) are at highest risk of becoming colonized or infected with an MDRO. There may be special circumstances when a referring hospital has experienced high transmission rates of a specific MDRO; therefore, additional restrictions may be recommended by the affiliated medical facility's IPC department. Vaccines are not available for the prevention of the MDROs described here.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a well-known MDRO. MRSA is a type of bacteria that is resistant to many antibiotics. Healthy individuals may be colonized with MRSA, and the bacteria may live inside their nostrils or on their skin.

MRSA infections frequently involve the skin, causing boils, or abscesses. MRSA also can cause very serious diseases, including pneumonia, infection of the bones and joints, and abscesses deep within the body.

MRSA can spread from person-to-person, especially when there is close contact with the infected fluid or pus that is draining.

Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE)

Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) is a bacterium that lives in the intestines of some people and it can cause infection. VRE infections in children are rare, and they usually occur in people with chronic illnesses such as cancer.

Gram negative bacteria

Multiple types of Gram-negative bacteria have developed resistance to multiple antibiotics. These highly resistant bacteria live in the intestines of some people and can cause infections. Studies have found many healthy people in the community are colonized with Gram-negative bacteria, but the bacteria usually are identified when a patient is hospitalized.

### Methicillin-resistant and susceptible Staphylococcus aureus: tolerance, immune evasion and treatment [^11765EPr]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is capable of infecting every organ system in the body and developing resistance to every available antibiotic used to treat it, such as methicillin-resistant S.aureus (commonly referred to as MRSA). This pathogen is characterized by the sudden emergence of virulent new clones and an array of mechanisms to circumvent the immune system and antibiotics. Furthermore, despite the development of new antibiotics and a growing body of high-quality data to inform their use, S.aureus continues to be a leading bacterial cause of death worldwide. In this Review, we provide an overview of the basic research on the complex interplay between S.aureus, the host and antibiotics. We also provide an update on the contemporary clinical studies on the treatment and prevention of S.aureus.

### What is the best therapeutic approach to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia? [^1122kQu7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to define what the best therapeutic approach is for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia.

Recent Findings

Although two meta-analyses reported conflicting findings, recent retrospective studies reported higher success rates in patients with MRSA pneumonia treated with linezolid when compared to vancomycin. Only registration trials are available for some anti-MRSA antibiotics, such as telavancin, ceftaroline, and ceftobiprole. Scarce information is available regarding the best therapeutic approach for MRSA community-acquired pneumonia.

Summary

Linezolid seems to be a better choice than vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia. It is still unclear whether this affirmation holds for other forms of MRSA pneumonia. Further research is needed to define whether newer antibiotics are better alternatives than currently recommended agents.
