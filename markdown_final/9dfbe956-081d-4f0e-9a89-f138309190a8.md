## Question

how to order the u/s for r lower quadrant pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to order an ultrasound for right lower quadrant pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability of appendicitis. Then, I should verify how patient age and pregnancy status change the imaging choice. Next, I will specify the ultrasound technique and what to request. After that, I need to plan for indeterminate results and escalation pathways. Finally, I should consider special populations, documentation, and safety, and then synthesize a concise, actionable order template with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability, because imaging should follow, not replace, clinical assessment. I need to check for classic features such as RLQ pain, migration, nausea/vomiting, anorexia, fever, leukocytosis, and peritoneal signs, while remembering that no single sign rules in or out appendicitis reliably, so I should integrate history, exam, and labs to stratify risk before ordering imaging [^112bHDkA] [^111wABHK].

> Now, I should verify how age and pregnancy status alter the initial modality. In children and adolescents, ultrasound is preferred first-line due to high diagnostic performance without radiation; in pregnant patients, ultrasound first with MRI if indeterminate is standard; in nonpregnant adults, CT has the highest accuracy, but ultrasound can still be first-line when expertise is available or radiation avoidance is prioritized, so I need to tailor the order accordingly [^1146XbnY] [^114VwB1P] [^1134gSKx].

> Wait, let me verify the adult pathway because I initially thought CT is always first, but that is too absolute. The ACR supports CT as the primary modality in most adults, yet WSES and EAES endorse ultrasound as a reasonable first-line when skilled sonographers are available, so I should frame this as a conditional recommendation rather than a rigid rule, especially in younger or nonobese adults and when local expertise supports high-quality RLQ ultrasound [^1146XbnY] [^117JHyaC] [^113k1sn7].

> For the ultrasound request, I need to ensure I specify the correct study and technique. I should order a right lower quadrant ultrasound with graded compression, and explicitly request evaluation of the appendix, terminal ileum, cecum, right colon, right ureter, and in females the right ovary and adnexa; if female and of reproductive age, I should add a pelvic ultrasound with endovaginal views when appropriate to assess for ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, and other gynecologic pathology, and I should note whether the patient is pregnant to guide transabdominal versus endovaginal approaches [^1146XbnY] [^112b81r8] [^113ryu8z].

> Hold on, I should verify what secondary sonographic signs to ask the radiologist to report because these change management when the appendix is not visualized. I will request documentation of free fluid, mesenteric fat changes, echogenic pericecal fat, enlarged nodes, wall thickening of adjacent bowel, and any focal tenderness with compression, since these findings increase the likelihood of appendicitis even when the appendix is not seen and can guide escalation decisions [^117CtoGR] [^111hC5sX].

> Next, I should review the escalation pathway for indeterminate ultrasound. If the ultrasound is negative or nondiagnostic but clinical suspicion remains intermediate to high, I should escalate to contrast-enhanced CT abdomen/pelvis for definitive diagnosis; if the patient is pregnant and ultrasound is indeterminate, MRI without gadolinium is preferred; if MRI is unavailable, low-dose CT can be considered after discussing risks and benefits in pregnancy, and I should double-check that MRI sensitivity and specificity in pregnancy are high in contemporary series [^1146XbnY] [^1134gSKx] [^116gTAEA].

> I will now examine special populations and edge cases to avoid missing mimics. In children, I should maintain a low threshold for ultrasound and consider short-interval repeat ultrasound or MRI to reduce CT exposure; in pregnancy, I must keep ectopic and heterotopic pregnancy on the differential and ensure early obstetric input; in older adults, I should remember right-sided diverticulitis and colitis as RLQ mimics; and in nonpregnant women, I should actively consider ovarian torsion and PID and ensure adnexal coverage on imaging requests [^114VwB1P] [^114BSxqc] [^116G2i4R] [^112b81r8].

> Let me consider point-of-care ultrasound as well, because it can expedite care. ED-POCUS has reasonable diagnostic characteristics and a positive study can obviate further imaging, but a negative POCUS cannot rule out appendicitis, so I should use it to triage and expedite surgical consultation while planning definitive imaging if uncertainty persists [^114kGxGX] [^117JHyaC].

> I should confirm documentation and communication elements that improve downstream care. I will specify the clinical question, pretest probability, key differentials including appendicitis, diverticulitis, ureteral colic, ovarian torsion, and ectopic pregnancy, and request that the radiologist comment on secondary signs and alternative diagnoses; if imaging is indeterminate, I will request surgical consultation and plan observation or repeat imaging rather than immediate discharge when suspicion remains [^117CtoGR].

> But wait, what if resources or expertise are limited. In community settings without 24/7 expert ultrasound, CT may be the practical first test for adults, whereas in pediatric centers with experienced sonographers, an ultrasound-first strategy with CT reserved for indeterminate cases is appropriate; I should align the pathway with local capabilities and patient-specific risk to balance accuracy, speed, and radiation exposure [^1146XbnY] [^114VwB1P].

> Putting this together, here is the concise, evidence-based order template I would use, with built-in contingencies. Order: Right lower quadrant ultrasound with graded compression, including evaluation of the appendix, terminal ileum, cecum, right colon, right ureter, and right ovary/adnexa; if female of reproductive age, add pelvic ultrasound with endovaginal views when appropriate; request documentation of secondary inflammatory signs; if negative or nondiagnostic and clinical suspicion persists, proceed to contrast-enhanced CT abdomen/pelvis; if pregnant and ultrasound is indeterminate, obtain MRI abdomen/pelvis without gadolinium; if MRI is unavailable, consider low-dose CT after counseling, and ensure surgical consultation for intermediate to high suspicion regardless of imaging status [^1146XbnY] [^1134gSKx].

Order a **right lower quadrant ultrasound with graded compression** [^113454rA] to evaluate the appendix, bowel, and adjacent structures for appendicitis or alternative causes [^116G2i4R]. In women of childbearing age, include a **pelvic ultrasound** [^113ryu8z] to assess gynecologic pathology [^115i5Udz]. If the ultrasound is inconclusive and suspicion remains, proceed to contrast-enhanced CT [^112Yc9Ju] or MRI [^1114v2Y1] based on age, pregnancy, and clinical risk [^113454rA]. This approach balances diagnostic accuracy, radiation avoidance, and timely management [^112WmpjU].

---

## Indications for ultrasound in right lower quadrant pain

Ultrasound is indicated for RLQ pain when **appendicitis is suspected** [^117JHyaC], particularly in children, pregnant patients, and young women, to avoid radiation [^114VwB1P] [^1134gSKx]. It is also used to evaluate gynecologic pathology — such as ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, and ovarian cysts — in women of reproductive age [^114r3nV8] [^112b81r8]. Additionally, ultrasound can identify alternative diagnoses, including diverticulitis, ureteral stones, and inflammatory bowel disease [^113454rA] [^116G2i4R].

---

## Clinical assessment before ordering ultrasound

Before ordering ultrasound, perform a focused clinical assessment:

- **History**: Onset, duration, location, migration, nausea, vomiting, fever, dysuria, menstrual history, pregnancy status [^112bHDkA].

- **Physical examination**: RLQ tenderness, rebound, guarding, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign, pelvic examination [^111wABHK].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CRP, urinalysis, pregnancy test in women of reproductive age [^112BidjC].

---

## Specific ultrasound protocol for right lower quadrant pain

The **graded compression technique** is essential for optimal visualization of the appendix and surrounding structures [^1118YHNa]:

| **Step** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Patient positioning: Supine, knees slightly flexed, full bladder for pelvic structures |
| 2 | Transducer selection: Linear (5–12 MHz) for superficial structures; curvilinear (3–5 MHz) for deeper structures or obese patients |
| 3 | Identify anatomical landmarks: Cecum, terminal ileum, psoas muscle, external iliac vessels |
| 4 | Apply graded compression to displace bowel gas and visualize the appendix |
| 5 | Evaluate appendix diameter, wall thickness, periappendiceal fat, fluid collections, and compressibility |
| 6 | Assess for secondary signs: Mesenteric lymphadenopathy, free fluid, abscess formation |
| 7 | In women, perform transabdominal and endovaginal pelvic ultrasound to evaluate ovaries, Fallopian tubes, and uterus [^115i5Udz] |

---

## Key ultrasound findings in appendicitis

- **Direct signs**: Appendix diameter > 6 mm, noncompressible, target sign (hypoechoic lumen with hyperechoic wall), appendicolith [^notfound].

- **Indirect signs**: Periappendiceal fat echogenicity, free fluid, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, abscess formation [^111hC5sX].

- **Nonvisualized appendix**: Common; secondary signs and clinical correlation are crucial [^113G8ZEr] [^117CtoGR].

---

## Limitations and challenges of ultrasound

- **Operator dependence**: Accuracy varies with operator experience and patient factors (obesity, bowel gas) [^115Gcr3R].

- **Nonvisualized appendix**: Occurs in 39–60% of cases; secondary signs and clinical correlation are essential [^113G8ZEr] [^117CtoGR].

- **False negatives**: Early or atypical appendicitis may be missed [^114kGxGX].

---

## Clinical decision-making based on ultrasound results

- **Positive ultrasound**: High specificity for appendicitis; surgical consultation indicated [^114kGxGX].

- **Negative ultrasound**: High sensitivity; if clinical suspicion remains high, proceed to CT or MRI [^112Yc9Ju] [^114r9oSK].

- **Equivocal ultrasound**: Clinical observation, repeat ultrasound, or advanced imaging (CT/MRI) based on clinical risk and patient factors [^113qfGMK].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: High sensitivity and specificity; preferred in adults, complex cases, or when ultrasound is inconclusive [^1146XbnY] [^112Yc9Ju].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: No radiation; preferred in pregnancy, children, and when contrast is contraindicated [^1146XbnY] [^116gTAEA].

- **Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS)**: Rapid, bedside assessment; useful in emergency settings but limited by operator skill [^114kGxGX] [^1146XbnY].

---

## Special considerations

In pregnancy, **ultrasound is first-line**, with MRI preferred if ultrasound is inconclusive [^113454rA] [^1134gSKx]. In pediatrics, ultrasound is the **preferred initial modality** [^114VwB1P]; CT is reserved for inconclusive cases [^113qfGMK]. In elderly patients, CT is often preferred due to atypical presentations and higher prevalence of alternative diagnoses [^notfound].

---

## Documentation and communication

Document **clinical findings, ultrasound results, and management plan**. Communicate results promptly to the surgical team, primary care provider, and patient. Ensure follow-up for patients discharged with equivocal results or ongoing symptoms [^112qbFKq].

---

Ultrasound is the **preferred initial imaging modality** for RLQ pain, especially in children, pregnant patients, and young women. It provides valuable diagnostic information while avoiding radiation, but its accuracy depends on operator skill and patient factors. If ultrasound is inconclusive, escalate to CT or MRI based on clinical judgment and patient characteristics [^115v4hst].

### ACR appropriateness criteria® right lower quadrant pain – suspected appendicitis [^113454rA]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The diagnostic imaging of patients presenting with right lower quadrant pain and suspected appendicitis may be organized according to age and gender and to the presence or absence of "classic" signs and symptoms of acute appendicitis. Among adult patients presenting with clinical signs of acute appendicitis, the sensitivity and specificity of CT are greater than those of ultrasound, with improved performance when CT is performed with intravenous contrast. The use of rectal contrast has been associated with decreased time in the emergency department. Computed tomography has also been shown to reduce cost and negative appendectomy rates. Both CT and ultrasound are also effective in the identification of causes of right lower quadrant pain unrelated to appendicitis. Among pediatric patients, the sensitivity and specificity of graded-compression ultrasound can approach those of CT, without the use of ionizing radiation. Performing MRI after inconclusive ultrasound in pregnant patients has been associated with sensitivity and specificity of 80% to 86% and 97% to 99%, respectively. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria(®) are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRight lower quadrant pain-suspected appendicitis [^1114v2Y1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Appendicitis remains the most common surgical pathology responsible for right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain presenting to emergency departments in the United States, where the incidence continues to increase. Appropriate imaging in the diagnosis of appendicitis has resulted in decreased negative appendectomy rate from as high as 25% to approximately 1% to 3%. Contrast-enhanced CT remains the primary and most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate this patient population. MRI is approaching CT in sensitivity and specificity as this technology becomes more widely available and utilization increases. Unenhanced MRI and ultrasound remain the diagnostic procedures of choice in the pregnant patient. MRI and ultrasound continue to perform best in the hands of experts. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Right upper quadrant pain: ultrasound first! [^114TCGGR]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is a common presenting symptom in emergency departments and outpatient medical practices, and is most commonly attributable to biliary and hepatic pathology. Ultrasound should be used as a first-line imaging modality for the diagnosis of gallstones and cholecystitis, as it allows the differentiation of medical and surgical causes of upper abdominal pathology, and in many circumstances is sufficient to guide patient management. Knowledge of strengths and limitations of ultrasound in the evaluation of RUQ is paramount in correct diagnosis. A spectrum of RUQ pathology for which a RUQ ultrasound examination should reasonably be considered as the initial imaging modality of choice will be reviewed.

### Imaging of right lower quadrant pain in children and adolescents: expert panel narrative review [^111n2Yma]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

Right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain is a common clinical presentation in children, and accurate clinical diagnosis remains challenging given that this nonspecific presentation is associated with numerous surgical and nonsurgical conditions. The broad differential diagnosis varies by patient age and sex. Important considerations in the selection of a diagnostic imaging strategy include the sequencing, performance, and cost of tests. This article provides a comprehensive narrative review of the diagnostic imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents, including a discussion of the complementary roles of ultrasound, CT, and MRI; description of key imaging findings based on available evidence; and presentation of salient differential diagnoses. Subspecialized pediatric emergency medicine and surgical perspectives are also provided as further clinical insight into this common, but often challenging, scenario. Finally, the current status of imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents is summarized on the basis of expert consensus.

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^111Ttnh6]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause for acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations with which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### Right lower quadrant abdominal pain: Do not forget about ovarian torsion on the computed tomography scan [^112b81r8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints of patients presenting to emergency departments, and emergency physicians (EPs) often evaluate patients with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Ovarian torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain, but early diagnosis is essential for salvage of the affected ovary. The diagnostic study of choice for ovarian torsion is a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler, but it is important for EPs and radiologists to be aware of findings of ovarian torsion that might appear on computed tomography (CT).

Case Report

We present a case of a young female with right lower quadrant abdominal pain with CT evidence of ovarian torsion that was not recognized; the patient was discharged and then called back when the study was over-read as concerning for ovarian torsion. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The presence of radiographic findings associated with ovarian torsion on a CT scan should encourage an EP to order a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler (if available) and obtain an obstetrics/gynecology consult.

### How to diagnose acute appendicitis: ultrasound first [^1173qt8k]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Why use US as first-line imaging modality?

In conclusion, the studies and reports detailed above give an overview of the persistent difficulties in the clinical diagnosis of AA in paediatric and adult patients, the usefulness of various clinical scores (which are not commonly used in routine practice) and recent developments of modern imaging techniques focusing on US imaging. To date, US imaging for suspected AA is performed world-wide by radiologists and many physicians of other medical subspecialties, with or without the support of sonographers.

Paediatric patient population: It is the opinion of the ESR working group on US that graded-compression US should be the first-line imaging modality in paediatric patients with suspected AA. Direct and indirect US signs of AA are well established, as is the examination technique itself. We recognize that US has, compared to CT and MRI, lower sensitivity for the diagnosis of AA. The 2011 ACR Appropriateness Criteria® for right lower quadrant pain — suspected appendicitis — state that "for adult patients with clinical signs of AA the sensitivity and specificity of CT are greater than those of US, but that in paediatric patients, the sensitivity and specificity of graded-compression US can approach those of CT, without the use of ionizing radiation".

### Right lower quadrant pain in a young female: ultrasound diagnosis of rectus abdominis tear [^113sqmdW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Right lower quadrant pain in young females presents a frequent diagnostic challenge for emergency physicians, with a broad differential and several important diagnoses. Using an "ultrasound first" imaging strategy can help decrease the use of computed tomography scans, with associated savings in radiation exposure, cost, and other resource use.

Case Report

We report a case of right lower quadrant pain in a young woman. After her initial history and physical examination, appendicitis was the leading differential. A bedside ultrasound was performed, leading to the uncommon diagnosis of rectus abdominis muscle tear. The sonographic findings of a muscle tear include increase in size, loss of linear, homogeneous architecture, and decreased echogenicity. Making this diagnosis at the bedside using ultrasound obviated the need for further imaging, avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure, and decreasing emergency department length of stay and overall cost, while leading to a tailored treatment plan. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? Rectus abdominis tear is a cause of right lower quadrant pain that may mimic appendicitis and should be considered in patients with this complaint. The ability to make this diagnosis with bedside ultrasound may assist in several important patient-oriented outcomes.

### ACR appropriateness criteria right upper quadrant pain [^111dW4BF]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant pain is a common presenting symptom in patients with acute cholecystitis. When acute cholecystitis is suspected in patients with right upper quadrant pain, in most clinical scenarios, the initial imaging modality of choice is ultrasound. Although cholescintigraphy has been shown to have slightly higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis, ultrasound is preferred as the initial study for a variety of reasons, including greater availability, shorter examination time, lack of ionizing radiation, morphologic evaluation, confirmation of the presence or absence of gallstones, evaluation of bile ducts, and identification or exclusion of alternative diagnoses. CT or MRI may be helpful in equivocal cases and may identify complications of acute cholecystitis. When ultrasound findings are inconclusive, MRI is the preferred imaging test in pregnant patients who present with right upper quadrant pain. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^111S5quT]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Nonsurgical diagnoses contributions by ultrasound vs CT — Considering nonsurgical diagnoses, 10% of ultrasound examinations (88/880) added a new diagnosis after CT, with pelvis contributing 73% (64/88) of ultrasound exams with new findings; pelvic ultrasound added diagnoses not seen with CT in 12.6% (64/506) versus 6.4% (24/374) for right upper quadrant ultrasound.

### Surgical management of acute right lower-quadrant pain in pregnancy: a prospective cohort study [^113s4teP]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The etiology of right lower-quadrant pain in pregnant patients is a challenge in diagnosis. We discuss the surgical issues among pregnant patients with right lower-quadrant pain and demonstrate the method to diagnosis.

Study Design

This was a prospective cohort study with enrollment during 2 years. Pregnant patients presenting with acute right lower-quadrant abdominal pain and requiring surgical consult were included. Demographics, gestational age, symptoms, workup, operative results, and pathology were recorded.

Results

One-hundred patients were enrolled, 38 had nonspecific abdominal pain, 15 of whom were admitted. There were no differences in temperature, leukocyte count, and neutrophil shift among the admitted and nonadmitted patients. Forty-one patients underwent surgery and had a substantially higher gestational age, leukocyte count, and neutrophil shift than those who did not. Ultrasound was performed considerably more often on first-trimester patients (81.6%) compared with second- (58.1%) and third-trimester (57.9%) patients, and CT scan was used considerably less in the first trimester compared with the second and third trimesters, and considerably less than ultrasound for the first trimester. Sensitivity of ultrasound for appendicitis was inversely correlated to fetal gestational age, and CT scan retained high sensitivity and specificity throughout pregnancy.

Conclusions

This is one of the first prospective studies assessing diagnoses and workup of pregnant patients with right lower-quadrant pain. We recommend abdominal ultrasound be the first imaging modality for patients for whom surgical consultation is necessary, thereby determining if the pathology is obstetric. If inconclusive, a CT scan is necessary to guide treatment.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated. The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain. Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain. The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

### ED endovaginal pelvic ultrasound in nonpregnant women with right lower quadrant pain [^115i5Udz]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

We hypothesized that emergency physician-performed endovaginal ultrasound (EVUS) would change diagnostic decision making in nonpregnant women with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain.

Methods

A prospective cohort of female patients was enrolled at an urban emergency department (ED). Inclusion criteria were RLQ pain, hemodynamic stability, and a strong suspicion for appendicitis or right adnexal pathology. Treating physicians were queried regarding pre- and post-ED EVUS probability of disease, differential diagnoses, consultation, and management. Positive findings included large cysts or multitissue densities, tubal dilation, uterine enlargement/mass, and extensive peritoneal fluid.

Results

With a positive ED EVUS, mean physician probability increased for gynecologic (24%) and decreased for both surgical (14%) and medical (20%) disease. With a negative ED EVUS, mean physician probability increased for surgical disease (5.3%) and decreased for gynecologic disease (18.6%).

Conclusion

Emergency department EVUS changes physician diagnostic decision making in nonpregnant women with undifferentiated RLQ pain.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^1159KirJ]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Diagnostic strategies

The fully paired study design, with all imaging tests in all patients and with the panel based final diagnosis as the reference standard, allowed a comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of multiple imaging strategies. We compared the following single imaging strategies: (1) diagnosis after clinical evaluation, (2) clinical diagnosis plus plain radiographs, (3) ultrasonography in all patients, and (4) CT in all patients. In addition, we investigated the following conditional ultrasonography and CT strategies: (5) ultrasonography first in all patients and CT in those with a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography and (6) ultrasonography in all patients and CT only in patients with inconclusive ultrasonography.

We also investigated imaging strategies driven by patients' characteristics, in which only selected patients would have initial ultrasonography, with CT after a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography, whereas all others would have initial CT. For initial ultrasonography in these strategies, we selected (7) younger patients (< 45 years), for whom exposure to ionising radiation is most hazardous, and (8) non-obese patients (body mass index < 30 kg/m²), in whom ultrasonography is more likely to be diagnostic. In another strategy (9) both younger and non-obese patients would have initial ultrasonography.

A common clinical view is that the choice of imaging for acute abdominal pain should be guided by the location of pain. Therefore, we investigated strategies in which the selection of ultrasonography or CT was driven by the abdominal quadrant in which the pain was predominantly located. In strategy (10) the choice of investigation was based on the American College of Radiology guidelines, which recommend ultrasonography for pain in the right upper quadrant and computed tomography for pain in the other quadrants and for diffuse abdominal pain. In an alternative pain location driven strategy (11) patients with pain in the right upper quadrant or right lower quadrant would have initial ultrasonography and all others would have initial CT. The box summarises the strategies investigated.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^112Yc9Ju]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Application of CT after a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography result (strategy 5) had a higher sensitivity than the clinical diagnosis without imaging: 94% versus 88% (P < 0.001). This conditional strategy would result in a significantly lower number of missed urgent conditions compared with CT only: 6% versus 11%, with a higher sensitivity (P < 0.001) but a lower specificity (P < 0.001). An alternative conditional strategy with CT only after inconclusive ultrasonography (strategy 6) would further reduce use of CT (27% of patients) but would increase the proportion of missed urgent conditions from 6% to 15%.

Five hundred and twelve (50%) patients were older than 45, and 157 (15%) patients had a body mass index exceeding 30. Nine per cent of urgent conditions would be missed with a strategy in which imaging is based on body mass index (strategy 8) compared with 10% for the strategies based on age (strategy 7) or on both age and body mass index (strategy 9). The diagnostic accuracy of the strategy reflecting the American College of Radiology guidelines (10) was comparable to that of the CT only strategy. The use of ultrasonography for both pain in the right upper quadrant and pain in the right lower quadrant (strategy 11) would lead to 16% missed urgent conditions.

Exposure to radiation

Table 2shows use of ultrasonography and CT for each strategy. CT related exposure to radiation would vary between 56% and 81% for the strategies driven by patients' characteristics and between 65% and 95% for the strategies driven by location of pain. The second lowest use of CT (49%) would be achieved with the conditional CT strategy, the strategy that also had the highest sensitivity in detecting urgent diagnoses.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® left lower quadrant pain: 2023 update [^1147mvFJ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis for left lower quadrant pain is wide and conditions range from the benign and self-limited to life-threatening surgical emergencies. Along with patient history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, imaging is often critical to limit the differential diagnosis and identify life-threatening abnormalities. This document will discuss the guidelines for the appropriate use of imaging in the initial workup for patients who present with left lower quadrant pain, patients with suspected diverticulitis, and patients with suspected complications from diverticulitis. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals.

### Ultrasound of the pediatric appendix [^1118YHNa]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is the most common pediatric surgical emergency. Ultrasound (US) receives the highest appropriate rating scale in children with right lower quadrant pain suspected to have appendicitis. The US exam of the appendix has improved since Puylaert pioneered the technique of graded compression in 1986. In this article, we review ultrasonography of the pediatric appendix as it pertains to the normal appendix, acute appendicitis and the different sonographic manifestations. We also briefly describe technical optimization of image acquisition, common pitfalls and differential diagnoses.

Diagnostic algorithms

In order to keep radiation dose and financial cost low, various algorithms have been recently published for the work-up of a patient with suspected AA.

Ramajaran et al. report their retrospective outcomes analysis for suspected AA, at a children's hospital, over a six-year period. Their pathway established US as the initial imaging modality, and CT was recommended only if US was "equivocal". 407 (60%) of 680 study patients followed the pathway. Of these, 200 patients were managed definitively without CT. The NAR was 7%.

A protocol was implemented in another children's hospital with an algorithm relying on 24-hour US as the primary imaging study in children with suspected AA. The number of CT examinations per appendectomy decreased from 42% before, to 30% after implementation of the protocol, leading to reduced radiation exposure and imaging charges.

Another study reported on a set of clinical features that can rule out appendicitis in patients with suspected AA and non-diagnostic US results. Patients were discharged after inconclusive US if less than two predictors were present: male sex, migration of pain to right lower quadrant, vomiting and leucocyte count > 12.0 × 10⁹/L and re-evaluated the next day. The implemented clinical decision rule reduced the probability of AA in a large subgroup of patients with negative or inconclusive US results.

What if not only one initial US examination is performed, and an initial equivocal US examination is followed by clinical reassessment, a short-interval US and surgical consultation? This algorithm was studied prospectively in 294 children with a suspicion of AA and a baseline paediatric appendicitis score ≥ 2. Of the 111 children with AA, 108 were identified without use of CT. The short-interval US confirmed or ruled out AA in 22 of 40 children with equivocal initial US. The authors conclude that their approach is most useful in children with an equivocal initial US.

For a period from 2008 to 2013, another study reported a significant increase in the use of "US first" amongst 3353 children in Washington following national recommendations to use US for the diagnosis of AA when possible. However, over 40% of children were examined by CT. Of these, 35% of all CT examinations were performed after an indeterminate US examination.

Van Atta et al. have shown that implementation of an imaging protocol using US as the primary modality to evaluate paediatric patients with suspected AA leads to a decrease of CT utilization because 326 of 512 patients (63%) did not require a CT examination.

### Ultrasound assessment of acute appendicitis in paediatric patients: methodology and pictorial overview of findings seen [^116mBUfj]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical features

Clinical features of appendicitis include right lower quadrant pain, pain migration, nausea or vomiting, anorexia, rebound tenderness, pyrexia and elevated white cell count. However, not all children with appendicitis present with such classical symptoms and this can prolong the diagnosis. Any delay in the surgical management can lead to complications as appendicitis usually does not resolve spontaneously. Potential complications include perforation, peritonitis, abscess formation and death. Because of atypical presentations and the risk of potential complications, imaging is often requested. In children, this imaging technique is usually US.

### Imaging right lower quadrant pain: not always appendicitis [^116G2i4R]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Although acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the commonest causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain (RLQP), there are numerous other conditions in the abdomen and pelvis that can simulate the clinical presentation of AA for which imaging is essential in detection. We discuss the approach to evaluation of patients presenting with acute onset RLQP and the choice of various imaging modalities that can be utilized. Although CT remains the workhorse in evaluation, US and MRI, given lack of radiation, play an important ancillary role, particularly in the pediatric and pregnant patients. We present a spectrum of conditions presenting with RLQP which we have classified systematically ranging from conditions affecting the bowel, mesentery/omentum/peritoneum, vasculature, urinary and reproductive systems to give the reader a checklist of conditions to consider when evaluating a case of RLQP.

### Right lower-quadrant pain-more than one diagnosis [^114GQDV4]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

When a patient presents with right-lower-quadrant pain in the emergency room, the diagnosis of appendicitis must always be considered, but the differential diagnosis for this symptom includes many other etiologies. We describe a case of an 8-year-old girl with von Willebrand disease who presented with right-lower-quadrant pain and was found to have an appendiceal wall hematoma. During her evaluation, an ultrasound of the abdomen was performed, and the results were initially interpreted as an intussusception. Although ultrasound is a highly reliable way to diagnose appendicitis and intussusception, the case illustrates that the thickened abdominal wall that occurs in a mural hematoma can appear like the "target sign" that is usually associated with intussusception, and in certain clinical scenarios, alternative forms of imaging may be of value.

Appendicitis

A case of acute appendicitis during pregnancy was first reported in the literature by Hancock in 1848. It is the most common non-obstetric surgical emergency during pregnancy. It occurs in about 1 in 1000–2000 pregnancies and may occur at any time during the pregnancy. The diagnosis is more frequently missed in pregnant than in non-pregnant patients, because signs and symptoms of appendicitis, such as leukocytosis, nausea and vomiting, are also commonly seen during pregnancy. There is a question of reliability of the abdominal examination in pregnant patients suspected of having appendicitis. The classical teaching is that the location of pain from appendicitis moves progressively upward as the pregnancy progresses based on Baer's 1932 study of barium images of 78 pregnant patients. More recent retrospective studies have failed to corroborate this hypothesis showing roughly 90% of patients having pain in the right lower quadrant regardless of trimester. Maternal morbidity is usually the result of a delay in diagnosis. Fetal loss occurs in 3%–5% of pregnant patients without perforation but can be as high as 36% with perforation. This high risk of fetal loss with perforation along with the difficulty of diagnosing appendicitis in the pregnant patient explains the high rate (50% in many series) of normal appendices found at operation. Traditionally, this high rate of negative operation had not been found to increase maternal or fetal morbidity; however, recent data suggest that negative appendectomy may be associated with an increase in fetal loss. Therefore, it is important to confirm the diagnosis before heading to the operating room. Ultrasound, CT, MRI or diagnostic laparoscopy can confirm the diagnosis. Ultrasound should be the first-line study for abdominal pain in the pregnant female; however, the sensitivity ranges from only 20% to 36%. If ultrasound is indeterminate, the next study that should be ordered if available is an MRI. A review of imaging strategies for right lower quadrant pain in pregnant females performed a meta-analysis of six studies examining the role of MRI in diagnosing appendicitis in pregnant females. They found a pooled sensitivity of 0.91 and a specificity of 0.98. If MRI is unavailable, a CT may be ordered. While the diagnostic accuracy of CT for appendicitis in the non-obstetric population has been well demonstrated, there is a paucity of data for pregnant females. Two small studies looking specifically at pregnant patients demonstrated successful diagnoses of appendicitis in 5/7 patients and 12/13 patients. Protocols involving abdominal ultrasound followed by CT scan, if inconclusive, have been associated with a reduction of negative appendectomy rates. Our diagnostic algorithm for appendicitis is shown in figure 1. Appendectomy can be performed open or laparoscopicallydepending on the surgeon's comfort level with the patient's body habitus and degree of pregnancy. The laparoscopic approach has advanced to become the standard of care at many centers; this is the authors' preference as well.

### Imaging the child with right lower quadrant pain and suspected appendicitis: current concepts [^116ayjPm]. Pediatric Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common condition presenting with right lower quadrant pain requiring acute surgical intervention in childhood. The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis is often not straightforward and can be challenging. Approximately one-third of children with the condition have atypical clinical findings and are initially managed non-operatively. Complications usually result from perforation and include abscess formation, peritonitis, sepsis, bowel obstruction and death. Cross-sectional imaging with sonography and computed tomography (CT) have proven useful for the evaluation of suspected acute appendicitis in children. The principal advantages of sonography are its lower cost, lack of ionizing radiation, and ability to precisely delineate gynecologic disease. The principal advantages of CT are its operator independency with resultant higher diagnostic accuracy, enhanced delineation of disease extent in perforated appendicitis, and improved patient outcomes including decreased negative laparotomy and perforation rates.

### A simple clinical decision rule to rule out appendicitis in patients with nondiagnostic ultrasound results [^112qbFKq]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to identify a set of clinical features that can rule out appendicitis in patients with suspected acute appendicitis and nondiagnostic ultrasound (US) results, allowing safe discharge and next-day reevaluation without initial computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Methods

Data on clinical and US evaluation, including a number of prespecified variables potentially associated with acute appendicitis, were prospectively collected in two diagnostic accuracy studies of imaging. These studies included patients with suspected appendicitis seen in the emergency department (ED). For development and validation of the clinical decision rule (CDR), only patients with inconclusive or negative US results were included. There were 199 (of 422) patients in the development cohorts and 120 (of 211) patients in the validation cohort. Logistic regression analysis was used for data from patients with inconclusive or negative US results, and profiles were created of all possible combinations of predictors retained in the multivariable model. A final diagnosis was assigned by an expert panel based on perioperative data, histopathology, and clinical follow-up of at least 3 months.

Results

The CDR selected patients after negative or inconclusive US for discharge and next-day reevaluation without initial CT or MRI if fewer than two of the following predictors were present: male sex, migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, vomiting, and white blood cell (WBC) count higher than 12.0 × 10⁹/L. Applying the CDR in the development set selected 126 of 199 (63%) patients with negative or inconclusive US results for discharge without further imaging. This rule reduced the probability of appendicitis from 26% (51 of 199) in the total group of patients with negative or inconclusive US results to 12% (15 of 126) in the group that would be discharged based on the rule (p = 0.001). In the validation set (n = 120), the decision rule selected 72 (60%) patients for discharge and next-day reevaluation and reduced the probability of appendicitis from 20% (24 of 120) in the total group to 6% (4 of 72) in the patients selected on the rule (p = 0.001). The negative predictive value of the decision rule in the validation set was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 87% to 98%). In comparison, the negative predictive value of CT in the same group was 99% (95% CI = 93% to 100%, p = 0.14), and that of MRI was 99% (95% CI = 94% to 100%, p = 0.12). Alternative decision rules based on combinations of the present decision rule with C-reactive protein (CRP) results did not improve selection.

Conclusions

This newly developed CDR significantly reduces the probability of appendicitis in a large subgroup of patients with negative or inconclusive US results. These patients can be safely discharged for outpatient reevaluation without further initial imaging if proper follow-up is available. This could assist in lowering the number of ED imaging investigations in patients with suspected appendicitis.

### Performance of overnight on-call radiology residents in interpreting unenhanced abdominopelvic magnetic resonance imaging studies performed for pediatric right lower quadrant abdominal pain [^115v4hst]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute appendicitis represents a prevalent and important cause of abdominal pain in pediatric patients. Rapid diagnosis and identification of complications are vital for timely and appropriate management of this condition. Imaging plays a crucial role in evaluating children with suspected acute appendicitis and has been shown to reduce negative appendectomy rates.

Although there is no universally accepted strategy for imaging pediatric patients with suspected acute appendicitis, some guidance is available. The American College of Radiology (ACR) has recently published updated appropriateness criteria on this topic. These guidelines recommend initial evaluation with ultrasound (US) for patients with an intermediate risk of acute appendicitis based on clinical assessment, followed by further evaluation with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in cases with equivocal US findings. In the setting of a high clinical risk, the three modalities carry equivalent recommendations of "may be appropriate", while all three are "usually not appropriate" in the setting of a low clinical risk.

Ultrasound has clear benefits in the setting of pediatric right lower quadrant abdominal pain, including its lack of ionizing radiation and intravenous contrast, low cost and availability. It can achieve very high sensitivity and specificity for acute appendicitis under ideal conditions. However, the accuracy of US varies with operator skill, patient factors and clinical setting and the 2018 ACR Appropriateness Criteria make the assumption of US performance by an expert when making its recommendations. CT is more likely to be the initial diagnostic modality in a community hospital setting. The benefits and risks of CT in the diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis have been well characterized; while CT offers high diagnostic accuracy, concerns regarding radiation exposure limit its utility as a first-line test in the pediatric population.

There has been rising interest in MRI for pediatric appendicitis. Diagnostic accuracy of the modality is high, but its utility was shown in some studies to be limited by long imaging times (often requiring sedation in children) and the need for gadolinium-based intravenous contrast administration. However, advances in MRI protocols have allowed for rapid non-contrast examinations that maintain a high degree of sensitivity/specificity. A recent study demonstrated the efficacy of MRI when employed as a first-line modality in pediatric patients suspected of having acute appendicitis.

### Clinical, ultrasonographic, and pathologic characteristics of patients with chronic right-lower-quadrant abdominal pain that may benefit from appendectomy [^116DSkkf]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pains of the right lower quadrant of the abdomen (RLQA) remain a challenging problem worldwide, especially in areas with limited technical background; chronic appendicitis is still a subject of controversy. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and paraclinical data of patients with chronic pains of RLQA who had an appendectomy performed.

Methods

During a period of 4 years, all patients presenting with a chronic pain of the RLQA were selected for our study and underwent clinical assessment and systematic ultrasonography of the abdomen; these served as a basis of selecting candidates for appendectomy. The intraoperative findings, histology results, and outcome after appendectomy were analyzed.

Results

Three hundred nineteen patients presented with chronic pains of the RLQA of which 213 could be finally analyzed; their mean age was 15.3 years; 192 patients were females. They had pains for 2–8 years. Echography showed a heterogeneous lesion in the RLQA in 87% of the cases. The operative findings displayed adhesions and other signs of chronic inflammation in 182 cases. Pathological analysis frequently revealed fibrosis and lymphoplasmocytic infiltration indicative of chronic inflammation. Eighty-seven percent of the patients were cured by appendectomy.

Conclusions

There is a chronic process involving the appendix that occurs in the RLQA of patients with chronic pains, typically the adolescent female. Appendectomy usually solves the problem. The criteria for selection of candidates still need to be identified, but in the absence of laparoscopic facilities, we recommend appendectomy when no other cause for the pain has been identified.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^115Gcr3R]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Diagnostic accuracy

Table 2shows the accuracy results for each strategy. Figure 3shows these results plotted in a receiver operating characteristics space (see web appendix for more information on the receiver operating characteristics space). The clinical diagnosis with or without plain radiographs had a high sensitivity but lacked specificity for urgent cases. Compared with the clinical diagnosis, the use of ultrasonography in all patients (ultrasonography strategy) reduced the number of false positive urgent diagnoses, but 30% of urgent conditions would still be missed. Ultrasonography as a single test was inferior to CT as a single test (CT strategy) for the detection of urgent conditions, as the sensitivity was significantly higher for CT (89%) than for ultrasonography (70%, P < 0.001). The sensitivities of both strategies were not significantly higher than with clinical evaluation alone; only specificities were significantly improved.

The performance of ultrasonography was stable between the participating centres. The sensitivity of 65% (95% confidence interval 58% to 72%) for ultrasonography done by residents without supervision after working hours was significantly lower than sensitivity of 74% (69% to 74%) for ultrasonography by radiologists (P = 0.03). The sensitivity was 69% (82% to 91%) for ultrasonography done by residents under supervision, which was not significantly lower than for ultrasonography done by radiologists (P = 0.20). The specificity for urgent conditions did not differ significantly between radiologists and supervised or unsupervised residents (P = 0.70).

Conclusions

In conclusion, this study highlights the significant role of ultrasound in diagnosing acute abdominal pain in pediatric patients at a tertiary care center in Shiraz, Iran. Ultrasound proved effective in identifying both common and rare conditions, with the majority of cases showing normal findings, underscoring the importance of clinical assessment in determining the need for further imaging. Key clinical features such as right lower quadrant pain, elevated CRP levels, and abnormal urine results were linked to specific ultrasound abnormalities, while common symptoms like nausea and vomiting did not reliably correlate with sonographic findings. The study also emphasizes the need for localized research to tailor diagnostic protocols according to regional healthcare settings.

### Left lower-quadrant pain: guidelines from the American college of radiology appropriateness criteria [^113Y3yaq]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of left lower-quadrant pain includes gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and renal/ureteric pathology. Imaging is helpful in evaluating left lower-quadrant pain, and is generally guided by the clinical presentation. Acute sigmoid diverticulitis should be suspected when the clinical triad of left lower-quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis is present. The severity of disease varies from mild pericolonic and peridiverticular inflammation to severe inflammatory changes with complications such as perforation, peritonitis, or abscess or fistula formation. Computed tomography is the preferred test in evaluating clinically suspected diverticulitis. It is used to evaluate the severity and extent of disease and to identify complications, but it also may diagnose other causes of left lower-quadrant pain that can mimic diverticulitis. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess left lower-quadrant pain. It has superior resolution of soft tissues and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation, but it is expensive and requires more time to perform. Transabdominal ultrasonography with graded compression is another effective technique but is limited by its high operator dependency and technical difficulties in scanning patients who are obese. Pelvic ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality in women of childbearing age. Radiography with contrast enema is less sensitive than computed tomography in diagnosing diverticulitis and is seldom used.

### Diagnostic accuracy of laboratory and ultrasound findings in patients with a non-visualized appendix [^117CtoGR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound (US) and laboratory testing are initial diagnostic tests for acute appendicitis. A diagnostic dilemma develops when the appendix is not visualized on US. Objective: To determine if specific US findings and/or laboratory results predict acute appendicitis when the appendix is not visualized. Methods: A prospective study was conducted on children (birth-18 yrs) presenting to the pediatric emergency department with suspected acute appendicitis who underwent right lower quadrant US. Children with previous appendectomy, US at another facility, or eloped were excluded. US findings analyzed: inflammatory changes, right lower quadrant and lower abdominal fluid, tenderness during US exam and lymph nodes. Diagnoses were confirmed via surgical pathology. Results 1252 subjects were enrolled, 60.8% (762) had appendix visualized and 39.1% (490) did not. In children where the appendix was not seen, 6.7% [33] were diagnosed with appendicitis. Among patients with a non-visualized appendix, the likelihood of appendicitis was significantly greater if: inflammatory changes in the RLQ (OR 18.0, 95% CI 4.5–72.1), CRP > 0.5 mg/dL (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.0–6.8), or WBC > 10 (OR 4.36, 95% CI 1.66–11.58). Duration of abdominal pain > 3 days was significantly less likely associated with appendicitis in this model (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.003–0.395). Combined, the absence inflammatory changes, CRP < 0.5 mg/dL, WBC < 10, and pain, ≤ 3 days had a NPV of 94.0%. Conclusion When the appendix is not visualized on US, predictors for appendicitis include the presence of inflammatory changes in the RLQ, an elevated WBC/CRP and abdominal pain < 3 days.

### US of right upper quadrant pain in the emergency department: diagnosing beyond gallbladder and biliary disease [^112jNZ25]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is the most common diagnosable cause for right upper quadrant abdominal (RUQ) pain in patients who present to the emergency department (ED). However, over one-third of patients initially thought to have acute cholecystitis actually have RUQ pain attributable to other causes. Ultrasonography (US) is the primary imaging modality of choice for initial imaging assessment and serves as a fast, cost-effective, and dynamic modality to provide a definitive diagnosis or a considerably narrowed list of differential possibilities. Multiple organ systems are included at standard RUQ US, and a variety of ultrasonographically diagnosable disease processes can be identified, including conditions of hepatic, pancreatic, adrenal, renal, gastrointestinal, vascular, and thoracic origin, all of which may result in RUQ pain. In certain cases, subsequent computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR cholangiopancreatography, or cholescintigraphy may be considered, depending on the clinical situation and US findings. Familiarity with the spectrum of disease processes outside of the gallbladder and biliary tree that may manifest with RUQ pain and recognition at US of these alternative conditions is pivotal for early diagnosis and appropriate management. Diagnosis at the time of initial US can reduce unnecessary imaging and its consequences, including excess cost, radiation exposure, nephrotoxic contrast medium use, and time to diagnosis, thereby translating into improved patient care and outcome. This article (a) reviews the causes of RUQ pain identifiable at US using an organ-system approach, (b) illustrates the US appearance of select conditions from each organ system with multimodality imaging correlates, and (c) discusses the relevant pathophysiology and treatment of these entities to aid in efficient direction of management.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute left upper quadrant pain [^115qtMc8]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints encountered in the emergency department and outpatient setting. Across all sites, the left upper quadrant (LUQ) is the least common location for abdominal pain with reportedly the lowest physical examination interrater agreement. The limited sensitivity of physical examination, combined with an uncommon and nonspecific clinical presentation, make assessment of LUQ pain challenging. Acute LUQ pain may arise directly from the spleen or infections in the LUQ, or represent referred pain from other organs such as stomach, bowels, pancreas, or kidney. This document aims to address acute pain with suspected splenomegaly, with fever, and not otherwise specified. CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast is usually appropriate for detection of a broad range of pathologies. In patients with suspected splenomegaly, ultrasound abdomen is also usually an appropriate alternate for initial imaging. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: evaluation and diagnosis [^112BidjC]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes are gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain should be considered. Pain location, history, and examination findings help guide the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability. Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing. Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. Conditions such as urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases. Imaging studies are chosen based on the location of pain and index of suspicion for specific etiologies. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is often chosen for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can aid in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis. In patients who have female reproductive organs, diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion should be considered. If ultrasonography results are inconclusive in pregnant patients, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred over computed tomography when available.

### Cost and radiation savings of partial substitution of ultrasound for CT in appendicitis evaluation: a national projection [^112WmpjU]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The costs of an ultrasound-CT protocol and a CT-only protocol for an appendicitis evaluation are compared. For the ultrasound-CT protocol, patients with right lower quadrant abdominal pain undergo an ultrasound examination. If it is positive for appendicitis, they are sent directly to surgery, avoiding CT.

Materials and Methods

A comparative effectiveness research study was conducted. The costs of imaging tests, excess surgeries, and excess surgical deaths for the ultrasound-CT protocol and the costs of imaging tests and excess cancer deaths in the CT-only protocol were estimated. Data sources were Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) datasets, national hospital discharge surveys, radiology information system cases, and U.S. Census Bureau life tables. A meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses were also conducted.

Results

The meta-analysis showed a positive predictive value of 92.5% for CT and 91.0% for ultrasound. Analysis of CMS files showed that utilization of CT was almost exactly 2.0 examinations (one abdominal and one pelvic) per patient and for ultrasound was almost nil. The cost of this imaging protocol was $547 per patient, whereas the cost of a limited ultrasound study would be $88 per patient. For the total U.S. population, the cost savings in imaging minus the cost of extra surgeries and extra surgical deaths is $24.9 million per year. Following model VII proposed by the Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR), which is known as "BEIR VII", the avoidance of a 12.4-mSv exposure for 262,500 persons would prevent 180 excess cancer deaths. The value of the years of life lost would be $339.5 million. The sensitivity analyses indicate that the cost savings are robust.

Conclusion

An ultrasound-CT protocol for appendicitis evaluation offers potentially large savings over the standard CT-only protocol. There are moderate savings from using a less expensive imaging technique despite extra surgeries and large savings from radiation exposure avoided.

### Diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and point-of-care ultrasound for pediatric acute appendicitis in the emergency department: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114kGxGX]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common surgical emergency in children. Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial but challenging due to atypical presentations and the inherent difficulty of obtaining a reliable history and physical examination in younger children.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the utility of history, physical examination, laboratory tests, Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) and Emergency Department Point-of-Care Ultrasound (ED-POCUS) in the diagnosis of AA in ED pediatric patients. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis and used a test-treatment threshold model to identify diagnostic findings that could rule in/out AA and obviate the need for further imaging studies, specifically computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and radiology department ultrasound (RUS).

Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS up to October 2016 for studies on ED pediatric patients with abdominal pain. Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) was used to evaluate the quality and applicability of included studies. Positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) for diagnostic modalities were calculated and when appropriate data was pooled using Meta-DiSc. Based on the available literature on the test characteristics of different imaging modalities and applying the Pauker-Kassirer method we developed a test-treatment threshold model.

Results

Twenty-one studies were included encompassing 8,605 patients with weighted AA prevalence of 39.2%. Studies had variable quality using the QUADAS-2 tool with most studies at high risk of partial verification bias. We divided studies based on their inclusion criteria into two groups of "undifferentiated abdominal pain" and abdominal pain "suspected of AA". In patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain, history of "pain migration to right lower quadrant (RLQ)" (LR+ = 4.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.59–6.44) and presence of "cough/hop pain" in the physical examination (LR+ = 7.64, 95% CI = 5.94–9.83) were most strongly associated with AA. In patients suspected of AA none of the history or laboratory findings were strongly associated with AA. Rovsing's sign was the physical examination finding most strongly associated with AA (LR+ = 3.52, 95% CI = 2.65–4.68). Among different PAS cutoff points, PAS ≥ 9 (LR+ = 5.26, 95% CI = 3.34–8.29) was most associated with AA. None of the history, physical examination, laboratory tests findings, or PAS alone could rule in or rule out AA in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain or those suspected of AA. ED-POCUS had LR+ of 9.24 (95% CI = 6.24–13.28) and LR- of 0.17 (95% CI = 0.09–0.30). Using our test-treatment threshold model, positive ED-POCUS could rule in AA without the use of CT and MRI, but negative ED-POCUS could not rule out AA.

Conclusion

Presence of AA is more likely in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain migrating to the RLQ or when cough/hop pain is present in the physical examination. Once AA is suspected, no single history, physical examination, laboratory finding, or score attained on PAS can eliminate the need for imaging studies. Operating characteristics of ED-POCUS are similar to those reported for RUS in literature for diagnosis of AA. In ED patients suspected of AA, a positive ED-POCUS is diagnostic and obviates the need for CT or MRI while negative ED-POCUS is not enough to rule out AA.

### Reducing computed tomography scans for appendicitis by introduction of a standardized and validated ultrasonography report template [^114r9oSK]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of appendicitis is associated with radiation exposure and increased cost. In an effort to reduce the diagnostic use of CT scans, we implemented a standardized ultrasound report template based on validated secondary signs of appendicitis.

Methods

In September 2012, as part of a quality improvement project, we developed and introduced a four category standardized ultrasound report template for limited right lower quadrant abdominal ultrasounds. Outcomes for patients undergoing ultrasound or CT scan for appendicitis between 9/10/2012 and 12/31/2013 (Period 2, n = 2033) were compared to the three months prior to implementation (Period 1, n = 304).

Results

In Period 1, 78 of 304 (25.7%) patients had appendicitis versus 385 of 2033 (18.9%) in Period 2 (p = 0.006). Non-diagnostic exams decreased from 48% to 0.1% (p < 0.001). Ultrasound sensitivity improved from 66.67% to 92.2% (p < 0.001). Specificity did not significantly change (96.9% to 97.69%, p = 0.46). CT utilization for appendicitis decreased from 44.3% in Period 1 to 14.5% at the end of Period 2 (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Implementation of a standardized ultrasound report template based on validated secondary signs of appendicitis nearly eliminated non-diagnostic exams, improved diagnostic accuracy, and resulted in a striking decrease in CT utilization.

### Does oral radiocontrast affect image quality of abdominal sonography? [^117Va5kD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Emergency Department patients with abdominal pain may require both an ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) for an accurate diagnosis. Patients are often asked to drink oral radiocontrast while awaiting ultrasound, in order to better expedite a CT in the case of a non-diagnostic US. The impact of oral radiocontrast on US image quality has not been studied. We compared the quality of US images obtained before and after the ingestion of oral radiocontrast in healthy adult volunteers.

Methods

This was a prospective study in which adult volunteer subjects underwent sonographic studies of the aorta, the right upper quadrant, the right lower quadrant, and the Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) examination. Initial studies were performed prior to ingestion of oral radiocontrast, with subsequent imaging occurring at 1 and 2hour post-ingestion. All of the images from the sonographic exams were randomized and subsequently scored for quality by two emergency ultrasound fellowship trained emergency physicians with extensive experience in performing and interpreting US.

Results

638 images from 240 exams were obtained from 20 subjects at three time points. Six exams were not scored due to inadequate images. There were no significant differences in image quality for any of the US exam types after the ingestion of oral radiocontrast at 1 and 2h.

Conclusion

Ingestion of oral radiocontrast did not affect image quality of four common abdominal ultrasound examinations.

### Clinical and imaging mimickers of acute appendicitis in the pediatric population [^116kxxEY]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to present the imaging appearance of common mimickers of appendicitis in children with right lower quadrant pain.

Conclusion

The majority of children who undergo imaging for suspected appendicitis will end up having an alternative diagnosis. These mimickers can be gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or pulmonary. Familiarity with these alternative diagnoses can aid in the challenging task of imaging right lower quadrant pain in the pediatric population.

### Routine ultrasound and limited computed tomography for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis [^112GvM9D]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The consequences of routine imaging for patients with potentially resolving appendicitis goes beyond the scope of this study. Future investigations will have to focus on this issue.

Having said all this, it must not be forgotten that thorough clinical evaluation is the cornerstone of every ED assessment for a patient with acute abdominal pain. In 7 out of 8 cases in which the radiological diagnosis was overruled, the surgeon did so rightly. The radiological result must always be interpreted in light of the clinical assessment of the patient.

### Role of ultrasound and CT in the workup of right upper quadrant pain in adults in the emergency department: a retrospective review of more than 2800 cases [^111ohNPF]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to compare ultrasound and CT in the diagnostic evaluation of right upper quadrant pain in adults in the emergency department. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective review was conducted of adult emergency department encounters for right upper quadrant pain over a 5-year period, excluding those for prior cholecystectomy, current pregnancy, and trauma. Imaging study reports were reviewed for gallbladder and nongallbladder explanations of right upper quadrant pain and were considered positive for cholecystitis when two or more supportive features were present. Encounter outcomes were evaluated on the basis of pathology data and clinical management. RESULTS. Among the encounters, 2859 met the study inclusion criteria, and 18% met the study definition of cholecystitis by pathologic or clinical criteria. The following metrics showed no statistically significant difference between ultrasound and CT, respectively: sensitivity, 61% and 55%; specificity, 91% and 92%; positive predictive value, 63% and 63%; and negative predictive value, 91% and 90%. Both modalities were performed in 20% of encounters. In the subgroup analysis, ultrasound showed an acute nongallbladder abnormality that was missed at a preceding CT examination in only 1 of 238 cases (0.4%). CT showed an acute nongallbladder abnormality missed at a preceding ultrasound examination in 103 of 322 cases (32%). CONCLUSION. CT is noninferior to ultrasound in both ruling in and ruling out the diagnosis of cholecystitis in adult patients undergoing emergency evaluation of right upper quadrant pain and offers the advantage of depicting acute nongallbladder abnormalities.

### Restrictive strategy versus usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with gallstones and abdominal pain (SECURE): a multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, non-inferiority trial [^116KhQ8g]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

International guidelines advise laparoscopic cholecystectomy to treat symptomatic, uncomplicated gallstones. Usual care regarding cholecystectomy is associated with practice variation and persistent post-cholecystectomy pain in 10–41% of patients. We aimed to compare the non-inferiority of a restrictive strategy with stepwise selection with usual care to assess (in)efficient use of cholecystectomy.

Methods

We did a multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, non-inferiority study in 24 academic and non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands. We enrolled patients aged 18–95 years with abdominal pain and ultrasound-proven gallstones or sludge. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either usual care in which selection for cholecystectomy was left to the discretion of the surgeon, or a restrictive strategy with stepwise selection for cholecystectomy. For the restrictive strategy, cholecystectomy was advised for patients who fulfilled all five pre-specified criteria of the triage instrument: 1) severe pain attacks, 2) pain lasting 15–30 min or longer, 3) pain located in epigastrium or right upper quadrant, 4) pain radiating to the back, and 5) a positive pain response to simple analgesics. Randomisation was done with an online program, implemented into a web-based application using blocks of variable sizes, and stratified for centre (academic versus non-academic and a high vs low number of patients), sex, and body-mass index. Physicians and patients were masked for study-arm allocation until after completion of the triage instrument. The primary, non-inferiority, patient-reported endpoint was the proportion of patients who were pain-free at 12 months' follow-up, analysed by intention to treat and per protocol. A 5% non-inferiority margin was chosen, based on the estimated clinically relevant difference. Safety analyses were also done in the intention-to treat population. This trial is registered at the Netherlands National Trial Register, number NTR4022.

Findings

Between Feb 5, 2014, and April 25, 2017, we included 1067 patients for analysis: 537 assigned to usual care and 530 to the restrictive strategy. At 12 months' follow-up 298 patients (56%; 95% CI, 52·0–60·4) were pain-free in the restrictive strategy group, compared with 321 patients (60%, 55·6–63·8) in usual care. Non-inferiority was not shown (difference 3·6%; one-sided 95% lower CI -8·6%; p non-inferiority = 0·316). According to a secondary endpoint analysis, the restrictive strategy resulted in significantly fewer cholecystectomies than usual care (358 [68%] of 529 vs 404 [75%] of 536; p = 0·01). There were no between-group differences in trial-related gallstone complications (40 patients [8%] of 529 in usual care vs 38 [7%] of 536 in restrictive strategy; p = 0·16) and surgical complications (74 [21%] of 358 vs 88 [22%] of 404, p = 0·77), or in non-trial-related serious adverse events (27 [5%] of 529 vs 29 [5%] of 526).

Interpretation

Suboptimal pain reduction in patients with gallstones and abdominal pain was noted with both usual care and following a restrictive strategy for selection for cholecystectomy. However, the restrictive strategy was associated with fewer cholecystectomies. The findings should encourage physicians involved in the care of patients with gallstones to rethink cholecystectomy, and to be more careful in advising a surgical approach in patients with gallstones and abdominal symptoms.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^114cvf3s]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America ICU fever guidelines — abdominal ultrasound can potentially diagnose acalculous cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, liver or kidney abscesses, perforated bowel, ascites, and/or appendicitis as potential sources of fever, and in surgical patients can identify surgical wound abscesses and determine if they are amenable to drainage. Acalculous cholecystitis, an important but often unrecognized cause of fever in critically ill patients, may be suspected with right upper quadrant pain, although this is commonly absent; in patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin, abdominal ultrasound may be helpful in diagnosing the cause of a febrile episode. However, a lack of data on false-positive and false-negative results in patients without abdominal signs or symptoms precludes a firm recommendation supporting routine diagnostic abdominal ultrasound.

### Evaluating patients with right upper quadrant pain [^117DxLpY]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Many disorders of the liver, gallbladder, and biliary tree may cause right upper quadrant pain and clinical diagnosis may be challenging. Imaging plays a key role in establishing a prompt diagnosis and guiding appropriate management. Although ultrasonography is the initial imaging modality of choice for most hepatobiliary disorders, radionuclide imaging, computed tomography (CT), and MR imaging also play important roles. Acute cholecystitis may be associated with many complications that have characteristic imaging features. MR cholangiopancreatography achieves high accuracy in diagnosis of choledocholithiasis and allows for noninvasive imaging when ultrasonography and CT are indeterminate.

### Clinical relevance of the nonvisualized appendix on ultrasonography of the abdomen in children [^113G8ZEr]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical relevance of the nonvisualized appendix on ultrasound imaging in children with right lower quadrant pain.

Study Design

We reviewed 1359 children admitted for abdominal pain between January and December 2013 who had abdominal ultrasound imaging for right lower quadrant pain. Patients who had scans for genitourinary symptoms or intussusception were excluded from the study. When the appendix was not visualized, secondary signs indicating right lower quadrant inflammatory pathology were noted.

Results

Of all admissions for abdominal pain, 810 had ultrasound scans. Thirty-eight did not evaluate the appendix and 131 were excluded for suspected intussusception, leaving 641 reports for children with a median age of 10.8 years (range, 1.3–21.3); 297 were boys (46.3%). There were 17 of 160 patients with a nonvisualized appendix (10.6%) who underwent appendectomy. Of these, 14 had secondary signs on ultrasound imaging and 3 (1.9%) had normal ultrasound reports. The 3 patients with normal ultrasound imaging had computed tomography imaging confirming appendicitis. There were 51 patients with a partially visualized appendix. The segment of appendix that could be seen was normal in 34 patients, none of whom had appendectomy. The remaining 17 had appendectomy, in whom the appendix seemed to be inflamed in 13 and equivocal in 4, all with histologically confirmed appendicitis. Overall, 232 children underwent appendectomy; 58 had no ultrasound imaging done, and 5 had a histologically normal appendix (overall negative appendectomy rate, 2.2%). Only 35 of 1359 patients (0.03%) had computed tomography scans.

Conclusion

In patients with a nonvisualized appendix on ultrasound imaging and no evidence of secondary inflammatory changes, the likelihood of appendicitis is less than 2%. Generous use of ultrasonography as an adjunct to clinical examination can achieve low negative appendectomy rates without underdiagnosis of acute appendicitis.

### Ultrasound in emergency medicinePoint-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for isolated pediatric dysuria: an unusual presentation of acute appendicitis [^111gBjJQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Isolated complaint of dysuria in an adolescent is a rare presentation for acute perforated appendicitis. Acute appendicitis typically involves vague periumbical pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, associated with pain, nausea, and loss of appetite. There have been case reports of associated pyuria and dysuria in addition to classical symptoms, but to our knowledge, this is the first case with isolated dysuria presenting to an emergency department (ED).

Case Report

A 14-year-old boy presented to the ED with 3 days of dysuria and subsequent sensation of urinary retention. Urine dip showed occult blood without white cells or nitrites. A bedside renal/bladder point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) did not show evidence of obstruction. However, it did reveal a retrovesicular fluid collection with an echogenic foci inside suspicious for abscess, likely secondary to ruptured appendicitis. This diagnosis was confirmed with a dedicated right lower quadrant ultrasound, with resultant treatment with i.v. antibiotics and eventual surgical resection of the appendix. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Pediatric and adolescent patients may present with extremely atypical symptoms of a common disease process. In this case, early use of POCUS in the ED helped to quickly identify an acute surgical process and focus diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

### Diagnostic value of ultrasound in pediatric acute abdominal pain: a cross-sectional study from a tertiary center in Southern iran [^114BL1Tu]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute abdominal pain is a common yet diagnostically challenging presentation in pediatric emergency care due to nonspecific symptoms. While ultrasound offers a safe and accessible diagnostic tool, its clinical utility and correlation with laboratory markers remain understudied in many regions, including Iran. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and diagnostic value of ultrasound findings and their association with clinical and laboratory indicators.

Methods

This cross-sectional study included 174 children aged 5–18 years who presented with acute abdominal pain to the emergency department of Namazi Hospital, Shiraz, Iran, between 2021 and 2022. Demographic data, clinical features, laboratory results, and ultrasound findings were recorded. Associations between sonographic abnormalities and clinical/laboratory parameters were analyzed using appropriate statistical tests.

Results

Ultrasound revealed abnormal findings in 59 (33.9%) patients. The most common sonographic diagnoses were abdominal free fluid (7.5%), appendicitis (4.6%), renal stones (2.9%), and intestinal obstruction (2.9%). Right lower quadrant pain and elevated CRP levels (> 20 mg/L) were significantly associated with appendicitis (p = 0.018 and p = 0.012, respectively). Positive urine protein and blood were significantly associated with renal stones (p = 0.01 and p = 0.003). The majority (79.3%) of ultrasounds were normal, highlighting the role of clinical assessment in determining the necessity of imaging.

Conclusions

Ultrasound is a valuable diagnostic tool in pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain, identifying both common and rare conditions. The study highlights the importance of clinical assessment in determining the need for further imaging and the necessity of localized research to inform diagnostic protocols in regional healthcare settings.

### Routine versus selective abdominal computed tomography scan in the evaluation of right lower quadrant pain: a randomized controlled trial [^117XDi6k]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the role of abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging in patients with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain. The authors hypothesized that selective use of abdominal CT would reduce imaging without increasing the rates of negative appendectomy and perforated appendicitis.

Methods

A prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted in a community teaching emergency department. Adult patients with acute RLQ abdominal pain with suspected acute appendicitis were included. Patients were randomized to mandatory (all patients) or selective (based on clinical evaluation) abdominal CT imaging. The primary outcome was the negative appendectomy rate.

Results

A total of 152 patients were randomized to selective (n = 80) and mandatory (n = 72) intervention groups. The mean (± SD) age was 34.1 (± 3.5) years, and 48% were female. CT imaging was performed in 54 of 80 patients (68%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 56% to 78%) in the selective group and in 70 of 72 patients (97%; 95% CI = 90% to 100%) in the mandatory group. There was a trend to a decreased rate of negative appendectomy in the mandatory group (1/39 [2.6%]; 95% CI = 0.5% to 13.2%) as compared with the selective group (6/43 [13.9%]; 95% CI = 6.6% to 27.3%), with a difference in prevalence rates of 11.3% (95% CI = -3.5% to 26.3%). There was also a trend to a decreased perforated appendix rate in the mandatory group (4/39 [10.3%]) as compared with the selective group (7/38 [18.4%]), with a difference in prevalence rates of 8.2% (95% CI = -8.0% to 24.4%).

Conclusions

In this small sample of adult patients with RLQ abdominal pain and suspected acute appendicitis, CT imaging was performed less frequently in the selective group and there was a trend with mandatory CT imaging to reduced rates of negative appendectomy and perforated appendices.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^114LkTft]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

General medical — abdominal pain assessment for suspected appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, and pyelonephritis lists condition-specific findings. Appendicitis findings include focal right lower quadrant tenderness possibly with rebound and guarding, right lower quadrant tenderness noted during palpation of the left lower quadrant (positive Rovsing's sign), peri-umbilical or diffuse abdominal tenderness with palpation of the abdomen/pelvis, fever, nausea/vomiting, and lack of appetite. Acute cholecystitis findings include right upper quadrant or epigastric tenderness, fever, nausea and vomiting, and history of gallstones. Pyelonephritis findings include fever, nausea/vomiting, urinary frequency/urgency, dysuria, hematuria, back/flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness to percussion.

### Sonography of acute right lower quadrant pain: importance of increased intraabdominal fat echo [^111hC5sX]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to assess the diagnostic usefulness of increased intraabdominal fat echo during the sonographic evaluation of patients with acute right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain.

Subjects and Methods

A total of 328 consecutive patients (132 male and 196 female; mean age, 28 ± 15 [SD] years) with acute RLQ pain prospectively underwent transabdominal sonography by one of three experienced radiologists. The radiologists prospectively graded intraabdominal fat echo using a 3-point scale: 1, normal; 2, slight increase; and 3, marked and diffuse increase. Final diagnoses were made using surgical or pathologic findings or by clinical follow-up. Of the 328 patients, 11 were lost to follow-up and excluded from analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of increased intraabdominal fat echo were calculated for a positive final diagnosis.

Results

Final diagnoses were negative (n = 103), acute appendicitis (n = 137), right colonic diverticulitis (n = 18), mesenteric lymphadenitis (n = 13), enteritis (n = 26), and others (n = 20). Grades of intraabdominal fat echo were grade 1 (n = 158), grade 2 (n = 35), and grade 3 (n = 124). Overall, fat echo grades 2 or 3 were more frequently observed in patients with a positive final diagnosis (73% [157/214] vs 2% [2/103], p < 0.001) than in those with a negative final diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of increased intraabdominal fat echo for a positive final diagnosis were 73%, 98%, 81%, 99%, and 64%. Increased intraabdominal fat echo was documented in 89% (122/137) of cases of acute appendicitis and in 100% (18/18) of cases of right colonic diverticulitis.

Conclusion

An increased intraabdominal fat echo on sonography is highly specific for the presence of RLQ inflammatory disease.

### MR imaging of acute right lower quadrant pain in pregnant and nonpregnant patients [^116gTAEA]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

The use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of acute abdominal pain is increasing, particularly in those circumstances where computed tomography (CT) is not desirable (eg, pregnancy, allergy to iodinated contrast material). Although ultrasonography (US) is considered the imaging study of choice for evaluation of abdominal pain in pregnant patients, MR imaging is a valuable adjunct to US in evaluation of pregnant patients with acute right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain who have inconclusive US results. MR imaging is also frequently used in patients with renal failure, in whom the use of iodinated contrast material is contraindicated, as well as in cases where CT results are inconclusive. In patients with acute RLQ pain, the breadth of abnormalities visible at MR imaging is very broad, with pathologic conditions potentially originating from multiple organ systems, but most commonly from the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems. MR imaging is an excellent imaging modality for evaluation of RLQ pain and should be strongly considered in those patients in whom use of iodinated contrast media or radiation is not desirable.

### Routine ultrasound and limited computed tomography for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis [^1165kjfQ]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Clinical evaluation alone is not accurate enough to manage patients with suspected appendicitis adequately. A diagnostic pathway using routine US, limited CT, and clinical re-evaluation for patients with acute abdominal pain provided excellent results for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis. The use of ionizing radiation was minimal and diagnostic laparoscopy was unnecessary to achieve these results.

### Extra scrotal spermatocele causing lower abdominal pain: a first case report [^1167a5f1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Lower quadrant abdominal pain is a common complaint evaluated in emergency departments (EDs). The number of differential diagnoses is lowered when the pain in a male patient is associated with a palpable tender mass. These diagnoses include inguinal hernia, inflamed inguinal lymph node, rectus sheath hematoma, cryptorchidism, mass derived from the spermatic cord, and polyorchidism. We report a case of extra scrotal spermatocele causing lower quadrant abdominal pain that was misdiagnosed as an inguinal hernia on several ED visits. Lower quadrant mass and pain caused by a spermatocele are unusual conditions. Upon the patient's third (ED) visit, the painful mass remained located in his right lower quadrant. The lower quadrant mass was movable on palpation and with pressure could be delivered into the superior aspect of the scrotum. The patient had an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan and lower quadrant ultrasound. The imaging studies revealed the mass to be a cystic structure. Surgical excision confirmed that the mass was a spermatocele. Differential diagnoses, diagnostic approaches, and treatment are discussed.

Materials and methods

Enrollment of patients

Three hundred patients, referred to the radiology department at Stockholm South General Hospital, for any diagnostic abdominal US examination, were enrolled between October 2011 and November 2012, and informed consent was obtained. Exclusion criteria were age < 18 years, inability to communicate with the examiner and referrals concerning metastases of the liver or contrast-enhanced examinations.

Data collection

Enrolled patients received one US examination by the study surgeon as well as the standard US examination by the on-duty radiologist. The examining surgeon and radiologist were blinded to each other's findings, and examinations were done right after one another when possible, and always within 6 h from each other. The surgeon took a short history from the patient and then performed the US, following a standardized protocol. Each examination took the surgeon approximately 15 min (10–20) to perform. The on-duty radiologist performed a standard care US focusing on the individual referrals, and each examination took approximately 10 min (5–15). Among the radiologists, the major part of the scans was done by US-specialized radiologists with several years of training (73% of the scans were performed by specialists in radiology and the remaining 27% by radiologists in specialist training). The surgeons used a portable US machine of the model LOGIQ e with a convex (1.6–4.6 MHz) or linear (5–13 MHz) transducer, GE Healthcare, WuXi, China. The radiologists used Philips iU22 with a convex C5–1 or a linear L12–5 transducer.

Criteria for patient inclusion

Patients with suspected biliary disease and/or suspected appendicitis were considered eligible for inclusion. Suspected biliary disease was defined as patients presenting with pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) and/or tenderness in the RUQ during physical examination and/or with a referral to the radiology department regarding gallstones and/or cholecystitis.

Suspected appendicitis was defined as patients presenting with pain in the right lower quadrant and/or tenderness in the right lower quadrant and/or with a referral to the radiology department regarding appendicitis.

### Nongynecologic causes of pelvic pain: ultrasound first [^113ryu8z]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Ultrasonography (US) is often the first-line imaging study used to evaluate women who present with acute or chronic pelvic pain. Detection of nongynecologic causes of pelvic pain is critical, because delay in diagnosis can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Evaluation of these entities requires a variety of transducers to achieve optimal imaging depth and changes in patient positioning. Specific imaging techniques (such as graded compression) may be required if bowel pathology is suspected. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography is increasingly used to improve detection of certain entities. The US appearance of common gastrointestinal and urinary tract-related causes of pelvic pain is reviewed.

### Rapid, free-breathing non-contrast MRI for evaluation of gynecologic pathologies in the emergency department: a retrospective cohort study [^114r3nV8]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Ultrasound (US) is the gold standard for evaluation of pelvic organs, however, achieving a full bladder can be challenging for children. Recent studies have shown excellent diagnostic performance of rapid MRI for acute appendicitis. As MRI becomes more prevalent in the evaluation of right lower quadrant pain, its use for gynecologic indications should be reevaluated.

Methods

A retrospective review of patients who had rapid MRI examinations performed in the ED for right lower quadrant pain at a single institution was conducted from August 2022 through August 2023. A time-matched control group with US evaluation for the same indication was obtained. A rapid, non-contrast three-sequence free-breathing MRI protocol was utilized.

Results

Of the 376 rapid MRI exams performed for the indication of right lower quadrant pain, 49 were noted to have gynecologic pathology identified. Of the 250 time-matched US controls, 51 were noted to have gynecologic pathology. Median MRI scan time (first image to last image) was 10 minutes. Total length of stay in the ED was significantly shorter in the rapid MRI group than controls (median 338 minutes versus 442 minutes, p < 0.05). Time to imaging diagnosis was significantly shorter in the rapid MRI group (201 minutes versus 285 minutes, p < 0.01). Time to gynecology consult was not significantly different between groups (238 minutes versus 253 minutes, p = 0.66).

Conclusions

First-line, rapid MRI for evaluation of gynecologic processes can provide imaging diagnoses faster than using US and results in lower overall lengths of stay in the ED.

Objective

To present a case report of a spontaneous, heterotopic, triplet conception of a patient without any risk factors.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Community hospital in Park Ridge, Illinois.

Patient(S)

One patient, 30-year-old multigravida, sent to the emergency room for evaluation of right lower quadrant pain after confirmed identification of an early, intrauterine pregnancy by an office ultrasound. The patient was taken to the operating room for suspected appendicitis and found to have a right ruptured ectopic pregnancy with a normal appendix.

Intervention(S)

The patient underwent a laparoscopic right salpingostomy with hydrodissection of the ectopic pregnancy.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Follow-up pelvic ultrasounds confirmed a viable, spontaneous twin intrauterine pregnancy.

Result(S)

The twin pregnancy continued without complications until 34 weeks' gestation, when the patient began preterm labor and delivered healthy twins.

Conclusion(S)

Even in the absence of infertility treatments and/or risk factors, heterotopic pregnancy should be included in the differential diagnosis for lower quadrant abdominal or pelvic pain.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^115CmY7q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal pain is very common presentation to emergency department. It is vital that the physician has an understanding and be familiar with the presentations of common diseases that cause abdominal pain. Patients with acute abdominal pain are a heterogeneous group that consumes a great deal of a surgical department's resources. To streamline efficiency and provide maximum cost effectiveness it would be of benefit to identify clinical and laboratory parameters in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain that would indicate no significant intra abdominal pathology and thereby encourage early discharge back to the community.

Women of childbearing age commonly present with right iliac fossa pain, most of them do not have appendicitis. Those who do not have the classical features of appendicitis with no evidence of peritonism on examination can be safely managed by active observation or diagnostic laparoscopy. This study was designed to identify the clinical and laboratory red flags. Recognizing these red flags in the history and physical examination and the initial imaging and laboratory findings helps to determine which patients may have a serious underlying disease process, and therefore warrant more expedited evaluation and treatment.

Baseline demographic and laboratory characteristics of the study population

Among the 174 participants, the majority experienced generalized abdominal pain (66.7%, n = 116). Pain localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) was reported in 14.9% (n = 26), while periumbilical pain was observed in 10.3% (n = 18). Other less common pain locations included the left lower quadrant (LLQ) and hypogastric region, each reported in 2.9% (n = 5), and the epigastric region in 2.3% (n = 4). The most frequently reported associated symptom was nausea and vomiting, occurring in 40.2% of patients (n = 70), followed by fever in 26.4% (n = 46). Diarrhea and constipation were each observed in 10.3% of patients (n = 18). Additional symptoms included anorexia (8%, n = 14), tenderness (9.2%, n = 16), and abdominal distention (2.9%, n = 5). Less commonly, dysuria (1.1%, n = 2) and irritability (1.7%, n = 3) were reported. The duration of symptoms ranged widely, with a mean duration of 2.8 ± 2.3 days. These findings highlight the varied presentations of abdominal pain and associated clinical features in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (Table 2).

### Abstract… [^116ENJg5]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Acute sigmoid diverticulitis, a complication of colonic diverticulosis, is the most common cause of acute left lower-quadrant pain in adults. Diverticulosis occurs in 5 to 10 percent of persons by 45 years of age, and in up to 80 percent by 80 years of age. Acute sigmoid diverticulitis should be suspected in patients with the clinical triad of left lower-quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. Additional diagnostic considerations include, but are not limited to, other gastrointestinal pathology, obstetric and gynecologic pathology, and renal or ureteric colic. This article reviews the most appropriate imaging studies in adults presenting with left lower-quadrant pain, according to the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria.
6. CASE 3 A 76-year-old man with recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis presents with left lower-quadrant pain and fever. Contrast-enhanced CT shows a diverticular fistula communicating with an abscess.

Rectal contrast delineates the fistula tract. The patient undergoes a sigmoidectomy. Radiologic Evaluation Imaging of patients with lower-quadrant pain should be guided by the clinical scenario. The differential diagnosis should be considered, and any additional relevant information should be obtained to guide clinical management. Imaging may not be necessary in patients with the classic triad of left lower-quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis, and in whom uncomplicated diverticulitis is suspected. Imaging also may not be necessary in patients with a history of diverticulitis who present with relatively mild clinical symptoms of recurrent disease. However, imaging often plays a definitive role in evaluating left lower-quadrant pain of unclear etiology. 7 However, it should be used judiciously in female patients of childbearing age in whom gynecologic etiologies have been clinically or sonographically excluded.

CT allows for diagnosis of other causes of left lower-quadrant pain that may mimic diverticulitis, which is important in directing appropriate medical management. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria specifies CT as the most appropriate imaging test for patients with acute, severe left lower-quadrant pain with or without fever; for patients with chronic, intermittent, or low-grade left lower-quadrant pain; and for patients who are obese with left lower-quadrant pain. 6.
