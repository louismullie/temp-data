## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evidence on aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, including benefits, harms, sex-specific effects, diabetes, dosing, and how guidelines have evolved to a shared decision-making framework. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between primary and secondary prevention and the historical rationale for aspirin. Then, I should verify the magnitude of benefits and harms from high-quality meta-analyses and pivotal trials. Next, I will examine sex-specific differences and diabetes-specific data. After that, I need to check dosing considerations and mechanistic issues like aspirin "resistance". Finally, I will review contemporary guideline positions and translate this into a practical, risk-stratified decision framework with concrete thresholds and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions, because I need to ensure we are not conflating primary and secondary prevention. Primary prevention refers to patients without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, whereas secondary prevention refers to patients with prior events or revascularization; aspirin has unequivocal net benefit in secondary prevention, but its role in primary prevention is uncertain and depends on a narrow balance of modest ischemic benefit versus meaningful bleeding risk [^111oBoek] [^116abzZB].

> I will now examine the magnitude of cardiovascular benefit in primary prevention. Wait, let me verify the pooled estimates across contemporary meta-analyses. The 2019 JAMA meta-analysis of 13 RCTs in 164,225 participants showed a modest reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke with aspirin (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.84–0.95; absolute risk reduction 0.38%; NNT 265), driven largely by fewer nonfatal MIs, with no significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality or all-cause mortality, which tempers enthusiasm for routine use [^116hjCXJ]. Similarly, the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration found a 12% proportional reduction in serious vascular events in primary prevention, again mainly from fewer nonfatal MIs, without clear effects on vascular mortality, reinforcing that absolute benefits are small in low-risk populations [^111oBoek]. Hold on, I should also note that more recent trials and meta-analytic updates suggest attenuation of MI benefit in the statin era, which I will revisit shortly [^1167CoXX].

> Next, I should review harms, because the bleeding signal is the critical counterweight. I need to check the absolute increase in major bleeding. The JAMA meta-analysis found a 43% relative increase in major bleeding with aspirin (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.30–1.56; absolute risk increase 0.47%; NNH 210), with increases in both gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding, and importantly, no mortality benefit to offset this risk in primary prevention cohorts [^116hjCXJ]. The USPSTF corroborates a 58% increase in major GI bleeding and a 31% increase in intracranial bleeds with low-dose aspirin across primary prevention trials, with bleeding risk rising with age and accumulating quickly after initiation, which is clinically pivotal when counseling patients [^113UbwMn]. Let me double-check: yes, the absolute bleeding increase is of similar magnitude to the absolute cardiovascular benefit, which explains the neutral net clinical effect in many primary prevention settings [^116hjCXJ].

> But wait, what about sex-specific effects? Do men and women benefit differently? I should confirm this nuance. A sex-specific meta-analysis showed that aspirin reduced MI in men but reduced ischemic stroke in women, with similar increases in bleeding in both sexes, suggesting that the component of the composite benefit differs by sex even though overall event reduction is modest in both groups [^1157hjdc]. Hold on, I should verify whether this translates into different thresholds for use; while guidelines do not mandate sex-specific thresholds, it supports tailoring discussions to the dominant risk phenotype in each patient, for example emphasizing MI prevention in men and ischemic stroke prevention in women when considering aspirin [^117ScdpR].

> I will now examine diabetes, because clinicians often ask whether diabetes changes the calculus. The ASCEND trial in people with diabetes showed that 100 mg/day aspirin reduced serious vascular events by 12% but increased major bleeding by 29%, yielding no net clinical benefit overall, which is a key reason guidelines are cautious about routine aspirin in diabetes for primary prevention [^116abzZB]. Earlier diabetes-specific meta-analyses were mixed, with some showing no statistically significant reduction in major cardiovascular events and others suggesting a modest MACE reduction offset by bleeding, underscoring heterogeneity and the need for individualized risk assessment rather than blanket use in diabetes [^117LNped] [^112MGanb]. Let me reconsider: the consistent theme is that absolute ischemic risk must be high enough to outweigh bleeding, and in many people with diabetes today on statins and with better risk control, that threshold is often not met [^116abzZB].

> Next, I should review dosing, because I need to ensure we are not inadvertently increasing harm without benefit. The lowest effective dose range for antiplatelet effect is 75–100 mg daily, with no evidence that higher doses improve efficacy but clear evidence that higher doses increase bleeding; enteric coating does not mitigate GI bleeding risk and may reduce bioavailability, so if aspirin is used, low-dose uncoated formulations are reasonable, and PPI gastroprotection should be considered in those at higher GI bleeding risk [^115eRH8U] [^115y6ebB]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought enteric coating might reduce GI bleeding; I should correct that assumption — coating does not reliably reduce clinically significant GI bleeding and may impair absorption, so PPI cotherapy is the preferred strategy when GI risk is present [^115y6ebB].

> I should also address the concept of aspirin "resistance", because it often confounds interpretation of nonresponse. Measurable platelet nonresponse to aspirin is multifactorial, with contributions from nonadherence, drug interactions, and true biochemical resistance; importantly, nonadherence appears to be a stronger predictor of adverse outcomes than biochemical resistance in some cohorts, so verifying adherence and eliminating interacting agents is essential before labeling a patient as "aspirin resistant" [^11513kRt] [^117AkHU1]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while platelet function testing can identify nonresponse, its clinical utility for guiding therapy remains unproven in primary prevention, so routine testing is not recommended outside research settings [^notfound].

> Now, I need to check how guidelines have evolved, because this dictates bedside decisions. The 2022 USPSTF recommends individualizing the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin for adults aged 40–59 years with a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or higher after shared decision-making, and recommends against initiating aspirin for primary prevention in adults 60 years or older due to bleeding risk outweighing benefits [^117ScdpR] [^114ecFa4]. The 2019 ACC/AHA guideline gives a Class IIb recommendation for selective use in adults 40–70 years at higher ASCVD risk and not at increased bleeding risk, and a Class III recommendation against routine use in those over 70 or anyone at increased bleeding risk, aligning with a conservative, risk-stratified approach [^112xCoAw] [^113HFECB]. I should confirm practical details: use 81 mg daily if aspirin is chosen, reassess bleeding risk at each visit, and consider discontinuation around age 75 as benefits wane and harms rise, which is consistent with USPSTF implementation guidance [^117FjWeB].

> Let me consider why the balance shifted over time, because this informs how we counsel patients. In the contemporary era of widespread statin use and aggressive risk factor control, baseline cardiovascular risk is lower, so the absolute benefit of aspirin is smaller, while bleeding risk remains unchanged, eroding the net benefit observed in older, higher-risk cohorts; meta-analytic moderator analyses show attenuation of MI benefit in recent trials compared with older eras, supporting this explanation [^1167CoXX] [^113xphh1]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not negate secondary prevention benefits — correct, secondary prevention remains unequivocally favorable for aspirin because absolute ischemic risk is high enough to dwarf bleeding risk [^111oBoek].

> Translating this into a practical decision framework, I need to ensure the steps are explicit and measurable. First, confirm no established ASCVD; if present, aspirin for secondary prevention is indicated. Second, estimate 10-year ASCVD risk using a validated calculator and confirm age 40–59 years if considering initiation; if age 60 or older, do not initiate for primary prevention. Third, screen for bleeding risk factors such as prior GI bleed, peptic ulcer disease, age over 70, CKD, thrombocytopenia, or concomitant NSAIDs, steroids, DOACs, or warfarin; if any are present, avoid aspirin. Fourth, engage in shared decision-making to discuss that aspirin lowers nonfatal MI and ischemic stroke modestly but increases major bleeding by about 0.5% per year, with no mortality benefit in primary prevention, and document the patient's preference after reviewing absolute benefits and harms using trial-based NNT/NNH estimates [^117ScdpR] [^116hjCXJ]. Fifth, if aspirin is initiated, prescribe 81 mg daily, consider PPI cotherapy if GI risk is elevated, and plan periodic reassessment of bleeding risk and continuation, with a low threshold to discontinue as age advances or new bleeding risks emerge [^112xCoAw] [^117FjWeB].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line, and I should double-check that I am not overstating any claims. For adults without ASCVD, aspirin confers a modest reduction in nonfatal cardiovascular events but increases major bleeding, with no improvement in cardiovascular or all-cause mortality; therefore, routine use is not justified, and the narrow net benefit may favor selective use only in carefully chosen adults aged 40–59 years with high ASCVD risk and low bleeding risk after shared decision-making, while aspirin should not be started for primary prevention in adults 60 years or older or in anyone with elevated bleeding risk [^116hjCXJ] [^117ScdpR] [^112xCoAw]. I need to ensure I emphasize that this does not change secondary prevention indications, where aspirin remains foundational therapy given the large absolute benefits relative to bleeding risk [^111oBoek].

Aspirin reduces nonfatal myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke in primary prevention [^1125SJyG] [^113jgpBQ], but **increases major bleeding** (GI and intracranial) [^113UbwMn], with no consistent mortality benefit [^111oBoek] [^111gAWxD]. Modern trials (ARRIVE, ASCEND, ASPREE) show **no net benefit** in most adults, especially older adults [^116Pe9C6] [^116abzZB] [^112E294o]. Current guidelines advise **individualized use** only for select adults aged 40–70 years at high ASCVD risk and low bleeding risk [^117ScdpR] [^112xCoAw], and recommend against routine use in adults ≥ 60 years or those with increased bleeding risk [^114ecFa4] [^1126UTd9]. Aspirin is not recommended for primary prevention in diabetes, low-risk, or elderly populations due to bleeding hazards [^114ecFa4] [^115JWA3C].

---

## Historical evidence and early guidelines

Early trials (e.g. Physicians' Health Study, Women's Health Study) suggested **modest reductions** in nonfatal MI and ischemic stroke, but **increased bleeding** [^1157hjdc] [^111oBoek]. Initial guidelines endorsed aspirin for primary prevention in high-risk adults, balancing ischemic benefit against bleeding risk [^112id9hc].

---

## Contemporary evidence and guideline changes

Recent large RCTs (ARRIVE, ASCEND, ASPREE) [^116Pe9C6] [^116abzZB] [^112E294o] show **no net benefit** in most adults, with increased major bleeding and, in ASPREE, higher all-cause mortality. This has prompted guideline shifts:

- **USPSTF 2022**: Individualize for adults 40–59 years with ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk; do not initiate ≥ 60 years [^117ScdpR] [^114ecFa4].
- **ACC/AHA 2019**: Consider only for select adults 40–70 years at high ASCVD risk and low bleeding risk; avoid ≥ 70 years or increased bleeding risk [^112xCoAw] [^1126UTd9].
- **ESC 2021**: Do not use routinely; consider only in very high-risk patients with low bleeding risk [^notfound].

---

## Specific populations

### Diabetes mellitus

In diabetes, **ASCEND** showed reduced vascular events but increased major bleeding, yielding no net benefit [^116abzZB]. ADA 2025 states that aspirin is effective for secondary prevention but remains controversial for primary prevention; **individualize based on risk** [^111fUUTu].

---

### Elderly individuals

In the elderly, **ASPREE** found no cardiovascular benefit and higher all-cause mortality with aspirin, largely due to cancer deaths [^116abzZB]. Guidelines advise **against initiation** in adults ≥ 60–70 years due to bleeding risk [^117ScdpR] [^1126UTd9].

---

### Low-risk populations

In low-risk populations, **ARRIVE** showed no cardiovascular benefit but increased GI bleeding in moderate-risk adults [^116Pe9C6]. Routine aspirin is **not recommended** for low-risk individuals [^112xCoAw].

---

## Balancing benefits and risks

| **Benefit** | **Risk** |
|-|-|
| Reduced nonfatal MI and ischemic stroke [^1125SJyG] | Increased major GI and intracranial bleeding [^113UbwMn] |
| Modest cardiovascular event reduction in high-risk adults [^114ecFa4] | No consistent mortality benefit [^111oBoek] |
| Potential cancer benefit (controversial, long-term) [^117Ev6Rb] | Bleeding risk rises with age, comorbidities, and interacting drugs [^114GwpLX] |

---

## Current clinical recommendations

- **Age 40–59 years**: Individualize if ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk and low bleeding risk [^117ScdpR].
- **Age ≥ 60 years**: Do not initiate routine aspirin [^117ScdpR].
- **High bleeding risk**: Avoid aspirin (e.g. prior GI bleed, anticoagulants, CKD) [^114GwpLX].
- **Dose**: 75–100 mg daily if used [^115eRH8U].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Ongoing work seeks to refine risk stratification, identify subgroups with favorable net benefit, and clarify long-term cancer effects [^112TboQE]. Platelet-function testing and novel biomarkers may enable **personalized aspirin use** [^117Fasrx].

---

Aspirin has a **limited role** in primary prevention: it modestly reduces nonfatal events but increases major bleeding, with no consistent mortality benefit. Use is now restricted to carefully selected, high-risk, low-bleeding-risk adults aged 40–70 years, with routine use discouraged in older adults or those with elevated bleeding risk [^117ScdpR] [^112xCoAw].

## References

### Narrative review: aspirin resistance and its clinical implications [^117AkHU1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Aspirin is currently the most cost-effective drug for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, but treatment failures are relatively common. Several factors have been linked to these recurrent vascular events in patients prescribed aspirin, including smoking, drug interactions, nonadherence, comorbid conditions, and aspirin resistance. The term aspirin resistance has been used to describe not only an absence of the expected pharmacologic effects of aspirin on platelets but also poor clinical outcomes, such as recurrent vascular events, in patients treated with aspirin. Aspirin resistance is perhaps more precisely understood as the phenomenon of measurable, persisting platelet activation that occurs in patients prescribed a therapeutic dose of aspirin and may underlie an unknown proportion of aspirin treatment failures. Key challenges for future research are to standardize a definition of aspirin resistance and to compare whether different measures of platelet activation, either alone or in combination, independently predict cardiovascular events. These challenges must be met before researchers conduct studies to assess the clinical utility of testing on patient outcomes and cost-effective prescribing.

### Overview of aspirin and platelet biology [^112Qn4i5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspirin (ASA) has historically been one of the most important drugs in cardiology and has long been the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy. Although its role in acute coronary syndrome remains undisputed, emerging data suggest that reappraisal of the efficacy of long-term ASA in some primary and secondary prevention may be warranted. The aim of this review is to place these new results in the context of previous evidence on aspirin by appraising the current body of evidence on its use of for cardiovascular diseases. This overview first summarizes the history of the discovery of aspirin, as well as its pharmacology and the concept of ASA resistance. We subsequently recapitulate the evidence of ASA on primary prevention and secondary prevention starting from the classical studies in order to serve as an introductory background to the examination of the most recent clinical trials that will be performed in the rest of the articles of this Supplement. Although the benefit of ASA in acute coronary syndrome remains incontrovertible, emerging evidence challenge the universal need for primary prevention, or for lifelong treatment in secondary prevention or all adults with stable coronary disease who are at highest risk for ASA-induced bleeding. The role of aspirin is quickly changing in recent times and this review provides a review for the clinician about the current role of this drug in cardiovascular care.

### Efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111gAWxD]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

The role of aspirin in the primary prevention setting is continuously evolving. Recent randomized trials have challenged the role of aspirin in the primary prevention setting.

Methods and Results

Electronic databases were searched for randomized trials that compared aspirin vs. placebo (or control) in subjects without established atherosclerotic disease. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality, while the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Summary estimates were reported using a DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. A total of 11 trials with 157 248 subjects were included. At a mean follow-up of 6.6years, aspirin was not associated with a lower incidence of all-cause mortality [risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93–1.02; P = 0.30]; however, aspirin was associated with an increased incidence of major bleeding (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.31–1.65; P < 0.0001) and intracranial haemorrhage (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13–1.58; P = 0.001). A similar effect on all-cause mortality and major bleeding was demonstrated in diabetic and high cardiovascular risk patients (i.e. 10-year risk > 7.5%). Aspirin was associated with a lower incidence of myocardial infarction (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.94; P = 0.006); however, this outcome was characterized by considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 67%), and this effect was no longer evident upon limiting the analysis to the more recent trials. Trial sequential analysis confirmed the lack of benefit of aspirin for all-cause mortality up to a relative risk reduction of 5%.

Conclusion

Among adults without established cardiovascular disease, aspirin was not associated with a reduction in the incidence of all-cause mortality; however, it was associated with an increased incidence of major bleeding. The routine use of aspirin for primary prevention needs to be reconsidered.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality events in diabetes: updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112NXH4U]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the benefits and harms of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality events in people with diabetes by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials of aspirin compared with placebo (or no treatment) in people with diabetes with no history of cardiovascular disease were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and a manual search of bibliographies to November 2015. Study-specific relative risks with 95% CIs were aggregated using random effects models.

Results

A total of 10 randomized trials were included in the review. There was a significant reduction in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events: relative risk of 0.90 (95% CI 0.81–0.99) in groups taking aspirin compared with placebo or no treatment. Limited subgroup analyses suggested that the effect of aspirin on major adverse cardiovascular events differed by baseline cardiovascular disease risk, medication compliance and sex (P for interaction for all > 0.05). There was no significant reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular mortality or all-cause mortality. Aspirin significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction for a treatment duration of ≤ 5 years. There were differences in the effect of aspirin by dosage and treatment duration on overall stroke outcomes (P for interaction for all < 0.05). There was an increase in risk of major or gastrointestinal bleeding events, but estimates were imprecise and not significant.

Conclusions

The emerging data do not clearly support guidelines that encourage the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with diabetes who are at increased cardiovascular disease risk.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117FjWeB]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF aspirin use for primary prevention — Implementation specifies to consider the patient's age. For adults aged 40 to 59 years, estimate CVD risk using a CVD risk estimator and, in patients whose estimated CVD risk is 10% or greater, use shared decision-making to inform the decision about initiating aspirin. For patients initiating aspirin use, it would be reasonable to use a dose of 81 mg/d. For adults 60 years or older, do not initiate aspirin for primary prevention of CVD. For potential discontinuation, for patients who are eligible and choose to start taking aspirin, the benefits become smaller with advancing age, and data suggest that clinicians and patients should consider stopping aspirin use around age 75 years.

### Aspirin and cancer [^117Ev6Rb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The place of aspirin in primary prevention remains controversial, with North American and European organizations issuing contradictory treatment guidelines. More recently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended "initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years". This recommendation reflects increasing evidence for a chemopreventive effect of low-dose aspirin against colorectal (and other) cancer. The intent of this paper is to review the evidence supporting a chemopreventive effect of aspirin, discuss its potential mechanism(s) of action, and provide a conceptual framework for assessing current guidelines in the light of ongoing studies.

### Low-dose aspirin in primary prevention: cardioprotection, chemoprevention, both, or neither? [^115aFQvm]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been shown to be effective in preventing about one-fifth of atherothrombotic vascular complications (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death) in a meta-analysis of 16 secondary prevention trials in patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient cerebral ischaemia. This corresponds to an absolute reduction of about 10–20 per 1000 patients in the yearly incidence of non-fatal events, and to a smaller, but still definite, reduction in vascular death. Against this benefit, the absolute increase in major extracranial bleeding complications [mostly, gastrointestinal (GI)] is 20- to 50-fold smaller, depending on age and sex. Hence, for secondary prevention, the benefits of antiplatelet therapy substantially exceed the risks. For primary prevention, the balance between vascular events avoided and major bleeds caused by aspirin is substantially uncertain because the risks without aspirin, and hence the absolute benefits of antiplatelet prophylaxis, are at least an order of magnitude lower than in secondary prevention. The aim of this article is to review the updated evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention and to discuss additional health benefits resulting from prolonged antiplatelet therapy in apparently healthy people at low average risk of vascular events.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112MGanb]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin is recommended by key guideline agencies for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes, although with some inconsistencies (see web extra on bmj.com). Existing recommendations are primarily based on indirect evidence extrapolated from large trials of populations at high risk of cardiovascular events. Evidence supporting the efficacy of aspirin therapy in trials of only people with diabetes is scant. A previous meta-analysis (287 trials, 135 000 participants) on the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy in the prevention of major cardiovascular events found a clear benefit of aspirin overall, but no statistically significant benefit in the subgroup of only people with diabetes (nine trials, 5126 participants). No significant reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events with low dose aspirin compared with placebo was found in three additional trials published after that meta-analysis.

Reactions of many in the scientific and clinical community to the results of the most recent trials have been mixed, some arguing for definite proof on the lack of aspirin's efficacy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events, others raising claims that data are still inconclusive and more trials are warranted. The persisting uncertainties form the basis of our meta-analysis of trials on the benefits and harms of aspirin in people with diabetes and no pre-existing cardiovascular disease.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117LNped]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective To evaluate the benefits and harms of low dose aspirin in people with diabetes and no cardiovascular disease.

Design Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Data sources Medline (1966-November 2008), the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (Cochrane Library 2008; issue 4), and reference lists of retrieved articles.

Review methods Randomised trials of aspirin compared with placebo or no aspirin in people with diabetes and no pre-existing cardiovascular disease were eligible for inclusion. Data on major cardiovascular events (death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and all cause mortality) were extracted and pooled with a random effect model. Results are reported as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals.

Results Of 157 studies in the literature searches, six were eligible (10 117 participants). When aspirin was compared with placebo there was no statistically significant reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events (five studies, 9584 participants; relative risk 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.00), cardiovascular mortality (four studies, n = 8557, 0.94; 0.72 to 1.23), or all cause mortality (four studies, n = 8557; 0.93, 0.82 to 1.05). Significant heterogeneity was found in the analysis for myocardial infarction (I 2 = 62.2%; P = 0.02) and stroke (I 2 = 52.5%; P = 0.08). Aspirin significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction in men (0.57, 0.34 to 0.94) but not in women (1.08, 0.71 to 1.65; P for interaction = 0.056). Evidence relating to harms was inconsistent.

Conclusions A clear benefit of aspirin in the primary prevention of major cardiovascular events in people with diabetes remains unproved. Sex may be an important effect modifier. Toxicity is to be explored further.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^113HFECB]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

2019 ACC/AHA primary prevention — aspirin use for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — Class IIb (Level A) states: Low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg orally daily) might be considered for the primary prevention of ASCVD among select adults 40 to 70 years of age who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at increased bleeding risk. Class III: Harm (Level B-R) states: Low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg orally daily) should not be administered on a routine basis for the primary prevention of ASCVD among adults > 70 years of age. Class III: Harm (Level C-LD) states: Low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg orally daily) should not be administered for the primary prevention of ASCVD among adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding.

### Revisiting the role of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1176By5P]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is the cornerstone of the antithrombotic management of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but major guidelines provide conflicting recommendations for its use in primary prevention. Findings from recent randomized trials totaling > 47000 patients called into question the net clinical benefits of aspirin in primary prevention for 3 key populations: patients with diabetes mellitus, community-dwelling elderly individuals, and patients without diabetes mellitus who are at intermediate risk for atherosclerotic events. In the context of increasing emphasis on the use of other treatments for primary prevention in patients with moderate-high future risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary prevention has become uncertain. Key unresolved questions regarding the role of aspirin in primary prevention include the optimal drug formulation, dosing schedule, weight-based dose selection, and interplay between sex and treatment response. In the current era, most patients without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease should not be prescribed aspirin. Rather, aggressive management of comorbidities tailored to the expected cardiovascular risk needs to be emphasized. In this context, informed shared decision making between clinicians and patients regarding the use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events is a suitable and laudable approach. In this article, we revisit the role of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases by critically reviewing the key scientific literature, highlight key areas of uncertainties for future research, and propose a decisional framework for clinicians to support prescription of aspirin in primary prevention.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116ZGU97]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) primary prevention trials by age — evidence adequacy across age groups is summarized as follows: Trials included large numbers of younger and older adults, with "almost 22 000 participants younger than 50 years and more than 37 000 participants 70 years or older", and "most trials with age subanalyses did not find a statistically significant difference in the relative effect of aspirin on CVD outcomes by age". The USPSTF "concluded that evidence on the benefits of aspirin on CVD outcomes was adequate for all groups, including adults aged 40 to 49 years and adults 70 years or older".

### Primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^11241qmc]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Aspirin for primary prevention — evidence and absolute effects: An individual participant data meta-analysis includes 95,000 individuals (660,000 person-years, 3,554 vascular events) from six large trials, and doses of aspirin varied between 75 mg and 300 mg without an apparent difference in benefit or harm. In low-risk patients, aspirin use would be associated with six fewer myocardial infarctions (MIs) and four more major bleeding events per 1,000 treated over a 10-year period, and aspirin would be associated with six fewer total deaths, but the 95% confidence interval includes zero fewer deaths. For moderate- to high-risk patients, aspirin reduces nonfatal MI (19 fewer/1,000 treated and 31 fewer/1,000 treated, respectively) and increases major bleeding (16 more/1,000 treated and 22 more/1,000 treated, respectively), with a similar impact on total mortality (six fewer total deaths). Relative effects include a vascular mortality relative risk of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.87–1.09) and a reduction in cancer mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50–0.87), translating to ~20 fewer cancer deaths (30 fewer to eight fewer) per 1,000 treated for 10 years; the larger absolute cancer mortality effect reflects a higher 10-year cancer mortality risk of 60 per 1,000 in trials vs a low 10-year total mortality of 10 per 1,000 in a 50-year-old man. The overall quality of evidence is rated as moderate given the imprecision in the relative effect estimates for total mortality.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women [^115wVN1T]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

For primary prevention, low-dose aspirin should be considered in women aged 40 to 70 years with a 10-year cardiovascular risk of 20% or more or in women with diabetes and a 10-year cardiovascular risk of 10% or more. The risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits in low-risk women and in women aged 70 years and older.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: time for a platelet-guided approach [^117Fasrx]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

Highlights

Aspirin is an antiplatelet therapy drug and has been shown to protect against atherothrombosis while increasing the risk of major bleeding.
The recent United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines on aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease reflect this clinical tradeoff as well as the persistent struggle to define a population that would benefit from prophylactic aspirin therapy.
Reliable methods for quantifying platelet activity, including light transmission aggregometry and platelet transcriptomics, could be considered to identify individuals at elevated (platelet mediated) cardiovascular risk.
Clinical studies are needed to investigate whether a platelet-guided precision-based medicine approach will identify individuals who will benefit (eg, benefit > risk) with aspirin for the prevention of a first heart attack or stroke.

In October 2021, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a draft statement updating its guidelines on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The USPSTF recommends the following: (1) low-dose aspirin should not be initiated for primary prevention in individuals ages 60 years or older, and (2) initiation of low-dose aspirin should be considered on an individualized basis in adults aged 40 to 59 years with a 10-year CVD risk of ≥ 10%. With the update, the USPSTF no longer recommends routine aspirin prescription for primary CVD prevention in any population, a position consistent with the most recent guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology. The shift reflects a longstanding struggle to identify a population in which aspirin's clinical benefit for primary CVD prevention exceeds its bleeding risk.

Aspirin — primary prevention among intermediate-risk individuals shows that while many high-risk groups have benefits that substantially exceed major bleeds, benefit in apparently healthy people is less certain; an individual participant data meta-analysis of six trials included 95,456 subjects with mean follow-up 6.9 years and median 5.5 years, and found a 12% reduction in serious vascular events (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.94; p = 0.0001), an 18% reduction in major coronary events (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.90; P < .0001), driven by a 23% reduction in nonfatal MI (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.89; P < .0001); there was no apparent reduction in cardiovascular death (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78–1.15; p = 0.50), and aspirin was associated with a nonsignificant 10% reduction in nonhemorrhagic stroke (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.80–1.01; p = 0.08).

### Primary care providers should prescribe aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease based on benefit-risk ratio, not age [^111HF3wJ]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent guidelines restricted aspirin (ASA) in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) to patients < 70 years old and more recent guidance to < 60.

In the most comprehensive prior meta-analysis, the Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration reported a significant 12% reduction in CVD with similar benefit−risk ratios at older ages. Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, four trials were added to an updated meta-analysis.

ASA produced a statistically significant 13% reduction in CVD with 95% confidence limits (0.83 to 0.92) with similar benefits at older ages in each of the trials.

Primary care providers should make individual decisions whether to prescribe ASA based on benefit−risk ratio, not simply age. When the absolute risk of CVD is > 10%, benefits of ASA will generally outweigh risks of significant bleeding. ASA should be considered only after implementation of therapeutic lifestyle changes and other drugs of proven benefit such as statins, which are, at the very least, additive to ASA. Our perspective is that individual clinical judgements by primary care providers about prescription of ASA in primary prevention of CVD should be based on our evidence-based solution of weighing all the absolute benefits and risks rather than age. This strategy would do far more good for far more patients as well as far more good than harm in both developed and developing countries. This new and novel strategy for primary care providers to consider in prescribing ASA in primary prevention of CVD is the same as the general approach suggested by Professor Geoffrey Rose decades ago.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114ecFa4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF aspirin for primary prevention — net benefit by age and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk: The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit, and that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit. Adequate evidence indicates low-dose aspirin has a small benefit to reduce risk for cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke) in adults 40 years or older at increased CVD risk, with absolute benefit increasing with higher 10-year CVD risk and greater lifetime benefit when started at a younger age; however, aspirin increases the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and hemorrhagic stroke, with harms small overall but increasing in older age groups, particularly in adults older than 60 years.

Response to public comment — scope and patient guidance are clarified: 'A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 12 to November 8, 2021'. The USPSTF emphasizes that 'the focus of this recommendation is the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD and not for other indications' and that 'This recommendation only applies to persons who do not have a history of CVD, signs or symptoms of CVD, or other conditions for which aspirin may be indicated'. For those already taking aspirin, 'Persons who are currently taking aspirin and have questions about whether they should continue or discontinue aspirin use, should discuss these questions with their clinician. Persons who are taking aspirin should not discontinue using it without consulting their clinician'. The USPSTF also notes it 'did not review the emerging evidence on the effect of aspirin on COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2'.

Strategies and Evidence

Past Randomized Trials

Initial trials of low-dose aspirin therapy for primary CVD prevention — including the Physicians' Health Study, TPT (Thrombosis Prevention Trial), HOT (Hypertension Optimal Treatment Study), and Primary Prevention Project (PPP) — suggested that aspirin conferred modest CV protection, particularly against nonfatal myocardial infarction, in individuals without established CVD. – Similarly, while the Women's Health Study did not show a reduction in its primary end point of major CV events with aspirin, it did suggest a modest benefit in women ages 65 years and older. A meta-analysis of these early trials showed a 12 and 14% odds of reduction in CV events associated with aspirin therapy in women and men, respectively. These CV risk reductions accompanied significant increases in major bleeding risk (68% and 72% in women and men, respectively). Given this clinical tradeoff and the assumption that aspirin's benefit increases with a patient's baseline CV risk, newer studies were designed in the mid to late 2000s to study primary preventive aspirin therapy in high-risk groups. ASCEND, ARRIVE, and ASPREE enrolled subjects with diabetes, subjects with multiple CVD risk factors and without diabetes, and the elderly, respectively. – Their results cast further doubt on aspirin's role in primary CV prevention, as ARRIVE and ASPREE did not show significant CV benefit with aspirin, and ASCEND demonstrated CV benefit that was counterbalanced by a substantial increase in the risk of major bleeding. However, it is important to note that despite the intention of recent trials to study higher-risk primary prevention populations, the event rates in ASCEND, ARRIVE, and ASPREE were ≈1% per year, consistent with lower-risk populations. Thus, the power of these studies was lower than expected, and the translatability of these findings to higher-risk primary prevention populations is uncertain.

USPSTF aspirin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) states: For adults aged 40 to 59 years with an estimated 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in this group should be an individual one (Grade: C). For adults 60 years or older, do not initiate aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD (Grade: D). This applies to adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD and who are not at increased risk for bleeding.

Antiplatelet therapy and risk reduction evidence — aspirin is effective for secondary prevention and is strongly recommended, while primary prevention is more controversial; across six large primary prevention trials in the general population (over 95,000 participants, including almost 4,000 with diabetes), aspirin reduced serious vascular events by 12% (relative risk 0.88 [95% CI 0.82–0.94]), with little effect on CHD death (relative risk 0.95 [95% CI 0.78–1.15]) or total stroke.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^11273tu4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States.

Purpose

To update a systematic review about the benefits of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults aged 40 years or older and to evaluate effect modification in subpopulations.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2008 to January 2015), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Study Selection

Two investigators independently reviewed 3396 abstracts and 65 articles according to prespecified criteria. All included trials evaluated aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.

Data Extraction

Two investigators assessed study quality; data were abstracted by 1 reviewer and checked by a second.

Data Synthesis

Two good-quality and 9 fair-quality randomized, controlled trials were identified. In analyses of all doses, aspirin reduced the risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (relative risk [RR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.87]) but not nonfatal stroke; aspirin showed little or no benefit for all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Benefits began within the first 5 years. Older adults achieved greater relative MI reduction, but no other effect modifications were found in analyzed subpopulations. In trials with aspirin doses of 100 mg or less per day, the reduction in nonfatal MI benefit persisted (absolute risk reduction, 0.15 to 1.43 events per 1000 person-years) and a 14% reduction in nonfatal stroke benefit was noted, but no benefit was found for all-cause mortality (RR, 0.95 [CI, 0.89 to 1.01]) or cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.97 [CI, 0.85 to 1.10]).

Limitation

Evidence for aspirin in primary prevention is heterogeneous and limited by rare events and few credible subgroup analyses.

Conclusion

The beneficial effect of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is modest and occurs at doses of 100 mg or less per day. Older adults seem to achieve a greater relative MI benefit.

### Aspirin in primary prevention: It is time to start stepping away [^1136ADVL]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is one of the most widely used drugs in medicine. While the benefits in secondary prevention have long been clear, the risk-benefit calculus in primary prevention is far less straightforward. Several randomized controlled trials conducted in the 1980s and 1990s showed cardiovascular benefits of aspirin in primary prevention, but more recent studies have called this benefit into question. One potential explanation for this discrepancy is that in the more recent era of statin therapy for primary prevention, the absolute risk of the population — and therefore, the absolute benefit of aspirin — has been reduced. Understanding the impact of aspirin therapy in patients on concomitant statins is highly relevant to current clinical practice and yet has been underexplored.

In this issue of JACC: Advances, Khan et aladdress this important question by assessing the impact of aspirin with and without statin therapy in patients without known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The authors performed a meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials of aspirin (at least 75 mg every other day) in adults without ASCVD. The primary outcomes were fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and major bleeding requiring transfusion or hospitalization or leading to death. These outcomes were assessed in patients at various ASCVD risk categories based on the Cholesterol treatment Trialist's Collaboration framework, ranging from very low risk of an event (< 5%) to very high risk (≥ 30%).

Enhancing the effectiveness of aspirin by tailoring administration regimens is an important question among health professionals. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the evidence on the effects of different aspirin regimens in terms of timing (chronotherapy) or frequency of dosing in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Only two out of the 28 included studies reported long-term cardiovascular outcomes, highlighting an evidence gap that future research should address. The remaining 26 studies used surrogate outcomes.

### Association of aspirin use for primary prevention of CVD with cardiovascular events and bleeding… [^111t3rpg]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

For double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, aspirin use was associated with reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome. No reduction was present in any of the secondary outcomes. Quiz Ref IDIn this meta-analysis of 13 trials enrolling 164 225 participants without cardiovascular disease, aspirin use was associated with reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome consisting of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. However, aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and major gastrointestinal bleeding with comparable absolute risk estimates. Aspirin use was associated with reductions in the primary cardiovascular composite outcome and increases in major bleeding risks in both low and high cardiovascular risk populations and in participants with diabetes. cardiovascular disease risk of 17.

3%) had an observed event rate of less than 10%. 6 This study showed that when analysis was restricted to populations with observation-derived 10-year cardiovascular event rate estimates of 10% or more, aspirin use was associated with an absolute risk decrease of 0. 63% for the cardiovascular composite outcome, but an absolute risk increase of
0. 64% for major bleeding. Quiz Ref IDThe challenge of interpreting absolute risk across different outcomes lies in the interpretation of the severity of each outcome. The current study demonstrates that the absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events and absolute risk increase for major bleeding associated with aspirin use were of similar magnitude. Aspirin use was not associated with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality, and deaths due to bleeding were rare.

Consequently, the decision to use aspirin for primary prevention may need to be made on an individual basis, accounting for the patient's risk of bleeding and their views on the balance of risk vs benefit.
34. The ASPREE study, which enrolled healthy older individuals, demonstrated an increased risk of death in patients randomized to receive aspirin, driven primarily by a 31% increased risk of cancer mortality. 15 This finding is in contrast to an individual patient data meta-analysis of primary and secondary prevention aspirin trials that demonstrated a 15% reduction in cancer mortality associated with aspirin use. 13 While the reduction in cancer mortality emerged after at least 5 years of follow-up, this result was not replicated in the ASCEND trial that f.

### Aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease? [^1138ANVJ]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is the cornerstone of treatment in patients with established atherosclerotic disease. The use of a single antiplatelet agent is commonly recommended for the long-term management of these patients. Although aspirin has represented the mainstay of antiplatelet therapy for decades, emerging evidence suggests that P2Y₁₂ inhibitors may be more than just a viable alternative to aspirin and may be preferred over aspirin. This review examines the current evidence comparing the efficacy and safety of aspirin vs P2Y12 inhibitors in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic disease. Special attention is given to the practical challenges and considerations surrounding the use of aspirin vs P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy, including interindividual variability in drug response, side effects, costs, and real-world implementation. By evaluating the strengths and limitations of these treatment options, this article aims to guide clinicians in optimizing the selection of single antiplatelet strategies for long-term secondary prevention in patients with atherosclerotic disease.

Harms of preventive medication — low-dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg/d) bleeding risks: Across CVD primary prevention trials, "The USPSTF reviewed 14 RCTs". For low-dose aspirin, a pooled analysis of "10 trials (n = 119 130)" found a "58% increase in major gastrointestinal bleeding (Peto OR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.38–1.80])", and "a pooled analysis of 11 trials (n = 134 470) showed an increase in intracranial bleeds" (Peto OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.11–1.54]). Low-dose aspirin "was not associated with a statistically significant increase in risk of fatal hemorrhagic stroke". Bleeding "occurs relatively quickly after initiating aspirin", with no differential relative bleeding risk by "age, sex, presence of diabetes, level of CVD risk, or race or ethnicity", but "the absolute incidence of bleeding… increases with age, and more so in adults 60 years or older".

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^115oPnCm]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality.1 For example, in 2000, it accounted directly for around 2 million deaths in the European Union. Worldwide, many people take aspirin daily in the belief that doing so helps to prevent CVD. This approach is established for the secondary prevention of recurrent vascular events. However, there has been some uncertainty about the place of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.6 In particular, there have been doubts about whether any benefits of aspirin in people with no history of CVD outweigh the risks (e.g. the fact that long-term low-dose aspirin therapy almost doubles the likelihood of gastrointestinal haemorrhage). Here we consider the place of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention of CVD.

Low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg orally daily) should not be administered on a routine basis for the primary prevention of ASCVD among adults > 70 years of age (III: Harm B-R). Low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg orally daily) should not be administered for the primary prevention of ASCVD among adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding (III: Harm C-LD).

### A critical appraisal of aspirin in secondary prevention: is less more? [^1172Z1cx]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Aspirin represents the sine qua non for antiplatelet pharmacotherapy in patients with cardiovascular diseases because of its well-established role in secondary prevention and its widespread availability and affordability. Historical studies, conducted in an era that bears little resemblance to contemporary clinical practice, demonstrated large reductions in thrombotic risk when aspirin was compared with placebo, thus forming the evidence base promulgated in practice guidelines and recommendations. P2Y 12 inhibitors have mostly been studied in addition to aspirin; dual-antiplatelet therapy proved superiority compared with aspirin monotherapy for the prevention of ischemic events, despite increased bleeding risks. An alternative approach currently under investigation includes evaluation of single-antiplatelet therapy with P2Y 12 inhibitors alone versus dual-antiplatelet therapy after acute coronary syndromes or coronary stent implantation. As the availability of more effective antiplatelet agents increases, it is time to revisit the existing and long-standing paradigm supporting aspirin use for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events. Ongoing trials will provide new evidence whether the less-is-more strategy is justified.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^114GwpLX]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — aspirin risk stratification and age cautions — Prior U.S. guidelines recommended prophylactic aspirin only in the setting of elevated ASCVD risk, for example using risk estimators like the PCE or specific ASCVD risk factors, and historical meta-regression shows observed ASCVD risk tracks reasonably well with baseline-estimated ASCVD risk, whereas observed bleeding risk on aspirin is less well correlated. Scenarios associated with increased bleeding risk include a history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer disease or bleeding from other sites, age > 70 years, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, CKD, and concurrent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, direct oral anticoagulants, and warfarin. Post hoc analysis of older trials suggests the benefit–risk ratio for prophylactic aspirin generally becomes more favorable at > 10% estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, but prophylactic aspirin in primary-prevention adults > 70 years of age is potentially harmful and difficult to justify for routine use.

### Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: current knowledge and future research needs [^115VNCAi]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In secondary prevention, among a very wide range of survivors of prior occlusive cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and those suffering acute myocardial infarction (MI) or occlusive stroke, aspirin decreases risks of MI, stroke, and CVD death. In these high risk patients, the absolute benefits are large and absolute risks are far smaller so aspirin should be more widely prescribed. In contrast, in primary prevention, aspirin reduces risks of first MI but the evidence on stroke and CVD death remain inconclusive. Based on the current totality of evidence from predominantly low risk subjects where the absolute benefits is low and side effects the same as in secondary prevention, any decision to prescribe aspirin for primary prevention should be an individual clinical judgment by the healthcare provider that weighs the absolute benefit in reducing the risk of a first MI against the absolute risk of major bleeding. If the ongoing trials of intermediate risks subjects show net benefits then general guidelines may be justified with several caveats. First, any decision to use aspirin should continue to be made by the healthcare provider. Second, therapeutic lifestyle changes and other drugs of life saving benefit such as statins should be considered with aspirin as an adjunct, not alternative. The more widespread and appropriate use of aspirin in primary prevention is particularly attractive, especially in developing countries where CVD is emerging as the leading cause of death. In addition, aspirin is generally widely available over the counter and is extremely inexpensive.

### Recent evidence examining efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary cardiovascular disease prevention [^116M1Wer]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Data on aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are conflicting and changing as new trials are published on the subject.

Objective

To review recent data evaluating the efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD.

Data Sources

Articles evaluating aspirin for primary prevention of CVD were gathered using a MEDLINE search with the keywords aspirin review, aspirin peripheral artery disease, aspirin stroke, aspirin coronary artery disease, aspirin diabetes, aspirin primary prophylaxis, and aspirin elderly. Primary literature published from January 2008 through November 2018 was reviewed. Additional references were identified from a review of citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized clinical trials that reported on aspirin for primary CVD prevention were included. In all, 10 publications met the inclusion criteria. The authors individually compared and contrasted the results from each publication.

Data Synthesis

The evidence for primary CVD prevention using aspirin varies widely. Previous analyses identified a benefit to aspirin use in certain populations, and current guidelines reflect this. However, new studies published in the past 10 years call the historically identified benefit of aspirin into question and force us to reexamine which patients, if any, are indicated for aspirin for primary prevention of CVD. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review provides a thorough discussion on the evidence behind aspirin for primary prevention of CVD.

Conclusion

Based on current evidence, aspirin is not recommended for primary prevention of CVD.

2. How can we reconcile the results of the different trials?

In order to synthesize and reconcile the results of the available trials, we examined existing meta-analyses of aspirin prevention trials (including those that focused on all patients and those that examined only patients with diabetes) and performed new meta-analyses with updated data.

The Anti-thrombotic Trialists' (ATT) collaborators recently published an individual patient-level meta-analysis of the six large trials of aspirin for primary prevention in the general population. These trials collectively enrolled over 95,000 participants, including almost 4,000 with diabetes. Overall, the meta-analysis found that aspirin reduced the risk of vascular events by 12% (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82–0.94). The largest reduction was for nonfatal MI (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67–0.89). Aspirin had little effect on CHD death (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78–1.15) or total stroke (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85–1.06). The net effect on total stroke reflected a relative reduction in risk of ischemic stroke (−14%) and a relative increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (+32%).

There was some evidence of a difference in aspirin effect by sex. Aspirin reduced CHD events in men (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67–0.89) but not in women (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.77–1.17). Conversely, aspirin had no effect on stroke in men (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.74–1.39) but reduced stroke in women (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59–0.99). These potential differences in effect by sex were of borderline statistical significance, were affected strongly by the results of one trial (WHS), and cannot be considered definitive. Notably, sex differences in aspirin's effects have not been observed in studies of secondary prevention. The ATT collaborators did not identify other clear sources of heterogeneity of effect, although there was some suggestion that current smokers derived less benefit from aspirin than nonsmokers.

### Usefulness of aspirin for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^1166twct]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspirin use in the prevention of cardiovascular events has been a mainstay of treatment for decades. However, the use of aspirin in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has recently come under scrutiny. Several recent studies have evaluated the use of aspirin in primary prevention and the results suggest that in many patients the risks may outweigh the benefits. Closer examination of these trials suggests that the use of aspirin therapy for primary prevention may have a role but likely needs a more tailored approach and that caution is needed in prescribing aspirin for primary prevention. In conclusion, in this article we review the evolving evidence for aspirin in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the 21Century: a review of the evidence [^116A6Rsb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspirin (ASA) is the most commonly prescribed antiplatelet agent. Although the evidence for efficacy of aspirin for secondary prevention of ischemic events in patients with established cardiovascular disease is strong, its role in primary prevention has been subject of controversies over the past decades. In fact, historical trials have shown only modest benefit in terms of reduction of ischemic events, mostly myocardial infarction and to a lesser extent stroke, and only at the expense of an increased risk of bleeding. These observations have led to divergent recommendations from professional societies on the use of ASA for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease manifestations. However, recent results from three trials of primary prevention have shown either no benefit or modest benefit on combined ischemic end points, without any impact on hard cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke, accompanied by an increased risk of bleeding. Overall, this translated into neutral net benefit or even harm with the use of aspirin in patients with no overt cardiovascular disease. These results have accordingly led to a downgrade in the current recommendations on the use of ASA for primary prevention. This article provides an overview on the current evidence on the use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Recommendations of others — The ACC/AHA recommends that low-dose aspirin use (75 to 100 mg/d) might be considered for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD among select adults aged 40 to 70 years at higher CVD risk but not at increased risk of bleeding. Low-dose aspirin use is not recommended on a routine basis for primary prevention of CVD in adults older than 70 years or among adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding. The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on aspirin use.

### Aspirin: promise and resistance in the new millennium [^115gLMMt]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2008). Low credibility.

Although conceived at the end of the 19th century, aspirin remains the gold standard of antiplatelet therapy. Approximately 100 randomized clinical trials have established its efficacy and safety in the prevention of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and vascular death among high-risk patients treated for a few weeks, at one end of the spectrum, and in low-risk subjects treated up to 10 years at the other. Despite this wealth of data, several issues continue to be debated concerning the use of aspirin as an antiplatelet agent, and novel opportunities appear on the horizon for this 110-year-old drug. These issues include: (1) the optimal dose for cardiovascular prophylaxis; (2) the uncertain threshold of cardiovascular risk for its use in primary prevention; (3) the apparent gender-related difference in its cardioprotective effects; (4) the increasingly popular theme of aspirin "resistance"; (5) the opportunities of chemoprevention in colorectal cancer; and (6) the renewed interest in aspirin as an analgesic agent in osteoarthritic patients at high cardiovascular risk. The aim of this review is to address these issues by integrating our current understanding of the molecular mechanism of action of the drug with the results of clinical trials and epidemiological studies of aspirin as an antiplatelet drug.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. 1 Reductions in CVD morbidity and mortality have been achieved by reducing risk factor exposure with lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions, including use of aspirin. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Aspirin has been demonstrated to prevent a first myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke among individuals at high risk 12, 13 and to be cost‐effective. 16, 17 It also decreases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events and death among individuals who have already experienced an MI or stroke. 14, 15

Regular aspirin use for primary prevention (PP) of CVD has been evaluated in multiple well‐designed clinical trials. In 1989, the Physician's Health Study reported a 44% reduction in risk of a first MI for male participants who received aspirin. 12 Regular aspirin use led to a 24% reduction in risk for ischemic stroke in women as demonstrated in the Women's Health Study in 2005. 13 These studies and others 18, 19, 20 led the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2009 to develop a class A recommendation for PP aspirin use in men aged 45 to 79 years and women aged 55 to 79 years for whom CVD ischemic event prevention outweighs bleeding risk. 21 This recommendation provided a distinctly favorable recommendation for aspirin use compared with the 2002 statement. The 2009 recommendation also offered specific benefit/risk guidance tables to facilitate the use of aspirin for PP, compared with the 2002 statement, which only recommended a discussion between clinicians and patients at increased risk for CVD ischemic events. Contemporary studies of PP aspirin use in low‐risk cohorts (eg, the Japanese Primary Prevention Project 22) have since demonstrated similar reductions in a first MI. A recent systematic review analyzed 11 PP aspirin trials completed in the past 3 decades. The meta‐analysis demonstrated a significant 22% reduction in nonfatal MI (relative risk, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71–0.87). 23

### Aspirin with or without statin in Individuals without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across risk Categories [^113xphh1]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The role of aspirin in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains controversial. In 2019, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommended considering prophylactic low-dose aspirin only among asymptomatic individuals at high risk of ASCVD events, low bleeding risk, and age < 70 years (IIb). In 2021, the European Society of Cardiology primary prevention guidelines endorsed a similar recommendation. More recently, the updated United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2022 guidelines recommended individualizing low-dose aspirin only among adults aged 40 to 59 years, if their 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 10% and they have low bleeding risk (Class C). In contrast, the guidelines recommend against the use of aspirin among adults ≥ 60 years (Class D). These recommendations stem from a USPSTF meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials demonstrating a significant reduction in major ASCVD events with aspirin at the cost of higher rates of major bleeding.

Statin is used as first-line therapy for the primary prevention of ASCVD due to cardiovascular benefits. Most randomized evidence favoring aspirin in primary prevention was conducted in the pre-statin era, whereas statin therapy use was more frequent at baseline in recent trials. For instance, the proportion of participants on a statin in ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly), ARRIVE (Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events), and ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes)trials were 65%, 43%, and 75%, respectively. Since statin therapy would mitigate baseline ASCVD risk, lower cardiovascular effects of aspirin in post-statin era trials might be attributable to the higher use of statin therapy. Furthermore, given a much more favorable risk-benefit profile, most patients considered for ASCVD risk reduction in current clinical practice would be expected to be on baseline statin therapy before entertaining a decision on possible aspirin initiation.

Prior studies, did not explore the potential impact of statin therapy on the net risk/benefit ratio of aspirin therapy. Therefore, this meta-analysis investigated the relative and absolute effects of aspirin in adults without ASCVD, stratified by statin use across different ASCVD risks.

### Aspirin dose for prevention of cardiovascular disease in diabetics [^11543q15]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a specific dose of aspirin can be recommended for prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes.

Data Source

Biomedical literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1990-February 2002). Key terms included diabetes, cardiovascular protection, and aspirin.

Data Synthesis

Pharmacologic and clinical studies focusing on the dose-response relationship of aspirin therapy were reviewed. Evidence supports the benefit of low-dose aspirin therapy in reducing vascular events in secondary and primary prevention trials in various patient populations; however, some studies suggest larger doses of aspirin may be needed in certain patients.

Conclusions

Review of the evidence does not support a particular dose of aspirin for cardiovascular protection in diabetic patients. Clinical guidelines recommend aspirin therapy in the range of 81–325 mg/d. However, due to an increased prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and disturbances in coagulation in diabetic patients, the dose of aspirin for prevention of cardiovascular disease in these individuals may be different from that in other populations and requires further evaluation.

### Aspirin has potential benefits for primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes in diabetes: updated literature-based and individual participant data meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials [^115y6ebB]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Implications of our findings

Compared with aspirin use for the secondary prevention of vascular disease, the use of aspirin for primary prevention has been a widely debated and controversial topic. Two recently published landmark trials, ASCEND, and ASPREE, evaluated the efficacy and safety of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes in people with diabetes and have been included in this review. Whereas the absolute benefits of aspirin on vascular benefits were counterbalanced by the bleeding hazard in the ASCEND study, there was no differential effect of aspirin on the risk of CVD and bleeding in people with diabetes in the ASPREE trial. Though our results show aspirin may have a beneficial effect in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes, aspirin had no differential effect on bleeding risk. Given the imprecise estimates reported for GI and non-GI bleeding, these results may be due to inadequate power of these trials to detect these events. Indeed, a wealth of data from general and secondary prevention populations suggests that the main adverse effect associated with aspirin use is GI bleeding. Both low aspirin dosage and long term therapy is associated with an absolute excess of GI bleeding complications in these population groups. A higher risk of bleeding events has also been reported among the elderly and people at low cardiovascular risk. Though the current data suggests otherwise, real-world data in general populations have demonstrated higher rates of bleeding in people with diabetes on aspirin therapy. Taking the overall findings together, two questions still remain on the role of aspirin therapy in primary prevention of CVD in diabetes: (i) are the absolute vascular benefits of aspirin counterbalanced by the potential for bleeding and (ii) in what groups of the population do the benefits of aspirin outweigh its bleeding hazards. Based on a recent comprehensive narrative review by Lippi and colleagues, the authors suggest that the harms of aspirin in primary prevention of CVD may be larger than the benefits, especially in the elderly general population. Our study findings suggest there may be important differences in the effect of aspirin by treatment dosage, treatment duration, as well as smoking status, but these results are based on limited data from subgroup analyses. Though our findings showed no suggestions of differences in the effect of aspirin by gender on all outcomes evaluated, there is evidence suggesting that the variation in the effect of aspirin therapy on cardiovascular outcomes could be explained by gender. In a meta-analysis of 23 trials which aimed to evaluate whether gender might play a role in explaining the large variation of aspirin efficacy across primary and secondary MI prevention trials, the authors demonstrated that gender accounted for a substantial proportion of the variability in the efficacy of aspirin in reducing MI rates across these trials. Emerging evidence points to the fact that women have an increased risk of aspirin resistance compared to men, which makes aspirin less effective in women. Apart from the condition diabetes which is associated with reduced rates of responsiveness to aspirin, other factors that could potentially reduce the antiplatelet effect of aspirin include older age, obesity, renal insufficiency, and platelet count. To answer all these pertinent questions may require an IPD meta-analysis based on all contributing trials. An updated meta-analysis by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration could help address some of these questions. There have been contradictory guideline recommendations on the role of aspirin in primary CVD prevention; however, the ADA recommends the use of low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in adults with type 1 and 2 diabetes who are at increased CVD risk, whereas not recommended for people at low CVD risk as the potential for bleeds likely offsets potential benefits in these people. Though the current findings do not justify these recommendations, it appears the clinical decision to initiate low dose aspirin for primary prevention is a complex process and should be individualised and tailored to each patient's baseline CVD and bleeding risk, as these tend to differ from one individual to another. Patients preferences should also be taken into account when making the decision. Leggio and colleagues in their review recommend that when a decision is taken to initiate primary CVD prevention, uncoated aspirin formulations with higher bioavailability should be prescribed at the lowest effective lower dose and concurrently used with proton-pump inhibitors for those at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, concurrent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided and those with rapid platelet turnover should be considered for twice-daily dosing regimen.

### Lack of aspirin effect: aspirin resistance or resistance to taking aspirin? [^11513kRt]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A lack of aspirin effect on platelets after a myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with poor health outcome. This lack of effect may be due to biological resistance to aspirin or due to nonadherence (the patient is not taking the aspirin, hence it has no effect). Determining which of these factors predicts poor outcome would inform potential intervention strategies.

Methods

Aspirin effect on platelets was assessed in a cohort of MI survivors who were divided into three groups: group A ("adherent"), patients whose platelets were affected by aspirin; group B ("nonadherent"), patients whose platelets showed no aspirin effect and who admitted in an interview that they were not taking their medications; and group C (potentially biologically resistant to aspirin), patients whose platelets showed no aspirin effect but maintained that they were taking their aspirin. Two health outcome measures (death, reinfarction, or rehospitalization for unstable angina; or admission for any cardiovascular causes) were assessed 12 months after enrollment.

Results

Seventy-three patients were enrolled and classified into groups A ("adherent", 52 patients), B ("nonadherent", 12 patients), and C ("potentially aspirin resistant", 9 patients). Adverse events and readmission were more common in the nonadherent group (B)-42% and 67%, respectively, when compared with the adherent group (A)-6% and 11%, and with the potentially biologically resistant group (C)-11% and 11%.

Conclusions

Nonadherence is a significant mediator of poor outcome. It is important to evaluate whether or not patients are taking their medications in clinical settings and in studies that evaluate the effect of prescribed medications.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: time for a platelet-guided approach [^117MfeiK]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Approaches to pharmacological primary cardiovascular disease prevention. Primary preventive antihypertensive and statin therapy are prescribed after a cardiovascular risk assessment and the measurement of a biomarker related to the drug class's primary mechanism of action. In contrast, primary preventive aspirin therapy is prescribed after cardiovascular risk assessment alone and is not guided by any related biomarker. CV indicates cardiovascular; and LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

In contrast, guidelines directing the use of aspirin for primary CVD prevention do not consider a mechanism-related biomarker. This is as previous primary CVD prevention trials of aspirin therapy enrolled subjects based on age alone or age and CVD risk and did not use measures of platelet activity. The absence of a platelet biomarker in these trials is notable, as both the risk (excess bleeding) and benefit (protection against thrombosis) of aspirin reflect the drug's platelet-inhibitory effects. Though the measurement of platelet activity in response to P2Y 12 inhibition among individuals on dual antiplatelet therapy (P2Y 12 inhibitor and aspirin) did not improve clinical outcomes in prospective randomized secondary prevention trials, studies were limited by analyzing only ADP-induced platelet activity and small sample size with inadequate power. We propose a different approaching — measuring the platelet phenotype at baseline to identify individuals at particular risk for platelet-mediated events, for example, MI and stroke. It stands to reason that adding this measurement of baseline platelet activity to traditional CV risk assessment may be the key to developing better aspirin use practices. This leads to the question of how best to measure platelet activity.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116PX8t1]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Biological understanding of aspirin's effects — mechanistic benefits and risks are summarized: 'At lower doses, aspirin is an irreversible cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme inhibitor. At higher doses, aspirin also inhibits COX-2'. Aspirin 'reduces the risk for atherothrombosis through the inhibition of platelet function (through COX-1 inhibition) and has been used widely for the prevention of CVD events, particularly for secondary prevention'. However, 'The COX-1 enzyme is also responsible for producing a variety of prostaglandins that protect the gastrointestinal mucosa. By inhibiting this enzyme, aspirin use can promote gastrointestinal bleeding'. The page also notes that 'The mechanism for the possible antineoplastic effects of aspirin is not as well understood'.

### Primary care providers should prescribe aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease based on benefit-risk ratio, not age [^112nowSR]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent guidelines restricted aspirin (ASA) in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) to patients < 70 years old and more recent guidance to < 60. In the most comprehensive prior meta-analysis, the Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration reported a significant 12% reduction in CVD with similar benefit-risk ratios at older ages. Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, four trials were added to an updated meta-analysis. ASA produced a statistically significant 13% reduction in CVD with 95% confidence limits (0.83 to 0.92) with similar benefits at older ages in each of the trials. Primary care providers should make individual decisions whether to prescribe ASA based on benefit-risk ratio, not simply age. When the absolute risk of CVD is > 10%, benefits of ASA will generally outweigh risks of significant bleeding. ASA should be considered only after implementation of therapeutic lifestyle changes and other drugs of proven benefit such as statins, which are, at the very least, additive to ASA. Our perspective is that individual clinical judgements by primary care providers about prescription of ASA in primary prevention of CVD should be based on our evidence-based solution of weighing all the absolute benefits and risks rather than age. This strategy would do far more good for far more patients as well as far more good than harm in both developed and developing countries. This new and novel strategy for primary care providers to consider in prescribing ASA in primary prevention of CVD is the same as the general approach suggested by Professor Geoffrey Rose decades ago.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in women and men: a sex-specific meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1157hjdc]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Aspirin therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease in adults who are at increased risk. However, it is unclear if women derive the same benefit as men.

Objective

To determine if the benefits and risks of aspirin treatment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease vary by sex.

Data Sources and Study Selection

MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases (1966 to March 2005), bibliographies of retrieved trials, and reports presented at major scientific meetings. Eligible studies were prospective, randomized controlled trials of aspirin therapy in participants without cardiovascular disease that reported data on myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cardiovascular mortality. Six trials with a total of 95 456 individuals were identified; 3 trials included only men, 1 included only women, and 2 included both sexes.

Data Extraction

Studies were reviewed to determine the number of patients randomized, mean duration of follow-up, and end points (a composite of cardiovascular events [nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular mortality], each of these individual components separately, and major bleeding).

Data Synthesis

Among 51,342 women, there were 1285 major cardiovascular events: 625 strokes, 469 MIs, and 364 cardiovascular deaths. Aspirin therapy was associated with a significant 12% reduction in cardiovascular events (odds ratio [OR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79–0.99; p = 0.03) and a 17% reduction in stroke (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70–0.97; p = 0.02), which was a reflection of reduced rates of ischemic stroke (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.93; p = 0.008). There was no significant effect on MI or cardiovascular mortality. Among 44,114 men, there were 2047 major cardiovascular events: 597 strokes, 1023 MIs, and 776 cardiovascular deaths. Aspirin therapy was associated with a significant 14% reduction in cardiovascular events (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78–0.94; p = 0.01) and a 32% reduction in MI (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54–0.86; p = 0.001). There was no significant effect on stroke or cardiovascular mortality. Aspirin treatment increased the risk of bleeding in women (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.13–2.52; p = 0.01) and in men (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.35–2.20; P < .001).

Conclusions

For women and men, aspirin therapy reduced the risk of a composite of cardiovascular events due to its effect on reducing the risk of ischemic stroke in women and MI in men. Aspirin significantly increased the risk of bleeding to a similar degree among women and men.

### Aspirin in the primary and secondary prevention of vascular disease: collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised trials [^111oBoek]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Low-dose aspirin is of definite and substantial net benefit for many people who already have occlusive vascular disease. We have assessed the benefits and risks in primary prevention.

Methods

We undertook meta-analyses of serious vascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death) and major bleeds in six primary prevention trials (95,000 individuals at low average risk, 660,000 person-years, 3554 serious vascular events) and 16 secondary prevention trials (17,000 individuals at high average risk, 43,000 person-years, 3306 serious vascular events) that compared long-term aspirin versus control. We report intention-to-treat analyses of first events during the scheduled treatment period.

Findings

In the primary prevention trials, aspirin allocation yielded a 12% proportional reduction in serious vascular events (0.51% aspirin vs 0.57% control per year, p = 0.0001), due mainly to a reduction of about a fifth in non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.18%vs 0.23% per year, p < 0.0001). The net effect on stroke was not significant (0.20%vs 0.21% per year, p = 0.4: haemorrhagic stroke 0.04%vs 0.03%, p = 0.05; other stroke 0.16%vs 0.18% per year, p = 0.08). Vascular mortality did not differ significantly (0.19%vs 0.19% per year, p = 0.7). Aspirin allocation increased major gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeds (0.10%vs 0.07% per year, p < 0.0001), and the main risk factors for coronary disease were also risk factors for bleeding. In the secondary prevention trials, aspirin allocation yielded a greater absolute reduction in serious vascular events (6.7%vs 8.2% per year, p < 0.0001), with a non-significant increase in haemorrhagic stroke but reductions of about a fifth in total stroke (2.08%vs 2.54% per year, p = 0.002) and in coronary events (4.3%vs 5.3% per year, p < 0.0001). In both primary and secondary prevention trials, the proportional reductions in the aggregate of all serious vascular events seemed similar for men and women.

Interpretation

In primary prevention without previous disease, aspirin is of uncertain net value as the reduction in occlusive events needs to be weighed against any increase in major bleeds. Further trials are in progress.

### Aspirin resistance, an emerging, often overlooked, factor in the management of patients with coronary artery disease [^115smzi1]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Aspirin is the most widely used medication in patients with cardiovascular disease. It has had a greater effect on patients with cardiovascular disease than any other drug. With the importance of aspirin now known for decades, it is recently becoming clearer that some patients do not derive as great a benefit from this "wonder drug" secondary to their resistance to its effects. Aspirin resistance, its prevalence, its identification, and how to overcome or avert it with other medications then becomes a central topic of discussion as important, if not more so, than the importance of aspirin itself as a cornerstone in the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease. This review explores the current understanding of the mechanism of aspirin resistance with regard to its prevalence and the magnitude of its clinical significance. It also examines the therapeutic implications of a diagnosis of aspirin resistance.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^115wxL3G]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease events in patients without a history of cardiovascular disease is controversial.

Purpose

To examine the benefits and harms of aspirin chemoprevention.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966 to May 2001).

Study Selection

1) Randomized trials at least 1 year in duration that examined aspirin chemoprevention in patients without previously known cardiovascular disease and 2) systematic reviews, recent trials, and observational studies that examined rates of hemorrhagic strokes and gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to aspirin use.

Data Extraction

One reviewer read and extracted data from each included article and constructed evidence tables. A second reviewer checked the accuracy of the data extraction. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Meta-analysis was performed, and the quantitative results of the review were then used to model the consequences of treating patients with different levels of baseline risk for coronary heart disease. Five trials examined the effect of aspirin on cardiovascular events in patients with no previous cardiovascular disease. For patients similar to those enrolled in the trials, aspirin reduces the risk for the combined end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (summary odds ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.87]). Aspirin increased the risk for hemorrhagic strokes (summary odds ratio, 1.4 [CI, 0.9 to 2.0]) and major gastrointestinal bleeding (summary odds ratio, 1.7 [CI, 1.4 to 2.1]). All-cause mortality (summary odds ratio, 0.93 [CI, 0.84 to 1.02]) was not significantly affected. For 1000 patients with a 5% risk for coronary heart disease events over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 6 to 20 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events. For patients with a risk of 1% over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 1 to 4 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events.

Conclusions

The net benefit of aspirin increases with increasing cardiovascular risk. In the decision to use aspirin chemoprevention, the patient's cardiovascular risk and relative utility for the different clinical outcomes prevented or caused by aspirin use must be considered.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^112xCoAw]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — aspirin prophylaxis recommendations and dosing — In recent trials, the estimated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk has exceeded observed risk during follow-up, supporting a lower class of recommendation with removal of a specific PCE threshold; accordingly, a Class IIb recommendation remains more suitable than a Class III recommendation for adults 40 to 70 years of age. Given the narrow balance of benefits and harms, there is limited justification to use aspirin at doses > 100 mg daily for primary prevention; meta-analyses suggest the ASCVD risk benefit for low-dose aspirin is equivalent to that for high-dose aspirin, but the bleeding risk is higher with high-dose aspirin, and low-dose prophylactic aspirin may be best justified among persons at high ASCVD risk who cannot achieve optimal control of other ASCVD risk factors.

### Aspirin therapy in primary cardiovascular disease prevention: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology working group on thrombosis [^112wYM4j]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although the use of oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists) has been abandoned in primary cardiovascular prevention due to lack of a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, the indications for aspirin use in this setting continue to be a source of major debate, with major international guidelines providing conflicting recommendations. Here, we review the evidence in favor and against aspirin therapy in primary prevention based on the evidence accumulated so far, including recent data linking aspirin with cancer protection. While awaiting the results of several ongoing studies, we argue for a pragmatic approach to using low-dose aspirin in primary cardiovascular prevention and suggest its use in patients at high cardiovascular risk, defined as ≥ 2 major cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) projected per 100 person-years, who are not at increased risk of bleeding.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111wnEey]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF aspirin use for primary prevention — Updates and burden highlight that the USPSTF currently recommends considering initiating aspirin in persons with an estimated 10% or greater CVD risk at a younger age: 40 years instead of 50 years, and there is a new recommendation not to initiate aspirin in adults 60 years or older for primary prevention, while the evidence is unclear whether aspirin use reduces the risk of colorectal cancer incidence or mortality. The burden statement notes that CVD is the leading cause of mortality in the US, accounting for more than 1 in 4 deaths, and each year an estimated 605 000 Americans have a first heart attack and about 610 000 experience a first stroke.

Conclusions

Aspirin has potential benefits in cardiovascular primary prevention in diabetes, but these may be counterbalanced by an increased bleeding risk. There are suggestions of differential effects of aspirin on cardiovascular outcomes by treatment dosage and duration as well as smoking status, but more data is required. The use of low dose aspirin may need to be individualised and based on each individuals baseline CVD and bleeding risk.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: an update of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^112id9hc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are leading causes of death in the United States. In 2002, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommended that clinicians discuss aspirin with adults who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease.

Purpose

To determine the benefits and harms of taking aspirin for the primary prevention of myocardial infarctions, strokes, and death.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and Cochrane Library (search dates, 1 January 2001 to 28 August 2008), recent systematic reviews, reference lists of retrieved articles, and suggestions from experts.

Study Selection

English-language randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); case-control studies; meta-analyses; and systematic reviews of aspirin versus control for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were selected to answer the following questions: Does aspirin decrease coronary heart events, strokes, death from coronary heart events or stroke, or all-cause mortality in adults without known CVD? Does aspirin increase gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhagic strokes?

Data Extraction

All studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined USPSTF criteria.

Data Synthesis

New evidence from 1 good-quality RCT, 1 good-quality meta-analysis, and 2 fair-quality subanalyses of RCTs demonstrates that aspirin use reduces the number of CVD events in patients without known CVD. Men in these studies experienced fewer myocardial infarctions and women experienced fewer ischemic strokes. Aspirin does not seem to affect CVD mortality or all-cause mortality in either men or women. The use of aspirin for primary prevention increases the risk for major bleeding events, primarily gastrointestinal bleeding events, in both men and women. Men have an increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes with aspirin use. A new RCT and meta-analysis suggest that the risk for hemorrhagic strokes in women is not statistically significantly increased.

Limitations

New evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is limited. The dose of aspirin used in the RCTs varied, which prevented the estimation of the most appropriate dose for primary prevention. Several of the RCTs were conducted within populations of health professionals, which potentially limits generalizability.

Conclusion

Aspirin reduces the risk for myocardial infarction in men and strokes in women. Aspirin use increases the risk for serious bleeding events.

### Aspirin for primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention as baseline risk increases: a meta-regression analysis [^111ak3t6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Aspirin has long had a role in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); however, recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have challenged this practice. Despite this, aspirin is still commonly recommended for high-risk primary prevention. We tested the hypothesis that aspirin is more efficacious for the primary prevention of ASCVD as the baseline risk increases.

Methods

RCTs that compared aspirin with control for primary prevention and evaluated ASCVD (composite of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke) and major bleeding were included. Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. A regression analysis was performed using the ASCVD event rate in the control arm of each RCT as the moderator.

Results

Twelve RCTs were identified with 963,829 patient-years of follow-up. Aspirin was associated with a reduction in ASCVD (4.7 vs 5.3 events per 1000 patient-years; RR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79–0.92). There was increased major bleeding among aspirin users (2.5 vs 1.8 events per 1000 patient-years; RR 1.41; 95% CI, 1.29–1.54). Regression analysis found no relationship between the log RR of ASCVD or major bleeding and rate of ASCVD in the control arm of each RCT.

Conclusion

Aspirin is associated with a reduction in ASCVD when used for primary prevention; however, it is unlikely to be clinically significant given the increase in bleeding. More importantly, aspirin's treatment effect does not increase as ASCVD risk increases, as many hypothesize. There is no suggestion from these data that use of aspirin for higher-risk primary prevention patients is beneficial.

### Association of aspirin use for primary prevention with cardiovascular events and bleeding events: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116hjCXJ]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The role for aspirin in cardiovascular primary prevention remains controversial, with potential benefits limited by an increased bleeding risk.

Objective

To assess the association of aspirin use for primary prevention with cardiovascular events and bleeding.

Data Sources

PubMed and Embase were searched on Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials from the earliest available date through November 1, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials enrolling at least 1000 participants with no known cardiovascular disease and a follow-up of at least 12 months were included. Included studies compared aspirin use with no aspirin (placebo or no treatment).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were screened and extracted independently by both investigators. Bayesian and frequentist meta-analyses were performed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary cardiovascular outcome was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The primary bleeding outcome was any major bleeding (defined by the individual studies).

Results

A total of 13 trials randomizing 164 225 participants with 1 050 511 participant-years of follow-up were included. The median age of trial participants was 62 years (range, 53–74), 77 501 (47%) were men, 30 361 (19%) had diabetes, and the median baseline risk of the primary cardiovascular outcome was 9.2% (range, 2.6%-15.9%). Aspirin use was associated with significant reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome compared with no aspirin (57.1 per 10 000 participant-years with aspirin and 61.4 per 10 000 participant-years with no aspirin) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89 [95% credible interval, 0.84–0.95]; absolute risk reduction, 0.38% [95% CI, 0.20%-0.55%]; number needed to treat, 265). Aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding events compared with no aspirin (23.1 per 10 000 participant-years with aspirin and 16.4 per 10 000 participant-years with no aspirin) (HR, 1.43 [95% credible interval, 1.30–1.56]; absolute risk increase, 0.47% [95% CI, 0.34%-0.62%]; number needed to harm, 210).

Conclusions and Relevance

The use of aspirin in individuals without cardiovascular disease was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events and an increased risk of major bleeding. This information may inform discussions with patients about aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events and bleeding.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116fEXro]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the benefits and harms of low dose aspirin in people with diabetes and no cardiovascular disease.

Design

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Data Sources

Medline (1966-November 2008), the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (Cochrane Library 2008; issue 4), and reference lists of retrieved articles. Review methods Randomised trials of aspirin compared with placebo or no aspirin in people with diabetes and no pre-existing cardiovascular disease were eligible for inclusion. Data on major cardiovascular events (death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and all cause mortality) were extracted and pooled with a random effect model. Results are reported as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Of 157 studies in the literature searches, six were eligible (10 117 participants). When aspirin was compared with placebo there was no statistically significant reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events (five studies, 9584 participants; relative risk 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.00), cardiovascular mortality (four studies, n = 8557, 0.94; 0.72 to 1.23), or all cause mortality (four studies, n = 8557; 0.93, 0.82 to 1.05). Significant heterogeneity was found in the analysis for myocardial infarction (I(2) = 62.2%; P = 0.02) and stroke (I(2) = 52.5%; P = 0.08). Aspirin significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction in men (0.57, 0.34 to 0.94) but not in women (1.08, 0.71 to 1.65; P for interaction = 0.056). Evidence relating to harms was inconsistent.

Conclusions

A clear benefit of aspirin in the primary prevention of major cardiovascular events in people with diabetes remains unproved. Sex may be an important effect modifier. Toxicity is to be explored further.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^115eRH8U]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The lowest effective daily dose of aspirin for long-term antiplatelet prophylaxis ranges between 50 and 100 mg, with no evidence that higher doses are more effective, consistent with saturability of platelet COX-1 inactivation at low doses. This evidence is based on indirect comparisons of RCTs employing different aspirin dosing regimens, as well as on a limited number of head-to-head randomized comparisons of a lower vs. a higher dose, both in acute coronary syndromesand stable patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

There is also no convincing evidence that the dose requirement for the antithrombotic effect of aspirin varies in different clinical settings or as a function of body weight. Similarly, there is no evidence that the effect of aspirin on major vascular events is influenced by gender, age, concomitant treatments, or primary vs. secondary prevention. In the ASPREE trial involving 19 114 healthy elderly persons (median age, 74 years) who did not have known cardiovascular disease (CVD), the use of low-dose aspirin did not result in a significantly lower risk of CVD than placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83–1.08]. However, the widely cited message from ASPREE that low-dose aspirin is ineffective in old age is potentially misleading, for the following reasons: (i) CVD was not the primary endpoint of ASPREE; (ii) CVD, a pre-specified secondary endpoint, was a composite of platelet-dependent as well as platelet-independent events, i.e. fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal MI, fatal or non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure; and (iii) when the analysis was restricted to a traditional composite of fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal MI, or fatal or non-fatal ischaemic stroke, the rate of this endpoint was 7.8 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 8.8 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.77–1.03). Such a moderate treatment effect is identical to that reported for younger subjects (< 65 years) in a setting of primary prevention, an effect that ASPREE failed to detect as statistically significant in a population at low cardiovascular risk (< 1.0% per year) because it was largely underpowered. Despite serious limitations, these results were published as a separate, stand-alone paper in the New England Journal of Medicine and named as one of the 12 'game changers' of 2018.

### Meta-analysis of data from the six primary prevention trials of cardiovascular events using aspirin [^111e5sY1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Until recently, 5 major studies have formed the basis for the use of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) in primary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) events. Despite these data, the role of aspirin in primary prevention has not been established firmly. Six randomized trials have evaluated the benefits of aspirin for the primary prevention of CV events: the British Doctors' Trial, the Physicians' Health Study, the Thrombosis Prevention Trial, the Hypertension Optimal Treatment study, the Primary Prevention Project, and the Women's Health Study. The combined sample consists of 47,293 subjects on aspirin and 45,580 not on aspirin or placebo. A meta-analysis of these 6 trials assessed 6 CV end points: total coronary heart disease (CHD), nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), total CV events, stroke, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality. No covariate adjustment was performed and appropriate tests for treatment effect, heterogeneity, and study size bias were applied. Using odds ratios and confidence intervals, the meta-analysis suggested superiority of aspirin for total CHD, nonfatal MI, and total CV events (p ≤ 0.001 in each case), with a nonsignificant trend (0.07 < p < 0.34) for decreased risk of stroke, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality. There was no evidence of statistical bias (p > 0.05). Given the study size and cohort, aspirin decreased the risk of CV events in this large patient sample. In conclusion, primary prevention with aspirin decreased the risk of total CHD, nonfatal MI, and total CV events, but there were no significant differences in the incidences of stroke or CV mortality.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for preventing cardiovascular events [^117JHWpt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for people with cardiovascular disease. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefit for people at high risk and people with established cardiovascular disease. This is an update to a previously published review from 2011.

Objectives

To review the benefit and harm of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy for preventing cardiovascular events in people who have coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or were at high risk of atherothrombotic disease, but did not have a coronary stent.

Search Methods

We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2017, Issue 6), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 4 July 2017) and Embase (Ovid, 1947 to 3 July 2017) on 4 July 2017. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP portal, and handsearched reference lists. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials comparing over 30 days use of aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone in people with coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or at high risk of atherothrombotic disease. We excluded studies including only people with coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) or non-DES, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on mortality from cardiovascular causes, all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke, major and minor bleeding. The overall treatment effect was estimated by the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel); we used a random-effects model in cases of moderate or severe heterogeneity (I 2 ≥ 30%). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used GRADE profiler (GRADE Pro) to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

The search identified 13 studies in addition to the two studies in the previous version of our systematic review. Overall, we included data from 15 trials with 33,970 people. We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The risk of bias was low in four trials because they were at low risk of bias for all key domains (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data), even if some of them were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Analysis showed no difference in the effectiveness of aspirin plus clopidogrel in preventing cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10; participants = 31,903; studies = 7; moderate quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; participants = 32,908; studies = 9; low quality evidence). There was a lower risk of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; participants = 16,175; studies = 6; moderate quality evidence). There was a reduction in the risk of fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.91; participants = 4006; studies = 5; moderate quality evidence). However, there was a higher risk of major bleeding with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.64; participants = 33,300; studies = 10; moderate quality evidence) and of minor bleeding (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.36; participants = 14,731; studies = 8; moderate quality evidence). Overall, we would expect 13 myocardial infarctions and 23 ischaemic strokes be prevented for every 1000 patients treated with the combination in a median follow-up period of 12 months, but 9 major bleeds and 33 minor bleeds would be caused during a median follow-up period of 10.5 and 6 months, respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence demonstrates that the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease and people with established cardiovascular disease without a coronary stent is associated with a reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, and an increased risk of major and minor bleeding compared with aspirin alone. According to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence was moderate for all outcomes except all-cause mortality (low quality evidence) and adverse events (very low quality evidence).

### Recent trends in aspirin use for cardiovascular disease prevention in the United States, 2015 to 2023 [^116EEowU]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In response to recent trials, aspirin use has decreased for primary prevention, both among older adults as advised by guideline changes, but also younger adults at elevated risk, which needs further study. Aspirin use for secondary prevention also reduced which needs to be evaluated in the context of P2Y12 use. Physicians must continually ensure their patients are informed and on appropriate prevention regimens.

### Aspirin in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease: past and current perspectives and future directions [^114UB78W]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In secondary prevention among a wide range of patients who have survived a prior occlusive vascular event, as well as during acute myocardial infarction and acute occlusive stroke, aspirin produces statistically significant and clinically important reductions in the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction, stroke, and vascular death. In primary prevention, aspirin reduces risk of a first myocardial infarction, but the data on stroke and vascular deaths remain inconclusive. In addition, the average absolute risk of subjects randomized in the primary prevention trials was so low that it is not possible to get reliable estimates of the benefit-to-risk ratio in primary prevention in subjects at moderate risk. Until the results of ongoing trials are available, nobody would disagree that a nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke is more likely to be disabling than a nonfatal bleed. Thus, in primary prevention at present, the appropriate and judicious use of aspirin by clinicians based on individual clinical judgments that weigh their absolute benefits against the absolute risks of the drug, will avoid premature morbidity and possibly, mortality.

### Effect of aspirin on mortality in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^113jgpBQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The lack of a mortality benefit of aspirin in prior meta-analyses of primary prevention trials of cardiovascular disease has contributed to uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks of aspirin in primary prevention. We performed an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of aspirin to obtain best estimates of the effect of aspirin on mortality in primary prevention.

Methods

Eligible articles were identified by searches of electronic databases and reference lists. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and bleeding. Data were pooled from individual trials using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model, and results are presented as relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Nine randomized controlled trials enrolling 100,076 participants were included. Aspirin reduced all-cause mortality (RR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88–1.00), myocardial infarction (RR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69–1.00), ischemic stroke (RR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.98), and the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death (RR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83–0.94), but did not reduce cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.84–1.09). Aspirin increased the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01–1.82), major bleeding (RR 1.66; 95% CI, 1.41–1.95), and gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 1.37; 95% CI, 1.15–1.62). A lack of availability of patient-level data precluded exploration of benefits and risks of aspirin in key subgroups.

Conclusion

Aspirin prevents deaths, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke, and increases hemorrhagic stroke and major bleeding when used in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Conclusions

PP aspirin use did not temporally increase in a large primary care population following the release of the 2009 USPSTF recommendations. Aspirin use was observed to increase with CVD risk and is highly prevalent in a high‐risk population but may be underused in those with a 10% to 20% 10‐year risk of CVD. As the 2016 USPSTF aspirin PP recommendations are considered for national dissemination, specific interventions to inform patients and health professionals should be implemented in primary care settings to improve PP aspirin use.

### Use of aspirin to reduce risk of initial vascular events in patients at moderate risk of cardiovascular disease (ARRIVE): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116Pe9C6]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study ARRIVE (aspirin) was published by Gaziano JM and colleagues in 2018 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiovascular disease prevention, Transient ischemic attack, Acute ischemic stroke, Unstable angina, ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the trial question was: what is the role of aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients at moderate risk of CVD? In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the population was: 12546 patients (3708 female, 8838 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a moderate estimated risk of a first cardiovascular event. The key exclusion criteria were high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or other bleeding, diabetes, history of a vascular event, such as stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary artery angioplasty or stenting, CABG, congestive HF, or vascular intervention. In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the interventions were: n = 6270 aspirin (100 mg PO once daily daily) n = 6276 placebo (matching tablet once daily). In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, unstable angina, or TIA (4.29% vs. 4.48%; HR 0.96, 96% CI 0.81 to 1.13). In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction in the intention-to-treat population (1.52% vs. 1.78%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.11) No significant difference in in the intention-to-treat population, nonfatal myocardial infarction (1.4% vs. 1.56%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.2) No significant difference in death, in the intention-to-treat population (2.55% vs. 2.57%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.8 to 1.24). In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events (82.01% vs. 81.72%). significant differences in overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events (16.75% vs. 13.54%, p < 0.0001), and gastrointestinal bleeding events (0.97% vs. 0.46%, p = 0.0007). In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the conclusion was: in patients with a moderate estimated risk of a first cardiovascular event, aspirin was not superior to placebo with respect to myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, unstable angina, or TIA.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117QVVss]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF recommendation update — primary prevention aspirin in adults states that the USPSTF recommends that the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one and recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 60 years or older. The USPSTF concluded that the evidence is inadequate that low-dose aspirin use reduces CRC incidence or mortality.

### Aspirin use and misuse for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [^1125LNKN]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Daily aspirin use for primary cardiovascular disease prevention is common among adults. Numerous clinical trials observe reduced cardiovascular disease with regular low-dose aspirin. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2016 published guidelines for aspirin use, but controversy exists about the side effects, and overuse or underuse may be common despite the guidelines. Using the Task Force recommendations, this paper describes the prevalence of appropriate aspirin use and physician advice in a population sample.

Methods

A random sample of men and women (aged 50–69 years) living in the Upper Midwest in 2017–2018 were surveyed, collecting demographic data, health history, and aspirin use. Appropriate primary prevention with aspirin was defined as having ≥ 10% cardiovascular disease risk (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking) with daily or every other day aspirin use. Those with prevalent cardiovascular disease were labeled as secondary prevention.

Results

A total of 1,352 adults were surveyed (697 women, 655 men). The criteria for secondary prevention were fulfilled in 188 participants, and these were eliminated from the analysis. In the remaining group, aspirin was indicated in 32.9% (383 of 1,164). Among those, 46.0% (176 of 383) were appropriate users, and 54.0% (207 of 383) were nonusers despite indications. Overuse, where aspirin is not indicated, was common at 26.9% (210 of 781). Discussion with a physician, although reported in 29% of subjects, was associated with some improvement in the appropriate use but also with overuse and underuse.

Conclusions

Aspirin use for primary cardiovascular disease prevention is common. However, many adults are medicating without indication (overuse) or are not using aspirin despite guidelines (underuse).

### Is aspirin useful in primary prevention? [^112YLe5M]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

There is no evidence that aspirin is effective for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events, although it may change the way that they present. Indeed, there is no evidence that long-term aspirin should be given to patients even with known cardiovascular disease. Theoretical arguments that aspirin can prevent cardiovascular events by reducing the propagation of thrombus are countered by evidence that plaque haemorrhage from vasa vasorum may also cause plaque growth and instability. There is evidence that aspirin causes serious bleeding into the brain and the gut. Aspirin may also detract from the benefits of drugs that have definite cardiovascular benefits, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Meta-analysis is prone to multiple biases in favour of aspirin, including publication bias, bias due to trial and endpoint selection and bias due to interpretation. Meta-analysis should not be relied on in preference to adequately powered clinical trials. Unfortunately, the benefits of aspirin, if they exist, may be so small that a very large study indeed would be required to demonstrate that its benefits outweigh its risks. The evidence that aspirin might reduce cancer is intriguing but relies on data from trials conducted many decades ago using a wide range of aspirin doses. There is no reliable evidence that aspirin used in the current fashionable doses of 50–100 mg/day is of any benefit in any common clinical setting.

### Aspirin for primary prevention: a challenging decision [^113KnG66]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a challenging issue for clinicians, patients, and health policy makers. Even with the availability of multiple randomized trials and several high‐quality systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, significant debate remains about which patients, if any, should be offered aspirin for primary prevention. – The main US guideline‐issuing organizations, including the US Preventive Services Task Force and the American Heart Association, have made recommendations in favor of aspirin use for primary prevention in people with increased CVD risk who are not at high risk for aspirin's adverse effects. – Others have recommended against aspirin use for most patients without a prior history of CVD events. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a statement reaffirming that "[it] has reviewed the available data and does not believe the evidence supports the general use of aspirin for primary prevention of a heart attack or stroke".

Much of the debate about aspirin's use for primary prevention centers on 2 key issues: (1) how to integrate information on potential benefits derived from multiple trials that were performed in heterogeneous populations, that used a range of doses of aspirin, and that were conducted in the context of differing availability of other effective interventions, such as statins; and (2) how to assess whether the potential benefits outweigh the known harms of aspirin, including gastrointestinal bleeding and, less commonly but more seriously, hemorrhagic stroke. Most analyses accept the general concept that aspirin will be more clearly indicated for people at higher CVD risk because even a modest reduction in relative risk of CVD events would offer net benefit after taking into account aspirin's effects on bleeding.

The potential stakes of the aspirin decision are enormous. Decisions about aspirin for primary prevention could apply to the more than 100 million US adults aged 40 to 75 years. CVD remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this age group and results in more than $200 billion in direct and indirect care costs. Cost‐effectiveness analyses have suggested that aspirin, if modestly effective for CVD prevention, could extend lives and reduce health care costs, particularly in higher‐risk patients. – An analysis by the Prevention Priorities Project ranks aspirin near the top of all preventive services in terms of cost‐effectiveness and ability to reduce burden of suffering. Alternatively, if the downsides of aspirin exceed its benefits (overall or in people below a certain level of CVD risk), widespread use could cause large amounts of morbidity and deflect health resources from better uses.

### Role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^116abzZB]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

The benefits of aspirin therapy for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease clearly outweigh the risks of bleeding, and low-dose aspirin is uniformly recommended in this setting. However, no clear consensus exists about whether, and if so in whom, aspirin therapy is appropriate for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Three trials of low-dose aspirin versus placebo in three populations at increased risk of myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke in the absence of established cardiovascular disease were reported in 2018. The ASPREE trial in elderly people was terminated early for futility because aspirin had no effect on disability-free survival but significantly increased the risk of major haemorrhage and, unexpectedly, all-cause mortality. In the ASCEND trial in patients with diabetes mellitus and no evidence of vascular disease, aspirin significantly reduced serious vascular events but increased major bleeding. In the ARRIVE trial in people with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, aspirin had no effect on major cardiovascular events but increased gastrointestinal bleeding. The aim of this Review is to place these new results in the context of previous evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and to appraise whether the new evidence is likely to enable the more targeted use of aspirin in particular individuals for whom the net benefit is both clinically worthwhile and statistically definite.

Low-dose aspirin may be considered for primary prevention in women on an individualized basis for those aged 40 to 59 years with a 10-year cardiovascular risk of 10% or more and without increased bleeding risk. Low-dose aspirin for primary prevention is not advised for low-risk women or women aged 60 years or older.

### Aspirin: latest evidence and developments [^1174qCkh]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is a foundation drug of the pharmaceutical industry originally derived as an analgesic/anti-inflammatory agent but serendipitously discovered to have use as a prophylactic drug for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Its modern-day utility in this latter role relies on its efficacy/safety balance in a contemporary population where, at least in high-income countries, age-standardised incident rates for MACE are falling, and where there are now competing therapeutic agents. Its future may be determined by its potential role as a chemoprophylactic or adjunct agent for cancer or other disease states. It therefore will continue to be the subject of further clinical research.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1125SJyG]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Supporting evidence — benefits of preventive medication reports 13 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving 161 680 participants; most trials used low-dose aspirin of 100 mg/d or less or aspirin every other day, with mean ages ranging from 53 years to 74 years. In pooled analyses of low-dose aspirin, decreased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction was observed (Peto odds ratio [OR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.80–0.96]) across 11 trials (n = 134 470) and decreased risk of nonfatal ischemic stroke (Peto OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78–1.00]) across 5 trials (n = 54 947). Low-dose aspirin was not associated with statistically significant effects on fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality at 3.6 to 10.1 years of follow-up, and although evidence does not suggest that the relative effect is modified by baseline CVD risk, the absolute magnitude of the benefit is greater in persons at higher CVD risk.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^115JWA3C]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Aspirin for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — evidence and bleeding risk: In adults < 40 years of age, there is insufficient evidence to judge the risk–benefit ratio of routine aspirin; although "routine use is not recommended in these settings", there is also insufficient evidence to comment on whether physicians might discuss prophylactic aspirin with adults < 40 years of age or > 70 years of age. As inferred from the first recommendation, there is "no justification for the routine administration of low-dose aspirin" among adults at low estimated ASCVD risk; in the ARRIVE trial the observed average 10-year ASCVD risk was < 10%, and "the overall benefits of prophylactic aspirin by intention-to-treat were negligible". Accumulated data "support avoiding prophylactic aspirin" when bleeding risk factors are present, including "a history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer disease or bleeding at other sites, age > 70 years, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD)", and concurrent use of agents that increase bleeding risk such as "nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, direct oral anticoagulants, and warfarin".

Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

5. How can we integrate potential benefits and harms of aspirin to determine which patients with diabetes should or should not receive aspirin for the primary prevention of CV events?

Based on the currently available evidence, aspirin appears to have a modest effect on cardiovascular events (RR reduction of ∼10%), with the absolute decrease in events depending on the underlying CVD risk (those with higher baseline risk should have greater absolute benefit). The main adverse effects appear to be an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. The excess risk may be as high as 1–5 per 1,000 per year in real-world settings. In adults with CVD risk greater than 1% per year, the number of CVD events prevented will be similar to or greater than the number of bleeding events induced, although the events considered (MI, stroke, and gastrointestinal bleeding) do not have equal effects on long-term health. We have developed recommendations based on these data.

### Antiplatelet therapy for every diabetic person? [^113vhFFN]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Until recently, aspirin was recommended by most guidelines for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes. Recommendations were primarily based on indirect evidence from large trials of populations at high risk of cardiovascular (CV) events. Evidence supporting the efficacy of aspirin therapy in trials of diabetic subjects only is scant. A previous meta-analysis on the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy in the prevention of major CV events found a clear benefit of aspirin overall, but no statistically significant benefit in the subgroup of people with diabetes. No significant reduction in the risk of major CV events with low dose aspirin compared with placebo was found in three additional trials published after that meta-analysis. New meta-analyses incorporating the results of more recent trials agree in indicating that the use of aspirin is associated with a 10% reduction in the risk of major CV events, with no significant effect on CV or all-cause mortality. A differential sex effect is also suggested. The lower-than-expected benefits of antiplatelet therapy make particularly important the evaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Aspirin use is associated with an excess risk of major bleedings of one or two cases for 1,000 individuals treated for 1 year. Such a risk is even higher in the real world setting, exponentially increases with age and is probably increased in the presence of diabetes. Given the currently available limited evidence, it seems reasonable to suggest aspirin treatment only for patients with a 10-year risk > 15%, and without contraindications for aspirin.

CV disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. In addition to the concomitant presence of multiple classical CV risk factors that increase atherothrombotic risk, diabetes is a "prothrombotic state" associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and inflammation that contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of vascular complications. For this reason, interventions to block one or multiple pathways modulating platelet activation and aggregation processes are considered as an essential component of diabetes care to reduce ischemic risk.

The use of aspirin for secondary prevention of CV events in patients with coronary or cerebrovascular disease is well established and is supported by solid evidence from the Antithrombotic Trialists' (ATT) Collaboration meta-analysis. This meta-analysis found that aspirin was beneficial in patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke or transient cerebral ischemia. In these high risk populations, aspirin decreases the risk of future events by about one-fifth.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis with a particular focus on subgroups [^116fTzCJ]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the benefit-risk ratio of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD with a particular focus on subgroups.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD versus control and including at least 1000 patients were eligible for this meta-analysis. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and net clinical benefit. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Subgroup analyses involving sex, concomitant statin treatment, diabetes, and smoking were performed.

Results

Thirteen randomized controlled trials comprising 164,225 patients were included. The risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was similar for aspirin and control groups (RR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93–1.02; RR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.90–1.08; respectively). Aspirin reduced the relative risk (RRR) of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 9% (RR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86–0.95), myocardial infarction by 14% (RR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77–0.95), and ischemic stroke by 10% (RR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82–0.99), but was associated with a 46% relative risk increase of major bleeding events (RR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.30–1.64) compared with controls. Aspirin use did not translate into a net clinical benefit adjusted for event-associated mortality risk (mean 0.034%; 95% CI, − 0.18 to 0.25%). There was an interaction for aspirin effect in three patient subgroups: (i) in patients under statin treatment, aspirin was associated with a 12% RRR of MACE (RR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96), and this effect was lacking in the no-statin group; (ii) in non-smokers, aspirin was associated with a 10% RRR of MACE (RR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82–0.99), and this effect was not present in smokers; and (iii) in males, aspirin use resulted in a 11% RRR of MACE (RR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83–0.95), with a non-significant effect in females.

Conclusions

Aspirin use does not reduce all-cause or cardiovascular mortality and results in an insufficient benefit-risk ratio for CVD primary prevention. Non-smokers, patients treated with statins, and males had the greatest risk reduction of MACE across subgroups.

### Aspirin in primary prevention: what changed? A critical appraisal of current evidence [^114Ux9Q7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspirin has been the mainstay of both secondary and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease for half a century. In 2018, 3 trials showed a modest reduction in cardiovascular outcomes that appeared counterbalanced by the risk of clinically significant bleeding. The latest ACC/AHA primary prevention guidelines downgraded their recommendation for aspirin use in primary prevention to that of physician preference. Despite the consistent and robust evidence previously supporting the use of aspirin in cardiovascular disease prevention, little discussion has been given to mechanisms or analytic explanations for this revision of recommendations. In this review, we explore 3 possible mechanisms that may have contributed to the alteration of our perception of aspirin's role in primary prevention. These include changes in the population potentially using aspirin in primary prevention, changes in cardiovascular disease and its presentation, and changes in aspirin itself. Here we present a translational look at knowledge gaps that should be addressed to better guide contemporary aspirin use in primary prevention. In conclusion, based on these considerations, the current recommendations might be improved by recalibration of the cardiovascular risk threshold above which aspirin should be recommended for primary prevention, including the incorporation of newer risk assessment modalities such as calcium scoring. A second enhancement would be developing a bleeding risk calculator to support clinicians' assessment of risk vs benefit. The use of enteric-coated aspirin vs noncoated aspirin should also be reassessed.

### Effects of changing guidelines on prescribing aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events [^114y3uBw]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increasingly being questioned. Aspirin may not benefit this population and may increase the risk of major bleeding events. Data support aspirin use in patients with known CVD.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of de-identified electronic health record (EHR) data from 131,050 individuals with known CVD or elevated risk for CVD as determined by diagnostic, demographic, and clinical data collected from 33 primary care practices in 11 different clinical organizations across 6 states. The percentage of the population of each cohort with aspirin recorded on their medication list, created through risk base analysis, was observed across 4 time periods.

Results

From 2007 to 2011, aspirin usage reflected in the EHR increased for the entire population and for each individual high-risk diagnosis. The percentage of the population initiating aspirin therapy for primary prevention within a year of diagnosis of CVD risk factors or CVD "equivalency" increased between 2007 and 2011. Among those with a new diagnosis of CVD, aspirin usage also steadily increased over the 4-year period, indicating no negative impact from new negative primary prevention studies.

Conclusions

Primary care clinicians have a central role in providing evidence-based preventive services and should integrate revised information into their practice to improve outcomes. Even with new evidence against the use of aspirin for primary prevention, it is difficult to change beliefs about the effectiveness and safety of aspirin, as reflected in the behavior of physicians and patients.

### The rise and fall of aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^112E294o]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Aspirin is one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide and is generally considered effective for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. By contrast, the role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is controversial. Early trials evaluating aspirin for primary prevention, done before the turn of the millennium, suggested reductions in myocardial infarction and stroke (although not mortality), and an increased risk of bleeding. In an effort to balance the risks and benefits of aspirin, international guidelines on primary prevention of cardiovascular disease have typically recommended aspirin only when a substantial 10-year risk of cardiovascular events exists. However, in 2018, three large randomised clinical trials of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease showed little or no benefit and have even suggested net harm. In this narrative Review, we reappraise the role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, contextualising data from historical and contemporary trials.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113yLz9H]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The apparent numerical difference in relative risk reductions observed in primary (typically, 10% to 12% reduction) and secondary (typically, 20% to 25% reduction) prevention trials is most likely explained by the much longer duration of the former (6.9 years) than the latter (2.5 years)and time-dependent loss of compliance with trial medication.

Strengths of the evidence for the antithrombotic efficacy of low-dose aspirin are related to the number, sample size, and duration of placebo-controlled RCTs across the whole spectrum of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. Potential limitations are represented by the time frame over which this evidence accumulated, prior to the development of coronary revascularization and other pharmacological preventive strategies (e.g. statins). Such improvements in treatment and prevention would be expected to reduce the baseline risk of serious vascular events and therefore the absolute benefits of aspirin addition. However, revascularization and statin therapy are unlikely to modify the relative risk reduction associated with aspirin use, if its benefits are additive to those of other strategies, as would be expected by their different mechanisms of action.

### Meta-analysis of multiple primary prevention trials of cardiovascular events using aspirin [^114ms1bj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Several meta-analyses have focused on determination of the effectiveness of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) in primary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) events. Despite these data, the role of aspirin in primary prevention continues to be investigated. Nine randomized trials have evaluated the benefits of aspirin for the primary prevention of CV events: the British Doctors' Trial (BMD), the Physicians' Health Study (PHS), the Thrombosis Prevention Trial (TPT), the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study, the Primary Prevention Project (PPP), the Women's Health Study (WHS), the Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis Trial (AAAT), the Prevention of Progression of Arterial Disease and Diabetes (POPADAD) trial, and the Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis With Aspirin for Diabetes (JPAD) trial. The combined sample consists of about 90,000 subjects divided approximately evenly between those taking aspirin and subjects not taking aspirin or taking placebo. A meta-analysis of these 9 trials assessed 6 CV end points: total coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), total CV events, stroke, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality. No covariate adjustment was performed, and appropriate tests for treatment effect, heterogeneity, and study size bias were applied. The meta-analysis suggested superiority of aspirin for total CV events and nonfatal MI, (p < 0.05 for each), with nonsignificant results for decreased risk for stroke, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality. There was no evidence of a statistical bias (p > 0.05). In conclusion, aspirin decreased the risk for CV events and nonfatal MI in this large sample. Thus, primary prevention with aspirin decreased the risk for total CV events and nonfatal MI, but there were no significant differences in the incidences of stroke, CV mortality, all-cause mortality and total coronary heart disease.

### A meta-analysis of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in the context of contemporary preventive strategies [^1167CoXX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases remains controversial, particularly in the context of contemporary aggressive preventive strategies.

Methods

Relevant randomized clinical trials were included, and risk ratios (RRs) were calculated using random-effects models. Additional moderator analyses were performed to compare the pooled treatment effects from recent trials (those reported after the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment Panel were published in 2001; thus, conducted on the background of contemporary preventive strategies) to the results of older trials.

Results

Data from 14 randomized controlled trials involving 164,751 patients were included. Aspirin use decreased myocardial infarction risk by 16% compared with placebo (RR 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–0.94); however, in the moderator analyses, aspirin was not associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction in recent trials, but was in older trials (P-interaction = .02). Overall, aspirin use significantly increased the occurrence of major bleeding (RR 1.49; 95% CI, 1.32–1.69) and hemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01–1.54). In moderator analyses, the risk of major bleeding (P-interaction = .12) or hemorrhagic stroke (P-interaction = .44) with aspirin was not significantly different between the older and new trials. Differences between aspirin and placebo in the risks for all-cause stroke, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality were not found.

Conclusions

In the context of contemporary primary prevention guidelines, the effect of aspirin on myocardial infarction risk was significantly attenuated, whereas its major bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke complications were retained. Therefore, in contemporary practice, routine use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events may have a net harmful effect.
