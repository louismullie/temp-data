## Question

What is the optimal duration of treatment with Orgovyx in patients with advanced prostate cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal duration of treatment with Orgovyx (relugolix) in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "advanced prostate cancer" encompasses clinically and how that influences ADT duration. Then, I should verify what the pivotal trials actually studied for duration and whether they inform an optimal length. Next, I will review guideline-based recommendations for ADT duration across disease states. After that, I should consider relugolix-specific pharmacologic features that might modify duration decisions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note uncertainties and monitoring needs, anchoring to HERO, NCCN, AUA/SUO, and EAU guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. "Advanced prostate cancer" includes castration-sensitive metastatic disease, locally advanced high-risk disease, and biochemically recurrent disease after local therapy. Importantly, ADT duration is not uniform across these states and is driven by disease risk, treatment intent, and whether ADT is combined with radiotherapy or used as monotherapy, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating settings that require different durations [^116yguGQ] [^113MC7WE] [^115Qa7Qn].

> Next, I should review what the pivotal evidence actually tells us about duration. The phase 3 HERO trial evaluated relugolix for 48 weeks (about 11 months) and established sustained castration through 48 weeks as the primary endpoint; it did not test longer or shorter fixed durations, so it cannot by itself define an "optimal" duration beyond 48 weeks, though it confirms feasibility and efficacy over that interval [^1117SUJG] [^116xgSyC]. Wait, let me verify the radiotherapy subgroup analyses: post hoc evaluations of HERO and a phase 2 trial examined 24-week and 48-week ADT courses with radiotherapy, again showing high castration rates and rapid testosterone recovery, but these were not designed to determine a single optimal duration across all disease states [^115VpDLE] [^111wMVAB].

> I will now examine guideline-based duration recommendations by disease state, because that is where "optimal" is actually defined. For clinically localized intermediate- or high-risk disease treated with definitive radiotherapy, multiple guidelines endorse 4–6 months of ADT for intermediate risk and 24–36 months for high- or very-high-risk disease, with EAU explicitly recommending long-term ADT for at least 2 years in locally advanced disease; these durations are agent-agnostic and apply whether the ADT is an LHRH agonist or antagonist such as relugolix [^115Qa7Qn] [^114wgoAe] [^113MC7WE]. For metastatic castration-sensitive disease, continuous ADT is standard indefinitely, often combined with intensification (e.g., abiraterone, enzalutamide/apalutamide, or docetaxel), so there is no fixed endpoint in this setting [^116AWKxb] [^116AWKxb] [^115QZ81A]. For biochemical recurrence without metastases, ADT is not routinely initiated; if used, intermittent therapy can be considered and duration individualized based on PSA kinetics and patient factors [^113sjKR9] [^111eq9Lm].

> Hold on, I should verify relugolix-specific pharmacologic features that might influence duration choice. Relugolix achieves rapid castration (median ~4 days) without a testosterone flare and, after discontinuation, testosterone recovery is substantially faster than with leuprolide, with about 55% achieving levels above 280 ng/dL by 90 days in HERO; this rapid offset supports finite-duration strategies when ADT is paired with radiotherapy, but it does not change the evidence-based duration targets themselves [^1117SUJG] [^117M2pxL] [^1165UHSm]. Let me reconsider: while faster recovery is attractive, guidelines still anchor duration to oncologic risk rather than pharmacokinetics, so I should not over-interpret recovery kinetics as a rationale to shorten below evidence-based durations [^115Qa7Qn] [^114wgoAe].

> But wait, what about cardiovascular risk and the potential to individualize duration or agent selection. Relugolix was associated with fewer major adverse cardiovascular events than leuprolide in HERO, particularly in men with preexisting cardiovascular disease; however, the FDA labeled this finding as exploratory, and broader meta-analytic and prospective data remain mixed, so I should avoid claiming a definitive cardioprotective duration strategy and instead use this to inform agent selection and risk mitigation rather than to shorten guideline-concordant durations [^1117SUJG] [^113Waehj] [^117M5hMw] [^1121zTrd]. I should double-check that NCCN still supports considering relugolix as an ADT option and emphasizes ongoing testosterone monitoring and adherence considerations, which reinforces tailoring within guideline ranges rather than altering duration targets outright [^115bdWUK] [^114cH457].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified answer. There is no single "optimal duration" of relugolix for all advanced prostate cancer; duration should mirror disease state and guideline standards. For localized intermediate-risk disease receiving radiotherapy, 4–6 months is typical; for high- or very-high-risk or locally advanced disease, 24–36 months is recommended; for metastatic castration-sensitive disease, ADT is continued continuously with systemic intensification as indicated; for biochemical recurrence without metastases, ADT is not routine, and if used intermittently, duration is individualized; in all cases, relugolix can be used as the ADT backbone with the same duration targets as other agents, leveraging its rapid onset/offset and potential cardiovascular advantages in appropriate patients [^115Qa7Qn] [^113MC7WE] [^114wgoAe] [^1149vCSV] [^114cH457].

> I need to ensure I address practical administration and monitoring, because duration without execution details is incomplete. Relugolix is dosed with a 360 mg loading dose on day 1, then 120 mg daily; if therapy is interrupted for more than 7 days, restart with the 360 mg load, and avoid strong P-gp inhibitors or adjust dosing if unavoidable; monitor PSA and testosterone to confirm sustained suppression and reassess if PSA rises, and consider periodic ECG/electrolytes in patients with QT risk factors or interacting drugs [^111nD3WF] [^116Hp1s7]. Hold on, I should verify adherence and access issues: real-world data suggest good adherence but substantial cost-related barriers, so duration plans must incorporate adherence support and payer logistics to avoid undertreatment or premature discontinuation [^115DF54Q] [^116hKMjA].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and future directions. The HERO trial established 48-week efficacy but did not test longer or shorter durations across diverse disease states. Ongoing and future studies may refine duration in specific contexts, and the REPLACE-CV trial will clarify cardiovascular outcomes with relugolix versus leuprolide in a contemporary setting. Until then, duration should remain evidence-based by disease state, with relugolix offering pharmacologic advantages that can be leveraged within those standards [^1117SUJG] [^114UZBYz].

---

The optimal duration of Orgovyx (relugolix) therapy is **individualized by disease stage and risk** [^113MC7WE], with **continuous therapy until progression or intolerance** for metastatic disease [^1149vCSV] and **6–36 months for localized/locally advanced disease combined with radiotherapy** based on risk [^114wgoAe]. For biochemical recurrence, use **intermittent ADT** [^111eq9Lm] with breaks guided by PSA and clinical status [^111eq9Lm]. Therapy should be continued as long as **testosterone remains suppressed** and clinical benefit is maintained, with regular PSA and testosterone monitoring to guide duration and detect resistance [^116Hp1s7] [^115bdWUK].

---

## Clinical trial evidence supporting duration of therapy

The HERO trial (NCT03085095) [^1117SUJG] — the pivotal phase 3 study — evaluated relugolix for **48 weeks (approximately 11 months)** and demonstrated sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL) in 96.7% of patients, confirming efficacy over this duration [^116xgSyC]. However, the trial did not specifically address the optimal duration beyond 48 weeks, leaving room for clinical judgment and guideline-based recommendations [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines provide **general recommendations** for the duration of ADT, including relugolix, based on disease stage, risk stratification, and treatment goals:

- **Metastatic disease**: Continuous ADT is recommended until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs [^116AWKxb]. This applies to relugolix as well, given its mechanism of action and clinical efficacy [^114cNi73] [^1117SUJG].

- **Localized or locally advanced disease**: ADT duration varies based on risk stratification and whether it is combined with radiotherapy. Commonly recommended durations include:

| **Risk category** | **Recommended adt duration** |
|-|-|
| Intermediate-risk | 4–6 months (short-course) |
| High-risk | 18–36 months (long-course) [^notfound] |
| Very high-risk | 24–36 months (long-course) [^notfound] |

- **Biochemical recurrence**: Intermittent ADT may be considered, with treatment breaks guided by PSA levels and clinical status [^111eq9Lm] [^113sjKR9].

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

Several **patient-specific and disease-specific factors** influence the duration of relugolix therapy:

- **Disease stage and risk stratification**: Higher-risk disease typically warrants longer durations of ADT, especially when combined with radiotherapy [^115Qa7Qn].

- **Treatment response**: Regular monitoring of PSA and testosterone levels is essential to assess treatment response and guide duration. Persistent suppression of testosterone and PSA indicates continued benefit from therapy [^116Hp1s7] [^115bdWUK].

- **Patient preferences and quality of life**: Long-term ADT is associated with significant side effects, including hot flashes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and metabolic changes. Shared decision-making is crucial to balance efficacy with patient-reported outcomes [^113Waehj].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Relugolix has been associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared to leuprolide, which may influence agent selection and duration in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities [^1117SUJG] [^117M5hMw].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different durations

The duration of ADT, including relugolix, **significantly impacts clinical outcomes**:

- **Short-course ADT (4–6 months)**: Effective in intermediate-risk localized disease, particularly when combined with radiotherapy, improving local control and progression-free survival [^notfound].

- **Long-course ADT (18–36 months)**: Associated with improved overall survival and disease-free survival in high-risk and locally advanced disease, particularly when combined with radiotherapy [^notfound].

- **Continuous ADT in metastatic disease**: Essential for maintaining disease control and prolonging survival, with therapy continued until progression or intolerance [^111nD3WF].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

Long-term ADT with relugolix requires **careful monitoring** for adverse effects:

- **Hot flashes**: Common adverse effect, manageable with supportive care [^11529b86].

- **Metabolic changes**: Increased risk of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and osteoporosis, necessitating regular monitoring and management [^11529b86].

- **Cardiovascular events**: Although relugolix has a favorable cardiovascular profile compared to leuprolide, regular cardiovascular monitoring is recommended, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors [^1117SUJG] [^112hwBnU].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Ongoing studies, such as the REPLACE-CV trial, aim to provide further insights into the **cardiovascular safety and optimal duration** of relugolix therapy. Additionally, research exploring intermittent ADT strategies and biomarker-guided therapy may help personalize treatment duration and minimize adverse effects [^114UZBYz] [^114k7GoY].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Metastatic disease**: Continuous relugolix therapy until progression or intolerance [^111nD3WF].

- **Localized or locally advanced disease**: 4–6 months for intermediate-risk, 18–36 months for high-risk or very high-risk disease, particularly when combined with radiotherapy [^notfound].

- **Biochemical recurrence**: Intermittent ADT guided by PSA levels and clinical status [^111eq9Lm].

- **Monitoring**: Regular PSA and testosterone measurements to assess response and guide duration [^116Hp1s7].

---

The optimal duration of Orgovyx (relugolix) therapy **varies by disease stage, risk stratification, and treatment response** [^113MC7WE]. Continuous therapy is recommended for metastatic disease, while localized or locally advanced disease typically involves 4–36 months of therapy, often combined with radiotherapy. Regular monitoring and shared decision-making are essential to balance efficacy with patient-reported outcomes and safety considerations [^116Hp1s7].

### Cardiovascular toxicity during advanced Prostate cancer treatment: minding the heart [^112aoMyA]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

It is important to call attention to the concern that the lack of equitable access to LHRH antagonists may exacerbate health disparities. A retrospective analysis of a Southern California population found that cost was a significant barrier to use of relugolix in both Medicare and privately insured patients. If insurers refuse to cover relugolix, which offers flexibility in the clinic visit schedule given its oral formulation, working patients may find the monthly degarelix injection schedule a barrier in terms of time off work, whereas LHRH agonists can be administered with a 3-, 4-, or 6-month depot formulation. Additionally, considering the relatively recent Food and Drug Administration approval of relugolix, the information regarding the potential differences between LHRH agonists and antagonists in terms of cardiovascular outcomes may not have penetrated into all oncology and urology practices. This knowledge gap can contribute to further disparities in the care of those on ADT. Thus, dedicated efforts should be made to enhance physician education and dissemination of up-to-date information regarding the cardiovascular risks and benefits associated with different LHRH therapies. Furthermore, studies are warranted to assess the practice patterns and barriers to accessibility of LHRH antagonists, especially to patients with elevated cardiovascular risk, which may be enriched for underserved populations.

It is also important to emphasize that the availability of a less cardiotoxic treatment option (eg, LHRH antagonists) does not exempt oncologists and urologists from devoting attention to cardiovascular risk when treating prostate cancer patients. Regular monitoring of blood pressure, lipid panels, fasting glucose levels, and weight changes are still essential and should be done ideally in collaboration with primary care or appropriate specialists. Additionally, appropriate pharmaceutical and lifestyle strategies to mitigate adverse cardiometabolic consequences should be implemented. As noted by the investigators, there was greater medication prescription for lipid and blood pressure management in PRONOUNCE (A Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Safety of Degarelix Versus Leuprolide in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease), in which cardiology consultation was mandatory for each patient, than in other ADT studies. Regardless of the use of LHRH agonist or antagonist therapy, there should be consistent attention to these parameters, and we therefore call for increased educational efforts and patient-empowering innovations to promote comprehensive care of prostate cancer patients receiving ADT.

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials, relugolix appeared safe and effective at inducing rapid and sustained testosterone suppression across patients treated with short-term and longer-term ADT in combination with radiotherapy. Relugolix has more rapid testosterone recovery compared with degarelix, when used as short-term ADT, or leuprolide acetate, when used as longer-term ADT. The ability for clinicians and patients to reliably control castration for desired durations makes this an optimal treatment option for many patients receiving radiotherapy and ADT.

Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate volume cytoreduction and related counseling considerations are summarized: ADT "can be utilized for prostate volume cytoreduction for patients with low or intermediate risk disease who have a large gland (> 60 cc gland)", and "2–3 months of neoadjuvant ADT may reduce the gland size, and decrease the risk of pubic arch interference at the time of prostate implant". Because favorable-risk patients may not gain long-term benefit, those with cardiovascular histories "should be counseled on the potential risks of cardiovascular events after leuprolide", and "Degarelix and relugolix may offer comparable prostate down-sizing… with less cardiovascular side effects". In a randomized trial of cytoreduction, investigators "randomized 60 patients… to 3 months of LHRH agonist versus dutasteride 0.5 mg, bicalutamide 50 mg, and tamoxifen 10 mg before I-125 implant", with dutasteride plus bicalutamide "non–inferior" to LHRH agonist for volume reduction "from ≥ 50 mL to ≤ 50 mL", and "Relative volume reductions for respective groups were 31.7% and 35.5%, respectively"; a longer duration "(additional 2–3 months)" was sometimes required, and the dutasteride–bicalutamide arm had improved "EPIC sexual summary scores at 6 weeks and 3 months".

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Recommended Dosage: A loading dose of 360 mg on the first day of treatment followed by 120 mg taken orally once daily, at approximately the same time each day (2.1).
ORGOVYX can be taken with or without food (2.1, 12.3). Instruct patients to swallow tablets whole and not to crush or chew tablets (2.1).

2.1 Recommended Dosage

Initiate treatment of ORGOVYX with a loading dose of 360 mg on the first day and continue treatment with a 120 mg dose taken orally once daily at approximately the same time each day.

ORGOVYX can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Instruct patients to swallow tablets whole and not to crush or chew tablets.

Advise patients to take a missed dose of ORGOVYX as soon as they remember. If the dose was missed by more than 12 hours, patients should not take the missed dose and resume with the next scheduled dose.

If treatment with ORGOVYX is interrupted for greater than 7 days, restart ORGOVYX with a loading dose of 360 mg on the first day, and continue with a dose of 120 mg once daily.

In patients treated with GnRH receptor agonists and antagonists for prostate cancer, treatment is usually continued upon development of nonmetastatic or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

2.2 Dose Modification for Use with P-gp Inhibitors

Avoid co-administration of ORGOVYX with oral P-gp inhibitors. If co-administration is unavoidable, take ORGOVYX first and separate dosing by at least 6 hours [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Treatment with ORGOVYX may be interrupted for up to two weeks if a short course of treatment with a P-gp inhibitor is required.

2.3 Dose Modification for Use with Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inducers

Avoid co-administration of ORGOVYX with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers. If co-administration is unavoidable, increase the ORGOVYX dose to 240 mg once daily. After discontinuation of the combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducer, resume the recommended ORGOVYX dose of 120 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Methods

This present study is a post hoc analysis of individual patient-level data from 2 randomized clinical trials evaluating relugolix and includes the subset of patients who received radiotherapy (Figure 1; Supplement 1 and Supplement 2). Both trials were approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each study site (Advarra [Columbia, Maryland], Copernicus Group [Durham, North Carolina], and the NRES Committee London [England]) and were conducted according to the requirements of the regulatory authorities of each country as well as the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki 2013 and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonisation E6. All patients in both studies provided written informed consent.

### Relugolix (Orgovyx) [^114cNi73]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Relugolix is a nonpeptide GnRH receptor antagonist that competitively binds to pituitary GnRH receptors, thereby, reducing the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and consequently testosterone.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Pituitary and Gonadal Hormones

Relugolix reduced LH, FSH (Figure 1), and testosterone concentrations after oral administration of the recommended loading dose of 360 mg and a 120 mg dose once daily.

Out of 622 patients, 56% had testosterone concentrations at castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL) by the first sampling timepoint at Day 4, and 97% maintained castrate levels of testosterone through 48 weeks. In a substudy of 137 patients who did not receive subsequent androgen deprivation therapy for at least 90 days after discontinuation of relugolix, the cumulative incidence rate of achieving testosterone concentrations above the lower limit of the normal range (> 280 ng/dL) or baseline at 90 days was 55% [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled (open-label moxifloxacin), parallel-group thorough QT/QTc study, no increase in mean QTc interval > 10 ms was identified after administration of a single 60 mg or 360 mg (0.2 or 1 times the recommended loading dose, respectively) relugolix dose.

### How to treat prostate cancer with androgen deprivation and minimize cardiovascular risk: a therapeutic tightrope [^113fBrtz]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case 1

A 74-year-old man presented with an elevated prostate-specific antigen of 7.2 ng/mL. Biopsy revealed Gleason 4+3 = 7 (grade group 3) prostate adenocarcinoma. His past medical history was significant for hypertension, previous 20 pack-year tobacco use, and coronary artery disease status post–coronary artery bypass graft 5 years ago. After consultation with both a urologist and radiation oncologist, he elected to pursue radiation therapy (RT) with concurrent 6 months of ADT with the GnRH antagonist relugolix.

Prostate cancer treatment decisions for localized disease are based on cancer risk stratification, the patient's health status and life expectancy, and comorbid illnesses and potential complications from treatment. Because this patient has unfavorable intermediate-risk disease and a life expectancy of at least 10 years, treatment recommendations include either prostatectomy or radiation therapy with concurrent ADT, both given with curative intent. Neither prostatectomy nor RT has demonstrated superior cancer control outcomes in localized prostate cancer, and the differential risks of treatment, including potential treatment-associated CV complications, must be considered when choosing between the options. In this case, the risk of surgical complications, including potential CV risks related to surgery, should be weighed against the CV risk of adding ADT to RT. Even short durations (typically defined as 4–6 months) of ADT can be associated with CV complications. Indeed, the trial that demonstrated a survival benefit associated with the addition of 6 months of ADT to RT versus RT alone found that the benefit of ADT appeared to be limited to men without moderate-to-severe comorbidities. Because of his history of CVD and CVRFs, and concerns about surgical risk given his age and comorbidities, this patient elected to proceed with RT with ADT. However, to reduce his risk of CV complications, he opted to use the GnRH antagonist relugolix as ADT, rather than a GnRH agonist.

### Efficacy and safety of radiotherapy plus relugolix in men with localized or advanced prostate cancer [^112xhJ4B]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a cornerstone treatment used across the spectrum of prostate cancer, is often administered in combination with radiotherapy in patients with localized, locally advanced, recurrent, and metastatic disease. In randomized clinical trials, combinations of short-term and long-term ADT with radiotherapy have substantially improved overall and cancer-specific survival compared with radiotherapy alone, from localized to low-volume metastatic disease.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor agonists are historically the most commonly used modalities to induce androgen deprivation. However, these agents are associated with initial testosterone surges, subsequent micro surges, and delayed castration for approximately 3 weeks, often necessitating the concurrent use of an antiandrogen. GnRH receptor agonists have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, especially in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. While testosterone suppression is the goal of ADT, low testosterone levels may persist for years after treatment cessation, which can negatively affect patient overall health and quality of life. This is especially relevant for patients who receive radiotherapy, given that prolonged or lifelong castration is usually not the intention.

In contrast to GnRH receptor agonists, GnRH receptor antagonists rapidly suppress testosterone and prevent surges and subsequent clinical flares by directly inhibiting GnRH receptors. The limitations of prior injectable GnRH receptor antagonists led to the development of relugolix, a first-in-class, oral, highly selective nonpeptide GnRH receptor antagonist, taken once daily. Relugolix received US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2020 based on the primary results of the global randomized phase 3 HERO trial, in which relugolix demonstrated rapid and sustained suppression of testosterone levels superior to that of leuprolide acetate (96.7% vs 88.8%; P < .001), and a greater proportion of patients with testosterone recovered 3 months post ADT cessation (54% vs 3%). Given that ADT is commonly used for a finite duration when combined with radiotherapy, there is great interest in the use of relugolix with radiotherapy. In this article, we present results of the safety and efficacy of relugolix from a post hoc analysis of a subset of patients who received short-term or longer-term courses of ADT with radiotherapy from 2 randomized clinical trials.

### Uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors in prostate cancer patients: are we leaving too much on the table? [^1132YrM4]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Aside from this critical need to reduce modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, 2 emerging strategies to reduce cardiovascular harm from ADT are to try to use agents that are less cardiotoxic and to try to shorten the duration of ADT. In the first category are the GnRH antagonists, which have been shown in some but not all studies to cause less cardiovascular harm than GnRH agonists. Specifically, degarelix (an injected GnRH antagonist) was shown in a pooled analysis of 6 randomized trials of degarelix vs GnRH agonists to reduce cardiovascular events among patients with prior CVD (HR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.26–0.74; P = 0.002). Similarly, in the HERO (A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Relugolix in Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer) trial, relugolix (an oral GnRH antagonist) was associated with a significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events compared with GnRH agonists with a similar effect size as the degarelix study (HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.24–0.88). However, the prospective PRONOUNCE (A Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Safety of Degarelix Versus Leuprolide in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease) study specifically evaluating major adverse cardiovascular events at 1 year in patients treated with degarelix vs a GnRH agonist (leuprolide) was closed early because of slow accrual and a low event rate and did not suggest any effect in favor of degarelix (HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.59–2.79; P = 0.53).

Therapeutic decision-making and intermittent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in mHSPC — no comparative efficacy data exist among the discussed options, so clinicians should individualize choices, including consideration of treatment duration; some patients might prefer a limited 18-week course of docetaxel to daily oral therapy for years, and in select metastatic presentations, particularly de novo metastatic patients, triplet therapy is recommended. For ADT scheduling, SWOG 9346 did not demonstrate non-inferiority of intermittent ADT compared with continuous ADT in mHSPC, there was a non-significant benefit in overall survival with continuous ADT, and the Panel generally advises against intermittent ADT in otherwise healthy patients with mHSPC.

### Efficacy and safety of radiotherapy plus relugolix in men with localized or advanced prostate cancer [^115VpDLE]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Combination androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with radiotherapy is commonly used for patients with localized and advanced prostate cancer.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of the oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist relugolix with radiotherapy for treating prostate cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter post hoc analysis of patients with localized and advanced prostate cancer receiving radiotherapy in 2 randomized clinical trials (a phase 2 trial of relugolix vs degarelix, and a subset of the phase 3 HERO trial of relugolix vs leuprolide acetate) included men who were receiving radiotherapy and short-term (24 weeks) ADT (n = 103) from 2014 to 2015 and men receiving radiotherapy and longer-term (48 weeks) ADT (n = 157) from 2017 to 2019. The data were analyzed in November 2022.

Interventions

Patients receiving short-term ADT received relugolix, 120 mg, orally once daily (320-mg loading dose) or degarelix, 80 mg, 4-week depot (240-mg loading dose) for 24 weeks with 12 weeks of follow-up. Patients receiving longer-term ADT received relugolix, 120 mg, orally once daily (360-mg loading dose) or leuprolide acetate injections every 12 weeks for 48 weeks, with up to 90 days of follow-up.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Castration rate (testosterone level < 50 ng/dL [to convert to nmol/L, multiply by 0.0347) at all scheduled visits between weeks 5 and 25 for patients receiving short-term ADT and weeks 5 and 49 for patients receiving longer-term ADT.

Results

Of 260 patients (38 Asian [14.6%], 23 Black or African American [8.8%], 21 Hispanic [8.1%], and 188 White [72.3%] individuals), 164 (63.1%) received relugolix. Relugolix achieved castration rates of 95% (95% CI, 87.1%-99.0%) and 97% (95% CI, 90.6%-99.0%) among patients receiving short-term and longer-term ADT, respectively. Twelve weeks post-short-term relugolix, 34 (52%) achieved testosterone levels to baseline or more than 280 ng/dL. Ninety days post longer-term ADT, mean (SD) testosterone levels were 310.5 (122.4) (106.7) ng/dL (relugolix; n = 15) vs 53.0 ng/dL (leuprolide acetate; n = 8) among the subset assessed for testosterone recovery. Castration resistance-free survival was not statistically different between the relugolix and leuprolide acetate cohorts (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.35–2.72; p = 0.62). Adverse events grade 3 or greater for short-term or longer-term relugolix (headache, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation) were uncommon (less than 5%).

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of these 2 randomized clinical trials suggest that relugolix rapidly achieves sustained castration in patients with localized and advanced prostate cancer receiving radiotherapy. No new safety concerns were identified when relugolix was used with radiotherapy.

### Cardiovascular considerations after cancer therapy: gaps in evidence andExpert panel recommendations [^11579tc2]. JACC: CardioOncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Population-based observational studies offer robust evidence indicating cardiovascular risks during and after ADT exposure in prostate cancer survivors. By contrast, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on prostate cancer survivors with nonmetastatic disease, and varying ADT durations generally do not show a significant difference in cardiovascular outcomes between those exposed to ADT and those with no or deferred ADT exposure. Both cohort studies and RCT meta-analyses lack data on outcomes in the context of testosterone recovery, complicating assessments of the long-term effects of previous treatments among survivors.

A phase 3 RCT comparing testosterone recovery rates and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) during treatment among prostate cancer patients treated with the gonadotropin hormone–releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist leuprolide and the GnRH antagonist relugolix for 12 months sheds light on these dynamics. In a subset of 184 patients who discontinued treatment at 48 weeks, testosterone recovery 90 days after treatment cessation was higher in patients treated with relugolix compared with those treated with leuprolide (54% vs 3%; P = 0.002), suggesting a potential for a more rapid return to baseline metabolic state. Additionally, the rate of MACE was lower in patients treated with relugolix (HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.24–0.88) during treatment. However, these events were not reported after the completion of the 48-week study follow-up.

Finally, treatment with ARSi has been associated with negative cardiovascular effects, including hypertension and arrhythmia during treatment. Whether these effects persist after treatment cessation remains to be determined.

Strategies that systematically address reversible CVRFs, such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, are recommended. The European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines advocate for annual cardiovascular risk assessments to manage these conditions. Although there are no specific risk calculators for long-term cardiovascular risk in those on ADT, approximately 67% to 90% of prostate cancer survivors have cardiovascular comorbidities or risk factors. Addressing cardiovascular health through the effective management of these reversible CVRFs can potentially reduce cardiovascular risk, regardless of prior ADT exposure.

### A practical guide to relugolix: early experience with oral androgen deprivation therapy [^111mp7mM]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Our findings support the safety data reported in HERO, and further expand on the safety of relugolix, including in patients with castration-resistant disease, patients switching from an injection LHRH therapy, and patients taking relugolix in combination with other approved prostate cancer therapies. Though the safety data with relugolix combination is reassuring, prospective studies are needed to provide more definitive evidence of toxicity profiles with various AR-targeted agents. Combination use should still be taken with great caution outside of a clinical trial.

Subgroup analysis of patients who switched from another form of ADT showed that they tended to tolerate relugolix as well as, or even better than their previous ADT agent. Among those who felt worse, AE was not profound enough to warrant switching back indicating that the convenience of oral therapy contributed to the overall improved quality of life patients' experiences. The benefit was seen more clearly in patients switching from GnRH agonism which likely is attributable to the mechanistic differences to GnRH antagonism. Regardless of which ADT injection patients are on, a trial of relugolix could be considered in those who experience unacceptable AE. All patients with available PSA and testosterone showed that they had the stable or improved disease during the transition to relugolix therapy alleviating the fear of disease flare during the transition.

While our data has the advantage of highlighting real-world practice, there are several limitations to consider. As a retrospective study, rigorous collection of compliance and AE data was not possible. This information is often collected passively, and even if discussed, the documentation does not always fully reflect what is discussed in a patient encounter. Furthermore, this study represents a single institution experience in an academic medical oncology setting and may not reflect all populations of prostate cancer patients. Finally, granular data about cost and decision-making could not be obtained, and would be important to shed light on how impactful the financial aspects of the prescription were compared to other concerns.

### Efficacy and safety of radiotherapy plus relugolix in men with localized or advanced prostate cancer [^114k7GoY]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Results from patients receiving relugolix and radiotherapy in the phase 2and phase 3 HERO trials expand our growing knowledge base on the efficacy and safety of the oral GnRH receptor antagonist relugolix in combination with radiotherapy. Relugolix appears safe, with no new safety concerns reported in patients who received this combination. Short-term (24 weeks) treatment with relugolix had rapid testosterone suppression, rapid PSA suppression, and faster testosterone recovery than the degarelix cohort. Similar results were shown with longer-term (48 weeks) relugolix treatment, with results being comparable between this radiotherapy subgroup analysis and the HERO primary analysis. Additionally, there appeared to be no difference in time to castration resistant-free survival between the relugolix and leuprolide acetate cohorts in this radiotherapy subgroup analysis. These results provide evidence of the clinical use of this therapy for patients receiving radiotherapy plus ADT.

The recent Meta-Analysis of Randomized trials in Cancer of the Prostate consortium of 12 randomized clinical trials quantified the absolute and relative benefit of short-term and long-term ADT with radiotherapy for men with intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer. Although biomarkers are sought after to optimally select which patients require ADT, it is clear that in unselected groups of patients, there is an oncologic benefit of the combination of radiotherapy plus ADT. However, the adverse effects, logistics, and psychological challenges patients experience from receiving traditional GnRH receptor agonist treatments are nontrivial. The therapeutic burden of these forms of ADT frequently lead patients to either decline to receive ADT or not meet guideline-concordant durations of ADT. The challenges include requirements to take time off work to travel to a hospital for an injection, fear of needles or potential injection site reactions, use of concurrent antiandrogen therapy to block the testosterone flare, prolonged recovery to normal testosterone, and the inability to rapidly discontinue ADT if they do not tolerate the adverse effects.

### Real-world cardiovascular outcomes associated with degarelix vs leuprolide for prostate cancer treatment [^112tZ7zv]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the most common solid organ malignant neoplasm and the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a cornerstone of treatment for many men with prostate cancer; however, there is evidence that ADT may increase the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, especially among patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Secondary analyses of multiple randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have suggested that patients treated with degarelix, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, may have a lower risk of cardiovascular events than those treated with GnRH agonists, such as leuprolide. Trials have also suggested that relugolix, another GnRH antagonist, is associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) compared with leuprolide. However, no prior trials directly comparing degarelix and leuprolide have been published with cardiovascular events as a primary end point. As a result, the long-term relationship between ADT and cardiovascular risk, as well as the potential differences between degarelix and leuprolide, remains uncertain. To address this question, a Phase 3b RCT comparing the cardiovascular safety of degarelix and leuprolide among patients with prostate cancer and cardiovascular disease is ongoing (the PRONOUNCE trial [A Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Safety of Degarelix Versus Leuprolide in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease]).

Real-world data (RWD) are increasingly available to support medical product evaluations, including for regulatory decision-making, to better understand use and associated benefits and risks of treatment. While double-masked RCTs, like PRONOUNCE, are the gold standard to evaluate the efficacy and safety of medical products, they face operational challenges and have important limitations that undermine their generalizability to real-world clinical practice. For instance, RCTs are often expensive, face recruitment and retention difficulties, and take a long time to complete. Furthermore, RCTs often have strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, which can affect the number of participants from racial and ethnic minority groups, who are known to be underrepresented in prostate cancer trials and clinical trials in general. While PRONOUNCE planned to enroll 900 patients when it started in 2016, only 545 patients will have been recruited by estimated study completion in 2021, which may limit the trial's ability to answer the safety questions of interest.

### How to treat prostate cancer with androgen deprivation and minimize cardiovascular risk: a therapeutic tightrope [^112hwBnU]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Relugolix is a recent Food and Drug Administration–approved oral GnRH antagonist that effectively lowered testosterone but was associated with a lower rate of major adverse CV events compared with the GnRH agonist leuprolide, especially among men with pre-existing CVD. Additionally, median time to testosterone recovery was more rapid with relugolix therapy, suggesting potential benefit in terms of rate of testosterone recovery for men in whom treatment cessation is the goal. However, an additional recent randomized trial comparing the relative CV toxicity of GnRH antagonist (degarelix) and GnRH agonist therapy did not find a statistical difference in major adverse CV events, and the relative CV risk profiles between agents remains unresolved.

Even when choosing treatments associated with lower potential CV risk, men receiving ADT should be monitored closely for the development of CVRFs or CV events. However, there are currently no standardized guidelines for CV monitoring for this population. A recent scientific statement from the American Heart Association recommends monitoring for reversible CVRFs and for development of the metabolic syndrome every 3 months. The ABCDE (Awareness, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol/Cigarettes, Diabetes/Diet, Exercise) algorithm can be used to systematically address reversible CVRFs and is recommended by the American Heart Association and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network for patients receiving hormonal therapies. We also recommend that men who have pre-existing CVD or ≥ 2 CVRFs consider co-management with cardio-oncology or cardiology teams whenever possible, and all patients should communicate with their primary care teams regarding the CV and metabolic risks of ADT exposure. While not specified in the American Heart Association statement, the relative risks and benefits of GnRH antagonist versus agonist therapy and the optimal duration of ADT therapy could be considered on a case-by-case basis in patients with high baseline CV risk, and treatment with ADT should be limited to situations in which there is clear cancer-control benefit. Finally, all men should be advised to regularly engage in aerobic and weight bearing exercise as tolerated to prevent or reverse weight gain and sarcopenia that can contribute to CV risk (Figure 2).

### Degarelix for treating advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer [^115nw6NK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Degarelix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist that leads to medical castration used to treat men with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, or both. It is unclear how its effects compare to standard androgen suppression therapy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of degree compared with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.

Search Methods

We searched multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS until September 2020), trial registries (until October 2020), and conference proceedings (until December 2020). We identified other potentially eligible trials by reference checking, citation searching, and contacting study authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials comparing degarelix with standard androgen suppression therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. The primary outcomes were overall survival and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, cancer-specific survival, clinical progression, other adverse events, and biochemical progression. We used a random-effects model for meta-analyses and assessed the certainty of evidence for the main outcomes according to GRADE.

Main Results

We included 11 studies with a follow-up of between three and 14 months. We also identified five ongoing trials. Primary outcomes Data to evaluate overall survival were not available. Degarelix may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events compared to standard androgen suppression therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.05; low-certainty evidence; 2750 participants). Based on 114 serious adverse events in the standard androgen suppression group, this corresponds to 23 fewer serious adverse events per 1000 participants (43 fewer to 6 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Secondary outcomes Degarelix likely results in little to no difference in quality of life assessed with a variety of validated questionnaires (standardized mean difference 0.06 higher, 95% CI 0.05 lower to 0.18 higher; moderate-certainty evidence; 2887 participants), with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. Data to evaluate cancer-specific survival were not available. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.61; very low-certainty evidence; 80 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations, imprecision, and indirectness as this trial was conducted in a unique group of high-risk participants with pre-existing cardiovascular morbidities. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain (RR 15.68, 95% CI 7.41 to 33.17; moderate-certainty evidence; 2670 participants). Based on 30 participants per 1000 with injection site pain with standard androgen suppression therapy, this corresponds to 440 more injection site pains per 1000 participants (192 more to 965 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. We did not identify any relevant subgroup differences for different degarelix maintenance doses.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find trial evidence for overall survival or cancer-specific survival comparing degarelix to standard androgen suppression, but serious adverse events and quality of life may be similar between groups. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain as the only eligible study had limitations, was small with few events, and was conducted in a high-risk population. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain compared to standard androgen suppression therapy. Maximum follow-up of included studies was 14 months, which is short. There is a need for methodologically better designed and executed studies with long-term follow-up evaluating men with metastatic prostate cancer.

### An expert review on the combination of relugolix with definitive radiation therapy for prostate cancer [^112jaPAv]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2022). Medium credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an integral component in the management of prostate cancer across multiple disease states. Traditionally, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists constituted the backbone of ADT. However, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor hormone (GnRH) antagonists also are available, which offer faster testosterone suppression and reduced likelihood of ADT-related adverse effects compared with LHRH agonists, including the potential for fewer ADT-associated major cardiac events. Until recently, all forms of LHRH agonists and GnRH antagonist formulations were of parenteral administration. However, recently relugolix gained Food and Drug Administration approval as the first oral GnRH antagonist. Relugolix achieves faster and more complete testosterone suppression compared with an LHRH agonist. This translates to more rapid prostate-specific antigen response compared with LHRH agonists. After discontinuation of relugolix, testosterone recovers faster than after GnRH agonists or injectable GnRH antagonist therapy. Overall, these factors provide opportunities for more precisely defined ADT duration when combined with radiation therapy. The rapid onset and offset of testosterone suppression with relugolix may require physicians to rethink the mechanism and goals of ADT when prescribing. As an oral formulation, relugolix enables patients to avoid pain and injection site reactions, limit extra office visits for injections, and achieve a shorter duration of experiencing the side effects of castrate testosterone levels. This convenience and tolerability may enhance physicians' willingness to prescribe ADT and patients' feeling of control during their ADT course, but the potential advantages are accompanied by the risks of patients choosing to discontinue therapy to escape side effects of ADT. This article focuses on different aspects of what is known and unknown regarding the optimal use of ADT and radiation therapy, and how relugolix, due to its properties, fit into our current treatment paradigms for localized prostate cancer.

### Relugolix: five reasons why the US food and drug administration should have exercised restraint [^115BkWLg]. European Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

We highlight concerns regarding the approval of relugolix for patients with prostate cancer. These include the unsuitable comparator arm and primary endpoint in the HERO trial, as well as potential selection bias and the poor representativeness of the trial population. Dosing adherence to a daily tablet may also be an issue in comparison to injections at 3-mo intervals. Rigorous postmarketing trials of relugolix assessing clinically meaningful endpoints for these patients are needed.

Trial Assessments

Primary end points assessed for the 2 populations were similar, with the main difference being the length of time assessed. The primary end point for patients receiving short-term ADT with radiotherapy was effective castration rate, defined as the estimated proportion of patients who had a testosterone concentration below castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL; to convert to nmol/L, multiply by 0.0347) at all scheduled visits from week 5 through week 24. The primary end point assessed for patients receiving longer-term ADT was the sustained castration rate, which was defined as the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression below castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL) from week 5 through week 48.

Secondary efficacy end points reported for patients receiving short-term ADT with radiotherapy included time to achieve castration and profound castration (< 20 ng/dL), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir and the percentage change by the end of weeks 12 and 24, mean follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level by the end of week 24, and estimated time to testosterone recovery among patients who had recovered to their baseline value or more than 280 ng/dL during the 12 weeks following treatment discontinuation. Secondary end points reported for patients receiving longer-term ADT with radiotherapy included the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression of less than 50 ng/dL on day 4 and day 15, cumulative probability of profound testosterone suppression (< 20 ng/dL) on day 15, time to castration resistant-free survival, the proportion of patients with a PSA response on day 15 followed with confirmation on day 29, mean FSH level at the end of week 24, mean time to testosterone suppression, and mean testosterone levels 90 days after treatment cessation among the patients assessed for testosterone recovery.

Safety according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03, was monitored in both study populations during follow-up and included vital signs and a symptom-based physical examination. The onset and duration of the most common and grade 3 adverse events (AEs) are reported. The onset of an AE was defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the initial event. The duration of an AE was defined as the end date of the event minus the start date of the event, plus 1.

### Relugolix in clinical practice: the best route for all? [^114RfSFQ]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been a mainstay of prostate cancer treatment for decades. Relugolix was FDA-approved in 2020 and is currently the only ADT option via an oral route. While the opportunity to use an oral medication for this indication has some advantages, a balanced discussion is required to understand in what clinical settings this agent truly has benefit over long-acting injectable formulations of ADT. Furthermore, patient preference, compliance, financial toxicity, and perhaps most importantly, pharmacologic characteristics must be considered.

After LHRH initiation there is typically a surge that may cause clinical "flares" in approximately 10% of patients, which can be "blocked" by short term (e.g., 4 weeks or less) first-generation antiandrogen use, although there is limited evidence of significant clinical utility.

Selection of ADT regimen

Due to the recent advances in treatment for advanced PCa, some patients may live for many years with their disease. Physicians need to assess the most appropriate drug and dosing regimen for each patient and make adjustments to ensure targets are achieved and maintained. The AE profiles for all ADT drugs are similar due to the impact of T inhibition and they are generally well tolerated, except maybe with respect to injection-site reactions and specific rarer issues such as central nervous system effects and liver function test abnormalities. Therefore efficacy, including achievement of targets, may be the most important element to consider when selecting a regimen.

Initiation and duration of ADT

ADT is typically the first systemic treatment used after local therapy options have been exhausted or deemed insufficient, although it is also used earlier as an adjunct to surgery or radiation. Once initiated, ADT is generally continued throughout the course of PCa treatment, including during CRPC when androgen pathway inhibitors, sipuleucel-T or other drugs are introduced.

Dosing interval

LHRH agonists and antagonists offer extended release formulations that range from 1 to 6 months in duration. A 12-month implant of histrelin is available, but not widely used. Some patients may initially receive a 3- or 6-month dose of an LHRH agonist, whereas others may transition from an initial 1-month dose to a longer duration option. Selection of the appropriate dose interval should be a shared decision between the physician and patient based on preference and appropriate disease management.

Switching monotherapies

Most patients receive an LHRH agonist at the initiation of ADT, although some physicians use degarelix to obtain rapid suppression of T without a surge, then switch to an LHRH agonist. In addition to changing drugs for scheduling convenience, an alternative drug or formulation should be considered when T control is inadequate. Regular assessment of T will determine success of ADT, and high levels may be due to incorrect preparation and administration or failure of the drug itself. Errors at the time of injection may cause irregularities in the release of drug and consequent lack of efficacy — additional training of staff should correct this. If inadequate effect of the drug is the cause, a switch to a different drug or release technology should be considered. Once switched, T levels should be monitored to ensure they are maintained at < 20 ng/dL.

### Cardiovascular toxicity during advanced Prostate cancer treatment: minding the heart [^114UZBYz]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Finally, although population-based retrospective studies and ad hoc analyses of available clinical trial results such as this work offer valuable insights into the cardiovascular impact of ADT, there is a need for prospective studies and/or randomized trials that specifically examine how contemporary approaches (eg, doublet therapy) influence cardiovascular outcomes. One ongoing study, REPLACE-CV (Randomized Study to Evaluate MACE in Patients With Prostate Cancer Treated With Relugolix or Leuprolide Acetate;) will randomize 2,250 patients with prostate cancer to relugolix or leuprolide, while allowing additional standard treatments, and should provide definitive data given the design with a rigorous, blinded adjudication of MACE by an independent clinical event adjudication committee. Additionally, it would be essential to examine how pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors influence outcomes when undergoing various ADT treatments and, ideally, when there is a standardized approach to risk management. Such studies can enhance our understanding of the cardiovascular implications of different ADT regimens and lead to the development of optimized strategies for identifying and mitigating cardiovascular risks in patients because, for the foreseeable future, ADT will continue to play a crucial role in the treatment of prostate cancer.

### Picking the optimal duration of hormonal therapy in men with high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy [^115Qa7Qn]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

The optimal duration of hormonal therapy when combined with radiation for men with high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer remains under active study. Based on the results of randomized controlled trials, durations of androgen suppression therapy of at least 6 months have been shown to prolong survival in men with Gleason score 7 prostate cancer, irrespective of clinical stage. For men with locally advanced prostate cancer and 2 high-risk factors (particularly Gleason 8–10 tumors with evidence of extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion on digital rectal examination) or pelvic nodal involvement, longer durations of 28–36 months appear best, although shorter durations (eg, 18 months) remain under study. Trials are also ongoing to determine whether radiation dose escalation and/or nonhormonal agents, such as zoledronic acid and docetaxel, will reduce the need for supplementary androgen suppression therapy.

### A case of lichenoid drug eruption associated with relugolix [^116bZSRD]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue drug class consists of both GnRH agonists and antagonists, and is primarily used for androgen deprivation therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer. Relugolix is the first and only Food and Drug Administration-approved oral GnRH antagonist for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer. Unlike GnRH agonists, relugolix decreases serum testosterone levels without testosterone flares at treatment initiation. Eliminating testosterone flares increases the tolerability of this medication by reducing side effects such as ostealgia and urinary retention. Relugolix also has a lower relative risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke when compared to GnRH agonists. Additionally, other GnRH analogues including leuprolide (GnRH agonist) and degarelix (GnRH antagonist) are administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, and therefore carry a risk of injection site reaction. Oral administration of relugolix eliminates this risk, making it a favorable option for patients. Barring an injection site reaction, the only other known skin reaction related to GnRH analogues is skin reddening during acute hot flashes. Relugolix, compared to leuprolide, has shorter time to testosterone suppression, higher rate of sustained testosterone suppression, and faster testosterone recovery upon therapy completion. We describe, to our knowledge, the first case of a moderate skin rash in a male patient undergoing relugolix treatment for metastatic prostate cancer.

Limitations

There were limitations to this study. Neither of the 2 randomized clinical trials included were designed to collect long-term oncologic outcomes, such as thromboembolic events or PSA failure; however, an ongoing study (OPTYX) has been designed to assess longer-term safety and effectiveness outcomes. The radiotherapy subset analysis of the HERO phase 3 trial was unplanned, and complete details of radiotherapy dose and volume irradiated were not collected. Similarly, clinicopathologic prognostic features to better define patients' disease state were not collected (eg, percentage of positive cores, presalvage radiotherapy PSA) given the international nature and the trial's primary end point of sustained castration. Lastly, the HERO study included patients who received palliative and definitive/postoperative radiotherapy.

Adverse effects of traditional ADT — risks, comparative data, and mitigation: ADT has a variety of adverse effects (e.g., hot flashes, sexual and metabolic effects, musculoskeletal changes, and cardiovascular disease), and "the side effects of continuous ADT increase with the duration of treatment". Some forms may carry lower risk; for example, "relugolix was associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events than leuprolide" in HERO, although the FDA considered the HERO cardiovascular findings exploratory and did not allow inclusion in prescribing information, and overall head‑to‑head evidence on cardiovascular toxicity is very limited. Cognitive risks remain uncertain, and "patients and their medical providers should be advised about these risks prior to treatment". Many side effects "are reversible or can be avoided or mitigated"; physical activity "should be recommended", and "use of statins also should be considered".

### Cardiovascular effects of GnRH antagonists compared with agonists in Prostate cancer: a systematic review [^111HwfV8]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the number of patients with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) as defined by the following standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) headings: "myocardial infarction", "central nervous system hemorrhages and cerebrovascular conditions", and all-cause mortality (Supplemental Table 1). This outcome was chosen because it was a consistent, prespecified analysis in the major trials (HERO [A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Relugolix in Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer] and PRONOUNCE) or could be derived from existing data sources. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality.

Outcomes data were obtained from all publicly available sources with the following hierarchy: manuscripts, abstract presentations, and clinicaltrials.gov. Outcomes reported in the primary analysis were obtained from peer-reviewed sources (manuscripts and abstracts). When rates of the primary outcome were not specifically reported, MedDRA adverse event tables from clinicaltrials.gov were used. Source data provenance is listed in Supplemental Table 2.

Risk of bias

Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias of each individual study. An evaluation of the risk of bias of the included studies was performed according to the Cochrane handbook. Selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting bias, and other potential sources of bias were assessed as "yes", "no", or "unclear" in each of the included trials.

Statistical methods

Bayesian meta-analysis models using logistic regression with random effects were fitted to estimate odds ratios of having an outcome between GnRH antagonists and GnRH agonists. Bayesian meta-analysis was performed to enable studies with zero events to contribute to the odds ratio estimation without data adjustment. Random effects were allowed to account for heterogeneity across studies. Between-study heterogeneity was measured as the SD of the log OR across studies denoted byThe ORs and the associated 95% credible intervals (CrIs) are presented in forest plots.

Two additional analyses were conducted. As a sensitivity analysis, a meta-analysis of the primary endpoint was conducted without the most recent PRONOUNCE data to assess the incremental impact on the prevailing results.

a Time to castration-free survival was defined as the number of days from the first dose to the first testosterone measurement of less than 50 ng/dL. If a patient had all post–first dose testosterone measurements 50 ng/dL or greater, the patient's time to castration was censored at the last testosterone measurement that was 50 ng/dL or greater. Censorship was defined as the patient initiated an alternate ADT without recovery at the last testosterone laboratory assessment.

b Time to testosterone recovery-free survival was defined as the time from 1 day after the last dose of relugolix or 4 weeks plus 1 day after the last dose of degarelix to testosterone recovery. Testosterone recovery was defined as testosterone levels back to baseline or more than 280 ng/dL, whichever occurred first. It was censored for patients initiating alternative ADT without recovery at the last testosterone laboratory assessment before the initiation of ADT.

In those receiving postoperative prostate bed radiotherapy, the addition of two years of antiandrogen therapy significantly improved MFS (absolute difference; 8.5% at 12 years; p = .005) and OS (absolute difference, 5% at 10 years; HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99; p = .04) compared with placebo. The RADICALS‐HD trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00541047) has established that long‐course ADT (24 months) improves MFS compared with short‐course ADT (six months; HR, 0.773; 95% CI, 0.612–0.975; p = .029). No definite OS benefit was observed. There is contradictory evidence regarding the use of six months of ADT, with some trials reporting a benefit in MFS or progression‐free survival (PFS), whereas others have reported none, so it may be offered based on a risk–benefit discussion with the individual. The three‐way comparison of the RADICALS‐HD trial (none, short‐course, long‐course) failed to detect an MFS benefit.

The time to testosterone recovery depends on the age of the individual, baseline testosterone, and duration of ADT prescribed. The oral ADT relugolix achieves rapid, sustained testosterone suppression and allows for earlier testosterone recovery upon discontinuation, and it may reduce the risk of major cardiovascular adverse events. The parenteral gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist degarelix has a similar cardiac profile compared with a GnRH agonist like leuprolide.

Conclusion

Relugolix is the first oral LHRH analogue, approved due to the safety and efficacy demonstrated in the HERO trial. Our early commercial experience shows that while medication compliance does not appear to be a major issue, the cost did impact how many patients filled their prescriptions or discontinued relugolix. No new safety signals were observed in patients taking relugolix in combination with AR-targeted agents or switching from injection therapy.

### Management of patients with advanced prostate cancer: recommendations of the ST gallen advanced prostate cancer consensus conference (APCCC) 2015 [^113dxTXD]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

In the absence of evidence, the selection of treatment is based on clinical judgement that includes the experience of the treating physician with the available agents, the status of the disease, when the patient is presenting for treatment, and potential comorbid conditions that might preclude a particular treatment. All treatments can have side-effects, and all of the new treatments are expensive. Of note, global access to the above-mentioned CRPC therapeutics varies across the globe, and the financial burden to an individual patient, but also to the community, must be factored.

Zoledronic acid and denosumab are approved to reduce the risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) based on the results of phase III trials in men with metastatic CRPC. Most were approved before the availability of therapies beyond taxanes. The optimal use of these osteoclast-targeted therapies (including sequencing, initiation, frequency and duration of treatment) has not been determined. Moreover, their roles, and in particular their efficacy, in the era of newly approved anticancer-treatment options for men with CRPC [many of which also reduce the risk of SREs or symptomatic skeletal-related events (SSEs)] have not been determined. Studies to address these critical knowledge gaps need to be undertaken.

Physicians may rely on national and international guidelines to base management decisions outside of clinical trials. The level of evidence on which a specific guideline is based varies considerably. Nonetheless, there still remain several topics regarding management decisions where there is either a paucity of level one evidence or conflicting evidence of results. To address this, an international expert consensus, the St Gallen Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC), was organised with the objective of providing the recommendations of experts to complement evidence-based guidelines and to better frame the discussion between men with prostate cancer and physicians when faced with management decisions.

Importantly, several of these recommendations were derived from clinical trial data that have been obtained from trials with specific entry criteria. These criteria will differ from trial to trial. Hence, not all recommendations can be generalised and applied uncritically to every patient, rather they should be tailored to an individual and shared decision making is still required.

### The oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist relugolix as neoadjuvant / adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy to external beam radiotherapy in patients with localised intermediate-risk prostate cancer: a randomised, open-label, parallel-group phase 2 trial [^1165UHSm]. European Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with neoadjuvant/adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an established treatment option to prolong survival for patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). Relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, was evaluated in this clinical setting in comparison with degarelix, an injectable GnRH antagonist.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix to achieve and maintain castration.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A phase 2 open-label study was conducted in 103 intermediate-risk PCa patients undergoing primary EBRT and neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT between June 2014 and December 2015.

Intervention

Patients randomly assigned (3:2) to 24-wk treatment with either daily oral relugolix or 4-wk subcutaneous depot degarelix (reference control).

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

The primary endpoint was the rate of effective castration (testosterone < 1.73nmol/l) in relugolix patients between 4 and 24 wk of treatment. Secondary endpoints included rate of profound castration (testosterone < 0.7nmol/l), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, prostate volume, quality of life (QoL) assessed using the Aging Males' Symptoms scale, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life (30-item EORTC core questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30] and 25-item EORTC prostate cancer module [EORTC QLQ-PR25]) questionnaires, and safety. No formal statistical comparisons with degarelix were planned.

Results and Limitations

Castration rates during treatment were 95% and 82% with relugolix and 89% and 68% with degarelix for 1.73 and 0.7nmol/l thresholds, respectively. Median time to castration in the relugolix arm was 4 d. During treatment, PSA levels and prostate volumes were reduced in both groups. Three months after discontinuing treatment, 52% of men on relugolix and 16% on degarelix experienced testosterone recovery (statistical significance of differences not tested). Mean and median QoL scores improved following treatment discontinuation. The most common adverse event was hot flush (relugolix 57%; degarelix 61%). Lack of blinding was a potential limitation.

Conclusions

Relugolix achieved testosterone suppression to castrate levels within days and maintained it over 24 wk with a safety profile consistent with its mechanism of action.

Patient Summary

Oral once-daily relugolix may be a novel oral alternative to injectable androgen deprivation therapies.

### Efficacy and safety of radiotherapy plus relugolix in men with localized or advanced prostate cancer [^114aJQ9x]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Among the 99 patients receiving longer-term relugolix with radiotherapy, 60 (61%) presented with locally advanced disease, 23 (23%) with evidence of biochemical or clinical relapse, and 16 (16%) with newly diagnosed metastatic disease. During the study, 88 patients (89%) received external beam radiotherapy (eTable 2 in Supplement 3). Sixty (61%) received radiotherapy as primary therapy, with 15 (15%) and 24 (24%) receiving radiotherapy for salvage or palliative purposes, respectively. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for the leuprolide acetate cohort and overall HERO cohort are found in Table 1 and Shore et al. While the treatment cohorts were balanced in the total population, in this subgroup analysis, the relugolix cohort had higher PSA levels and a greater proportion of patients with metastatic disease and Gleason scores of greater than 8 than the leuprolide acetate cohort at baseline.

Efficacy

Short-Term ADT With Radiotherapy

The effective castration rate over 24 weeks was 95% (95% CI, 87.1%-99.0%) in the relugolix cohort and 89% (95% CI, 75.2%-97.1%) in the degarelix cohort. For the relugolix cohort, the secondary end points of median time to achieve testosterone levels of less than 50 ng/dL and less than 20 ng/dL were 4 days and 15 days, respectively (Figure 2 A). PSA levels steadily declined through the study, with percentage changes reaching 97.4% (mean [SD] PSA nadir of 0.3 ng/mL [0.7]; to convert to μg/L, multiply by 1). FSH levels were suppressed to 1.5 mIU/mL (to convert to IU/L, multiply by 1) in the relugolix cohort through week 24. Testosterone suppression to castrate levels occurred rapidly in both cohorts, while time to testosterone recovery was more rapid for the relugolix cohort vs the degarelix cohort (Figure 3 A). Thirty-four (52%) and 6 patients (16%) achieved testosterone levels to baseline or 280 ng/dL within 12 weeks of treatment discontinuation in the relugolix and degarelix cohorts, respectively.

### Efficacy and safety of radiotherapy plus relugolix in men with localized or advanced prostate cancer [^113F2hTq]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Relugolix, like all prior US Food and Drug Administration–approved forms of ADT, reached the therapeutic bar of sustained castration. There was superior sustained castration compared with leuprolide acetate in the HERO phase 3 trial. The kinetics of testosterone recovery and delivery route of relugolix are favorable, especially for patients receiving finite durations of ADT. The ability of relugolix to suppress testosterone within hours and achieve deep levels of sustained castration and very rapid testosterone recovery make it highly desirable as a form of ADT to be used in combination with radiotherapy. Treatment with GnRH receptor agonists for even just 6 months has been shown to have a 19-month time to testosterone recovery, with approximately 30% of men not achieving normal testosterone levels within 18 months. In men receiving long-term ADT (median duration of 24 months), it takes multiple years to recover normal T levels, with 47% of men not recovering normal testosterone levels within 2 years. In contrast, even after 48 weeks of relugolix treatment, most men recovered to normal testosterone levels (≥ 280 ng/dL) within 90 days after discontinuing ADT (vs < 5% with leuprolide acetate).

Prior trials and meta-analyses, including the HERO trial, demonstrated the potential for fewer major adverse cardiovascular events with GnRH receptor antagonists compared with agonists, although to our knowledge other studies have not shown this benefit. Other AEs were generally similar for patients in the HERO trial who did or did not receive radiotherapy. While rates of diarrhea were higher in patients who received radiotherapy than in the total HERO population (22% vs 10%), they were mostly considered mild (grades 1 and 2) and presented for a duration of less than 70 days. Similarly, these rates were increased in patients who received relugolix compared with leuprolide acetate, as shown in the overall study population.

### Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of SHR7280, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist, in healthy men: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 study [^116fYyo9]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The PK profiles of SHR7280 were comparable to those of other oral GnRH antagonists, such as elagolix and relugolix. SHR7280 demonstrated a rapid onset of action, supporting its use as acute therapy. During twice-daily dosing of 100 to 1000 mg BID, no accumulation of SHR7280 was found. This finding was consistent with the PD data, which showed a rapid rebound of LH, FSH, and testosterone concentrations after elimination of SHR7280. In comparison with the peptide long-acting antagonist degarelix acetate for injection, SHR7280, as a non-peptide small molecule antagonist, has certain advantages, such as high oral bioavailability, the ability to adjust the dose flexibly according to the weight and hormone levels of patients, and rapid clearance of the drug effect after discontinuation of administration.

The PD results of SHR7280 were also consistent with those reported for GnRH antagonists. SHR7280 demonstrated quick and sustainable suppression of LH, FSH, and testosterone levels, indicating its potential as a novel GnRH antagonist option. The prompt and rapid plasma exposure of SHR7280 may contribute to the quick response of sex hormones. The inhibitory effects on sex hormone were dose-proportional, and higher doses, such as 800, 1000, or even 600 mg BID, achieved medical castration of these hormones. Relugolix, with a protocol-prespecified dose of 360 mg as an initial dose followed by daily doses of 120 mg, required 4 days to suppress testosterone level to achieve castration status in patients with advanced prostate cancer; however, SHR7280 was able to suppress testosterone level to the castration status from day 2 in healthy male subjects, although the suppression effect by SHR7280 in patients with prostate cancer requires further validation. Taken together, these findings provide a basis for dose selection in the subsequent phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.

### A practical guide to relugolix: early experience with oral androgen deprivation therapy [^115DF54Q]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Relugolix is the newest form of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) approved for prostate cancer. However, as an oral drug, several real-world concerns exist, particularly medication compliance, safety with other androgen receptor-targeted agents, and financial burden to patients.

Methods

A single institution retrospective chart review was conducted evaluating all patients who were prescribed relugolix for any prostate cancer indication from January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Demographic data, cardiac risk factors, concomitant therapy usage, and PSA/testosterone levels, were abstracted from the chart review. Adverse effects were obtained by examining progress notes. Compliance was assessed by clinic notes as well as prescription fills by specialty pharmacy records. The reasons patients did not fill or discontinued the medication were noted.

Results

Hundred and one patients were prescribed relugolix, and 91 patients consented to research. Seventy-one (78%) patients filled the prescription to relugolix, with a median follow-up of 5months. Prescription fill data were available for 45 (63%) patients, with 94% of days covered. The most commonly reported reason not to fill was cost at 50%. Sixty-six (93%) patients reported never missing a dose. PSA levels were available in 71 (100%) patients with 69 (97%) showing stable or improved PSA. Testosterone levels were available in 61 (86%) of patients, which showed 61 (100%) stable or successful castration. Twenty-four (34%) patients used relugolix in combination. No new major safety signals were seen in combination therapy. Nineteen (27%) patients had switched to another form of ADT. Fifteen of these (79%) felt similar or better on relugolix therapy.

Conclusions

Compliance with relugolix seemed acceptable. No major new safety signals were seen, even in combination. Among patients who switched therapy, most tolerated relugolix similarly or better than the previous form of ADT. The cost was a major reason for patients not initiating and for discontinuing therapy.

5.1 QT/QTc Interval Prolongation

Androgen deprivation therapy, such as ORGOVYX may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, or frequent electrolyte abnormalities and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions

ORGOVYX is contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity to relugolix or any of the product components [see Contraindications (4)]. Hypersensitivity reactions, including pharyngeal edema and other serious cases of angioedema, have been reported in postmarketing in patients treated with ORGOVYX.

In the HERO study, patients treated with relugolix reported angioedema (0.2%) [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)].

Advise patients who experience any symptoms of hypersensitivity to temporarily discontinue ORGOVYX and promptly seek medical care.

Discontinue ORGOVYX for severe hypersensitivity reactions and manage as clinically indicated.

5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

The safety and efficacy of ORGOVYX have not been established in females. Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, ORGOVYX can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. In an animal reproduction study, oral administration of relugolix to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal lethality at maternal exposures that were 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 120 mg daily based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose of ORGOVYX [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].

5.4 Laboratory Testing

Therapy with ORGOVYX results in suppression of the pituitary gonadal system. Results of diagnostic tests of the pituitary gonadotropic and gonadal functions conducted during and after ORGOVYX may be affected. The therapeutic effect of ORGOVYX should be monitored by measuring serum concentrations of prostate specific antigen (PSA) periodically. If PSA increases, serum concentrations of testosterone should be measured.

### Recent advances in the management of metastatic prostate cancer [^115QZ81A]. JCO Oncology Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of metastatic prostate cancer has undergone a revolution over the past decade with the introduction of several novel agents and repurposing of others. Several clinical trials reported improved outcomes with the intensification of androgen deprivation therapy by the addition of docetaxel chemotherapy or novel hormonal agents (abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide) in the metastatic castration-sensitive state. Relugolix has been recently approved as the first oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist agent with a superior cardiovascular side-effect profile, and serum testosterone suppression compared with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, leuprolide. Poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (olaparib and rucaparib) have demonstrated significant clinical benefit for patients harboring deleterious mutations in genes belonging to the homologous recombination repair pathway and have received Food and Drug Administration approval. Recently, lutetium-177-prostate-specific membrane antigen-617 with standard of care treatment has shown to improve overall survival in men with advanced-stage prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. These recent approvals, successes, and the ongoing investigation of multiple novel agents are expected to continue to dramatically improve survival outcomes of men with metastatic prostate cancer in the coming years.

Longer-Term ADT With Radiotherapy

The sustained castration rate over 48 weeks was 96.9% (95% CI, 90.6%-99.0%) in the relugolix cohort and 96.4% (95% CI, 86.4%-99.1%) in the leuprolide acetate cohort. For the relugolix cohort, the secondary end points of day 4 and day 15 testosterone suppression rates (< 50 ng/dL) were 59.6% and 100%, respectively, compared with 0% (day 4) and 10.3% (day 15) in the leuprolide acetate cohort (Figure 2 B). Relugolix achieved a rapid PSA response in more patients compared with leuprolide acetate by day 15 (75.8% vs 19.0%). Additionally, FSH levels at week 24 were suppressed to 1.6 mIU/mL in the relugolix cohort compared with 5.5 mIU/mL in the leuprolide acetate cohort. The eFigure in Supplement 3 presents these end points as continuous data in box plots.

Testosterone suppression to castrate levels occurred rapidly in the relugolix cohort, which achieved a mean testosterone level of 38 ng/dL on day 4 (Figure 3 B). In contrast, testosterone levels briefly surged from baseline to day 4 in the leuprolide acetate cohort before decreasing to castrate levels by day 29. Mean (SD) testosterone levels assessed 90 days after treatment discontinuation for the testosterone recovery subgroup were 310.5 (122.4) ng/dL for the relugolix cohort compared with 53.0 (106.7) ng/dL for the leuprolide acetate cohort. Castration resistance-free survival was not statistically different between the cohorts (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.35–2.72; p = 0.62).

### Population PK and semimechanistic PK / PD modeling and simulation of relugolix effects on testosterone suppression in men with prostate cancer [^117Dhkko]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor agonists and antagonists decrease testicular production of testosterone and are therefore used as ADT, with the injectable GnRH receptor agonist (peptide analog) leuprolide acetate being the current mainstay of prostate cancer treatment. GnRH receptor agonists initially stimulate testicular testosterone production, which leads to an increase in systemic testosterone concentrations, but ultimately causes desensitization and downregulation of GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary. Consequently, testicular production of testosterone is reduced, with castration levels of testosterone being reached within 4 weeks following treatment initiation. However, the initial testosterone surge can be associated with adverse clinical effects in some patients (e.g. spinal cord compression, pathologic bone fracture, bladder outlet obstruction, and, consequently, death). First‐generation androgen receptor inhibitors (e.g. bicalutamide) are often co‐prescribed to avoid the initial testosterone surge. In addition, until recently, ADT products were only available as injectable depot formulations, which are not only associated with injection‐site reactions, but therapeutic or adverse effects may persist for months following discontinuation of treatment.

Relugolix (ORGOVYX), the first orally active, nonpeptide GnRH receptor antagonist, is currently approved in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer, with a recommended dosing regimen of a 360‐mg loading dose followed by a 120‐mg daily dose. By directly blocking GnRH signals, relugolix lowers systemic testosterone concentrations immediately at the start of treatment without an initial testosterone surge. Differences in mechanism of action, formulation, and route of administration result in rapid onset and offset of relugolix action that may provide therapeutic benefits compared with leuprolide acetate and other ADT products. Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) and semimechanistic PopPK/pharmacodynamic (PopPK/PD) models were developed to characterize the relugolix exposure and its relationship to systemic testosterone concentrations. Relugolix and testosterone concentration data, demographic and clinical information from two phase I studies, two phase II studies, and the phase III safety and efficacy study (HERO) were combined to create a pooled dataset for model development. Simulations using the PopPK and PopPK/PD models were conducted to confirm the recommended relugolix dosing regimen, identify covariates that impact relugolix or testosterone concentrations, assess the impact of temporary treatment interruption on testosterone concentrations, and describe the time‐course of testosterone concentrations following treatment discontinuation.

Safety

Short-Term ADT With Radiotherapy

Hot flashes, the most common AE of any grade in both groups, was experienced by 37 of 65 patients (57%) and 23 of 38 patients (61%) in the relugolix and degarelix cohorts, respectively (Table 2). Onset of symptoms was experienced at a mean (SD) of 19.3 (16.3) days in the relugolix cohort and 28.9 (27.3) days in the degarelix cohort for a mean (SD) duration of 186.0 (75.6) and 201.2 (73.5) days, respectively. Other AEs experienced by more than 10% of the population in both cohorts included fatigue, diarrhea, cataract, nocturia, and pollakiuria. Symptom onset and the duration of each are reported in Table 2. Grade 3 or higher AEs experienced by more than 2% of the population included headache and hypertension in the relugolix cohort (n = 1 each).

Longer-Term ADT With Radiotherapy

AEs that were experienced by more than 10% of the population in the relugolix cohort included hot flash, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, arthralgia, back pain, dysuria, nocturia, and weight increase (Table 2). Select AEs were seen with numerically higher frequency in the relugolix vs the leuprolide acetate cohort; however, time of event onset and duration were similar between cohorts, with large intracohort variation. Grade 3 or higher AEs were uncommon; 2 patients each experienced grade 3 or higher atrial fibrillation and hypertension in the relugolix cohort. In the leuprolide acetate cohort, 1 patient experienced grade 3 or higher hypertension.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

After administration of single doses ranging from 60 mg to 360 mg (0.17 to 1 times the recommended loading dose), the area under concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-inf) and the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of relugolix increased approximately proportionally with dose. After administration of multiple doses of relugolix once daily, the AUCtauof relugolix increased approximately proportionally with dose while the Cmaxincrease was greater than dose proportional for doses from 20 mg to 180 mg (0.17 to 1.5 times the recommended dosage). After administration of a single 360 mg loading dose in patients, the mean (± standard deviation [± SD]) of AUC0–24and Cmaxof relugolix were 985 (± 742) ng.hr/mL and 215 (± 184) ng/mL, respectively. After administration of a 120 mg dose once daily in patients, the mean (± SD) of AUC0–24and Cmaxof relugolix at steady-state were 407 (± 168) ng.hr/mL and 70 (± 65) ng/mL, respectively. The accumulation of relugolix upon once daily administration is approximately 2-fold.

Key Points

Question

Is relugolix, an oral androgen deprivation therapy, safe and effective in patients receiving radiotherapy for prostate cancer?

Findings

In these 2 randomized clinical trials of 260 men with prostate cancer who were receiving treatment with radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy, relugolix achieved high castration rates in 95% or more of patients across localized, locally advanced, recurrent, and/or metastatic disease. Rapid testosterone recovery was achieved with relugolix, and no new safety concerns were identified in the radiotherapy setting.

Meaning

The results of these randomized clinical trials suggest that relugolix is safe and effective in patients receiving radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

### A practical guide to relugolix: early experience with oral androgen deprivation therapy [^116ihQuY]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog leuprolide provides safe, reversible, and effective means for testosterone suppression in prostate cancer. By virtue of its mechanism of action, however, leuprolide initially raises testosterone levels before achieving castration, potentially leading to symptomatic flare in advanced disease. The LHRH antagonist degarelix was developed in part to avoid this, achieving faster, safer, and more consistent testosterone suppression.

While both leuprolide and degarelix are generally well tolerated, their administration typically requires an injection in the physician's office. Relugolix is an oral highly selective LHRH antagonist given daily that has been shown to achieve androgen deprivation in both phase Iand phase IItrials and was finally approved by the FDA in the phase III HERO trial. The HERO trial enrolled patients with castration-sensitive prostate cancer and compared their sustained castration rate at 48 weeks to leuprolide. While the safety profile of the 2 agents was similar, relugolix achieved castrate levels of testosterone faster and provided a higher overall rate of castration.

### Updates to advanced prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline (2023) [^113sjKR9]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Advanced prostate cancer — initiating androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) without radiographic metastases: ADT should not be routinely initiated in this population; however, if ADT is initiated in the absence of metastatic disease, intermittent ADT may be offered in lieu of continuous ADT. Any potential benefit of early initiation of systemic therapy must be weighed against adverse events and quality of life, and in the TOAD trial, early ADT was associated with higher rates of hormone-treatment-related symptoms and inferior quality of life related to sexual activity; there is no evidence to determine the best time to start ADT without radiographic metastases.

### Management of patients with advanced prostate cancer: recommendations of the ST gallen advanced prostate cancer consensus conference (APCCC) 2015 [^111V6yYm]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Another area of uncertainty is the 'best use' of osteoclast-targeted agents in men with CRPC concerning initiation, dose, frequency and duration. It is also unclear if, in the time of potent new therapies, the effect of these agents is redundant or additive, and that may depend on the new therapy used. The management of men with oligometastatic disease is another area where trial data are lacking and no consensus could be achieved, which makes it an important research question. More data are necessary to address the above topics where consensus is lacking, and this conference pointed to clinical issues where physicians make decisions without certainty of benefit. If the gaps in knowledge are not filled with informative rigorous data, future regulators and payers may decide how a patient will be treated.

We did not capture differences in the opinion of panel members by geographic region, access to drugs or imaging or by different patient ethnic groups or cultures. This will be considered at the next meeting.

Additional important questions remain that have not been addressed in this meeting such as costs and cost-effectiveness of drugs, drug accessibility, ideal clinical settings, health economic issues, patient-reported QoL outcomes, implementation of precision medicine strategies in clinical practice as well as combination strategies.

The panel predicts that by the next APCCC in 2017 some of the unanswered questions will be better understood or hopefully clarified by emerging data. Additional questions will then be addressed to provide further recommendations useful for daily clinical practice: in particular selecting the right treatment, for the right patient and at the right time.

### Cardiovascular risk in prostate cancer: state-of-the-art review [^117M5hMw]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

When the findings from PRONOUNCE were incorporated into an updated meta-analysis, the ORs for the composite of major adverse cardiovascular events and overall mortality were, respectively, 0.57 (95% credible interval: 0.37–0.86) and 0.58 (95% credible interval: 0.32–1.08). However, as with the prior meta-analysis, confidence in these findings is not high, because of the open-label nature of the trials and other potential biases and methodological limitations.

Currently, it remains unclear whether GnRH antagonists offer cardiovascular benefits over GnRH agonists. Furthermore, there are clinical limitations to the current commercially available GnRH antagonists. Degarelix, which requires monthly injections, leads to a higher rate of skin adverse effects than GnRH agonists, which can be administered less frequently. Relugolix is an oral agent, which requires adherence to a daily dosing regimen. Research is ongoing into teverelix, an injectable GnRH antagonist that can be administered every 6 weeks. Until more data are available, it is reasonable to discuss with patients the uncertainties surrounding the potential benefits of GnRH antagonists, especially in those with high cardiovascular risk.

Summary

- Cardiovascular risk factors are frequently suboptimally controlled in patients with PC. Strategies should be developed to address this care gap.
- There are some data to suggest that GnRH antagonists may be associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular events than GnRH agonists, but confirmation is needed in appropriate prospective randomized, controlled trials. Until such trials have been performed, the use of GnRH antagonists should be individualized.

### Population PK and semimechanistic PK / PD modeling and simulation of relugolix effects on testosterone suppression in men with prostate cancer [^116yguGQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Quantitative pharmacology based on clinical data can be implemented to provide dosing recommendations for relugolix.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in men, with over 1.2 million cases diagnosed and 358,000 deaths reported annually worldwide. Prostate cancer is defined as advanced when it has metastasized beyond the prostate; the term "advanced" is also used for the disease with prostate‐specific antigen biochemical relapse following primary surgical or radiation therapy of curative intent, or for localized disease unlikely to be cured by local surgical or radiation therapy of curative intent. Although the overall survival rate of patients with localized disease is high, it decreases dramatically with advanced disease, with a 5‐year survival rate ranging from 26% to 30%.

Testosterone (the primary androgen in men) stimulates prostate cancer cell growth, and surgical or medical castration can induce prostate cancer cell death. Hence, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is recommended by European and US clinical practice guidelines as the foundational treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer. Medical castration with testosterone concentrations < 50 ng/dL has been associated with decreased metastases of the primary tumorand has been accepted by regulatory authorities to establish efficacy for prostate cancer treatments. Profound castration with testosterone concentrations < 20 ng/dL has been associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with testosterone concentrations < 50 ng/dL. Upon disease progression to castration‐resistant prostate cancer, where extra‐testicular production of testosterone from the adrenal gland and prostate carcinoma cells develops, tumor growth remains androgen dependent, and therefore treatment with ADT is continued and other treatments with complementary mechanisms of action are co‐prescribed.

HERO Study

The safety and efficacy of ORGOVYX was evaluated in HERO (NCT03085095), a randomized, open label study in men with advanced prostate cancer requiring at least 1 year of androgen deprivation therapy and defined as biochemical (PSA) or clinical relapse following local primary intervention, newly diagnosed castration-sensitive metastatic disease, or advanced localized disease.

A total of 934 patients were randomized to receive ORGOVYX or leuprolide in a 2:1 ratio for 48 weeks:

ORGOVYX at a loading dose of 360 mg on the first day followed by daily doses of 120 mg orally.
Leuprolide acetate 22.5 mg injection (or 11.25 mg in Japan and Taiwan) subcutaneously every 3 months. Leuprolide acetate 11.25 mg is a dosage regimen that is not recommended for this indication in the US.

Serum testosterone concentrations were measured at screening; on Days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 29 in the first month; then monthly until the end of the study.

The population (N = 930) across both treatment groups had a median age of 71 years (range 47 to 97 years). The ethnic/racial distribution was 68% White, 21% Asian, 4.9% Black, and 5% other. Disease stage was distributed as follows: 32% metastatic (M1), 31% locally advanced (T3/4 NX M0 or any T N1 M0), 28% localized (T1 or T2 N0 M0), and 10% not classifiable. The median testosterone concentration at baseline across the treatment groups was 408 ng/dL.

### FDA approves relugolix for advanced prostate cancer-NCI… [^117AHsMM]. NCI (2021). Medium credibility.

Relugolix Approval Expected to Alter Treatment for Advanced Prostate Cancer, by Carmen Phillips A new drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration is expected to immediately affect the treatment of some men with prostate cancer. In a large clinical trial, the drug, relugolix, was shown to be more effective at reducing testosterone levels in men with advanced prostate cancer than another commonly used treatment, leuprolide. "For me, this is significant, " Dr. Shore said. "Many of the patients we start on testosterone suppression are at risk of having a cardiac complication. " Given its superior ability to reduce testosterone and safety with regard to heart-related effects, Dr. Shore said, "it's perfectly arguable" that relugolix should be the preferred choice for ADT in men with advanced prostate cancer. Going After Testosterone Prostate cancer that is confined to the prostate is typically treated with surgery or radiation therapy.

Once it advances beyond the prostate, either to nearby tissues or to other parts of the body, ADT is typically used. Improved Testosterone Suppression, Lower Cardiac Risks More than 900 men with advanced prostate cancer whose tumors still relied on testosterone were enrolled in the HERO trial, which was funded by Myovant Sciences, the manufacturer of relugolix. Participants were assigned at random to take relugolix daily for 48 weeks or to receive leuprolide injections every 3 months for the same length of time. Approximately 97% of men treated with relugolix reached and maintained very low testosterone levels through 48 weeks, compared with 89% of men who received leuprolide. In addition, men in the relugolix group also did substantially better on several other measures, including being able to return to normal testosterone levels within a few months of stopping therapy. Dr.

Karzai noted that there are still questions about using relugolix in patient care. For example, there might be problems with men's ability to take a pill every day, as opposed to only having to get an injection of leuprolide or related drugs every few months. Dr. Morgans agreed that this could be a concern but noted that men with more advanced forms of prostate cancer also receive other drugs that are taken as pills and have been generally good about using them as prescribed.

### Mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in prostate cancer [^112L9Rf9]. Current Oncology Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the USA. The challenge in managing castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stems not from the lack of therapeutic options but from the limited duration of clinical and survival benefit offered by treatments in this setting due to primary and acquired resistance. The remarkable molecular heterogeneity and tumor adaptability in advanced prostate cancer necessitate optimization of such treatment strategies. While the future of CRPC management will involve newer targeted therapies in deliberately biomarker-selected patients, interventions using current approaches may exhibit improved clinical benefit if employed in the context of optimal sequencing and combinations. This review outlines our current understanding of mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in progression to and after the development of castration resistance, highlighting targetable and reversible mechanisms of resistance.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

Relugolix, the first orally active, nonpeptide gonadotropin‐releasing hormone receptor antagonist, is approved in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of adults with advanced prostate cancer.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

A population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model and a semimechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PopPK/PD) model for testosterone suppression by relugolix were developed from phases I–III data, to identify covariates with clinical relevance, assess impact of temporary treatment interruption, and demonstrate testosterone recovery after treatment discontinuation.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

The PopPK and PopPK/PD models characterized relugolix exposure and its relationship to testosterone concentrations. Age, body weight, race, and health status demonstrated limited/no clinically meaningful impact. Model‐based simulated testosterone profiles were consistent with clinical data for the approved relugolix dosing regimen (a 360‐mg loading dose, followed by a 120‐mg daily dose) and support temporary treatment interruption of ≤ 14 days, if necessary.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

### Population PK and semimechanistic PK / PD modeling and simulation of relugolix effects on testosterone suppression in men with prostate cancer [^112At6WZ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Additional simulations based on the final PopPK/PD model were conducted to demonstrate testosterone recovery after treatment discontinuation: — ~ 50% of patients were predicted to achieve testosterone concentrations above the castration levels on day 25 and above 280 ng/dL on day 52. Simulated testosterone following treatment discontinuation was faster than that observed in the HERO study, which is consistent with other studies demonstrating a correlation between the duration of ADT and the time required for testosterone concentrations to normalize. Specifically, in a subset of patients in the HERO study who did not receive subsequent ADT for 90 days following discontinuation of treatment with relugolix, the cumulative incidence rate of testosterone concentrations to > 280 ng/dL (lower limit of normal range) or to baseline was 55%.

In summary, the PopPK and semimechanistic PopPK/PD models adequately characterized the systemic relugolix exposure and its relationship to testosterone concentrations. Age, body weight, and Black/African American race demonstrated at most minimal effects with no clinical relevance; other races, health status (healthy men vs. patients with prostate cancer), or stage of cancer demonstrated no effects on relugolix exposure or testosterone concentrations. Model‐based simulations of testosterone profiles were consistent with clinical data, reflecting the high predictive value of the model and supporting the reliability of the model‐based simulations. Simulation using the PopPK/PD model demonstrated that 97.3% and 85.5% of the patients remained at castration levels upon temporary interruption for 7 days and 14 days, respectively. The PopPK and PopPK/PD models can be used to provide guidance regarding dosing recommendations under various circumstances (e.g. temporary interruption of treatment, if needed) for relugolix.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114cH457]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with relugolix — Relugolix alone is included as an option for ADT in patients with castration-naïve disease. Reported major adverse cardiovascular events were 2.9% in the relugolix arm and 6.2% in the leuprolide arm (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24–0.88). Ongoing monitoring for sustained suppression of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL) can be considered, data are limited on long-term adherence to oral relugolix, and relugolix may not be a preferred agent if adherence is uncertain. The HERO trial did not include patients receiving curative intent therapy, and although the Panel considers relugolix to be an acceptable option in the curative-intent setting, additional studies are needed; furthermore, relugolix shows a shorter time to testosterone recovery, which might be associated with a higher risk of death from prostate cancer.

### Cardiovascular risk in prostate cancer: state-of-the-art review [^11612UKT]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

The uncertain role of GnRH antagonists

Initial interest in the cardiovascular effects of degarelix, the first widely available GnRH antagonist, arose from post hoc analyses of early-phase trials suggesting fewer cardiovascular events with degarelix compared with GnRH agonists. Animal studies supported this hypothesis by showing less atherosclerotic aortic disease in low-density lipoprotein receptor–knockout mice with degarelix compared with a GnRH agonist.

The HERO (A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Relugolix in Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer) trial, an open-label, randomized trial, compared the oral GnRH antagonist relugolix with the GnRH agonist leuprolide. A lower incidence of cardiovascular events with relugolix was found in a nonprespecified analysis. A systematic review of randomized trials of GnRH antagonists, including HERO, showed that the pooled risk ratios for adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality were respectively 0.57 (95% CI: 0.39–0.81), 0.49 (95% CI: 0.25–0.96), and 0.48 (95% CI: 0.28–0.83) compared with GnRH agonists. Importantly, the risk for bias in the trials identified was considered high, and confidence in these findings was moderate.

### Enzalutamide therapy for advanced prostate cancer: efficacy, resistance and beyond [^115rxCbQ]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion and future perspectives

The introduction of enzalutamide as a second-line hormonal therapy for patients with mCRPC has led to significant improvements in the management of the disease. Due to tumor heterogeneity, the duration of benefit to enzalutamide interventions varies between patients. While some men do respond extremely well and continue treatment for several years, others progress rapidly as a result of treatment resistance. The increasing number of ongoing clinical trials reflects the successful preclinical advances in understanding enzalutamide resistance mechanisms and in discovering novel therapeutic targets to maximize clinical outcome. However, the disease continues to be terminal and current treatment options, including enzalutamide and its alternatives, have only a modest impact on survival, highlighting that many aspects of the disease remain poorly understood. Only by understanding which mechanisms underlie treatment resistance, robust molecular or clinical biomarkers can be developed to guide therapeutic decision-making and to identify patient subpopulations that benefit thereof mostly. That way, well thought-out therapeutic strategies can be designed, comprising optimal patient-tailored therapy sequencing and combination.

### Impact of relugolix versus leuprolide on the quality of life of men with advanced prostate cancer: results from the phase 3 HERO study [^116pnWtv]. European Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist, demonstrated testosterone suppression to castrate levels in men with advanced prostate cancer (PCa) in the HERO study. Since advanced PCa and its treatments can impact patients' daily life, it is imperative to understand the impact of systemic therapy on patient health-related quality of life (HRQOL).

Objective

To report the HRQOL for patients on relugolix compared with those on leuprolide in on-treatment and testosterone recovery periods of the HERO study.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A phase 3 randomized controlled study was conducted in 934 patients with advanced PCa.

Intervention

Patients underwent 2:1 randomization and received relugolix 120 mg orally once daily or leuprolide 3-mo injections for 48 wk. Testosterone recovery was evaluated in a patient subset.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

HRQOL evaluations were based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Prostate Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-PR25) during treatment and testosterone recovery phases. In a post hoc analysis, predictors of HRQOL deterioration were evaluated.

Results and Limitations

No statistically significant differences between the two groups were found in changes from baseline to the end of treatment in either the EORTC QLQ-C30 or the EORTC QLQ-PR25 instrument. During the testosterone recovery phase, hormonal treatment-related symptoms scores were lower for relugolix than for leuprolide, suggesting a lower burden of hormone-related symptoms associated with a treatment that has more rapid testosterone recovery after treatment cessation. Limitations include low patient numbers in the testosterone recovery group.

Conclusions

Oral relugolix is a therapeutic option with similar patient-reported HRQOL to leuprolide, providing an oral option for androgen deprivation therapy associated with a more rapid testosterone reduction.

Patient Summary

In men with advanced prostate cancer, relugolix had similar health-related quality of life to leuprolide.

European Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 Management of side effects caused by hormonal therapy

Cardiovascular events are a significant cause of death in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Many factors may contribute to the increased risk for cardiovascular events in patients with advanced prostate cancer who are receiving systemic therapies. The novel potent ARPIs (abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide, and enzalutamide) have been associated with a small increase in cardiovascular events in clinical trials, but this could partly be due to longer time on trial and capturing of events related to increasing age. Alterations in body composition, lipid profile abnormalities, and impaired glucose control have been discussed as potential underlying mechanisms. For the combination of apalutamide plus ADT, an increase in triglycerides and cholesterol was documented in the TITAN trial, in which patients in the control arm received ADT alone. In the HERO trial, which compared the oral LHRH antagonist relugolix with the LHRH agonist leuprorelin, the risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) with LHRH agonists was most pronounced in patients with a history of prior MACEs. APCCC 2022 panellists discussed questions about performing a cardiovascular assessment before starting systemic therapy and monitoring of patients on ARPIs (see Table 3 and supplement 3 for details).

Q122. Before starting patients with mHSPC on hormonal therapy, 28% of panellists recommended obtaining a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) in the majority of patients, 44% recommended doing so only if there is a history of a MACE or other risk factors for cardiac disease, and 28% voted against a baseline ECG. There were five abstentions. (No consensus for any given answer option.)

Q123. For patients with mHSPC, before starting an ARPI (abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide, or enzalutamide) plus ADT, 14% of panellists voted to recommend a cardiac evaluation (including, eg, echocardiography) in the majority of patients, 57% voted for cardiac evaluation only if patients have a history of MACE(s), and 29% voted against it. There were five abstentions. (No consensus for any given answer option.)

### FDA approves relugolix for advanced prostate cancer… [^11529b86]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

On December 18, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist, relugolix, for adult patients with advanced prostate cancer. Efficacy was evaluated in HERO, a randomized, open label trial in men requiring at least one year of androgen deprivation therapy with either prostate cancer recurrence following radiation or surgery or newly diagnosed castration-sensitive advanced prostate cancer. Patients were randomized to receive relugolix 360 mg oral loading dose on the first day, followed by daily oral doses of 120 mg, or leuprolide acetate 22. 5 mg injection subcutaneously every 3 months for 48 weeks. The main efficacy outcome measure was medical castration rate defined as achieving and maintaining serum testosterone suppression to castrate levels by day 29 through 48 weeks of treatment. The medical castration rate was 96. 7% in the relugolix arm. The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving relugolix in HERO were hot flush, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, diarrhea, and constipation. The most common laboratory abnormalities were increased glucose, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase. Decreased hemoglobin was also observed. The recommended relugolix dose is a loading dose of 360 mg on the first day followed by a daily oral dose of 120 mg at approximately the same time with or without food.

### Duration of androgen deprivation therapy and cardiovascular fitness: delivering the right patient the right therapy at the right time [^113168HM]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Moving forward, improving cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes in patients with prostate cancer will likely require: 1) use of ADT strictly for appropriate evidence-based indications and treatment durations; 2) improved attention to cardiovascular risk factor mitigation in this population; and 3) testing of novel therapies and cardiovascular risk-mitigation strategies. Although consensus guidelines informing the appropriate use of ADT have been published by oncologic and urologic organizations, the optimal use, timing, and duration of ADT remains highly variable in routine prostate cancer clinical practice. As highlighted by the accompanying publication, some cardiometabolic toxicities of ADT may be cumulative and dependent on the duration of therapy, therefore emphasizing the importance of adherence to evidence-based ADT treatment durations. In addition, recent evidence indicates that cardiovascular risk factors are commonly underrecognized and undertreated in patients with prostate cancer planned for ADT initiation. Improvement in both medical and lifestyle cardiovascular risk factors in patients receiving ADT through standardized practical clinical algorithms like the "ABCDE approach", will require enhanced collaborative efforts between prostate cancer providers, cardiologists, and general internists, and may yield improved outcomes for patients. Finally, novel therapies with improved cardiac toxicity profiles are needed. Notably, recent findings from a large phase 3 randomized trial of the novel oral GnRH antagonist relugolix versus the GnRH agonist leuprolide demonstrated a lower incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events with relugolix, particularly in those patients with underlying cardiovascular disease history. Further research should seek to validate this finding and to investigate underlying mechanisms for this improved cardiac safety. In terms of strategies to improve modifiable, lifestyle factors, an ongoing international phase 3 randomized trial is evaluating the use of supervised high-intensity aerobic and resistance training in patients with advanced prostate cancer receiving ADT. Although the primary endpoint of this trial is overall survival, key secondary endpoints will evaluate validated physical quality-of-life metrics and physical functioning (such as cardiopulmonary exercise and 400-m walk tests).

By improving our understanding of the patient- and treatment-related factors contributing to ADT-related cardiac toxicity, oncology and cardiology providers can work collaboratively to optimally use such therapy modifications and cardiovascular risk-mitigation strategies. Ultimately, success will come when we simultaneously maximize both cardiovascular and cancer outcomes for each man, ensuring that we have the right patient receiving the right therapy at the right time.

### Cardiovascular effects of GnRH antagonists compared with agonists in Prostate cancer: a systematic review [^112Di13v]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was preregistered in PROSPERO and is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines.

Literature search

The electronic databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus) were searched in August 2021 (and later updated in October 2022) for eligible studies. Initial screening was performed based on study title and abstract followed by the full-text paper review by 2 reviewers (A.N. and S.T.) independently. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The following search terms were used: (degarelix OR relugolix OR GnRH antagonist OR LHRH [luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone] antagonist OR leuprorelin OR goserelin OR GnRH agonist OR LHRH agonist) AND prostate cancer AND (randomized controlled trial OR RCT OR prospective study).

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

All randomized clinical trials in which a GnRH antagonist was compared with a GnRH agonist for the treatment of prostate cancer were included. Nonrandomized trials, phase 1, nonhuman, and observational studies were excluded. Trials in which survival outcomes were not reported or could not be obtained in both arms were excluded.

Data extraction

The following data were extracted: publication year, sample size at randomization and by study arm, maximum trial duration (and median duration where available), methods of randomization, blinding status, treatment strategy, dose and duration of treatment, outcome definitions, adjudication status, and the number of individual CV and all-cause mortality outcomes.

### Relugolix (Orgovyx) [^111oRY69]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

QT/QTc Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of ORGOVYX was evaluated in HERO, a randomized (2:1), open-label, clinical study in patients with advanced prostate cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Patients received orally administered ORGOVYX as a loading dose of 360 mg on the first day followed by 120 mg taken orally once daily (n = 622) or received leuprolide acetate administered by depot injection at doses of 22.5 mg (n = 264) or 11.25 mg (n = 44) per local guidelines every 12 weeks (n = 308). Leuprolide acetate 11.25 mg is a dosage regimen that is not recommended for this indication in the US. Among patients who received ORGOVYX, 91% were exposed for at least 48 weeks. Ninety-nine (16%) patients received concomitant radiotherapy and 17 (3%) patients received concomitant enzalutamide with ORGOVYX.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 12% of patients receiving ORGOVYX. Serious adverse reactions in ≥ 0.5% of patients included myocardial infarction (0.8%), acute kidney injury (0.6%), arrhythmia (0.6%), hemorrhage (0.6%), and urinary tract infection (0.5%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients receiving ORGOVYX including metastatic lung cancer (0.3%), myocardial infarction (0.3%), and acute kidney injury (0.2%). Fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke were reported in 2.7% of patients receiving ORGOVYX.

### Management of patients with advanced prostate cancer: recommendations of the ST gallen advanced prostate cancer consensus conference (APCCC) 2015 [^117DtX6p]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

The dose of denosumab in the pivotal trial by Fizazi et al. was 120 mg s.c. every 4 weeks until discontinuation or until the primary cut-off date, which occurred about 41 months after start of enrolment. Both zoledronic acid and denosumab were developed and investigated before the era of agents with significant anti-tumour effect and survival impact for men with CRPC. For abiraterone post-docetaxel, or enzalutamide both pre- and post-docetaxel, a significant reduction in the time to first SRE in the active treatment arms was reported.

For radium-223, also a bone targeting agent, there was also a significant prolongation in time to first SSE in the overall trial population and also in the subgroup of patients receiving bisphosphonates.

The optimal timing for starting treatment, optimal treatment intensity (dose and frequency) and optimal duration of osteoclast-targeted agents for men with CRPC is unclear. Also treatment-related toxicity (e.g. osteonecrosis, hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia) has to be taken into consideration.

Overall, 62% of the panel recommended that the majority of men with CRPC with bone metastases should receive an osteoclast-targeted agent for prevention of SRE. Thirty-two percent of the panel recommended osteoclast-targeted treatment in a minority of selected patients. If these treatments are planned there was consensus (76% of the panel) that a professional dental check (dentist) should be undertaken at baseline before treatment start in the majority of patients (Figure 4 B).

The panel was almost equally divided as to preference between zoledronic acid (30%), denosumab (42%) and either of the two options (27%). This voting result may be influenced by the fact that zoledronic acid has become generic influencing the cost of the treatment.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1143brys]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer — relugolix (LHRH antagonist) in the phase 3 HERO trial: 622 patients received relugolix (120 mg orally once daily) and 308 received leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint of sustained castrate testosterone (< 50 ng per deciliter) through 48 weeks showed noninferiority and superiority of relugolix over leuprolide (96.7%; 95% CI, 94.9–97.9 vs. 88.8% [95% CI, 84.6–91.8]; P < .001 for superiority). Castrate levels on day 4 were also improved with relugolix (56% vs. 0%). However, relugolix did not achieve superiority in the key clinical secondary endpoint of castration resistance‑free survival compared to leuprolide.

CRPC treatment initiation and sequencing — decision factors — indicates that the decision to initiate therapy after disease progression on one or more treatments should be based on available high-level evidence of safety, efficacy, and/or tolerability and its application to the individual patient, and prior exposures to therapeutic agents should be considered. Data to inform the optimal sequence for delivery of these agents in patients with mCRPC is evolving, and choice of therapy is based largely on clinical considerations, including patient preferences, prior treatment, presence or absence of visceral disease, symptoms, and potential side effects.

### Relugolix (Orgovyx) [^117M2pxL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The major efficacy outcome measure was medical castration rate defined as achieving and maintaining serum testosterone suppression to castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL) by Day 29 through 48 weeks of treatment. Other endpoints included castration rates on Day 4 and 15 and castration rates with testosterone < 20 ng/dL at Day 15.

The efficacy results are shown in Table 3 and the time course of percent change from baseline in testosterone suppression by ORGOVYX and leuprolide during the 48 week treatment period are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Mean (95% CI) Percent Change from Baseline in Testosterone Concentrations from Baseline to Week 49 by Treatment Group in HERO

The percentages of patients who attained the medical castration levels of testosterone < 50 ng/dL and < 20 ng/dL within the first 29 days of treatment are summarized in Table 4 and the cumulative incidences of time to testosterone < 50 ng/dL or < 20 ng/dL are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Cumulative Incidence of Time to Testosterone < 50 ng/dL and < 20 ng/dL in HERO

In the clinical trial, PSA levels were monitored and were lowered on average by 65% two weeks after administration of ORGOVYX, 83% after 4 weeks, 92% after 3 months and remained suppressed throughout the 48 weeks of treatment. These PSA results should be interpreted with caution because of the heterogeneity of the patient population studied. No evidence has shown that the rapidity of PSA decline is related to a clinical benefit.

A substudy was conducted in 137 patients who did not receive subsequent androgen deprivation therapy for at least 90 days after discontinuation of ORGOVYX. Based on Kaplan-Meier analyses, 55% of patients achieved testosterone levels above the lower limit of the normal range (> 280 ng/dL) or baseline at 90 days after discontinuation of ORGOVYX.

### Oral relugolix for androgen-deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer [^1117SUJG]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Injectable luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (e.g., leuprolide) are the standard agents for achieving androgen deprivation for prostate cancer despite the initial testosterone surge and delay in therapeutic effect. The efficacy and safety of relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, as compared with those of leuprolide are not known.

Methods

In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with advanced prostate cancer, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive relugolix (120 mg orally once daily) or leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. The primary end point was sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (< 50 ng per deciliter) through 48 weeks. Secondary end points included noninferiority with respect to the primary end point, castrate levels of testosterone on day 4, and profound castrate levels (< 20 ng per deciliter) on day 15. Testosterone recovery was evaluated in a subgroup of patients.

Results

A total of 622 patients received relugolix and 308 received leuprolide. Of men who received relugolix, 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 94.9 to 97.9) maintained castration through 48 weeks, as compared with 88.8% (95% CI, 84.6 to 91.8) of men receiving leuprolide. The difference of 7.9 percentage points (95% CI, 4.1 to 11.8) showed noninferiority and superiority of relugolix (P < 0.001 for superiority). All other key secondary end points showed superiority of relugolix over leuprolide (P < 0.001). The percentage of patients with castrate levels of testosterone on day 4 was 56.0% with relugolix and 0% with leuprolide. In the subgroup of 184 patients followed for testosterone recovery, the mean testosterone levels 90 days after treatment discontinuation were 288.4 ng per deciliter in the relugolix group and 58.6 ng per deciliter in the leuprolide group. Among all the patients, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events was 2.9% in the relugolix group and 6.2% in the leuprolide group (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.88).

Conclusions

In this trial involving men with advanced prostate cancer, relugolix achieved rapid, sustained suppression of testosterone levels that was superior to that with leuprolide, with a 54% lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.

### Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of SHR7280, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist, in healthy men: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 study [^116wRGFu]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Globally, prostate cancer represents a significant health burden for the male population, being the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related mortality among men in 2020. The foundational therapeutic approach for advanced prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

In the hypothalamic–pituitary axis, the hypothalamus secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the release of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH, in turn, stimulates testosterone production. Consequently, targeting GnRH, which is the upstream regulatory factor of testosterone, has become a feasible therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer. In the early years, GnRH agonists were the standard of care for advanced prostate cancer. However, their use was limited due to clinical flare-up of symptoms, side effects, and a delayed onset of testosterone suppression for several weeks.

An alternative option of ADT is the suppression of sex hormones by GnRH antagonists. GnRH antagonists compete with GnRH receptor signaling, blocking the release of LH and FSH from the pituitary and leading to a decline in testosterone production. Compared to GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists have a rapid efficacy in testosterone castration, and the suppressed testosterone level can be quickly restored after treatment cessation. Abarelix and degarelix were two pioneering GnRH antagonists, but their development and clinical use were hindered by allergic reactions and injection administration, respectively. Currently, the most widely used oral GnRH antagonist for advanced prostate cancer is relugolix, which received FDA approval in 2020. Nevertheless, it still has some disadvantages, such as causing hot flashes, prolonging the QT interval, having embryo-fetal toxicity, and being incompatible with co-administrated of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors and combined P-gp and strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inducers. Thus, the development of alternative GnRH antagonists with promising efficacy and acceptable safety is warranted.

### Castration-resistant prostate cancer: an algorithmic approach [^111EubD4]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Since 2010, 5 new agents have been approved for advanced prostate cancer treatment. The American Urologic Association (AUA) published guidelines for the management of castration-resistant prostate cancer in 2013. These guidelines identify 6 index patients to consider when selecting the most appropriate treatment. No comparative trials have provided an approach to optimize the sequencing of these drugs. For the urologist, incorporating the guidelines into clinical practice typically requires a multidisciplinary team. This article provides an algorithmic approach based on indication and mechanism of action that complements the AUA guidelines to ensure patients receive the most optimal care.
