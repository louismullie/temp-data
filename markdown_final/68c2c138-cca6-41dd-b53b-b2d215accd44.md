## Question

What are the potential risks associated with administering an MMR booster to individuals with a negative measles titer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential risks associated with administering an MMR booster to someone with a negative measles titer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a negative measles titer means clinically and immunologically. Then, I should verify the expected benefits and limitations of a booster in this context. Next, I will review the safety profile and adverse event risks of MMR boosters. After that, I need to consider special populations and contraindications. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced risk–benefit conclusion and outline practical management steps, including when to stop boosting and what to do for nonresponders [^113jmstX].

> Let me first confirm what a negative measles titer implies. A negative measles IgG generally indicates a lack of detectable circulating antibodies and, by commonly used correlates, suggests susceptibility to measles, although the exact protective threshold is debated and varies by assay and context, with some literature citing 120 mIU/mL as a correlate while acknowledging limited evidence and variability across methods [^115qTXkk] [^117BWSu2]. Wait, let me verify the immunologic heterogeneity here: some individuals with negative IgG may still have cellular immunity, but in true nonresponders, even T and B cell responses to measles antigen are absent, indicating a lack of immunologic memory and a higher likelihood of remaining susceptible despite boosting [^116FLjd7].

> Next, I should review the expected benefit of a booster in seronegative individuals. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some will seroconvert, but not all. In a large cohort of healthcare workers with negative titers after two prior doses, about 74% seroconverted after one booster and about 93% after a second booster, though titers were often modest and waned over time, underscoring that boosting helps many but not all and that durability can be limited [^114Mrkx1] [^1133S3gh]. I need to check durability data: in a small study of seronegative adults, median IgG titers after one or two boosters were low and declined by roughly 50% over three years, and neutralizing antibody titers remained substantially below those seen in primary vaccine responders, raising concern about long-term protection even after seroconversion [^114PCNsx] [^112hj7wf].

> I will now examine the safety profile of MMR boosters in immunocompetent adults. Common adverse effects are mild and transient: local soreness, fever, and mild rash, with fever and rash peaking around 5–12 days after vaccination; lymphadenopathy and transient arthralgia or arthritis, particularly in adult women, also occur [^111AEQZ2] [^111bxdkC]. Let me double-check the febrile seizure signal: MMR is associated with a small increased risk of febrile seizures 8–14 days after vaccination, estimated at about 1 per 3,000–4,000 vaccinated children, and the risk is higher when MMR is combined with varicella in MMRV for the first dose, which is not relevant to adult boosters but is important for pediatric context [^111AEQZ2] [^114QBjzM]. Serious allergic reactions are rare, and no new safety signals have emerged for booster doses in adults beyond the known profile of primary doses [^114Mrkx1].

> But wait, what about rare but clinically important risks? I should confirm the immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) risk. The MMR label and CDC note a small increased risk of ITP in the six weeks following vaccination, estimated around 1 per 40,000 doses; this risk is low and generally self-limited, but it is a recognized signal that should be contextualized against the risks of measles itself [^111AEQZ2] [^1115H1pv]. Hold on, I should verify whether this changes booster decisions: given the rarity and the severity of measles, this does not negate the benefit of boosting seronegative adults, but it supports counseling and documentation of timing relative to any prior thrombocytopenia history [^111AEQZ2].

> Next, I should review special populations and contraindications. Severe immunodeficiency, including advanced HIV with CD4 < 200 cells/mm3, and pregnancy are contraindications to MMR; individuals with these conditions should not receive live MMR boosters, and pregnancy should be avoided for four weeks after vaccination [^114qBmSD] [^1113iYxK]. Let me consider immunocompromised hosts more carefully: in carefully selected transplant recipients with low-level immunosuppression, MMR has been given safely with good serologic responses, but this is not generalizable and requires specialist oversight; for most severely immunocompromised patients, boosting remains contraindicated [^116Bm9z5] [^113vpado]. I should also confirm that a personal or family history of seizures is a precaution favoring separate MMR and varicella rather than MMRV for the first pediatric dose; this is less relevant to adult boosters but remains a general safety principle [^114QBjzM].

> Now, I need to ensure I weigh the immunologic limitations of repeated boosting. In individuals with primary vaccine failure or profound loss of measles-specific immune memory, additional boosters may fail to restore durable protection; nonresponders after two boosters have been described and may require alternative strategies such as exposure precautions and immunoglobulin in the event of exposure rather than further live vaccination attempts [^116FLjd7] [^113jmstX]. Hmm, wait a minute — does this mean boosting is futile? No, it means that while many will benefit, a subset will not, and clinicians should set expectations accordingly and plan for nonresponder management rather than indefinite repeated boosters [^114Mrkx1] [^1133S3gh].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance. The clinical risks of an MMR booster in a seronegative, immunocompetent adult are low and similar to primary vaccination, with mostly mild, self-limited reactions and very rare serious events such as anaphylaxis or ITP; in contrast, measles is highly contagious, can be severe, and carries risks of complications and outbreaks, particularly in exposed settings like healthcare or travel [^111AEQZ2] [^117YNWB8]. I should double-check that current guidance supports boosting when seronegative: while routine serologic testing is not universally recommended, when seronegativity is identified — especially in high-risk groups — administering a booster is reasonable and aligns with occupational health and outbreak-control practices [^114Mrkx1].

> Finally, I need to outline practical management and follow-up. For a seronegative adult with a reliable two-dose history, a single MMR booster is appropriate, with serologic reassessment in about 4–8 weeks to document response; if still seronegative, a second booster can be considered, recognizing diminishing returns and the possibility of nonresponse, after which further boosting is generally not helpful and the individual should be managed as a nonresponder with exposure precautions and access to post-exposure prophylaxis, including immunoglobulin when indicated [^114Mrkx1] [^113jmstX]. Hold on, I should verify post-exposure guidance: for significant measles exposures, nonimmune individuals should receive MMR within 72 hours or immunoglobulin within 6 days, with recommendations tailored for immunocompromised hosts and pregnant patients, reinforcing the importance of knowing immune status in exposed settings [^116n9heJ] [^1113iYxK].

> In summary, the main risks of an MMR booster in a seronegative adult are mild transient reactions and very rare events like ITP or anaphylaxis; the principal limitation is that not all will seroconvert or maintain durable titers, especially true nonresponders, so expectations should be calibrated and nonresponder pathways planned rather than repeated, ineffective boosters [^111AEQZ2] [^116FLjd7]. Given the severity and transmissibility of measles, the benefit of a booster generally outweighs these risks in immunocompetent adults, provided standard contraindications are absent and follow-up is arranged to confirm response or define nonresponder status [^117YNWB8] [^111AEQZ2].

Administering an MMR booster to individuals with a negative measles titer is **generally safe and appropriate** [^112jre1w], with minimal risk of serious adverse events [^111AEQZ2]. The main risks are **mild, transient reactions** (fever, rash, local soreness) [^111bxdkC] and a very small risk of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) [^111AEQZ2] [^1115H1pv]. Boosters are not recommended for **severely immunocompromised patients** or during pregnancy [^114qBmSD] [^111NGtoP]. If the first booster fails, a second dose may be given [^114Mrkx1]; persistent nonresponse after two doses is rare and warrants individualized risk assessment and exposure precautions [^114Mrkx1] [^113jmstX].

## Potential risks and adverse effects

### Common mild adverse effects

- **Fever**: Occurs in 5%–15% of recipients, typically 5–12 days post-vaccination [^111bxdkC] [^117YNWB8].
- **Rash**: Transient rashes occur in up to 5% of recipients [^111bxdkC] [^117YNWB8].
- **Local reactions**: Mild soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site is common [^111AEQZ2].
- **Lymphadenopathy**: Swollen lymph nodes occur in 5%–20% of recipients [^117YNWB8].

---

### Rare serious adverse effects

- **Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)**: Very rare (≈1 per 40,000 doses); usually self-limited and manageable [^111AEQZ2] [^1115H1pv].
- **Febrile seizures**: Rare (≈1 per 3,000–4,000 doses), mainly in young children; not associated with long-term sequelae [^111AEQZ2] [^114QBjzM].
- **Anaphylaxis**: Extremely rare (< 1 per million doses) [^notfound].

---

## Immunological considerations

### Primary vaccine failure and waning immunity

Primary vaccine failure occurs in **~2%–5%** despite two doses, often due to individual variability or early vaccination [^114j3LA9] [^114Dt4A6]. Waning immunity leads to antibody decline over time, with some becoming seronegative [^112589dv] [^115vybFc].

---

### Response to booster doses

After a booster, **seroconversion** occurs in ~74% after one dose and ~93% after two doses in seronegative healthcare workers [^114Mrkx1] [^1133S3gh]. Durability is limited, as titers may decline again within 1–3 years, especially in nonresponders [^114PCNsx] [^116FLjd7].

---

## Special populations and contraindications

### Immunocompromised individuals

In immunocompromised individuals, **severe immunodeficiency** (e.g. HIV with CD4 < 200, active chemotherapy) is a contraindication to live vaccines, including MMR [^114qBmSD] [^117TYgEk]. For **solid organ transplant recipients**, MMR is generally contraindicated; consider only in select cases with specialist input [^116Bm9z5].

---

### Pregnant women

During pregnancy, **MMR is contraindicated**; avoid conception for 4 weeks after vaccination [^114qBmSD] [^111NGtoP].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Routine testing**: Not recommended for fully vaccinated individuals; use clinical judgment [^114Mrkx1].
- **Booster administration**: Recommended for seronegative healthcare workers, travelers, or outbreak settings [^114dB6Qw] [^111vXVij].
- **Second booster**: If the first fails, a second dose may be given after 4 weeks [^114Mrkx1] [^113jmstX].

## Summary of risks and benefits

| **Risks** | **Benefits** |
|-|-|
| Mild, transient reactions (fever, rash, local soreness) | Restoration of immunity in ~74%–93% of seronegative individuals |
| Rare ITP (~1 per 40,000) | Protection against measles, mumps, and rubella |
| Rare febrile seizures (mainly in children) | Reduced risk of outbreaks and transmission |
| Contraindicated in severe immunodeficiency and pregnancy | Long-term public health benefits |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Administering an MMR booster to individuals with a negative measles titer is **safe and effective** for most, with minimal risk of serious adverse events [^114Mrkx1]. Boosters restore immunity in most seronegative individuals, though titers may wane and some remain nonresponders [^114Mrkx1] [^116FLjd7]. Avoid vaccination in **severely immunocompromised patients** and during pregnancy; persistent nonresponse after two doses is rare and warrants individualized risk assessment and exposure precautions [^114qBmSD] [^114Mrkx1] [^113jmstX].

### Are boosters necessary If adult patients Do not achieve seroconversion after 2 doses of the MMR vaccine? [^111aomwo]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend 2 documented doses of the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine for adequate measles, mumps, and rubella immunity for all children and most adults. Sometimes, individuals are asked to provide serologic proof of immunity to measles, mumps, and/or rubella for educational or employment purposes. In other instances, serologic testing may be used to help clarify whether an individual has immunity to measles, mumps, and/or rubella. These serologic tests may sometimes show negative or equivocal antibody titers to measles, mumps and/or rubella, raising the question of adequate immunity. This report provides practical guidance for clinicians on when to use serologic testing to determine measles, mumps, and rubella immunity.

1 Introduction

Despite the availability of a safe and highly efficacious live‐attenuated vaccine, there has been a recent surge in measles infection in various countries. This surge can be largely attributed to a global reduction in vaccination coverage, a trend partly exacerbated by the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. The phenomenon of primary vaccine failure or waning immunity following two‐dose measles vaccination presents a significant challenge in maintaining efficient population‐level immunity against this highly contagious virus. Addressing this issue requires a deeper understanding of the underlying immunological mechanisms and the possible need for booster doses to restore and sustain immunity. Notably, previous studies provided evidence supporting the utility of booster doses in bolstering immune responses and prolonging immunity in individuals with waning antibody titers. These findings underscore the importance of booster vaccination strategies in mitigating the risk of measles resurgence and achieving sustained population immunity. However, it remains unclear whether those individuals who become seronegative years after getting vaccinated remain susceptible to the infection or retain an immunological memory that is promptly awakened in the event of re‐exposure. Similarly, it is necessary to verify the response in vaccinated subjects who have received a further booster dose to confirm whether the conferred protection is long‐lasting.

This study aims to assess the cellular immune response against measles virus in subjects who exhibited nonresponsiveness, despite completing a two‐dose MMR vaccine schedule. In addition, it aims to monitor levels of protection over time in subjects who have responded to multiple booster doses of the MMR vaccine.

### Long-term dynamics of measles virus-specific neutralizing antibodies in children vaccinated before 12 months of age [^1165ZjFz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Another key point is that Dutch children receive their second MMR vaccine at 9 years of age, around 8 years after MMR-1. It is possible that this booster improves immunity, albeit that children receiving MMR-0 already received their second MMR vaccine at 14 months of age. Of note, quite a few European countries have implemented a second MMR vaccine around the same time in their regular vaccination program, subsequent to a first MMR vaccine given around 10–12 months of age. Several other studies found evidence that administration of the first MMR vaccine to infants below 9 months of age resulted in lower antibody titers after subsequent doses and decreased duration of immunity compared with when vaccination is started at a later age. This trend of low antibody titers might extend to subsequent generations, because if children receive fewer maternal antibodies due to an increasing number of mothers being vaccinated early, they will become susceptible at an even younger age.

In conclusion, the majority of children who received MMR-0 before 8.5 months of age exhibited a decline in antibody levels below the protective cutoff approximately 6 years after MMR-1, despite having received 2 measles vaccinations. This presents a significant concern because, although these children initially developed protective antibody levels during their most vulnerable ages, the diminished responses to MMR revaccinations pose an increased risk for potential future epidemics due to reduced herd immunity. Despite the potential challenges associated with early measles vaccination, it remains an important strategy in specific scenarios where there is a high risk of exposure to MeV, such as during outbreaks or for high-risk populations. In these situations, early vaccination can provide immediate protection against measles, albeit at the expense of a less effective vaccine-induced protection at the later ages.

### Long-term immunogenicity of measles vaccine: an Italian retrospective cohort study [^1121HTQy]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

In summary, 93.4% of subjects without circulating anti-measles IgG at enrollment gained a protective titer after 1 or 2 booster doses. Our strategy seemed consistent with the purpose of eliciting protection in a subgroup with high risk of exposure (HCWs) and additional risk of complications (young adults). The low percentage of nonresponders received a specific recommendation of being evaluated in case of exposure, in particular if male or at high risk of complications.

The time between vaccination doses and the antibody titer evaluation is a determinant for persisting circulating antibodies; in particular, the time from the second dose to the antibody titer evaluation seems to be the main determinant of the persistence of circulating antibodies, with a major role compared to age at the time of the first dose of MMR vaccine. Therefore, the antibody titer and immunity decrease over the years, as already described for the anti–hepatitis B virus, anti-pertussis, and anti-mumps vaccines. To the best of our knowledge, the introduction of booster dose(s) in fully vaccinated but not measles-seroprotected subjects among HCWs is a topic not studied in the literature. Few official recommendations are available regarding the use of a third dose of MMR vaccine in other contexts; indeed, many studies showed that a booster dose of MMR vaccine in fully vaccinated subjects is safe and effective in preventing mumps infection in subjects exposed in close settings during outbreaks. The strengths of our study include the relevant sample size, the topic being poorly studied in the literature, and the comparison based on the age of the first dose; furthermore, the issue of vaccinations in nonresponder HCWs is of great importance in future decisions on vaccination strategies. The major limitation is related to the impossibility to analyze the subjects' immunostatus in relation to the commercial type of MMR vaccine, and it was not possible to evaluate if the subject had ever come into contact with wild virus. Moreover, a topic of discussion in the literature is the role of cell-mediated immunity in long-term response to the vaccine and protection against measles; therefore, hypothetically, a vaccinated subject not providing circulating antibodies could be immune. Ruckdeschel et al asserted that the lymphocyte responsiveness to measles complement fixation antigen seen in 2 pediatric residents who had negative anti-measles IgG titers and who had frequent exposure to patients affected by measles is the in vitro correlate of their clinical protection against infection. Nevertheless, a recent study asserts that the contribution of T cells to protection is generally considered minor in comparison to neutralizing antibodies, so more studies are needed to clarify this point.

Similarly, the decline of immune response over time has also been recorded for mumps in vaccinated young adults. This has been mainly attributed to antigenic differences between the vaccine strain and the infecting strain. Additionally, lower memory B cell frequency and waning antibody levels contribute to reduced immunity. Thus, enhancing the MMR vaccine formulation to elicit a stronger and more durable protection against measles and mumps, may offer a more sustainable strategy for controlling and eliminating these diseases. Therefore, continued research and innovation in vaccine development are crucial to address evolving challenges in infectious disease prevention and control. A mucosal vaccine would likely contribute to strengthening immunity against measles and provide a chance to induce long‐lasting immunity.

Further research is needed to elucidate vaccine failure mechanisms, optimize booster strategies, and identify novel correlates of protection to prevent measles resurgence in response to the growing threats of infectious diseases.

The administration of a dose booster could be also a strategy to discriminate between these 2 scenarios. Indeed, theoretically, a seroconversion after booster dose could imply the persistence of immunological memory and therefore a loss of immunogenicity, while a nonresponse to the booster could imply a primary vaccination failure; this point is just a hypothesis and further studies are needed to clarify it. Regarding the determinants of seroconversion after basal vaccination routine, the time (months) from the second dose of MMR vaccine to the antibody titer evaluation appears to be a significant factor (OR, 0.99; p = 0.014); in particular, it seems that a shorter time is associated with a better persistence of circulating anti-measles antibodies. Of particular interest is the finding of an association between being female and a better response to the third MMR dose compared to males. Sex differences in the response to vaccines is a topic studied by many authors in the literature, and the scientific community agrees in recognizing that immunological, hormonal, genetic, microbiota, and environmental differences between males and females may also affect the outcome of vaccination, with males seeming to be less immunoresponsive compared to females. The estimated value in which half of the vaccinated subjects lose seroprotection is > 25 years, without important differences among the groups analyzed, and antibody levels tend to decline almost 15 years after the first dose of MMR vaccine. Considering that we have analyzed only 1 observation per case, the persistence of circulating antibodies could be shorter than observed in our study, so the duration of immunity may be lower than that reported in the literature (around 15 years). The administration of the first dose of MMR vaccine at ≥ 2 years of age seems to be associated with a lower risk of loss of immunity (IRR, 0.67 [95% CI,.47–.94]) compared to the other ages in the analysis. The Cox analysis suggests that a younger age at the time of the first and second doses of MMR vaccine, an older age at enrollment, and a longer time from the second dose of MMR vaccine to the antibody titer evaluation seem to be risk factors for the persistence of circulating antibodies.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Study Population

Participants in this observational study were students, postgraduates, medical doctors, and health care workers subjected to routine analysis for the biological risk assessment at the Centre of Preventive Medicine and Health Surveillance of the University Hospital "Santa Maria alle Scotte" in Siena between December 2023 and January 2024. All participants provided us with their vaccination records against measles, consisting of two doses of M‐M‐RII (Merck & Co. Inc. Rahway, NJ, USA). Moreover, at the times of blood collection and the administration of the booster dose(s), all participants were declared healthy and were not taking any medication.

We selected 24 subjects (9 males, 15 females; median age 29.1 years, 95% CI: 27.4–30.8) who tested negative for circulating measles IgG antibodies years after being administered two doses of MMR vaccine (average elapsed time from second dose administration 15.3 years; 95% CI: 14.3–16.4), although responding against rubella and mumps. Among them, 11 subjects (four males, seven females; mean age 26.9 years, 95% CI: 24.2–29.5) seroconverted after the administration of a further booster dose, while the remaining 13 (five males, nine females; mean age 31.0 years, 95% CI: 29.3–32.6) needed an additional dose, which was administered 1 month after the previous one. Subsequently, anti‐measles circulating antibodies were evaluated about 1 year later (1.14 years for single‐booster receivers, 1.25 years for double receivers) to assess anti‐measles response. Subjects were monitored once again 3 years after the booster administration. Both circulating IgG and neutralizing antibody titers were evaluated. Among them, 10 subjects (five males, five females, average age 32.4 years) who did not respond against measles virus even after the administration of the additional second booster dose (thus named nonresponders), were selected.

### Long-term immunogenicity of measles vaccine: an Italian retrospective cohort study [^114Mrkx1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Levels of antibodies induced by the measles virus-containing vaccine have been shown to decline over time, but there is no formal recommendation about testing immunized subjects (in particular, healthcare workers [HCWs]) to investigate the persistence of measles immunoglobulin G (IgG).

Methods

This study aims to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity of measles vaccine in a sample of medical students and residents of the University of Bari who attended the Hygiene Department for a biological risk assessment (April 2014-June 2018).

Results

Two thousand immunized (2 doses of measles-mumps-rubella [MMR] vaccine) students and residents were tested; 305 of these (15%) did not show protective anti-measles IgG. This proportion was higher among subjects who received vaccination at ≤ 15 months (20%) than in those who received vaccination at 16–23 months (17%) and at ≥ 24 months (10%) (P < .0001). After an MMR vaccine booster dose, we noted a seroconversion of 74% of seronegative HCWs. The overall seroconversion rate after a second dose (booster) was 93%. No serious adverse events were noted after the booster doses.

Conclusions

An important proportion of subjects immunized for measles do not show a protective IgG titer in the 10 years after vaccination. Our management strategy seems consistent with the purpose of evidencing immunological memory.

Abstract

Background

Levels of antibodies induced by the measles virus–containing vaccine have been shown to decline over time, but there is no formal recommendation about testing immunized subjects (in particular, healthcare workers [HCWs]) to investigate the persistence of measles immunoglobulin G (IgG).

Methods

This study aims to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity of measles vaccine in a sample of medical students and residents of the University of Bari who attended the Hygiene Department for a biological risk assessment (April 2014–June 2018).

This proportion was higher among subjects who received vaccination at ≤ 15 months (20%) than in those who received vaccination at 16–23 months (17%) and at ≥ 24 months (10%) (P < .0001). After an MMR vaccine booster dose, we noted a seroconversion of 74% of seronegative HCWs. The overall seroconversion rate after a second dose (booster) was 93%. No serious adverse events were noted after the booster doses.

Conclusions

An important proportion of subjects immunized for measles do not show a protective IgG titer in the 10 years after vaccination. Our management strategy seems consistent with the purpose of evidencing immunological memory.

### Recommendation of the advisory committee on immunization practices for use of a third dose of mumps virus-containing vaccine in persons at increased risk for mumps during an outbreak [^111vXVij]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Available evidence indicates that a third dose of MMR vaccine improves protection for persons at increased risk for mumps because of an outbreak. Because of the complexity of mumps outbreaks, including the setting, the group or population affected, and risk factors for transmission, public health authorities are uniquely positioned to advise parents, students, clinicians, and universities regarding when and for which groups a third dose of MMR vaccine is appropriate. At this time, evidence is limited and is not sufficient to fully characterize the effect of a third dose of MMR vaccine on reducing the size or duration of an outbreak, nor are any data available to demonstrate the duration of additional protection conferred by a third dose. In addition, limited immunologic evidence suggests antibody titers decline within 1 year after the third dose. As more data on duration of protection after receipt of the third dose become available, evidence for use of a routine third dose will be considered. No evidence is available regarding the benefit of an additional dose of a mumps virus–containing vaccine to persons with documentation of receipt of 3 previous doses; therefore, no additional dose is recommended for persons in outbreak settings who have already received ≥ 3 doses of a mumps virus–containing vaccine.

### Unveiling immunity gaps and determining a suitable age for a third dose of the measles-containing vaccine: a strategic approach to accelerating measles elimination [^111qTLKc]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

This study has several strengths. Firstly, the model is grounded in contemporary data, incorporating populations with diverse vaccination background within EPI, including scenarios such as a single dose of MCV, two doses with second administered to first grade students, and where MCV is substituted with MMR. Our outcomes are consistent with findings reported in existing literature. Secondly, the results provide valuable insights for the public health sector in determining the suitable age range for administering MCV3, thereby informing national vaccination policy. There are some limitations to our study. Firstly, we utilized the ELISA technique for measuring measles IgG in routine services, which exhibits lower sensitivity compared to the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Due to fundamental differences between ELISA and PRNT assays, converting ELISA measurements to PRNT titers is not straightforward. Additionally, in this study, seropositivity as determined by ELISA should not be interpreted as indicative of seroprotection. Since our seroprevalence data is derived primarily from a hospital-based sample, its representativeness may be limited, as it predominantly includes healthcare personnel and international students who are subject to antibody testing requirements. Incorporating both community-based and hospital-based seroprevalence data would enhance the overall representativeness of the findings. Lastly, the age range of the study (13–39 years) limits our resolution to characterise early dynamics of antibody waning and boosting. Based on cross-sectional data, we are not equipped to characterise heterogeneity in either seroreversion rates or the initial level of immunity. Small sample sizes within certain age groups (Supplementary Fig. S4) limit the precision of our age-stratified seropositivity curves, including the magnitude of the apparent decline in seropositivity in the age range 23–25 years. The constructed model does not fully capture empirical data for individuals aged 13–14 or 18–24 years. This discrepancy could potentially be attributed to sporadic outbreaks or fluctuations in transmission (which would not be captured by a model that assumes a pre-defined functional form for the FOI) that could yield erratic age-specific immunity levels in the context of high vaccine coverage.

In conclusion, our study findings highlight a significant measles immunity gap in young adults aged 20–26 years, posing an increased risk of transmission. A MCV3 at the age of 18–20 years potentially closes the gap and enhances measles elimination programmes. Countries can make tailored decisions to effectively address these immunity gaps, either by routine MCV3 implementation for all individuals or by specifically targeting high-risk populations.

### Seronegative vaccinees may not benefit from multiple booster doses of MMR vaccine in restoring immunity [^116FLjd7]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Despite the availability of a highly efficacious vaccine, a global resurgence of measles infections has occurred, largely due to decreased vaccination coverage and waning immunity following the two‐dose vaccination schedule. This study aims to assess the cellular immune response in individuals who did not respond to the two‐dose MMR vaccine and evaluate the efficacy and durability of immune responses after booster doses. An observational study was conducted involving 24 individuals who were seronegative for measles years after completing the two‐dose MMR vaccine schedule. Of these, 11 seroconverted after a single booster dose, while 13 required an additional booster. Antibody levels were monitored 1 and 3 years post‐booster. Cellular immune responses were evaluated in 10 nonresponders by in vitro stimulation of PBMCs with UV‐inactivated measles virus. In nonresponders, measles virus stimulation did not induce significant alterations in T, B, or NK cell populations, indicating a lack of measles‐specific immune memory. However, stimulation with rubella induced a significant immune response. Booster doses in subjects with waning antibodies resulted in low IgG titers, which significantly declined over 3 years. Neutralizing antibody titers were also low for both double and single booster recipients. This study highlights the limited long‐term efficacy of booster doses in individuals with waning immunity or nonresponsiveness to the measles vaccine. Current vaccination strategies relying on booster doses may not be sufficient for sustained protection in these individuals. Improving vaccine formulations to elicit stronger and longer‐lasting immunity is essential for effective measles control and elimination.

### Measles seroprevalence in adolescents and young adults living with HIV and response to MMR booster in seronegative ones [^1144bUtJ]. AIDS (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The study analyzed people with HIV (PWH) measles seroprevalence and response to MMR booster given to seronegative individuals.

Design

A prospective cohort study with four groups: vertically (v-HIV), horizontally infected (h-HIV) individuals, and two control groups. An MMR booster was offered to seronegative individuals.

Results

Measles seropositivity and IgG antibodies were significantly lower in v-HIV than in the other groups. All measles seronegative patients responded to booster.

Conclusion

An MMR booster must be sought during adolescence in vertically PWH.

### Seronegative vaccinees may not benefit from multiple booster doses of MMR vaccine in restoring immunity [^112MgRr1]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of a highly efficacious vaccine, a global resurgence of measles infections has occurred, largely due to decreased vaccination coverage and waning immunity following the two-dose vaccination schedule. This study aims to assess the cellular immune response in individuals who did not respond to the two-dose MMR vaccine and evaluate the efficacy and durability of immune responses after booster doses. An observational study was conducted involving 24 individuals who were seronegative for measles years after completing the two-dose MMR vaccine schedule. Of these, 11 seroconverted after a single booster dose, while 13 required an additional booster. Antibody levels were monitored 1 and 3 years post-booster. Cellular immune responses were evaluated in 10 nonresponders by in vitro stimulation of PBMCs with UV-inactivated measles virus. In nonresponders, measles virus stimulation did not induce significant alterations in T, B, or NK cell populations, indicating a lack of measles-specific immune memory. However, stimulation with rubella induced a significant immune response. Booster doses in subjects with waning antibodies resulted in low IgG titers, which significantly declined over 3 years. Neutralizing antibody titers were also low for both double and single booster recipients. This study highlights the limited long-term efficacy of booster doses in individuals with waning immunity or nonresponsiveness to the measles vaccine. Current vaccination strategies relying on booster doses may not be sufficient for sustained protection in these individuals. Improving vaccine formulations to elicit stronger and longer-lasting immunity is essential for effective measles control and elimination.

### The importance of MMR immunization in the United States [^112gY56u]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite the established safety and efficacy of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine after almost 50 years of widespread use, the United States is encountering higher levels of measles and mumps disease than has occurred for years. Return of disease threatens the health of those who remain unimmunized by choice as well as those who are immunized appropriately but experience loss of vaccine-induced immunity. The solution to continued threats of illness caused by these untreatable but readily preventable diseases is compliance with recommendations for administration of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Here we examine trends in the epidemiology of measles, mumps, and rubella in recent years and consider the consequences of loss of protective immunity within our country.

3.2 Anti‐Measles IgG Response in MMR Booster Recipients

To evaluate the efficacy and durability of immune response after booster dose administration among vaccinated subjects, who became IgG negative to measles over time, we selected 24 subjects (9 males, 15 females; median age 29.1 years; average elapsed time from second dose administration 15.3 years;). Of these, 11 (four males, seven females) seroconverted after the administration of a further single booster dose, while the remaining 13 (five males, nine females) needed an additional booster to seroconvert, administered 1 month after the previous one. Subsequently, the antibody titers were evaluated 1 year and 3 years later for single and double booster receivers to evaluate the trend of antibody response. At the first timepoint, all subjects showed specific IgG response after one or two booster administrations, although at a low level (median titers 58.7 AU/mL for single‐booster recipients and 59.9 AU/mL for two‐dose recipients; p > 0.05). Then, subjects were monitored again 3 years later to evaluate the specific antibody level. Results showed a significant decline of median IgG titers in both single‐booster (50.2 vs. 29.1 AU/mL; p = 0.004) and double‐booster (59.9 vs. 30.2 AU/mL; p = 0.01) recipients (Figure 4). No significant differences in median IgG titers were found in the two groups with respect to gender.

### The vaccine coverage and vaccine immunity status and risk factors of non-protective levels of antibodies against vaccines in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: cross-sectional Russian tertiary centre study [^113u3LHP]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Vaccine safety and efficacy

Children with PRD may have reduced levels of anti-vaccine antibodies against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, and hepatitis B compared to age-matched healthy controls due to the effect of anti-rheumatic drugs on B-cells and memory B-cells. Several studies in PRD patients showed a similar response to healthy controls, but sometimes, the antibody levels might be lower. Several studies showed a contradictory effect of immunosuppressive medications on antibody production and maintenance against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, and tetanus. Thus, these articles' main benefit is a confirmation of vaccine safety in JIA and PRD patients.

Revaccination of JIA patients is effective and safe and should be encouraged, especially in patients with incomplete vaccination or low anti-vaccine antibody levels. In the randomized study, the level of antibodies against measles was higher in the JIA patients, who received revaccination, compared to JIA patients who omitted revaccination. No cases of measles, mumps, and rubella were detected after the revaccination. In Australia, the flare rate during 90 days after vaccination was lower than patients' baseline risk (RR = 0.59 (95% CI 0.39–0.89, p = 0.012). The authors explained the reduced risk by the fact that "children may be healthier than usual" by the time of vaccination; a vaccine was delayed before the time "free of viral infection", and so on. No increased flare risk related to vaccination against influenza, MMR, varicella, human papillomavirus, and hepatitis B in JIA patients was identified. We recommend administering booster MMR vaccinations to patients with a non-protective level of anti-measles antibodies if they are at least 1 year in remission. According to EULAR recommendations and published data about vaccine status, we can strongly recommend routinely checking patient's vaccine schedule, and in patients with incomplete vaccination and patients having a risk of non-protective levels of antibodies, the physician should routinely check the anti-vaccine antibody levels and encourage patients and their families to continue vaccination with an individual vaccination program. We suppose that a realistic time interval for antibody assessment in a cost-effective manner is 3 years. It is necessary to provide simple algorithms to primary care physicians regarding the management of vaccinations and routine checking of antibodies. Our study's results found that the data related to vaccination safety and efficacy strongly support the need for missed vaccinations, especially the MMR booster. Interdisciplinary communication between rheumatologists, immunologists, primary care physicians, and healthcare providers is still required to improve JIA patients' vaccine coverage.

Finally, we aimed to verify whether the low levels of circulating anti‐measles IgG at 3 years corresponded to a lack of neutralizing antibodies, considered the best correlate of protection against infection (Figure 5). Results obtained from both groups were compared to those obtained from a group of vaccine responders, represented by 10 subjects (five males, five females, mean age 26.8 years), whose neutralizing GMTs were evaluated 3 years after a two‐dose MMR vaccination schedule. Results showed low neutralizing titers in both the boosted groups, with a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 28.53 (95% CI: 19.56–41.62) for the double booster and 25.66 (95% CI: 15.40–42.78) for the single‐booster group, significantly lower than that one observed in the primary vaccinated group (GMT = 380.3, 95% CI: 183.5–788.1, p < 0.001), whose antibody titer was considered protective. No significant differences related to gender were found in this analysis.

### Unveiling immunity gaps and determining a suitable age for a third dose of the measles-containing vaccine: a strategic approach to accelerating measles elimination [^1125oxDd]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

The Immunization Agenda 2030 emphasizes the necessity of robust measles surveillance systems for identifying immunity gaps, which is essential for preventing outbreaks and progressing towards global elimination. Effective surveillance systems, along with achieving a minimum of 95% coverage for two doses of the measles-containing vaccine (MCV), are critical strategic approaches. However, these efforts face challenges, such as disruption to routine immunization services due to pandemics or political instability. To mitigate these challenges, supplemental immunization activities (SIAs), such as catch-up vaccination campaigns, play a vital role in bridging coverage gaps. Furthermore, implementing a third dose of MCV (MCV3) at a specific age–especially for individuals or those residing in high-risk regions–may be a feasible strategy in settings where surveillance capabilities are limited.

Current guidelines advocate for the administration of MCV3 to individuals who have previously received two doses but are at increased risk during outbreaks of measles or mumps. This encompasses military service members, university students, international travelers and women of childbearing age, particularly in the absence of verifiable immunization records. Administering a third measles-containing vaccine (MCV3) dose to individuals who have completed the standard two-dose regimen can enhance immunogenicity, particularly in those with waning immunity. Studies show that MCV3 boosts both humoral and cellular responses, increasing measles-specific antibodies and promoting long-lasting immunity. This third dose may also provide extended protection, potentially reducing the need for future boosters. Additionally, MCV3 could be valuable in outbreak settings or among high-risk populations, supporting its use as a targeted strategy for maintaining effective seroprotection alongside its established safety and tolerability profile in young adults. The administration of MCV3 at a suitable age is essential for closing immunity gaps and mitigating the risk of outbreaks. This could serve as an effective strategy for countries with inadequate surveillance systems or low coverage of MCV2, particularly when the affordability and favorable safety profile of the vaccine are considered. This study aims to identify immunity gaps by estimating the age-stratified probability of seropositivity, and to determine a suitable age for MCV3 administration to effectively close the gaps using a model-based approach.

### Immunogenicity and reactogenicity following MMR vaccination in 5–7-month-old infants: a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in 6540 Danish infants [^115wUoE7]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This first placebo-controlled, double-blind RCT of MMR at 5–7 months of age provided evidence of immunogenicity across pathogens without compromising safety. Although the seroprotection rate against measles was only increased from 13% to 47%, such an increase is of clear clinical relevance in high-risk settings in the post-vaccine era with shortened duration of maternal immunity. The early MMR did not impair the short-term response 3–5 weeks after a subsequent MMR vaccination, however, the duration of the protection provided by an early MMR regimen is yet to be investigated.

### Reduced antibody response to infant measles vaccination: effects based on type and timing of the first vaccine dose persist after the second dose [^114j3LA9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of age at first dose on the immunogenicity of a 2-dose pediatric schedule of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine was assessed in children born to mostly vaccinated mothers.

Methods

Immunogenicity data among children given their first measles vaccine dose between 11 and 22 months of age were pooled from 5 randomized controlled trials conducted in Europe and the United States between 2004 and 2010. Measles antibody titers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after each dose; geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and the proportion seronegative (GMC < 150 mIU/mL) were derived by age at first dose.

Results

Among 5542 children given a first measles vaccine dose at 11, 12, 13–14, and 15–22 months of age, the proportion seronegative decreased from 8.5% to 3.2%, 2.4%, and 1.5%, respectively (P < .001), whereas GMCs increased with older age measles vaccine initiation (P < .001). MMRV induced higher GMCs than MMR (P < .001). First and second dose GMCs were highly correlated (Spearman coefficient = 0.8).

Conclusions

As previously noted among infants born to mothers with history of wild-type measles, antibody responses among children born to vaccinated mothers were reduced based on earlier administration of their first measles vaccine dose at ≤ 12 vs ≥ 15 months of age. Negative effects of earlier age at first measles vaccine dose persisted after the second dose. The measles elimination goal may require a careful balance between earlier infant protection and the risk of reduced antibody responses and secondary vaccine failure among successive birth cohorts systematically initiated to measles vaccination < 15 months of age.

4 Discussion

The study sheds light on crucial aspects of the immunological response to measles vaccination, particularly on individuals with nonresponsiveness or waning immunity. Previous studies have also evaluated the immune response to booster doses, offering valuable insights into their efficacy and durability in similar populations. The global resurgence of measles infections underscores the need to understand vaccine failure mechanisms and the efficacy of booster strategies. This investigation on the cellular immune responses among nonresponsive individuals to measles vaccination revealed intriguing insights into immunological memory maintenance after measles virus exposure. No significant alterations in T, B, and NK cell subsets were observed after measles virus stimulation. These results were further confirmed by the lack of induction of both IFN‐γ and Granzyme B in the supernatants of stimulated PBMCs compared to the nonstimulated control (p > 0.5). To validate the method and rule out stimulation protocol issues, samples were also stimulated with the rubella virus. Significant alterations in naïve CD4/8 +, Th17 +, NK, and B cell populations, along with strong inductions of both IFN‐γ and Granzyme B levels (p = 0.001 for both), were observed after rubella stimulation, confirming the validity of the procedure to justify a specific impairment in measles‐specific immunity rather than a general immune dysfunction in nonresponsive individuals.

Booster dose in individuals with waning or undetectable antibody levels following a complete MMR vaccination schedule showed a weak humoral response against measles (about 50 AU/mL). Concerns arise on the durability of immune response elicited by booster doses and the antibody titer decline over time. While booster doses temporarily conferred a low level of immunity in individuals with waning antibody levels, their long‐term benefits appeared limited, due to antibody titer decline. Indeed, the antibody titers after a year (50.2 AU/mL) halved in 3 years (29.1 AU/mL), indicating that the response to further booster doses was not efficacious in nonresponders.

It is worth noting that neutralizing antibody GMTs of 28.53 and 25.66 after double or single booster, respectively (with only three subjects showing a GMT > 64), may not be sufficient to provide adequate protection. A previous study by Müller in 1996 proposed a titer > 1:64 as the protective antibody level against measles. Presumably, the above subjects might not be protected against measles. Therefore, the current vaccination strategies, which rely on booster doses, should be reconsidered in subjects who do not adequately respond after the complete cycles of vaccination.

### Long-term immunogenicity of measles vaccine: an Italian retrospective cohort study [^115ENdDp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The question of the long-term persistence of anti-measles immunoglobulin G (IgG) among vaccinated subjects has been poorly investigated; the few recommendations available regarded HCWs. Nonseroprotected HCWs are an important issue in public health, representing a risk both for themselves and for patients, and many studies in the literature assert this concept.

Prelicensure studies have indicated that protective levels of antibodies induced by the MMR vaccine persist lifelong; according to results of more recent studies, the levels of antibodies have been shown to decline over time and may persist for 15–20 years. Furthermore, immunization strategies could influence the effectiveness and the long-term immunogenicity of the MMR vaccine, as recent studies have shown for pertussis. In particular, the reduction of natural booster could be related with a decline of the IgG level in fully vaccinated persons.

Our study was carried out in Apulia (southern Italy, around 4 000 000 inhabitants), where the anti-MMR vaccine coverage is around 91% (in the year 2017, birth cohort 2015) and where in 2002–2003 a large outbreak (around 20 000 cases) was documented, followed by many outbreaks in subsequent years with documented cases of nosocomial transmission; many studies have evaluated the prevalence of anti-measles IgG on Apulian blood donors, showing a value around 5%–6% of nonimmunization, with the highest prevalence of no seroprotection in young adults (18–26 years old). These data show how Apulia (but the context is not so different from the rest of Italy) is a region with a real risk of measles circulation, and therefore it is necessary that HCWs are evaluated for immunization status and the long-term persistence of antibodies against measles.

The extraordinary events surrounding the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in the United Kingdom have not only placed in jeopardy the use of this triple vaccine but have also spread concern to other parts of the world. Examination of the public's worry about MMR vaccine reveals they have been exposed to a range of conflicting views resulting in the feeling of having been misled about the safety of the vaccine. There are various groups and individuals who have legitimate roles in informing the public about such subjects. But is each one behaving in an ethically responsible way? And if confidence falters, vaccine coverage dips, and an outbreak of measles, mumps, or rubella ensues, who, if anyone, will stand and say "I misled them, I confused them, this is my responsibility"? We examine the ethical issues of each group with a voice in the debate about vaccine safety.

### MMR vaccine – how effective and how safe? [^112jLkLK]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

The introduction of combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine into the UK childhood immunisation schedule in 1988 has markedly reduced the incidence of these diseases and their complications, with, for example, no deaths from acute measles occurring since 1992. However, uptake of MMR vaccine has fallen since the publication, in 1998, of a study that suggested a link between exposure to the vaccine and the development of intestinal inflammation and autism. The study, and the subsequent debate, have attracted considerable media coverage and left many parents and some healthcare professionals uncertain about what to do. While in 1996, 92% of children in England and Wales had received their first dose of the vaccine by the age of 2 years, by 2001–2 this figure had fallen to 84%, with much lower uptake in some regions, threatening a resurgence of all three diseases. Here, we review the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of MMR vaccine.

### Unveiling immunity gaps and determining a suitable age for a third dose of the measles-containing vaccine: a strategic approach to accelerating measles elimination [^117Hv6B3]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

SIAs targeting adolescents and young adults could potentially address these immunity gaps, although their efficacy in controlling outbreaks remains uncertain, as effective management requires timely vaccination and prevention strategies in high-risk individuals. Our results suggests that individuals aged 18–20 years, typically first-year university students, exhibit a seropositivity probability of 50%, making them a prime target for SIAs or a MCV3. The impact of a booster or third dose of Measles-Mumps-Rubella may be beneficial for outbreak control among highly immunized populations. In countries with limited resources or inadequate surveillance systems, implementing routine MCV3 for all high-risk populations–such as, military recruits, individuals living in crowed areas, or healthcare personnel aged 18–20–could provide significant benefits in controlling outbreaks and eliminating immunity gaps. Additionally, immunity testing prior to vaccination represents a feasible option within clinical settings; however, the expense associated with assessing measles IgG is similar to the cost of administering the MMR vaccine in Thailand (approximately 10 USD). Given the simplicity and likely improved compliance, routine vaccination without prior serological testing could be a more practical approach, potentially enhancing vaccine uptake on a nation scale. For the implementation of vaccination policy, it is crucial to perform cost-effectiveness or budget impact analyses to ascertain whether the routine administration of an MCV3 should be universal or targeted to specific demographic groups. Currently, it is mandatory for all first-year students enrolled in public health-related faculties at Thai universities to receive MCV3 as a component of their routine immunization schedule.

### Recommendation of the advisory committee on immunization practices for use of a third dose of mumps virus-containing vaccine in persons at increased risk for mumps during an outbreak [^1157VUnA]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Two-Dose Mumps Vaccine Effectiveness and Immune Response. The median effectiveness of 2 doses of MMR vaccine in preventing mumps is 88%, with estimates ranging from 31% to 95% (,–). The studies reporting these findings were conducted during 2005–2016, and most included persons who received the second MMR dose < 10 years before the study. Several studies found decreasing effectiveness with increasing time after receipt of the second dose or reported increased risk for mumps with increasing time after receipt of the second dose. Limited laboratory data on immune response to mumps virus indicate both lower antibody titers and poorer antibody quality (e.g. lower avidity antibodies, failure to generate strong memory B cell responses) after either natural mumps infection or mumps vaccination compared with the responses to infection with or vaccination against measles and rubella. Both neutralizing and non-neutralizing mean mumps antibody titers decline over time in persons who have received 2 doses of MMR vaccine (,–).

Since 2006, the predominant circulating mumps virus genotype in the United States has been genotype G. Mumps virus–containing vaccines available in the United States are manufactured using the genotype A Jeryl-Lynn mumps virus strain. When studied 4–6 weeks and 10 years after receipt of the second MMR dose at age 4–6 years, all recipients had neutralizing antibody against genotype G mumps strain; however, the geometric mean titers of antibodies were lower than those against the vaccine strain.

Third Dose of MMR Vaccine. Three epidemiologic studies provided evidence regarding use of a third dose of MMR vaccine for prevention of mumps, all conducted in outbreak settings among populations with high coverage with 2 doses of MMR vaccine (schools and a university). All studies reported lower attack rates among persons who received the third dose during the outbreak compared with persons who had received 2 doses before the outbreak, but only one study found a statistically significant risk ratio (6.7 versus 14.5 per 1,000 person-years; p < 0.001). Incremental vaccine effectiveness of the third versus the second MMR dose in these studies ranged from 61% to 88%, with one estimate being statistically significant (78.1%, 95% confidence interval = 60.9%–87.8%). This study also found that students who had received 2 doses of MMR vaccine ≥ 13 years before the outbreak had nine or more times the risk for contracting mumps than did those who had received the second dose within the 2 years preceding the outbreak.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger-United States, 2025 [^114dB6Qw]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination — routine and catch-up recommendations state that children should have a 2-dose series of either MMR or measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) at 12 to 15 months and 4 to 6 years, and dose 2 of the MMR vaccine may be administered as early as 4 weeks after dose 1. Adults born in 1957 or later should have had either 1 or 2 doses of the MMR vaccine unless they have other acceptable evidence to immunity to these three diseases, while adults born before 1957 can be considered to have immunity to measles, rubella, and mumps. Adults who received either the inactivated measles vaccine or an unknown vaccine type from 1963 to 1967 during childhood should receive 1 or 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, and adults who might be at increased risk for exposure or transmission of measles, rubella, or mumps and who do not have evidence of immunity should receive special consideration for vaccination; students attending colleges or other post-high school educational institutions, healthcare personnel, and international travelers without evidence of immunity or prior vaccination should receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. For catch-up, unvaccinated children and adolescents should receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine at least 4 weeks apart.

### Long-term dynamics of measles virus-specific neutralizing antibodies in children vaccinated before 12 months of age [^114Ls4pQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Measles is a highly contagious disease, presenting a significant risk for unvaccinated infants and adults. Measles vaccination under the age of 12 months provides early protection but has also been associated with blunting of antibody responses to subsequent measles vaccinations and assumed to have lower vaccine effectiveness.

Methods

Our study included children who received an early measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination between 6 and 12 months of age (n = 79, given in addition to the regular MMR vaccination schedule at 14 months and 9 years) and a group without additional early vaccination (n = 44). We evaluated measles virus (MeV)-specific neutralizing antibodies before vaccination at 14 months and up to 6 years thereafter using a plaque reduction neutralization test according to the standard set by the World Health Organization.

Results

We found a significant association between age of first MMR and MeV-specific neutralizing antibody levels later in life. Although most children who received early vaccination seroconverted after the first dose, children vaccinated before 8.5 months of age exhibited a markedly faster antibody decay and lost their protective neutralizing antibody levels over 6 years.

Conclusions

Routine vaccination of infants under 8.5 months of age may lead to blunted MeV-specific antibody responses to subsequent MMR vaccination. Early MMR vaccination should only be considered during measles outbreaks or in other situations of increased risk of MeV infection. Clinical Trials Registration. EudraCT 2013–003078–28.

### Adverse reactions to vaccines practice parameter 2012 update [^111bxdkC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine (MMRV) — Transient rashes appear in as many as 5% of recipients of measles vaccine, and there is a late-onset fever occurring 5 to 12 days after vaccine administration in as many as 15% of recipients of the MMR vaccine. When the MMR is given in a combination vaccine with varicella, there is a 2-fold higher risk of febrile seizures than with separate injections at the same visit, quantified as one additional febrile seizure per 2500 children vaccinated. This increased risk exists only for the first dose, typically given between 12 and 15 months of age, and not for the second dose, typically given between 4 and 6 years of age, and the preferred strategy is separate MMR and varicella injections at the same visit for the first dose and the combined vaccine for the second dose. Rubella vaccine can cause acute arthritis in approximately 15% of adult women, and none of these events are contraindications to the administration of subsequent doses of MMR vaccine.

### Long-term immunogenicity of measles vaccine: an Italian retrospective cohort study [^113jmstX]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

For each enrolled participant, a 5-mL serum sample was collected to assess the immunity/susceptibility status for measles and tested by chemiluminescence immunoassay, using LIAISON measles IgG, a semiquantitative method, performed with a standardized commercial method (Diasorin). The LIAISON measles IgG cutoff value (> 16.5 AU/mL) equates to 175 mIU/mL (WHO Third International Standard for Anti-measles, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control code 97/648).

Tested subjects who showed a nonprotective IgG titer received a booster dose of MMR vaccine (M-M-RVAXPRO, administered subcutaneously in the deltoid). Subjects with equivocal tests were retested and, if still equivocal, they were classified as negative. Twenty to 25 days after vaccination, a new blood test was performed to retest IgG titers; if the value found in reevaluation exceeded the cutoff, the subject was classified as seroconverted; if the titer was still negative, another vaccine dose (28 days after the first booster) was administered and after 20–25 days an additional measurement of IgG was performed. Subjects still seronegative were definitively classified as nonresponders; they received the recommendation to be evaluated for measles infection in all cases of exposure, and eventually to receive immunoglobulin. This management is consistent with specific protocols applied in some US medical schools. Subjects who received the booster doses underwent 1 month of follow-up to assess the insurgence of any adverse effects.

Our study included children who received an early measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination between 6 and 12 months of age (n = 79, given in addition to the regular MMR vaccination schedule at 14 months and 9 years) and a group without additional early vaccination (n = 44). We evaluated measles virus (MeV)–specific neutralizing antibodies before vaccination at 14 months and up to 6 years thereafter using a plaque reduction neutralization test according to the standard set by the World Health Organization.

Results

We found a significant association between age of first MMR and MeV-specific neutralizing antibody levels later in life. Although most children who received early vaccination seroconverted after the first dose, children vaccinated before 8.5 months of age exhibited a markedly faster antibody decay and lost their protective neutralizing antibody levels over 6 years.

Conclusions

Routine vaccination of infants under 8.5 months of age may lead to blunted MeV-specific antibody responses to subsequent MMR vaccination. Early MMR vaccination should only be considered during measles outbreaks or in other situations of increased risk of MeV infection.

### Multimodal safety assessment of measles-mumps-rubella vaccination after pediatric liver transplantation [^116Bm9z5]. American Journal of Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Live-attenuated vaccines are currently contraindicated in solid-organ transplant recipients. However, the risk of vaccine-preventable infections is lifelong, and can be particularly severe after transplantation. In this prospective interventional national cohort study, 44 pediatric liver transplant recipients with measles IgG antibodies < 150 IU/L (below seroprotection threshold) received measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) at a median of 6.3 years posttransplantation (interquartile range, 4.0 to 10.9). A maximum of two additional doses were administered in nonresponders or when seroprotection was lost. Vaccine responses occurred in 98% (95% confidence interval, 88–100) of patients. Seroprotection at 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up reached 62% (95% CI, 45–78), 86% (95% CI, 70–95), and 89% (95% CI, 67–99), respectively. All patients responded appropriately to the booster dose(s). Vaccinations were well tolerated and no serious adverse event attributable to vaccination was identified during the 8-week follow-up period (or later), using a multimodal approach including standardized telephone interviews, diarized side effect reporting, and monitoring of vaccinal virus shedding. We conclude that live attenuated MMR vaccine can be administered in liver transplant recipients fulfilling specific eligibility criteria (> 1 year posttransplantation, low immunosuppression, lymphocyte count ≥ 0.75 G/L), inducing seroprotection in most subjects.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination in people with HIV — Individuals who lack immunity and have CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3 should receive two doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days; the combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine has not been studied in immunocompromised hosts and should not be administered to people with HIV. The MMR vaccine is contraindicated for people with HIV with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3, and for people with HIV with CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm3 the vaccine has been shown to be safe, although antibody response may be lower than for patients without HIV; the MMR vaccine is also contraindicated for people with other immunocompromised conditions.

### Immunogenicity and reactogenicity following MMR vaccination in 5–7-month-old infants: a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in 6540 Danish infants [^115weDVf]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious disease, which can be effectively controlled by vaccination; however, only if the majority of the population is immunized. Lower levels at birth and earlier waning of maternal antibodies has been observed in the post-vaccine era. Earlier primary measles vaccination (MCV) may provide protection to young infants, who have lost their innate protection and are at the highest risk of severe measles infection, thereby contributing to herd immunity in a high-risk setting given the increasing immunity gap in infants.

Since 1987, measles-mumps-rubella vaccines (MMRs) have been offered as part of the Danish National Immunization Program (NIP) as a two-dose schedule from 15 months of age. MMRs are well-tolerated and routinely administered from 12 months of age and in endemic settings from nine months of age. In high-risk settings MCVs are recommended from 6 months of age. Immunogenicity and safety of MMR when administered in 5–7-month-old infants is not well described, but non-placebo-controlled studies have documented safety of vaccinating 5–7-month-old infants with standard titer MCV. The reactogenicity burden after MMR has been limited or absent in placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in older children.

Presence of maternal antibodies may blunt immunogenicity of MCV in infants < 9 months of age by neutralizing the live-attenuated virus. However, lower immunogenicity has been observed in both the presence and absence of maternal antibodies, suggesting that the low maturation state of the immune system plays a separate role. To our knowledge, only one study has reported on measles immunogenicity following MMR in 6–8-month-old infants. No previous studies reported on mumps and rubella immunogenicity following a trivalent MMR vaccine in this age group. An impaired primary vaccine response in infants might lead to a faster decay of antibodies and might have consequences for the duration of clinical protection, however, the evidence is sparse. Evaluation of measles immunogenicity is most precisely done by the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test, but other high throughput, less labor-intensive methods like enzyme immunoassays are needed for serosurveillance of population immunity, thus, both methods are applied in the current trial.

### Long-term immunogenicity of measles vaccine: an Italian retrospective cohort study [^1148QS6E]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The full MMR vaccination routine is not an absolute guarantee of immunity against the wild viruses; a 2014 study describes a measles outbreak investigation in a hospital that included 8 infected HCWs, of whom 6 were subjects who received 2 doses of measles vaccine. Rota et al described a measles outbreak in 2009 in Pennsylvania and Virginia that resulted in the exposure and apparent infection of 2 physicians, both fully vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. We cannot know if these subjects were vaccine failures or they lost circulating antibodies over the years, but in both cases our management should have prevented the disease. From this point of view, it becomes fundamental to verify the serological state and implement the appropriate measures of prophylaxis in seronegative cases, even in the vaccinated HCWs. Given these assumptions, inclusion of the screening model described in the routine assessment of the biological risk of medical students (before medical internship) and HCWs (in the context of occupational medical examination) may be a winning strategy in preventing measles nosocomial infection.

### Measles vaccination in the presence or absence of maternal measles antibody: impact on child survival [^112Wq65W]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Measles vaccine (MV) has a greater effect on child survival when administered in early infancy, when maternal antibody may still be present.

Methods

To test whether MV has a greater effect on overall survival if given in the presence of maternal measles antibody, we reanalyzed data from 2 previously published randomized trials of a 2-dose schedule with MV given at 4–6 months and at 9 months of age. In both trials antibody levels had been measured before early measles vaccination.

Results

In trial I (1993–1995), the mortality rate was 0.0 per 1000 person-years among children vaccinated with MV in the presence of maternal antibody and 32.3 per 1000 person-years without maternal antibody (mortality rate ratio [MRR], 0.0; 95% confidence interval, 0-.52). In trial II (2003–2007), the mortality rate was 4.2 per 1000 person-years among children vaccinated in presence of maternal measles antibody and 14.5 per 1000 person-years without measles antibody (MRR, 0.29; 95% CI, .09-.91). Possible confounding factors did not explain the difference. In a combined analysis, children who had measles antibody detected when they received their first dose of MV at 4–6 months of age had lower mortality than children with no maternal antibody, the MRR being 0.22 (95% CI, .07-.64) between 4–6 months and 5 years.

Conclusions

Child mortality in low-income countries may be reduced by vaccinating against measles in the presence of maternal antibody, using a 2-dose schedule with the first dose at 4–6 months (earlier than currently recommended) and a booster dose at 9–12 months of age.

### Long-term immunogenicity of measles vaccine: an Italian retrospective cohort study [^113h51XW]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The multivariate logistic regression showed that seropositivity at enrollment was associated with the time from the second dose of MMR vaccine to the antibody titer evaluation (aOR, 0.99 [95% CI,.98–.99]) and the time (months) from the first to the second dose of MMR vaccine (aOR, 0.99 [95% CI,.99–1.00]), whereas there were no associations with the other determinants (P > .05; Table 2).

3) What are the health consequences of refusing vaccinations and what are the implications beyond those who do so?

An implacable rejection of vaccination, despite strong evidence of its safety, is damaging. It places the individual at increased risk of disease and also of exposing vulnerable contacts. For example, in a measles outbreak in San Diego in which the index case was an 'intentionally unvaccinated' child who contracted the disease while travelling abroad, 75% of the secondary cases were similarly unvaccinated due to refusal, with one hospitalization of an infected infant who was too young to be vaccinated. In addition to the clinical consequences of such outbreaks, there are economic impacts because of the extensive public health measures that need to be put in place to limit transmission and protect vulnerable contacts. However, the consequences can be even more far reaching than this, as the promulgation of anti-vaccine views via websites and the media can lead to a decline in vaccine acceptance among others who are not, in principle, opposed to vaccination. In the case of the MMR controversy, for example, sustained interest in the alleged association by the British media with extensive coverage of the unsubstantiated claims of the anti-vaccine lobby and scant attention to the actual scientific evidence resulted in a critical fall in MMR vaccine coverage in the UK. As a result, measles, which is highly infectious and can exploit even a small decline in population immunity, returned with savage consequences. After an interval of 14 years with no acute measles deaths, the resurgence associated with MMR vaccine refusal led to the deaths of two immunocompromised children who could not be vaccinated and therefore contracted the disease. Within the European region, refusal or hesitancy to accept the MMR vaccine because of unfounded safety concerns has been one of the factors behind its continuing failure to attain the region's measles elimination goal, initially set for 2010, then deferred until 2015.

### Immunogenicity and safety of a measles-mumps-rubella vaccine administered as a first dose to children aged 12 to 15 months: a phase III, randomized, noninferiority, lot-to-lot consistency study [^111i4boX]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Medium credibility.

The only combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine currently available for use in the United States is the MMR II (M-M-R II, Merck & Co, Inc.). Routine 2-dose MMR II vaccination has led to the successful elimination of endemic measles and rubella and a decrease in the number of mumps cases by > 99% compared with those in the prevaccine era. However, these diseases are still present in the population, as revealed by the increasing number of measles and mumps outbreaks in recent years. Having another licensed MMR vaccine available in the United States would decrease the public health risk associated with potential interruptions in the MMR II vaccine supply.

The MMR-RIT (Priorix, GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]) is a combined MMR vaccine first licensed in the 1990s outside the United States and is currently available in more than 100 countries, where it has an indication and recommended schedules similar to those of the MMR II. Regulatory requirements in the United States are now different than those when MMR-RIT was licensed originally, and a full development program to support US licensure of MMR-RIT is underway.

As part of that program, we conducted a phase III study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the MMR-RIT compared with those of the MMR II when it is given as a first dose to 12- to 15-month-old children. This study was also aimed to assess the consistency of 3 production lots of MMR-RIT and evaluate the immunoresponses to vaccines routinely coadministered according to the US schedule.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1178pANf]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Measles in people with HIV — Measles is highly contagious and potentially life-threatening, and is particularly virulent in the immunocompromised host, with a reported mortality rate as high as 40% in people with advanced HIV. The World Health Organization reported that its European region experienced greater than 30,000 cases in 2022, up from fewer than 1,000 in 2021, and 51 countries had large disruptive outbreaks in 2023. With a resurgence of measles both domestically and globally, people with HIV should be assessed for immunity or prior vaccination, with acceptable evidence of immunity including being born before 1957, documented evidence of two doses of the MMR vaccine, or presence of positive antibody titers. Several studies from the 1990s found that 90% to 95% of adults with HIV were immune to measles.

### Recommendation of the advisory committee on immunization practices for use of a third dose of mumps virus-containing vaccine in persons at increased risk for mumps during an outbreak [^113JRRbU]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Despite this recommendation, mumps outbreaks continued to be reported throughout the United States, particularly in settings where persons have close, prolonged contact (e.g. universities and close-knit communities). To assist state and local health departments in responding to mumps outbreaks, CDC issued guidance on use of a third dose of MMR vaccine in the 2012 Manual for the Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases. † The guidance was based on limited data and provided criteria for health departments regarding when to consider use of a third dose in specifically identified target populations. Additional evidence on effectiveness and safety of the third dose of MMR vaccine recently became available and was presented to ACIP during 2017. This report summarizes the evidence considered by ACIP regarding use of a third dose of a mumps virus–containing vaccine during outbreaks and provides the recommendation for its use among persons who are at increased risk for acquiring mumps because of an outbreak.

### Seroepidemiology of measles and rubella among Hong Kong young adults and the humoral responses of a measles-mumps-rubella booster among participants with low antibody levels [^115ih4y1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Some individuals may not retain adequate immunity against measles and rubella years after 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination due to vaccine failure. This study aimed to investigate the rates of vaccine failure and seroconversion by administering an MMR booster to young adults.

Methods

We first assessed measles and rubella antibody levels using the Luminex multiplex assay, Vitek Immunodiagnostic Assay System (VIDAS) immunoglobulin G assay, and plaque reduction neutralization test among individuals aged 18–30 years who had received 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Participants with low measles and/or rubella antibody levels as confirmed by VIDAS received an MMR booster. Antibody levels were measured at 1 month postbooster.

Results

Among 791 participants, the measles and rubella seroprevalence rates were 94.7% (95% confidence interval, 92.9%-96.0%) and 97.3% (95% CI, 96.0%-98.3%), respectively. Lower seroprevalence rates were observed among older participants. One hundred thirteen participants who received an MMR booster acquired higher measles and rubella antibody levels at 1 month postbooster compared to baseline.

Conclusions

Although measles and rubella vaccine failures were observed among 5.3% and 2.7% of young adults, respectively, an MMR booster triggered a significant antibody response.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) re-immunization and vaccine response after antiretroviral therapy (ART) — children with HIV: For certain vaccines the response to vaccination may be greater with immune reconstitution following ART and may vary with viral load, and for most vaccines patients with higher CD4 counts have improved immune response with response likely improved after ART is initiated. The ACIP made specific recommendations for routine MMR re-immunization after initiation of ART; individuals with perinatal HIV infection who were vaccinated prior to establishment of effective ART should receive two appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine once effective ART has been established unless severely immunosuppressed or with other acceptable current evidence of measles immunity. For some vaccines such as hepatitis B, ACIP recommends performing post-vaccination serology to ensure immune response, and children living in a household with an adult or child with HIV can receive MMR vaccine because the viruses in this vaccine are not transmitted from person to person.

### Immunogenicity and reactogenicity following MMR vaccination in 5–7-month-old infants: a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in 6540 Danish infants [^114B8Lrz]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

It is reassuring and in accordance with a recent review that the majority of mothers in this trial, who received MMR during childhood have persisting seroprotective antibodies in adulthood. Even though timely MCV-induced serological protection wanes over time, it has been shown to primarily affect quantitative antibody levels and neither seroprotection ratesnor T-cell immunity in 20 year follow-up studies in elimination settings.T-cell responses in infants are independent of presence of maternal antibodies and are key in eliminating viral infections. Studies on measles-specific T-cell responses have been planned by the author group.

The inconsistency of SPR between measles PRNT and measles IgG ELISA is a well described phenomenon. Although PRNT is the gold standard for measuring seroprotection, it is labor-intensive, why other ways to measure responses are useful. Measles IgG ELISAs have lower sensitivity (underestimating SPR by around 10 percentage points), which causes false negative results. Samples in the ELISAs were run in unicate causing uncertainty for the estimated level of antibodies in each individual sample, however, this was mitigated by a high number of samples, and reading of controls being very similar across plates underlining the uniform performance of the assay and the laboratory work.

Maternal antibody presence is not an as impactful inhibitor of immunogenicity of mumps and rubella immunizations compared to maternal measles antibodies. We tested two different protective thresholds for rubella IgG: the conservative and currently widely accepted 10 IU/mL and the post-vaccine era estimated protective threshold at 4 IU/mL (see Supplement for elaboration). We found rubella SPR at 57% or 74% depending on which protective threshold is applied, after early MMR, suggesting good immunogenicity in the 5–7 months old infants. With an SPR at 92% or 97%, depending on the protective cutoff, after two doses (6 months and 15 months in the MMR group), SPRs are comparable to the two-dose schedule in older children. For mumps IgG, a clear cut protective threshold has not been established, but immunogenicity has been shown to be independent of maternal antibody presence and dependent of age.

### What is the evidence to support a correlate of protection for measles? A systematic review [^115qTXkk]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many studies assume that the serologic correlate of protection from measles disease is 120 mIU/mL. We systematically reviewed the literature to examine the evidence supporting this correlate of protection.

Methods

We searched peer-reviewed and gray literature for articles reporting a measles correlate of protection. We excluded studies focusing on special populations, infants aged < 9 months, and those using animal models or nonstandard vaccines or administration routes. We extracted and synthesized data from full-text articles that met inclusion criteria.

Results

We screened 14 778 articles and included 5 studies in our review. The studies reported either preexposure antibody concentrations of individuals along with a description of symptoms postexposure, or the proportion of measles cases that had preexposure antibody concentrations above a threshold of immunity specified by the authors. Some studies also described secondary antibody responses upon exposure. The variation in laboratory methods between studies made comparisons difficult. Some of the studies that assumed 120 mIU/mL as a correlate of protection identified symptomatic individuals with preexposure titers exceeding this threshold.

Conclusions

Our findings underscore the scant data upon which the commonly used 120 mIU/mL measles threshold of protection is based, suggesting that further work is required to characterize the measles immunity threshold.

### Current recommendations for vaccines for patients planning pregnancy: a committee opinion [^114s56R9]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Summary — vaccination for individuals planning pregnancy outlines that vaccination in individuals of reproductive age before or during pregnancy confers resistance to intrauterine infections and provides the newborn with passive immunity to neonatal infections, and immunization schedules are best completed before beginning treatment for infertility because some vaccinations should not be administered during pregnancy. Rubella, measles, and varicella immunity should be documented before pregnancy; if nonimmune, the vaccine should be administered, and pregnancy should be avoided for 4 weeks. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for individuals who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy because COVID-19 infection increases the risk of complications during pregnancy. The influenza and tetanus-diphtheria immunizations should be completed before pregnancy but can be administered during pregnancy, the inactivated influenza vaccine can be given anytime during pregnancy, and Tdap should be given preferably during the third trimester or late second trimester. Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and meningococcal vaccinations may be indicated in some circumstances during pregnancy when benefits exceed risks, and live attenuated vaccines, including MMR, varicella, and live attenuated influenza vaccines, are contraindicated during pregnancy.

Table 3.
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis of determinants of seroconversion after booster MMR dose

The mean time of PAS was 17.8 (SD, 4.0) years (range, 0.0–34.0 years); the IgG loss in 25% of fully vaccinated subjects was estimated to be 21 years (95% CI, 21–22 years), and the incidence rate per 100 person-years of seronegativity was 8.6 (95% CI, 7.7–9.6). The PAS did not seem to differ by age at first dose of MMR vaccine (z = 2.5; p = 0.285; Figure 1); the incidence rate per 100 person-years of losing IgG was 10.2 (95% CI, 8.1–12.9) among subjects vaccinated at ≤ 15 months, 8.9 (95% CI, 7.6–10.3) in those vaccinated at 16–23 months, and 6.9 (95% CI, 5.4–8.7) in those vaccinated at ≥ 24 months, with an IRR of 0.86 (95% CI,.65–1.16; p = 0.154) in the comparison between those vaccinated at 16–23 months and ≤ 15 months and an IRR of 0.67 (95% CI,.47–.94; p = 0.009) in the comparison between those vaccinated at ≥ 24 months and ≤ 15 months.

### Measles vaccination elicits a polyfunctional antibody response, which decays more rapidly in early vaccinated children [^1136611Q]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Overall, our results show that antibodies in early-vaccinated children are as capable of inducing Fc-effector functions as antibodies from children who received 1 regular vaccination at 14 months of age. The consequences of the long-term decline in polyfunctionality still must be elucidated, eg, whether these children are at higher risk to get infected by measles virus, or that exposure to the virus sufficiently boost the vaccine-induced memory response. Nonetheless, the spike in functionality in the short term for young vaccinees is promising for children who receive early measles vaccination in endemic locations or in outbreak situations before the first recommended dose. Most importantly, this work has expanded the scope of understanding into the antibody-mediated measles response in both the short and long term after vaccination across multiple age groups.

Characteristics of the Sample, by Vaccination Group

Of the 2000 subjects, 1695 (84.8% [95% CI, 83.1%–86.3%]) showed a protective IgG titer; this percentage did not differ between males (512/613; 83.5% [95% CI, 80.3%–86.4%]) and females (1183/1387; 85.3% [95% CI, 83.3%–87.1%]). The proportion of subjects with detectable titer of anti-measles IgG was lower (P < .0001) among those vaccinated at ≤ 15 months (80.0% [95% CI, 75.5%–84.0%]) than in those vaccinated at 16–23 months (82.9% [95% CI, 80.3%–85.2%]) or ≥ 24 months (89.9% [95% CI, 87.4%–92.0%]) (Table 1). The overall IgG geometric mean titer was 77.2 (95% CI, 73.0–81.6), with differences among groups (P < .0001; Table 1). Two hundred twenty-seven of 305 (85.6%) seronegative subjects received a booster dose and of these, 212 (93.4%) were reevaluated. In 157 of 212 (74.1% [95% CI, 67.6%–79.8%]) a seroconversion was noted, without differences among the groups in analysis (P > .05) (Table 1). The IgG geometric mean titer value after a booster dose was 46.1 (95% CI, 39.1–54.4), without significant differences between groups (P > .05; Table 1). Forty-seven of 55 (85.5%) subjects who were still seronegative received another booster dose, and 36 of these (76.6%) were reevaluated: 13 (36.1% [95% CI, 20.8%–53.8%]) seroconverted (the study population is described in flowchart 1). Overall, the seroconversion rate after a second dose was of 93.4% (95% CI, 89.0%–96.5%).

### Immunogenicity, effectiveness, and safety of measles vaccination in infants younger than 9 months: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Dt4A6]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Added value of this study

To our knowledge, our systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to examine the immunogenicity, effectiveness, and safety of MCV1 administered to infants younger than 9 months. We found that MCV1 vaccination in this age group induces a good immune response, which increased with increasing age at vaccination. MCV1 administered to infants younger than 9 months confers protection and is safe, although higher antibody titres and vaccine effectiveness are seen in infants who are vaccinated later. Little evidence was available on antibody avidity, duration of immunity, and cellular immunity following MCV1 vaccination before 9 months of age.

Implications of all the available evidence

Findings from our systematic review were presented at the 2015 WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization meeting, which recommended that a MCV could be administered as early as 6 months of age for infants at high risk of contracting measles. However, a dose of MCV given to those younger than 9 months should be considered a supplementary dose, and two additional MCV doses should be given for optimal protection, according to national immunisation schedules. This updated WHO recommendation is an important step towards reducing measles-related mortality and morbidity. Further evidence on the effect of different measles vaccination schedules, derived from clinical, immunological, epidemiological, and modelling studies, could aid in the design of optimal MCV vaccination schedules that are needed to achieve global targets for measles control and regional elimination goals.

WHO recommends that children receive two doses of a measles-containing vaccine (MCV) as part of routine immunisation. In countries where measles-related mortality is high in the first year of life, the first MCV dose (MCV1) is recommended at 9 months of age, whereas in countries with low measles transmission, MCV1 is recommended at 12 months of age. A second dose of a MCV (MCV2) is offered in 171 (88%) WHO member states.

Measles incidence has increased in several WHO regions in infants younger than 9 months, adolescents, and adults. The increase in young infants has been particularly apparent in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and this trend might worsen because of declining immunity and increased transmission in adolescents and adults. Another explanation for the increase of measles in young infants is that mothers who have vaccine-induced antibodies lose passive immunity approximately 3 months earlier than infants with mothers who have naturally acquired immunity. Since measles in young infants is more severe than in older children, they disproportionally contribute to the burden of measles-related morbidity and mortality.

### Immunogenicity and reactogenicity following MMR vaccination in 5–7-month-old infants: a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in 6540 Danish infants [^114yGwam]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The data collection was pragmatic without objectively measurable information (except fever). Other trials used more strict observation regimes: assessment by personnel or more clear case definitions, e.g. temperature measurement at an anatomical site, daily measurements, or graded adverse reactions. However, the parental observations were not affected by the staff reflecting what families experience after vaccination. Most registrations occurred within 21 days after randomization (Supplementary Figure S3) suggesting increased focus on child health complaints shortly after vaccination.

The placebo-controlled trial design is ever more important, since parents who refrain from vaccination express safety concerns as a main reason. Additionally, as earlier vaccination has been suggested, high-level evidence of safety is crucial.

The SAEs in this trial were deemed unrelated to vaccination as they were equally distributed between the two randomization groups and due to the late onset of symptoms (Supplementary Table S2). The higher rate of SAEs in infants receiving early MMR was based on few events. One case of febrile seizure occurred in the MMR group in a highly predisposed individual. As the event occurred 33 days after vaccination it was deemed unrelated. The febrile seizure incidence was comparable to other studies in older children (1:3227).

MMR has been widely used for decades without observing negative long-term effects, however evaluation of rare long-term events must await pragmatic population-based observational studies. This paper focused on humoral immunogenicity and short-term consequences of early MMR vaccination, but other aspects should be considered regarding future vaccination strategies including effectiveness, long-term protectionand long-term safety of early MMR.

While explored in a small sample, premature infants, the most vulnerable, may be the population to gain the most from an additional early MMR. Given the high measles mortality rate in infants in low-income countries, and the evidence of a growing population of infants susceptible to measles at a younger age (from around 2–3 months of age), early measles immunization may be an effective protective strategy against measles during this vulnerable period of life in high-risk settings. The absence of reactogenicity after early MMR and the overall achievement of measles seroprotection for one third of vaccinated participants, described in this trial, stresses the desirable situation of reducing the number of susceptible young individuals in high-risk settings and thereby decreasing the risk of measles in unprotected infantsand preventing the spread of measles by providing an additional early dose of MMR.

### Long-term persistence of seroprotection against measles following measles-mumps-rubella vaccination administered before and after pediatric liver transplantation [^113vpado]. American Journal of Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Liver transplantation (LT) recipients are susceptible to infections, including measles. Concerns about the safety and efficacy of live-attenuated vaccines, such as the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, have led to hesitancy among providers in administering them to immunocompromised patients. This 9-year interventional study assessed seroprotection against measles following MMR vaccination in pediatric LT recipients. Of 119 participants enrolled, 60 (50%) were seroprotected against measles after transplantation. Among the 59 nonseroprotected participants, 56 fulfilled safety criteria and received MMR vaccination with a seroprotection rate of 90% (95% confidence interval, 73%-98%) after a first dose, 95% (95% CI, 85%-99%) after primary vaccination with 1 to 3 doses, comparable to nonimmunocompromized populations. However, measles antibodies declined over time, suggesting the need for regular monitoring, and booster doses. Half of the vaccinees (26/53, 49%) subsequently lost seroprotection. Among them, 23 received additional doses of MMR, with a high seroconversion rate. At their last follow-up (median, 6.1 years; interquartile range, 3.0–8.1 after inclusion), 63% (95% CI, 49%-75%) of all vaccinees were seroprotected against measles. In conclusion, MMR vaccination in pediatric LT recipients offers seroprotection against measles, but long-term immunity should be monitored closely.

### Protecting infants against measles in england and wales: a review [^116y6RQL]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish the most appropriate age ranges for the use of human normal immunoglobulin and MMR vaccine as postexposure prophylaxis.

Design

Review of literature and of laboratory confirmed measles cases.

Setting

England and Wales and countries with a similar measles epidemiological profile.

Patients

Women of childbearing age and infants.

Main Outcome Measures

The risk of measles, maternally derived measles antibody levels and the response to measles containing vaccines in infants.

Results

By 4 to 5 months of age, only 28–45% of infants born to women from highly vaccinated populations have protective levels of measles antibody. In the postvaccine era, between 74% and 80% of infants vaccinated between 6 and 9 months respond to vaccine, and around 67% have clinical protection from measles vaccination.

Conclusion

This study suggests that many infants being born in the UK will become susceptible to measles before 6 months and will be able to respond to vaccine between 6 and 9 months of age. It is proposed that current guidance is changed to recommend passive immunisation with human normal immunoglobulin for most infants exposed to measles below 6 months of age. For infants aged 6 months or over exposed to measles, vaccination with MMR may be given.

Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) — Minimum Age: 12 Months. Two doses of MMR vaccine for all individuals with HIV infection aged ≥ 12 months who do not have evidence of current severe immunosuppression is noted; the first dose should be administered at age 12 months through 15 months and the second dose at age 4 years through 6 years (or as early as 28 days after the first dose). Individuals with perinatal HIV infection who were vaccinated prior to establishment of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) should receive two appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine once effective ART has been established and there is no evidence of current severe immunosuppression as defined by ACIP.

### Measles in the 21st century: progress toward achieving and sustaining elimination [^114ACL3i]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

MMR vaccination is only rarely associated with serious adverse events, and both precautions and contraindications to MMR vaccination have been carefully delineated to minimize serious reactions. A review by the Institute of Medicine assessed whether there was both epidemiologic and mechanistic evidence of serious adverse events associated with MMR vaccine. This review concluded that there is an increased risk of febrile seizures following MMR vaccine, and that the evidence supported a causal relationship between MMR vaccine and febrile seizures. The review also concluded a causal relationship between MMR vaccine and anaphylaxis, and MMR vaccine and MIBE in individuals with demonstrated immunodeficiencies.

The attributable risk of febrile seizures after MMR vaccine has been evaluated in multiple large population-based studies to be approximately 25–34 additional febrile seizures per 100 000 children vaccinated, and occurs most commonly 7–14 days after vaccination [35]. The risk is approximately twice as high for children aged 12–23 months who receive the MMRV combination vaccine compared with those who receive MMR and varicella vaccines separately [36]. These studies found that there was 1 additional febrile seizure per every 2300–2600 MMRV vaccine doses given, compared with MMR and varicella vaccines given separately. There was no increased risk in individuals receiving a second dose of MMRV compared to MMR and varicella separately at the recommended 4–6-year-old age range [37]. Based on these findings, providers are recommended to discuss the benefits and risks of vaccination with MMRV versus MMR and varicella separately for the first dose of measles vaccine, and to administer MMRV as the first dose only if the parent or caregiver expresses a preference for MMRV vaccine.

### Early measles vaccination during an outbreak in the Netherlands: short-term and long-term decreases in antibody responses among children vaccinated before 12 months of age [^112mMtpd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we showed that most children develop protective measles virus–specific antibodies following vaccination as early as 6 months of age. A lower risk of measles virus infection was indeed shown for infants first vaccinated between 6 and 14 months of age during this measles outbreak. Because low numbers of measles cases were reported, vaccine effectiveness could not accurately be determined; however, all reported measles cases occurred in infants vaccinated before 9 months of age. We found that 20% infants vaccinated before 9 months of age had measles virus–specific neutralizing antibody levels below the cutoff for clinical protection (0.12 IU/mL), which highlights that a proportion of these infants is not sufficiently protected after 1 dose of MMR. It should be noted that the interval between early vaccination and antibody level measurement at age 14 months increased with a lower age at receipt of the first dose, which may account for some of the quantitative differences between the 2 early vaccinated groups.

Interestingly, for the subgroup of children with low levels of neutralizing antibodies after receipt of the first MMR dose, the response to MMR-1 was quite similar to that for the control group, indicating a primary antibody response after a receipt of MMR-1. This finding was substantiated by the observation that, at 4 years of age, all children had antibody levels above the cutoff for protection. Gans et al also showed that additional vaccination 12 months after primary vaccine failure at 6 months of age resulted in protective antibody levels 2 years later. These results stress that additional vaccination is essential to protect infants who do not respond to a first dose received before 9 months of age.

Previous studies have shown that vaccination before 9 months of age induces a reduced antibody response. Recently, Carazo Perez et al showed that measles virus–specific vaccine response rates increase with increasing age at first vaccination, an effect that persists after additional vaccination. However, another study showed a comparable response to a first dose of MMR received at 8 versus 12 months of age, based on measles virus–specific antibodies measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

### Healthcare maintenance in elderly patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115eBvTZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)

Adults born before 1957 are generally considered immune to measles and mumps. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes no specific MMR vaccination recommendations for adults aged 60 or older, except for healthcare personnel. For unvaccinated healthcare personnel lacking immunity to any of these viruses, vaccination should be considered (2 doses for measles and mumps, 1 dose for rubella). Some authors suggest checking antibody titers in older IBD patients with an unknown vaccination history. In immunocompetent patients who lack immunity to any of these viruses, the vaccine should be administered.

Varicella

The absolute risk of primary varicella infection in older IBD patients is unknown. Cullen et al identified 20 reported cases of primary varicella infection in IBD patients, with 5 deaths. The risk of infection increased with immunosuppressive therapy, particularly with corticosteroids and combination immunosuppressive therapy.

Although adults born in the US before 1980 are considered immune to varicella, with the exception of pregnant women and healthcare personnel, IBD patients should be tested for varicella zoster virus antibody titers if there is uncertainty about their history of infection or vaccination. A two-dose varicella vaccine, with at least 4 weeks between doses, is recommended for seronegative, immunocompetent adults. In seronegative patients on immunosuppressive therapy, varicella vaccine may be administered 3–6 months following cessation of all immunosuppressive therapy.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111SKrEh]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination — people with HIV should follow age-based dosing and immunosuppression criteria: Absence of severe immunosuppression is defined as CD4 percentages ≥ 15% for ≥ 6 months for people aged ≤ 5 years and CD4 percentages ≥ 15% and CD4 count ≥ 200 lymphocytes/mm3 for ≥ 6 months for people aged > 5 years; when CD4 percentages are not available for those aged ≤ 5 years, absence is defined as ≥ 6 months above age-specific CD4 count criteria (CD4 count > 750 lymphocytes/mm3 while aged ≤ 12 months and CD4 count ≥ 500 lymphocytes/mm3 while aged 1 through 5 years). The first dose should be administered at age 12 months through 15 months, and the second dose should be administered at age 4 years through 6 years (or as early as 28 days after the first dose). Individuals with perinatally acquired HIV who were vaccinated prior to the establishment of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) should receive two appropriately spaced doses (28 days between each dose) of MMR vaccine once effective ART has been established and there is no evidence of current severe immunosuppression, as defined by ACIP, and MMR vaccine is recommended for international travelers aged 6 months through 11 months. The MMR and MMRV vaccines are contraindicated in people with AIDS or HIV who have severe immunosuppression with a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3 or a CD4 percentage < 15%, and MMRV vaccine has not been studied in people with HIV and should not be substituted for MMR vaccine in people with HIV, regardless of CD4 count; when only CD4 counts or percentages are available for those aged > 5 years, assessment can be based on the available CD4 value.

MEASLES VACCINE SAFETY

The safety of MCVs, including measles-only, measles-rubella (MR), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), and MMR-varicella (MMRV) vaccines is well-established. MCVs have similar safety profiles and are well tolerated, and common reactions after vaccination are mild [20,]. Common adverse events after MMR vaccination depend on components of the vaccine and include fever (5%–15%), rashes (5%), and lymphadenopathy (5%–20%), as well as parotitis and transient arthralgias/arthritis [29–32]. These adverse events occur approximately 6–12 days after vaccination, the time period of peak vaccine virus replication. Compared with the first dose of vaccine, adverse events are less common after the second dose of vaccine, because most children are immune at the time they receive the second vaccination, and therefore, less viral replication occurs [33].

### Mortality reduction benefits and intussusception risks of rotavirus vaccination in 135 low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling analysis of current and alternative schedules [^112ca64X]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

This analysis also highlights the potential benefit of a booster dose in mitigating the waning protection of rotavirus vaccines. A third dose of rotavirus vaccination co-administered with Meas1 was assumed to have the same efficacy (and waning) as a second dose co-administered with DTP. This assumption is consistent with a Rotarix immunogenicity study in Bangladesh, where seropositivity (immunoglobulin A titres ≥ 20 units per mL) increased from 53% to 70% when a third dose of Rotarix was administered concurrently with measles vaccine. A study in Mali also found an increase in immunoglobulin A titres and no negative effect on the immune response of other vaccines administered at the same visit (eg, measles, yellow fever). However, more evidence is needed on the safety, efficacy, and incremental cost-effectiveness of a booster dose, and until this evidence emerges, the results of this analysis should be interpreted with caution. Most of the excess cases associated with RotaShield were vaccinated as part of a catch-up campaign among older infants, although these cases were associated with the first and second dose, and no excess risk has been reported with the third dose of RotaTeq administered at about 6 months.

If all 135 LMICs were to adopt the age-unrestricted schedule with the highest predicted reduction in rotavirus gastroenteritis deaths (including schedules with neonatal doses, booster doses, or both), 81 000 associated deaths could be averted (42% reduction) compared with 74 000 (38% reduction) for schedules co-administered with DTP. The risk would also be lower because these schedules typically involve administering the first dose with BCG when the background risk of intussusception is lower. However, if a rotavirus vaccine could be developed for LMICs with the same efficacy and duration of protection observed in high-income countries, a far greater number of deaths (about 146 000) could be averted (75% reduction). However, the predicted reduction in rotavirus gastroenteritis deaths is just one of many possible decision criteria that should be considered when selecting a schedule. Other criteria include the expected risks, benefit–risk, operational feasibility, cost, cost-effectiveness, and public acceptance. In this analysis, schedules that involve giving the first dose with BCG and the second dose with DTP1 had lower risk and favourable benefit–risk results, so warrant serious consideration. The choice of schedule should be informed by a detailed country-led review of inputs and careful consideration of the different trade-offs involved.

Evidence of immunity includes birth date before 1957, documentation of receipt of MMR vaccine, or laboratory evidence of immunity or disease for each pathogen. For measles post-exposure, for nonimmune individuals with CD4 count ≥ 200 cells mm3, administer MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure or IG within 6 days of exposure and do not administer MMR vaccine and IG simultaneously; for nonimmune individuals with CD4 count < 200 cells mm3 or who are pregnant, administer IG within 6 days of exposure. For pregnant women without immunity to rubella, after pregnancy, administer two doses of MMR vaccine at least 1 month apart if CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm3 and on ART (AIII). ACIP recommendations indicate no difference in recommendations.

### Adverse events after MMR or MMRV vaccine in infants under nine months old [^1146eE2U]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In the United States, measles is resurging, with more than 700 confirmed cases since January 2014. During measles outbreaks, vaccination as early as at 6 months of age is sometimes recommended for infants who are at risk for exposure.

Methods

We searched the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for reports of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine combined or measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine combined vaccination in children less than 9 months of age. We performed a clinical assessment of each report and summarized the frequency, range, onset time and severity of adverse events.

Results

After excluding 346 reports because they were duplicates or because they contained insufficient information about the child's age or vaccine(s), we retained 204 reports in the analysis, including 35 (17%) that were serious. Among the 169 nonserious reports, more than half (88; 52%) described a vaccination error without any adverse event per se. Other nonserious reports described fever, injection reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms. Serious adverse events included developmental disorders, fever and fussiness. There were 44 reports of fever, but only 4 cases began 5–12 days after immunization, the peak risk window. The vast majority of fever reports listed concomitant vaccines, such as diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, acellular or whole-cell pertussis vaccine.

Conclusions

This review did not identify any major safety concerns. These findings may facilitate discussions about the risks and benefits of vaccinating infants who are potentially exposed to this life-threatening disease.

Model structure

A serocatalytic dynamic probability model was developed, stratifying seropositivity by age due to either vaccination or natural exposure for individual subjects. Our study defined natural exposure or natural immunity as immunity resulting from prior infection. A schematic of the model is shown in Fig. 1. Maternal immunity was excluded from consideration, given that the initial age of interest was 13 years. As such, each individual was assumed to be seronegative at birth. Seroconversion could occur due to either vaccination, or natural exposure. We modelled different rates of seroreversion for individuals who acquired seropositivity through natural exposure, as opposed to vaccination only. Natural immunity was expected to confer a longer average duration of protectionthan vaccine-induced immunity.

Schematic diagram of the serocatalytic model.

Vaccination was modelled in accordance with the Thailand Expanded Program Immunization (EPI) described in the Supplementary Material. For an individual born in year b, scheduled to receive dose i of a MCV at ageunder the EPI, we first computed the probability of vaccine-induced seroconversionassociated with dose i. This was taken to be the product of MCV effectiveness (assumed to be 90% per dose for the measle vaccine, and 95% per dose for the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine,), and vaccine coverage in the year, as reported by the Thai government. In case of missing coverage data, values were imputed using the average of the preceding and following years.

Rather than modelling disease transmission directly, we assumed a functional form for the rate of natural exposure to measles, referred to hereafter as the force of infection (FOI). Only a non-immune (seronegative) individual would develop the disease following exposure; a seropositive individual would instead receive an immunity boost. Prior to the initiation of the EPI in 1982, we assumed a constant FOI. To allow for systematic declines in transmission resulting from the nationwide immunization program, the FOI was modelled to decay exponentially over time (measured in years AD) at ratethereafter, yielding

### Update from the advisory committee on immunization practices [^1154UnXS]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts, meets 3 times per year to develop recommendations for vaccine use in the United States. The group has 15 voting members, and each member's term is 4 years. ACIP members and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff discuss the epidemiology of vaccine-preventable diseases and vaccine research, effectiveness, safety data, and clinical trial results. Representatives from the American Academy of Pediatrics (Carrie L. Byington and D. W. K.) and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (S. T. O.) are present as liaisons to the ACIP. The ACIP met on June 21 to 22, 2017, to discuss catch-up vaccination for hepatitis A vaccine, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine effectiveness, herpes zoster vaccine, the effect of varicella vaccination on the incidence of herpes zoster, meningococcal disease in patients taking eculizumab, and considerations for a potential third dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to combat ongoing mumps outbreaks. Updates on dengue virus epidemiology, Zika virus vaccines, anthrax vaccine, yellow fever vaccine, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System were given also.

### Inequalities in uptake of childhood vaccination in england, 2019–23: longitudinal study [^113WSYUM]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

MMR vaccination

Owing to the highly infectious nature of measles, WHO recommends 95% vaccination coverage for herd immunity using two doses of MMR. This threshold has historically not been reached in England, with our study showing that this is now unmet by > 15% of children in the most deprived populations. The number of people with measles has begun to increase in the UK and Europe, with modelling predicting the potential for tens of thousands of affected people in London alone. Furthermore, in our study, historical trends show higher measles rates in more deprived populations (see supplementary figure S1). In early 2024, measles outbreaks occurred in large urban areas in England. In Birmingham, 216 confirmed and 103 probable diagnoses were detected between October 2023 and 18 January 2024, and UKHSA declared a national incident.

PCV booster

Our study found a reduction in uptake of the PCV booster, which was most pronounced in more deprived populations. This is in the context of the schedule switch in 2019, from two primary doses and a booster dose to one primary dose and a booster dose (see supplementary table S1). The booster dose is therefore even more critical for protection in the new schedule. Widening inequality is concerning for disease risk in disadvantaged adults who require herd protection and where the risk of serious illness and invasive pneumococcal disease is disproportionately higher. Furthermore, the risk of pneumonia is also disproportionately higher for children living in areas of increased deprivation.

Rotavirus vaccination

Our study found the largest decrease in uptake of rotavirus vaccination since its introduction to the UK schedule in 2013. Before introduction of the vaccine, rotavirus was the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in children, with hospital admissions highest in more deprived populations. Rotavirus vaccination reduces these admissions with high vaccine effectivenessand reduces inequalities in disease burden. This is despite lower uptake of rotavirus vaccine in more deprived groups, as also shown in our study. Eligibility for rotavirus vaccination ends at 6 months of age, with no opportunity for catch-up. This makes the growing inequity in uptake, and disproportionate cumulative increase of susceptible children living in higher deprivation, particularly concerning.

### Measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (PRIORIX): recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2022 [^1115H1pv]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

ITP is associated with the receipt of live attenuated measles vaccines. In the four randomized controlled clinical trials at the U.S. potency of PRIORIX, one case of ITP was identified among 1,960 PRIORIX recipients and one case among 933 M-M-R II recipients. From a previous postmarketing study conducted in the United States, the rate of ITP after M-M-R II is estimated at 2.5 per 100,000 doses. However, strain- or vaccine formulation–specific data on ITP risk are sparse. Based on the clinical trials and the literature, the rates of ITP after vaccination were considered similar for PRIORIX and M-M-R II.

Short-term humoral immunity was assessed using data from 13 randomized controlled trials (.), four at the licensed U.S. potency of PRIORIX, and nine at a lower potency of PRIORIX used in other countries. Serologic response thresholds were achieved for all three antigens in all studies. Antibodies in all studies were more than 8.8-fold higher than the predefined seroresponse threshold for measles (200 mIU per mL; correlate of protection 120 mIU per mL) and more than 4.2-fold higher than the rubella correlate (10 IU per mL). Although an antibody correlate of protection has not been established for mumps, the anti-mumps antibody level was ≥ 3.3-fold higher than the mumps seroconversion threshold (10 IU per mL). The four studies conducted with PRIORIX at the U.S. potency found no significant difference in anti-measles, anti-mumps, or anti-rubella geometric mean concentrations (GMC) after the first dose between PRIORIX and M-M-R II recipients. Among the nine studies at a lower PRIORIX potency, eight showed no statistically significant difference between anti-measles or anti-rubella GMC levels, and seven showed no statistically significant difference between anti-mumps GMC levels. One study reported on persistence of the humoral immune response (2 years after vaccination) and found no difference between vaccines. None of the four studies that reported on GMC after a second dose noted a significant difference for any antigen at any potency after a second dose between PRIORIX or M-M-R II recipients.

### Measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (PRIORIX): recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2022 [^112jre1w]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Vaccination is the main means for preventing measles, mumps, and rubella virus infections and their related complications (1,2). Achieving and maintaining high 2-dose measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination coverage in the United States has led to elimination of endemic measles in 2000, rubella and congenital rubella syndrome in 2004, and a sharp decrease in mumps cases. However, measles and rubella remain endemic in many countries, leading to importations of cases and occasional local transmission within the United States (3). Reported U.S. mumps cases declined > 99% from the prevaccine period (4); however, mumps is endemic worldwide, and since 2006, the number of mumps cases and mumps outbreaks has increased in the United States, with wider geographic spread since 2016 (4). Given the risk for importation of measles and rubella and the resurgence of mumps, maintaining high measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage is important. Since 1978, only one MMR vaccine, M-M-R II (Merck and Co, Inc.), has been available in the United States. On June 6, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration approved a second MMR vaccine, PRIORIX (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), for the prevention of measles, mumps, and rubella in persons aged ≥ 12 months. The three live attenuated viruses contained in PRIORIX are genetically similar or identical to the corresponding components in M-M-R II (Table) (5–7). On June 23, 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) unanimously recommended PRIORIX as an option to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella according to the existing recommended schedules and for off-label uses (i.e., indications not included in the package insert)* (1,2). ACIP considered PRIORIX to be safe, immunogenic, and noninferior to M-M-R II. Both PRIORIX and M-M-R II are fully interchangeable for all indications for which MMR vaccination is recommended. This report contains ACIP recommendations specific to PRIORIX and supplements the existing ACIP recommendations for MMR use (1,2).

### Safety and immunogenicity of human serum albumin-free MMR vaccine in US children aged 12–15 months [^115vMWL9]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Despite the successful introduction of routine immunization with combined live attenuated measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines in the 1970s, outbreaks and generally increased prevalence of mumps and measles are still noted among the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, respectively, across the United States. Maintenance of high vaccine coverage rates remains an essential component of efforts to control these diseases. A 2-dose MMR vaccination schedule is recommended in the United States. Children receive dose-1 at 12–15 months concomitantly with other recommended vaccines, including hepatitis A vaccine (HAV), varicella vaccine (VAR), and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). MMR dose-2 is administered at age 4–6 years to induce immune responses in those who fail to respond to the initial dose. Two-dose catch-up schedules, with a minimum 4-week interval between MMR doses, are recommended for children and adolescents who miss the first dose. As Merck's M-M-R TM II (MMRII), a human serum albumin-free vaccine, is currently the only MMR vaccine licensed in the United States, any interruption in its availability would pose a critical public health risk. Therefore, GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines is currently evaluating its trivalent MMR vaccine Priorix TM (MMR-RIT) for use in the United States. MMR-RIT is routinely given in over 100 countries from the second year of life onwards. The formulation of MMR-RIT used in this study does not contain human serum albumin, thereby minimizing any theoretical risk of microbial contamination as compared to previous formulations. This formulation is also consistent with the recommendation from the European Medicines Agency to eliminate the use of blood-derived products of human origin.

This Phase-2 exploratory study assessed immunologic responses to 3 lots of MMR-RIT (containing a range of mumps virus titers) and to MMRII used as a first dose in 12–15-month-old children in the United States. The study was used as a preliminary evaluation of the minimum effective mumps virus titer for the candidate vaccine to allow planning of a Phase-3 study, and was used also to generate preliminary data on the safety and immunogenicity of co-administration of MMR-RIT with routine childhood vaccines: VAR, HAV, and 7-valent PCV (PCV7).

### Immunogenicity and safety of a measles and rubella-containing vaccine at age 6 and 9 months in Bangladesh: an open-label, randomised trial [^116T78zV]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

The first dose of measles-rubella (MR) vaccine is routinely administered to infants aged 9 months as part of a standard two-dose schedule. However, during large measles outbreaks and in other settings of increased circulation or increased risk, WHO recommends administering a supplementary dose at age 6 months to protect young infants. We aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a first dose of MR vaccine administered to infants aged 6 months and its effect on the immune response to the routine MR vaccine at age 9 months.

Methods

This open-label, randomised trial enrolled healthy infants aged 6 months in Matlab, Bangladesh, who had never received an MR vaccine dose and had no history of measles or rubella. Using a computer-generated block randomisation scheme, infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either two doses of the MR vaccine, one at age 6 months and the second at age 9 months (two-dose group), or one dose at age 9 months (one-dose group). Baseline characteristics were recorded for all enrolled participants at age 6 months. Blood samples were drawn for antibody assays before each vaccination and at final follow up when infants were aged 11 months. The primary outcome was immunogenicity of a first MR vaccine in infants aged 6 months or 9 months and the immunogenicity of a second MR vaccine in infants aged 9 months who received their first MR vaccine at 6 months. Immunogenicity was measured as the proportion of infants who seroconverted in the 12 weeks after vaccination at age 6 months or the 8 weeks after vaccination at age 9 months. Seroconversion was defined as a 4-times increase in IgG concentrations relative to the pre-vaccination concentrations or achieving seroprotective antibody concentrations between study timepoints. The modified intention-to-treat analysis included all infants who received MR vaccines per group assignment and had antibody results at baseline, 9 months, and 11 months. All enrolled infants were included in the safety analysis of the immediate reactions (observed by study staff at the fixed-site clinic in the first 30 min after vaccination), adverse events within 48 h of vaccination among infants in the two-dose group receiving their first MR vaccine at age 6 months, and adverse events observed by study staff or parents at any time during the study. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03071575, and is closed to enrolment.

Findings

Between March 9, 2017, and March 18, 2018, 620 infants were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two study groups (312 in the two-dose group and 308 in the one-dose group). Of the 301 infants vaccinated at 6 months, 282 seroconverted for measles (94%, 95% CI 90–96), and 283 seroconverted for rubella (94%, 91–96). By 11 months, after receiving a second dose at age 9 months, 297 (cumulative 99%, 95% CI 97–100) infants seroconverted for measles and 297 infants seroconverted for rubella (cumulative 99%, 96–100). Of the 292 infants vaccinated at 9 months only, 291 seroconverted for both antigens by age 11 months (100%, 95% CI 98–100). 123 adverse events were observed; 72 in the two-dose group and 51 in the one-dose group, with no differences in severity (p = 0.78) or outcomes (p = 0.71) by study group. 12 (17%) events in the two-dose group and seven (14%) in the one-dose group were severe; most events were mild, resolved without sequelae, and were unrelated to the MR vaccine. One death occurred in the one-dose group before the infant received the 9-month dose of the vaccine, and therefore was deemed to be unrelated to the MR vaccine.

Interpretation

The data presented support use of MR vaccine at 6 months to protect young infants during measles outbreaks and in settings with increased risk or high transmission. We recommend additional studies to evaluate longer-term immunity based on age at vaccination.

### Current recommendations for vaccines for patients planning pregnancy: a committee opinion [^115ax2es]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Vaccination before infertility treatment and during pregnancy — immunizations should be completed before conception because some recommended vaccinations cannot be administered during pregnancy; vaccinations before or during pregnancy protect individuals, prevent vertical transmission to the fetus, and confer passive immunity, with maternal immunoglobulin (IgG) transfer increasing markedly during the last 4–6 weeks of gestation. During pregnancy, few vaccines are contraindicated and the contraindicated vaccines include measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), varicella, and herpes zoster; vaccinations during pregnancy are indicated when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, and guidance for special indications is outlined in a committee opinion published by the CDC.

- Has a known severe immunodeficiency
- Is pregnant. Precautions A precaution is a condition in a recipient that might increase the chance or severity of a serious adverse reaction, or that might compromise the ability of the vaccine to produce immunity.

Precautions for MMR or MMRV vaccine include —
- Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever
- Recent receipt of antibody-containing blood product 7
- History of thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopenic purpura
- Need for tuberculin skin testing or interferon gamma release assay testing
- Personal or family history of seizures. Women known to be pregnant or attempting to become pregnant should not receive a live virus vaccine, including MMR vaccine.

### Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine safety… [^111AEQZ2]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Common side effects
- Sore arm from the shot.
- Fever.
- Mild rash.
- Temporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women who did not already have immunity to the rubella component of the vaccine. Some people may experience swelling in the cheeks or neck. MMR vaccine rarely causes a temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder that usually goes away without treatment and is not life threatening. Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it. Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps, or rubella. When to call 911 MMR vaccine has been linked with a very small risk of febrile seizures. Febrile seizures following MMR vaccination are rare and are not associated with any long-term effects. Because the risk of febrile seizures increases as infants get older, it is recommended that they get vaccinated as soon as recommended.

Extremely rarely, a person may have a serious allergic reaction to MMR vaccine. Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine. Report possible adverse events to VAERS.
- Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is a disorder that decreases the body's ability to stop bleeding. It can happen after both natural measles infection as well as after getting the MMR vaccine. However, it is usually not life threating. Treatment may include blood transfusion and medications. The risk of ITP has been shown to be increased in the six weeks following an MMR vaccination, with one study estimating 1 case per 40, 000 vaccinated children. Safety studies Adverse events
- The most common adverse events following the MMR vaccine are pain where the vaccine is given, fever, a mild rash, and swollen glands in the cheeks or neck.
- Studies have shown a small increased risk of febrile seizures occurs among children who are younger than 7 years old approximately 8–14 days after vaccination at a rate of one for every 3, 000–4, 000 children vaccinated with MMR vaccine. This is compared to children not vaccinated during the preceding 30 days. Pediatrics, 126, e1–e8. https://doi.org/10. 1542/peds. 2010–0665.

### MMRV questions and answers for healthcare providers… [^114QBjzM]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Q&As About Vaccination Options for Preventing Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella. The discussion with parents or caregivers should focus on helping them understand the risks and benefits by using tools including the vaccine information statements. Compared with use of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine at the same visit, use of MMRV vaccine results in one fewer injection but is associated with a higher risk for fever and febrile seizures 5–12 days after the first dose among children aged 12–23 months. Use of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine avoids this increased risk for fever and febrile seizures following MMRV vaccine.

Studies of febrile seizures after vaccination with first dose of MMRV vaccine have not been done in older children, but experts agree that this increased risk of fever and febrile seizures during the 5 to 12 days after first dose vaccination likely also occurs in children aged 24–47 months. Is the MMR vaccine associated with an increased risk of febrile seizures. MMR vaccination has previously been associated with febrile seizures occurring 8–14 days after vaccination; among children aged < 7 years, approximately one additional febrile seizure occurs among every 3, 000–4, 000 children vaccinated with MMR vaccine, compared with children not vaccinated during the preceding 30 days. Is there an increased risk of fever or febrile seizures associated with the MMRV vaccine when given to a child who is 4–6 years old.

In clinical trials, the proportion of children aged 4–6 years who experienced fever following vaccination was similar among those who received the MMRV vaccine and those who received MMR and varicella vaccines at the same visit. Should a child with a personal or family history of seizures receive MMRV vaccine. A personal or family history of seizures is a precaution for MMRV vaccination. Studies suggest that children who have a personal or family history of febrile seizures or family history of epilepsy are at increased risk for febrile seizures compared with children who do not have such histories. Children with a personal or family history of seizures should generally be vaccinated with separate MMR and varicella vaccines because the risks of using MMRV vaccine in this group of children generally outweigh the benefit of MMRV vaccine.
