## Question

Blood work for cardiac amyloid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about blood work for cardiac amyloidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching diagnostic algorithm and where blood tests fit. Then, I should verify the mandatory monoclonal protein screen and its components. Next, I will examine cardiac biomarkers for staging and prognosis. After that, I need to consider additional blood tests that support subtype differentiation and monitoring. Finally, I will integrate how blood work guides next steps in imaging and biopsy, and close with practical ordering and interpretation pearls, making sure I double-check thresholds and exceptions like renal failure before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework so I don't jump to conclusions: in suspected cardiac amyloidosis, the workup must start with a monoclonal protein screen to distinguish AL from ATTR, because ATTR can be diagnosed noninvasively with bone scintigraphy only when the monoclonal screen is negative, whereas AL requires tissue proof of light-chain amyloid before initiating plasma cell–directed therapy. This is a foundational principle across ACC/AHA/HFSA and CCS/CHFS guidance and the ACC expert consensus pathway, so I need to ensure this sequence is explicit before discussing any biomarkers [^f85c7a0b] [^2b72d837] [^7426e6f6].

> Wait, let me verify the components of the monoclonal protein screen so I don't omit anything critical: the three obligatory tests are serum free light chains with kappa/lambda ratio, serum immunofixation electrophoresis, and urine immunofixation electrophoresis. I initially thought SPEP/UPEP might suffice, but hold on, that's not sensitive enough for AL screening, and guidelines explicitly prefer immunofixation for both serum and urine to maximize detection of low-level clones, so I should correct that and emphasize IFE rather than routine electrophoresis alone [^a970fa71] [^5b397749] [^c44ed9f5].

> I should confirm the interpretive thresholds and caveats: an abnormal kappa/lambda ratio is typically < 0.26 or > 1.65, but I need to remember that in advanced renal failure the reference range widens to about 0.54–3.30, so I must interpret a borderline ratio in that context. If all three tests are normal, AL is essentially excluded and one can proceed to ATTR-directed testing; if any are abnormal, I should refer to hematology and plan tissue confirmation and staging before starting AL therapy [^5bec6455] [^2b72d837].

> Next, I will examine cardiac biomarkers for staging and prognosis, but I should be careful not to overstate diagnostic specificity: NT-proBNP and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T or I are consistently elevated in cardiac amyloidosis and are integral to staging systems in AL, with NT-proBNP showing high sensitivity for cardiac involvement and prognostic stratification. However, they are not specific for amyloid and can be elevated in other heart failure etiologies, so I must pair them with the monoclonal screen and imaging to avoid misclassification [^f5831d2c] [^cf12bcaa] [^3c77ed8d].

> Hold on, I should verify the prognostic staging details so I cite the right cutoffs: in AL, the Mayo staging uses NT-proBNP and troponin with the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chains to assign stage, and a European modification identified a stage 3b subgroup with NT-proBNP > 8500 ng/L and very poor outcomes. In ATTR, NT-proBNP and troponin also inform prognosis, though staging systems differ, and kidney function further refines risk, so I need to ensure I capture both cardiac biomarkers and eGFR when assessing ATTR risk [^cf12bcaa] [^3c77ed8d].

> Let me consider additional blood tests that support subtype differentiation and monitoring, but I should confirm their roles: in confirmed ATTR, TTR gene sequencing distinguishes wild-type from variant disease, which has implications for family screening and prognosis. In AL, a bone marrow biopsy is typically indicated to quantify plasma cell burden and exclude multiple myeloma, and serial free light chains are the principal hematologic marker to follow response. I should also note that while TTR concentration has been explored, it is not yet validated as a diagnostic screening tool, so I must not rely on TTR levels for diagnosis [^c44ed9f5] [^661650f8] [^fb5825e6].

> I will now examine how blood work integrates with imaging and biopsy so I don't miss a step: if the monoclonal screen is negative, technetium-99m pyrophosphate or DPD/HMDP scintigraphy with SPECT is indicated, and grade 2 or 3 myocardial uptake in the absence of a clonal protein supports ATTR-CM. If the monoclonal screen is positive, I should avoid interpreting scintigraphy in isolation and proceed to tissue confirmation, ideally with Congo red staining followed by mass spectrometry for typing, recognizing that fat pad biopsy has imperfect sensitivity and that endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard when noncardiac tissue is unrevealing or suspicion remains high despite negative tests [^49c41d7f] [^c44ed9f5] [^fdc15558].

> But wait, what if imaging and blood work are discordant or suspicion is high despite negative tests? I should double-check the contingency pathways: if scintigraphy is negative or equivocal yet clinical suspicion persists, endomyocardial biopsy should be considered. Similarly, if the monoclonal screen is positive but tissue is negative from a surrogate site, I should escalate to an affected organ biopsy to avoid a false-negative. These branches are explicitly recommended in consensus statements and help prevent diagnostic delays in equivocal cases [^79f76ef7] [^ea12f103] [^62d1b15f].

> Next, I should review how blood work informs follow-up and response assessment so I don't underuse serial testing: in AL, hematologic response tracked by free light chains typically precedes cardiac response measured by NT-proBNP and troponin, with cardiac biomarker declines occurring within 6–12 months of deep hematologic responses and correlating with improved survival. In ATTR, serial NT-proBNP and troponin help monitor disease progression and treatment response, and guidelines endorse periodic biomarker checks alongside imaging during follow-up, which I should incorporate into longitudinal care plans [^cf12bcaa] [^6cd5f016] [^39a528a0].

> Let me think about practical ordering and interpretation pearls so clinicians can act on this: I should order the monoclonal screen in any patient with heart failure, unexplained LV hypertrophy, or other red flags, and I should avoid relying on SPEP/UPEP alone because immunofixation markedly increases sensitivity. I need to ensure I interpret free light chain ratios in the context of renal function, and I should remember that a normal monoclonal screen does not absolutely exclude early or smoldering AL, so persistent suspicion warrants tissue confirmation. Finally, I should coordinate with hematology for AL and consider genetic counseling for ATTRv carriers to enable family screening [^f85c7a0b] [^5b397749] [^5bec6455].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: blood work in suspected cardiac amyloidosis centers on a mandatory three-test monoclonal protein screen to separate AL from ATTR, followed by cardiac biomarkers for staging and prognosis, with additional studies such as TTR genotyping and bone marrow biopsy as indicated. These laboratory results must be integrated with ECG, echocardiography, CMR, and bone scintigraphy to complete diagnosis and guide therapy, and serial biomarkers are essential for monitoring treatment response and disease progression [^7426e6f6] [^cf12bcaa] [^e687d7b2].

---

Blood testing for cardiac amyloidosis centers on **monoclonal protein screening** (serum free light chains with kappa/lambda ratio, serum and urine immunofixation) [^a970fa71] to distinguish AL from ATTR, and **cardiac biomarkers** (NT-proBNP and high-sensitivity troponin) [^f5831d2c] for staging and prognosis [^cf12bcaa]. These tests are **first-line** [^f85c7a0b] in suspected cases and guide subsequent imaging and biopsy decisions [^7426e6f6]. Additional labs (CBC, renal and liver panels, TSH, coagulation profile) assess organ involvement and comorbidities, while genetic testing is indicated for ATTR to distinguish wild-type from variant disease [^c44ed9f5]. Routine lipid panels are not diagnostic but may be checked for cardiovascular risk management [^notfound].

## Essential blood tests for cardiac amyloidosis

### Monoclonal protein screening (AL amyloidosis)

- **Serum free light chain (sFLC) assay**: Measures kappa and lambda light chains and calculates the kappa/lambda ratio; an abnormal ratio (< 0.26 or > 1.65) suggests a clonal plasma cell disorder [^a970fa71].

- **Serum protein immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE)**: Detects monoclonal proteins (M-protein) in serum [^a970fa71].

- **Urine protein immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE)**: Detects monoclonal proteins in urine, improving sensitivity for AL amyloidosis [^a970fa71].

These tests are **critical for distinguishing AL from ATTR** and should be performed in all patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis [^f85c7a0b] [^2b72d837].

---

### Cardiac biomarkers (AL and ATTR amyloidosis)

- **N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)**: Elevated in cardiac amyloidosis due to myocardial stress and dysfunction; used for staging and prognosis [^f5831d2c] [^cf12bcaa].

- **High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T or I**: Elevated due to myocardial injury; integral to staging and prognosis [^f5831d2c] [^cf12bcaa].

These biomarkers are **elevated in both AL and ATTR** and correlate with disease severity and prognosis [^3c77ed8d].

---

## Additional blood tests for comprehensive evaluation

### Organ function assessment

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluates anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia, which may indicate marrow infiltration or chronic disease.

- **Renal function tests (serum creatinine, eGFR)**: Assesses renal involvement, common in AL amyloidosis [^b2d10156].

- **Liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin)**: Evaluates hepatic involvement or cholestasis [^b2d10156].

- **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**: ATTR amyloidosis can affect thyroid hormone transport, causing dysregulation.

- **Coagulation profile (PT, aPTT, INR)**: Acquired factor X deficiency can occur in AL amyloidosis, causing bleeding diathesis [^b2d10156].

---

### Genetic testing (ATTR amyloidosis)

TTR **gene sequencing** is indicated to distinguish wild-type from variant ATTR and to guide family screening and counseling [^c44ed9f5] [^49c41d7f].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize a **multidisciplinary approach**, integrating blood tests with imaging and clinical assessment:

- **Monoclonal protein screening**: Mandatory in suspected cardiac amyloidosis to differentiate AL from ATTR [^f85c7a0b] [^2b72d837].

- **Cardiac biomarkers**: Essential for staging, prognosis, and monitoring treatment response [^cf12bcaa] [^6cd5f016].

- **Genetic testing**: Recommended for ATTR amyloidosis to identify hereditary forms and guide family screening [^c44ed9f5] [^49c41d7f].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **False positives/negatives**: Monoclonal protein tests may yield false results; clinical correlation and confirmatory testing are essential [^b2d10156].

- **Renal impairment**: NT-proBNP levels may be elevated in renal dysfunction, necessitating cautious interpretation [^notfound].

- **Complementary testing**: Blood tests alone cannot confirm cardiac amyloidosis; imaging (echocardiography, cardiac MRI, bone scintigraphy) and biopsy may be required [^e687d7b2] [^c44ed9f5].

---

Blood testing for cardiac amyloidosis includes **monoclonal protein screening** and **cardiac biomarkers**, with additional tests for organ function and genetic testing as indicated. These tests are essential for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring, but results must be interpreted in clinical context and complemented by imaging and, when necessary, biopsy [^f85c7a0b] [^2b72d837].

Advances in cardiac imaging have resulted in greater recognition of cardiac amyloidosis in everyday clinical practice, but the diagnosis continues to be made in patients with late-stage disease, suggesting that more needs to be done to improve awareness of its clinical manifestations and the potential of therapeutic intervention to improve prognosis. Light chain cardiac amyloidosis, in particular, if recognized early and treated with targeted plasma cell therapy, can be managed very effectively. For patients with transthyretin amyloidosis, there are numerous therapies that are currently in late-phase clinical trials. In this review, we address common questions encountered in clinical practice regarding etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of cardiac amyloidosis, focusing on recent important developments in cardiac imaging and biochemical diagnosis. The aim is to show how a systematic approach to the evaluation of suspected cardiac amyloidosis can impact the prognosis of patients in the modern era.

Key diagnostic strategies for cardiac amyloidosis—recommendations with strong level of consensus include that in patients suspected of having cardiac and systemic amyloidosis, identification of amyloid protein in specified tissues or affected organs is recommended to diagnose amyloidosis (Level of Evidence C). If TTR amyloid is detected from a biopsy specimen, DNA mutational analysis should be used to differentiate between senile and hereditary amyloidosis (Level of Evidence C). When the diagnosis of amyloidosis has been established, imaging and further laboratory studies or biopsies should be considered to identify the organs involved (Level of Evidence C), and the extent of organ involvement is critical in determining treatment strategies and prognosis. Echocardiography should be performed in patients suspected of having cardiac amyloidosis or patients with systemic amyloidosis and HF (Level of Evidence B).

### Cardiac amyloidosis: can advances in diagnostics and treatments improve survival? [^58154a12]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis is a generalised clinical disorder characterised by extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils. Symptomatic cardiac amyloidosis is typically associated with light chain (AL) amyloidosis in the western world. Amyloid deposition in the myocardium causes restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac manifestations affect patient's performance status and limit therapeutic options. We present a case of rapidly progressing cardiac amyloid deposition due to AL amyloidosis presenting with typical features of restrictive cardiomyopathy. We also discuss the advances in non-invasive diagnostic techniques applied in this case and currently available novel treatments. Early diagnosis and better response to novel treatments could potentially improve the overall survival in this group of patients.

### The last decade in cardiac amyloidosis: advances in understanding pathophysiology, diagnosis and quantification, prognosis, treatment strategies, and monitoring Response [^58f47946]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis represents a unique disease process characterized by amyloid fibril deposition within the myocardial extracellular space. Advances in multimodality cardiac imaging enable accurate diagnosis and facilitate prompt initiation of disease-modifying therapies. Furthermore, rapid advances in multimodality imaging have enriched understanding of the underlying pathogenesis, enhanced prognostication, and resulted in the development of imaging-based markers that reflect the amyloid burden, which is of increasing importance when assessing the response to treatment. Whereas conventional therapies have focused on reducing amyloid formation and subsequent stabilization of the cardiac disease process, novel agents are being developed to accelerate the immune-mediated removal of amyloid fibrils from the heart. In this context, the ability to track changes in the amyloid burden over time is of paramount importance. Although advanced imaging techniques have shown efficacy in tracking the treatment response, future research focused on improved precision through use of artificial intelligence may augment the detection of changes earlier in the course of treatment.

However, granular sparkling can also be present in other causes of LV hypertrophy, yielding lower sensitivity for identifying cardiac amyloidosis than previously anticipated. In addition, tissue harmonic imaging and image processing techniques may alter the myocardial echogenicity and, thus, impair the diagnostic value of this feature. Generally, LV diastolic abnormalities occur already in the early stages of cardiac amyloidosis. In contrast, LV ejection fraction usually remains normal or mildly reduced until the late stages of the disease, despite diminished longitudinal deformation of the myocardium. Despite preserved ejection fraction, cardiac output is low due to decreased ventricular volumes. In addition, native T1 values were shown to be related to functional echocardiographic markers of systolic and diastolic LV function and significantly increased even in asymptomatic amyloidosis patients, thus being potentially more sensitive than LGE.

Extracellular Volume By measuring the T1 value of the myocardium before and after gadolinium administration, the myocardial ECV can be quantified. This parameter reflects the fraction of myocardium composed by the extracellular space, where the amyloid deposits accumulate in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. ECV requires administering gadolinium-based contrast agents but is less susceptible to technical issues than the pulse sequences used for native T1 mapping. Like native T1, ECV has been extensively validated in cardiac amyloidosis, including studies where ECV was serially studied during treatment with novel pharmacologic agents in AL and ATTR amyloidosis. Due to its high reproducibility and quantitative nature, the use of ECV was proposed for serial studies, monitoring the response to therapies in patients with cardiac amyloidosis.

In addition, ECV has been validated against histology, exhibiting a close correlation to histologic amyloid burden and was independently associated with patients' outcomes. In ATTR amyloidosis, ECV was, in contrast to native T1 values, independently associated with mortality after adjustment for age, biochemical, functional markers, and LGE. This highlights the robustness of this marker which was recently confirmed in a meta-analysis by a systematic comparison of ECV versus native T1 in AL and ATTR amyloidosis patient cohorts. Summarizing the relevance of native T1 and ECV, both markers bear diagnostic solid and prognostic implications and need to be considered together with clinical, laboratory, and other imaging parameters during the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis.

### Amyloid transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis with different manifestations, test findings and types [^55d4c6ef]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Amyloid transthyretin amyloidosis usually presents with cardiac amyloidosis manifestations, most commonly with a heart failure syndrome. The history and physical examination offer clues of other cardiac and extracardiac manifestations. Taking a detailed history is essential in elucidating pertinent family and medical history that may increase suspicion for amyloidosis. Further, certain findings on electrocardiogram and imaging should raise suspicion and trigger further workup that can confirm the diagnosis, since treatment is evolving.

### Light-chain cardiac amyloidosis: strategies to promote early diagnosis and cardiac response [^02dd375e]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Delays in diagnosis and treatment likely contribute to the poor life expectancy of patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis despite improved treatments; increased clinical suspicion among cardiologists is needed. Improved survival in patients with less advanced disease highlights that cardiac AL amyloidosis is not a hopeless condition and may be effectively treated. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment will ensure patients are not needlessly subjected to standard medications for heart failure that may be ineffective or even harmful. Emerging interventions may specifically target amyloid, potentially improving cardiac function.

### Diagnosis and treatment of cardiac amyloidosis. A position statement of the European Society of Cardiology working group on myocardial and pericardial diseases [^37ca99a9]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis is a serious and progressive infiltrative disease that is caused by the deposition of amyloid fibrils at the cardiac level. It can be due to rare genetic variants in the hereditary forms or as a consequence of acquired conditions. Thanks to advances in imaging techniques and the possibility of achieving a non-invasive diagnosis, we now know that cardiac amyloidosis is a more frequent disease than traditionally considered. In this position paper the Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Disease proposes an invasive and non-invasive definition of cardiac amyloidosis, addresses clinical scenarios and situations to suspect the condition and proposes a diagnostic algorithm to aid diagnosis. Furthermore, we also review how to monitor and treat cardiac amyloidosis, in an attempt to bridge the gap between the latest advances in the field and clinical practice.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the suspicion and diagnosis of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^57344f14]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiomyopathy is a manifestation of transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), which is an underrecognized systemic disease whereby the transthyretin protein misfolds to form fibrils that deposit in various tissues and organs. ATTR amyloidosis is debilitating and associated with poor life expectancy, especially in those with cardiac dysfunction, but a variety of treatment options have recently become available. Considered a rare disease, ATTR amyloidosis may be more prevalent than thought, particularly in older persons. Diagnosis is often delayed because of a lack of disease awareness and the heterogeneity of symptoms at presentation. Given the recent availability of effective treatments, early recognition and diagnosis are especially critical because treatment is likely more effective earlier in the disease course. The Amyloidosis Research Consortium recently convened a group of experts in ATTR amyloidosis who, through an iterative process, agreed on best practices for suspicion, diagnosis, and characterization of disease. This review describes these consensus recommendations for ATTR associated with cardiomyopathy as a resource to aid cardiologists and others in the recognition and diagnosis of ATTR associated with cardiomyopathy. Included in this review is an overview of red flag signs and symptoms and a recommended diagnostic approach, including testing for monoclonal protein, scintigraphy, or biopsy and, if ATTR associated with cardiomyopathy is identified, TTR genotyping.

Clinical suspicion and laboratory testing

AL amyloidosis is most commonly diagnosed when end-organ dysfunction prompts an evaluation. Ultimately, the diagnosis can only be made by biopsy, with the identification of extracellular amyloid deposits that are subtyped by either immunohistochemistry or mass spectrometry as arising from the deposition of monoclonal kappa or lambda light chains,. Therefore, clinical presentation depends on which organs have significant organ deposition (Table 3).

Table 3 
Common Organ Involvement of Systemic AL Amyloidosis With Associated Symptoms/Laboratory Abnormalities

Multiple clues can exist that should raise suspicion of a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. Besides clues on imaging or electrocardiography (discussed later), clinical/laboratory clues include the following:
1 Persistently elevated cardiac-specific troponin or multiple presentations with elevated cardiac troponin without adequate explanation on coronary angiography
2 Heart failure combined with other characteristic organ findings (e.g. macroglossia, nephrotic syndrome, elevated alkaline phosphatase, or dysphagia)
3 Unexplained heart block, atrial arrhythmias, or ventricular arrhythmias in a patient with increased ventricular wall thickness

If AL amyloidosis is suspected, laboratory testing should be initiated to evaluate for both monoclonal protein production and evidence of vital organ infiltration/dysfunction (Table 4). The combination of normal serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation (SPIE), normal urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation (UPIE), and a normal serum FLC ratio nearly rules out systemic AL amyloidosis,. However, the presence of an abnormality in any of these tests is insufficient for a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis, because MGUS or myeloma without AL amyloidosis are possibilities. As such, biopsy evidence of amyloid deposits (with amyloid subtyping) is always needed.

Table 4 
Laboratory Testing in AL Amyloidosis

During treatment with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy, SPIE/UPIE/FLC can be followed to track treatment response; in general, FLC ratios are the main marker followed because they are more sensitive for low-level abnormalities, and they are measuring the protein that is depositing (light chains) rather than whole immunoglobulins.

### Use of biomarkers to diagnose and manage cardiac amyloidosis [^97d153bd]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Amyloidoses are characterized by the tissue accumulation of misfolded proteins into insoluble fibrils. The two most common types of systemic amyloidosis result from the deposition of immunoglobulin light chains (AL) and wild-type or variant transthyretin (ATTRwt/ATTRv). Cardiac involvement is the main determinant of outcome in both AL and ATTR, and cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is increasingly recognized as a cause of heart failure. In CA, circulating biomarkers are important diagnostic tools, allow to refine risk stratification at baseline and during follow-up, help to tailor the therapeutic strategy and monitor the response to treatment. Among amyloid precursors, free light chains are established biomarkers in AL amyloidosis, while the plasma transthyretin assay is currently being investigated as a tool for supporting the diagnosis of ATTRv amyloidosis, predicting outcome and monitor response to novel tetramer stabilizers or small interfering RNA drugs in ATTR CA. Natriuretic peptides (NPs) and troponins are consistently elevated in patients with AL and ATTR CA. Plasma NPs, troponins and free light chains hold prognostic significance in AL amyloidosis, and are evaluated for therapy decision-making and follow-up, while the value of NPs and troponins in ATTR is less well established. Biomarkers can be usefully integrated with clinical and imaging variables at all levels of the clinical algorithm of systemic amyloidosis, from screening to diagnosis and prognosis, and treatment tailoring.

### American Society of Nuclear Cardiology quality metrics for cardiac amyloid radionuclide imaging [^186d897a]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

This document from the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology develops metrics for the assessment of quality for laboratories that perform cardiac amyloid radionuclide imaging. These metrics are based on clinical guidelines, appropriate use criteria, information and position statements, and expert opinion. The document introduces 15 quality metrics that address current gaps in care organized around 4 axes: A) Appropriate indications; B) Patient experience and workflow; C) Instrumentation and protocols; and D) Interpretation and reporting. With the increasing use of imaging for cardiac amyloid, it is imperative that our laboratories maintain a high level of quality to preserve the value that imaging provides to patients. Laboratories should perform imaging in appropriately selected patients avoiding low-value imaging. Proper education should be provided to patients prior to performing testing, timely access to testing must be available, and periodic assessment of patient experience and satisfaction should be the norm. Strict adherence to established protocols with periodic assessment of laboratory quality control is essential. Laboratory studies to rule out plasma cell dyscrasia should be performed in all patients suspected of having cardiac amyloidosis. Crucially, interpretation should be based on SPECT rather than planar imaging in all patients. The study report should include sufficient technical details to allow for proper interpretation of study findings and its conclusion should be clear and unambiguous to guide clinical management. Laboratories can use data derived from these metrics to identify areas of deficiency and introduce quality improvement initiatives, which will ultimately improve patient outcomes.

### Expert consensus on the monitoring of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^39a528a0]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a life-threatening condition with a heterogeneous clinical presentation. The recent availability of treatment for ATTR-CM has stimulated increased awareness of the disease and patient identification. Stratification of patients with ATTR-CM is critical for optimal management and treatment; however, monitoring disease progression is challenging and currently lacks best-practice guidance. In this report, experts with experience in treating amyloidosis and ATTR-CM developed consensus recommendations for monitoring the course of patients with ATTR-CM and proposed meaningful thresholds and frequency for specific parameters. A set of 11 measurable features across three separate domains were evaluated: (i) clinical and functional endpoints, (ii) biomarkers and laboratory markers, and (iii) imaging and electrocardiographic parameters. Experts recommended that one marker from each of the three domains provides the minimum requirements for assessing disease progression. Assessment of cardiac disease status should be part of a multiparametric evaluation in which progression, stability or improvement of other involved systems in transthyretin amyloidosis should also be considered. Additional data from placebo arms of clinical trials and future studies assessing ATTR-CM will help to elucidate, refine and define these and other measurements.

### Outcomes of asymptomatic transthyretin cardiac amyloid infiltration (...) [^b126877c]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Diagnosis of ATTR cardiac amyloid infiltration was established on the basis of myocardial uptake on bone scintigraphy in the absence of biochemical evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia or biopsy proof of ATTR amyloid in the presence of PCD. 10 Patients with asymptomatic ATTR cardiac amyloid infiltration, defined as the absence of HF history, HF signs and symptoms, and diuretic therapy at diagnosis, were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. We found that patients with grade 2 or 3 myocardial uptake exhibited significant cardiac functional and structural abnormalities, whereas patients with grade 1 uptake generally showed less abnormal cardiac structure and function; the rate of development of symptomatic HF, diuretic initiation, NT-proBNP progression, HF hospitalization.

ATTR cardiac amyloid infiltration encompasses a wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from amyloid deposits with no consequent cardiac structural and functional changes to established cardiomyopathy with the typical HF symptoms, elevated cardiac biomarkers, and echocardiographic evidence of cardiac dysfunction and morphologic changes. Bone scintigraphy is currently a key imaging modality in the noninvasive diagnostic algorithm for ATTR cardiac amyloidosis. 10, 16 Beyond its established diagnostic value, 10, 16 the degree of myocardial uptake of bone tracers has also been shown to provide a gross estimate of the presence and extent of cardiac amyloid infiltration. 17-20. Our data show different disease stages within the spectrum of asymptomatic ATTR cardiac amyloid infiltration. Asymptomatic patients with grade 1 uptake showed less abnormal cardiac structure and function in almost all cases by echocardiogram with normal or only mildly elevated serum NT-proBNP concentrations.

In contrast, patients with grade 2 or 3 uptake had structural and functional features on echocardiography typical of amyloid infiltration, namely increased left ventricular wall thickness and mass, reduced LV cavity size, atrial dilatation, increased LV filling pressures, preserved or mildly reduced LV ejection fraction, and reduced global longitudinal strain. Asymptomatic ATTR cardiac amyloid infiltration is being increasingly recognized in clinical practice. Patients with grade 2 or 3 cardiac uptake in this cohort study had substantial cardiac functional and structural abnormalities, consistent with ATTR-CM, whereas patients with grade 1 uptake mostly had less abnormal cardiac structure and function, indicating initial ATTR cardiac amyloid infiltration without overt cardiomyopathy.

### Hepatocyte growth factor and cardiac amyloidosis [^fb5825e6]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis still requires that the astute clinician exercise a high degree of suspicion to recognize “red flag” features of symptoms and laboratory or echocardiographic derangements. Next, appropriate testing must be ordered and correctly interpreted. Recent multi-societal consensus recommendations have been developed that standardize both test acquisition and interpretation, as well as frame diagnostic testing within appropriate clinical contexts. Although the capacity to diagnose ATTR amyloidosis noninvasively through imaging has undoubtedly contributed to its increased recognition, there remains considerable heterogeneity in adherence to guideline recommendations, resulting in test misuse and inaccurate diagnoses. A highly discriminative blood biomarker test would represent a significant advancement in the approach to cardiac amyloidosis diagnosis by serving as a gatekeeper whereby follow-on imaging testing could be triggered or avoided.

Circulating biomarkers are attractive as screening tests for cardiac amyloidosis because they lack the inherent subjectivity of imaging and are easy to acquire and easy to interpret. Free light-chain concentration in AL amyloidosis identifies systemic disease but does not specify organ involvement. Cardiac-specific biomarkers including natriuretic peptides (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] and N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide [NTpro-BNP]) and troponins (troponin I and T) are useful for prognostication in both AL and ATTR, but are not specific diagnostically. In ATTR, there is evidence that prealbumin (or TTR) concentration may also prove prognostic and appears to be a means to follow response to ATTR-specific therapy, but its role as a diagnostic screening test for cardiac amyloidosis remains unproven. At present, only retinol binding protein 4 appears useful as a specific biomarker screening test for hATTR amyloidosis, but one that functions best when incorporated into a prediction model that requires other diagnostic test results (electrocardiogram and echocardiography). No biomarker appears to confer both reliable diagnostic and prognostic information.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: evolving diagnosis and management: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^27fe57d8]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) results in a restrictive cardiomyopathy caused by extracellular deposition of transthyretin, normally involved in the transportation of the hormone thyroxine and retinol-binding protein, in the myocardium. Enthusiasm about ATTR-CM has grown as a result of 3 simultaneous areas of advancement: Imaging techniques allow accurate noninvasive diagnosis of ATTR-CM without the need for confirmatory endomyocardial biopsies; observational studies indicate that the diagnosis of ATTR-CM may be underrecognized in a significant proportion of patients with heart failure; and on the basis of elucidation of the mechanisms of amyloid formation, therapies are now approved for treatment of ATTR-CM. Because therapy for ATTR-CM may be most effective when administered before significant cardiac dysfunction, early identification of affected individuals with readily available noninvasive tests is essential. This scientific statement is intended to guide clinical practice and to facilitate management conformity by covering current diagnostic and treatment strategies, as well as unmet needs and areas of active investigation in ATTR-CM.

Purpose Of Review

Cardiac amyloidosis is an underrecognized cause of heart failure. We review clinical clues to the diagnoses, a rational approach to testing, and current and emerging therapies.

Recent Findings

Advances in the diagnosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy include (1) use of 99m technetium ( 99m Tc) bone-avid compounds which allow accurate noninvasive diagnosis of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) in the context of a negative monoclonal light chain screen; and (2) the use of serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis with serum free light chains as an accurate first diagnostic step for light chain cardiac amyloidosis (AL-CM). Advances in treatment include tafamidis for ATTR-CM and immunologic therapies for AL-CM. With the advent of accurate noninvasive diagnostic modalities and effective therapies, early recognition of cardiac amyloidosis is paramount to implement a diagnostic algorithm and expeditiously institute effective therapies to minimize morbidity and mortality.

### Performance analysis of AL amyloidosis cardiac biomarker staging systems with special focus on renal failure and atrial arrhythmia [^92f79881]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic light chain amyloidosis (AL) is a life-threatening protein deposition disorder with an annual incidence in the western world of about 8-12 cases per one million inhabitants.The disease is initiated by clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow,which secrete the amyloid-precursor proteins: free light chains (FLC) with a propensity to misfold and aggregate. In the fatal course of this disease, excessive amyloid causes dysfunction of vital organs such as the heart, kidneys or liver, which results in substantial morbidity and mortality.

In recent decades, biomarkers have gained essential importance for the diagnosis, risk stratification, response assessment and monitoring of AL patients. Besides the FLC test, which allows for highly sensitive quantification of the involved FLC and underlying clonal disorder, – a wide range of organ biomarkers are available which reflect the severity of organ dysfunction and amyloid load in AL patients. – Given the complexity of the disease, accurate estimates of prognosis are of great value to clinicians for optimal primary management and treatment.

### Light-chain cardiac amyloidosis: strategies to promote early diagnosis and cardiac response [^c733a22e]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a systemic disease characterised by the aggregation of misfolded immunoglobulin light chain (LC), predominantly in the heart and kidneys, causing organ failure. If untreated, the median survival of patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis is 6 months from the onset of heart failure. Protracted time to establish a diagnosis, often lasting >1 year, is a frequent factor in poor treatment outcomes. Cardiologists, to whom patients are often referred, frequently miss the opportunity to diagnose cardiac AL amyloidosis. Nearly all typical cardiac support measures, with the exception of diuretics, are ineffective and may even worsen clinical symptoms, emphasising the need for accurate diagnosis. Patients with severe cardiac involvement face poor outcomes; heart transplantation is rarely an option because of multiorgan involvement, rapid clinical decline and challenges in predicting which patients will respond to treatment of the underlying plasma cell disorder. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment with Ã¢â'¬Ëœsource therapiesÃ¢â'¬â"¢ that limit the production of amyloidogenic LC are associated with better survival and improvement in organ function after a median of 2.4 months following haematological complete response. However, organ recovery is often incomplete because these source therapies do not directly target deposited amyloid. Emerging amyloid-directed therapies may attenuate, and potentially reverse, organ dysfunction by clearing existing amyloid and inhibiting fibril formation of circulating aggregates. Improved recognition of AL amyloidosis by cardiologists allows for earlier treatment and improved outcomes.

AL amyloidosis diagnosis—figure-based algorithm outlines key clinical clues and two parallel pathways. Clinical clues include restrictive cardiomyopathy, macroglossia, unexplained proteinuria, hepatomegaly, and acquired factor X deficiency with coagulopathy. Under evidence of amyloid tissue deposits, biopsy of a surrogate site versus the affected organ is followed by Congo red staining and then immunohistochemistry or liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); if biopsy of a surrogate site is negative, a biopsy of the affected organ is required to accurately exclude AL amyloidosis. Under evidence of plasma cell dyscrasia, serum free light chains with serum immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) and urine IFE are used to identify a monoclonal protein, followed by bone marrow biopsy to assess the plasma cell burden and exclude multiple myeloma or B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.

Noninvasive and invasive diagnostic pathways for suspected cardiac amyloidosis specify that the cardiac amyloidosis diagnostic algorithm should always begin with a monoclonal protein screen to assess for the presence of a plasma cell disorder, and the obligate first decision point is based on the presence or absence of a monoclonal protein; a diagnostic pitfall is interpreting cardiac scintigraphy without a concomitant screen because cardiac uptake consistent with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (grade 2 or 3 uptake) may be present in over 10% of patients with light chain cardiac amyloidosis, so a scintigraphy scan alone is neither appropriate nor valid for distinguishing ATTR-CM from AL-CM, and AL amyloidosis can be essentially excluded by obtaining a monoclonal protein screen comprising 3 laboratory tests: serum free light chain (sFLC) assay, SIFE, and UIFE.

The most common forms of cardiac amyloidosis are progressive, life threatening, and underrecognized. Symptoms affect a variety of organs and overlap with those of more common conditions, complicating and postponing diagnosis. Cardiac disease generally determines mortality, but noncardiac manifestations typically surface before cardiac symptoms, often several years before diagnosis. Familiarity with noncardiac manifestations may lead to early diagnosis, enabling treatment and improving prognosis.

### Evaluation of the 2021 ESC recommendations for family screening in hereditary transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^a2e4eb95]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

The 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) screening recommendations for individuals carrying a pathogenic transthyretin amyloidosis variant (ATTRv) are based on expert opinion. We aimed to (i) determine the penetrance of ATTRv cardiomyopathy (ATTRv-CM) at baseline; (ii) examine the value of serial evaluation; and (iii) establish the yield of first-line diagnostic tests (i.e. electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and laboratory tests) as per 2021 ESC position statement.

Methods and Results

We included 159 relatives (median age 55.6 [43.2-65.9] years, 52% male) at risk for ATTRv-CM from 10 centres. The primary endpoint, ATTRv-CM diagnosis, was defined as the presence of (i) cardiac tracer uptake in bone scintigraphy; or (ii) transthyretin-positive cardiac biopsy. The secondary endpoint was a composite of heart failure (New York Heart Association class ≥II) and pacemaker-requiring conduction disorders. At baseline, 40/159 (25%) relatives were diagnosed with ATTRv-CM. Of those, 20 (50%) met the secondary endpoint. Indication to screen (≤10years prior to predicted disease onset and absence of extracardiac amyloidosis) had an excellent negative predictive value (97%). Other pre-screening predictors for ATTRv-CM were infrequently identified variants and male sex. Importantly, 13% of relatives with ATTRv-CM did not show any signs of cardiac involvement on first-line diagnostic tests. The yield of serial evaluation (n=41 relatives; follow-up 3.1 [2.2-5.2] years) at 3-year interval was 9.4%.

Conclusions

Screening according to the 2021 ESC position statement performs well in daily clinical practice. Clinicians should adhere to repeating bone scintigraphy after 3years, as progressing to ATTRv-CM without signs of ATTRv-CM on first-line diagnostic tests or symptoms is common.

Although small studies have shown that various tracers have diagnostic utility, these tracers are still at an early investigational stage, are not reimbursed by 3rd-party payors, and remain not widely accessible. Targeted amyloid-binding PET tracer imaging has a promising role to play in the diagnosis and prognosis of CA, and the evidence is progressively accumulating.It is possible that PET tracers will play a key role in early diagnosis and may even be sensitive enough to detect patients with cardiac amyloid deposits who have not yet undergone the structural and functional changes that result in cardiac amyloidosis. Larger multicenter studies are required to further assess their diagnostic performance relative to other established imaging modalities.

Cardiac amyloidosis, including ATTR‐CM, is not widely recognized in Asian scientific literature suggesting that it may be underdiagnosed.,,A Japanese study has revealed an increasing trend in mortality associated with amyloidosis, and in particular a marked increase in mortality among men over the past 6 years.Moreover, while the AHA guidelines detail the use of readily available tests and imaging techniques to allow accurate, noninvasive diagnosis of ATTR‐CM (without confirmatory endomyocardial biopsies), regional practice variations across Asia may limit access to healthcare, availability of specific tests, and expertise in assessing diagnostic images. Consequently, the overall patient pathway may also vary between different healthcare systems.

This manuscript is primarily based on a discussion at an Expert Panel Meeting titled ‘Clinical recommendations to diagnose/monitor patients with ATTR‐CM in Asia', held virtually on March 26, 2021.

### Redefining cardiac involvement in systemic immunoglobulin AL amyloidosis (...) [^593e6792]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Meaning ECV mapping redefines the hematological response associated with better outcomes and has the potential to inform treatment strategies. Importance Cardiac amyloid infiltration is the key determinant of survival in systemic light-chain amyloidosis. Current guidelines recommend early switching therapy in patients with a nonoptimal or suboptimal response regardless of the extent of cardiac amyloid infiltration. The prevalence of the presence of cardiac involvement using the 4 approaches based on cardiac biomarkers, echocardiography, or their combination was assessed across the range of amyloid infiltration as measured by ECV mapping. Among patients fulfilling the criteria for cardiac involvement, CMR with ECV mapping confirmed cardiac amyloid infiltration in most cases but found 27 to 37 patients without cardiac involvement.

Conversely, among patients not fulfilling the criteria, CMR with ECV mapping identified cardiac amyloid infiltration in 17 patients to 49 patients. This prospective study demonstrates the ability of CMR with ECV mapping in patients with systemic AL amyloidosis to characterize the degree of cardiac involvement, predict long-term outcomes, and inform management strategies. Our study demonstrated the following 3 findings. First, the different approaches currently used to define the presence and severity of cardiac involvement, which included serum biomarkers, echocardiography, and CMR with ECV mapping, produce widely different results. Second, when all approaches currently used to define cardiac involvement were assessed in multivariable models, ECV mapping was the only independent predictor of prognosis.

Third, the degree of cardiac infiltration, as measured by ECV mapping, provided information on the effect of the depth and rapidity of hematological response required; the key finding was that not all patients required a rapid hematological response, but a rapid and deep hematological response was crucial in patients with increasing degrees of cardiac infiltration, as redefined by CMR with ECV mapping. This study found that CMR with ECV mapping has the key advantage of accurately characterizing the presence and extent of cardiac amyloid infiltration compared with both serum cardiac biomarkers and echocardiography. ECV mapping can independently predict overall survival in systemic AL amyloidosis and has the ability to help define hematological response associated with better long-term survival according to the presence and severity of cardiac amyloid infiltration.

Cardiac amyloidosis—initial evaluation and imaging/ECG indicators emphasize an iterative process and early diagnosis. “An iterative process of diagnosis” is outlined, and clinicians are advised that “diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis requires a high index of suspicion because the diagnosis cannot be established on the basis of routine testing alone”; once suspected, “the goal is to obtain an early and rapid diagnosis as early initiation of therapy can prevent further amyloid deposition and further end-organ damage.” The diagnostic process begins with “clinical history/examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and transthoracic echocardiogram,” where “Discordance between QRS voltage and wall thickness seen on echocardiogram is a well-recognized feature” and “the lack of low QRS voltage on ECG by commonly applied criteria is only present in about 30% of patients with cardiac amyloidosis, and its absence does not exclude the diagnosis.” Echocardiographic clues include “increased left ventricular wall thickness (above the sex-specific upper limit of normal and typically ≥1.2 cm) as well as other features such as atrioventricular valve/right ventricle free wall/intraatrial septum thickening, diastolic dysfunction, decreased mitral annular systolic velocity (s’), biatrial enlargement.”

Cardiac amyloidosis—diagnostic testing and biopsy use: The current diagnostic approach for cardiac amyloidosis uses imaging alongside plasma-cell disorder assessment, with serum and urine immunofixation plus serum free light chains (FLC) required for AL amyloidosis, while serum plasma electrophoresis is described as insensitive and unreliable. While ATTR cardiac amyloidosis can be diagnosed accurately without cardiac biopsy, AL amyloidosis requires light-chain amyloid fibrils in tissue before chemotherapy, and a cardiac biopsy remains necessary for ATTR when imaging is equivocal or a monoclonal gammopathy coexists; endomyocardial biopsy is highly sensitive (100%) but impractical for screening. In confirmed ATTR amyloidosis, TTR gene sequencing is used to establish ATTRwt versus ATTRv.

Perceived Barriers to Cardiac Amyloidosis Diagnosis

Overall, 89.2% of survey respondents were aware that the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is usually delayed, and 88.8% agreed that delayed initiation of treatment for cardiac amyloidosis may lead to adverse health outcomes for patients. Additionally, survey participants were cognizant of the importance of timely diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, with 63.2% considering timely diagnosis to be “extremely critical” and 30.3% considering it “somewhat critical.”

With regard to perceived barriers to prompt diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, lack of knowledge about the disease “red flags” was the most important barrier, with a mean response of 3.4 ± 0.7, followed by limited access to imaging and laboratory tools necessary to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis (3.3 ± 0.7) and heterogeneity in disease manifestations and presentation (3.1 ± 0.6). Conversely, lack of available treatment options once cardiac amyloidosis is diagnosed and the perception that cardiac amyloidosis can be diagnosed only on endomyocardial biopsy were less important barriers to cardiac amyloidosis diagnosis according to CAAS participants, with mean responses of 2.9 ± 0.8 and 2.8 ± 1.0, respectively.

### Diagnostic imaging of cardiac amyloidosis [^fa5aba57]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Systemic amyloidosis encompasses a debilitating, under-diagnosed but increasingly recognized group of disorders characterized by the extracellular deposition of misfolded proteins in one or more organs. Cardiac amyloid deposition leads to an infiltrative or restrictive cardiomyopathy and is the major contributor to poor prognosis in patients with systemic amyloidosis. In total, >30 proteins can form amyloid fibrils, but the two main types of amyloid that can infiltrate the heart are monoclonal immunoglobulin light-chain amyloid and transthyretin amyloid. Cardiac amyloidosis can be acquired in older individuals or inherited from birth. Given the nonspecific symptoms of these disorders, a high index of suspicion is paramount in making the correct diagnosis, which can involve the use of non-invasive imaging methods such as echocardiography, bone scintigraphy and cardiovascular MRI. In the past decade, the use of cardiovascular MRI with tissue characterization and bone scintigraphy to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis has revolutionized our understanding of the disease, leading to changes in patient care. However, a need remains for improved awareness and expertise, and greater clinical suspicion, because the initial clues provided by electrocardiography and echocardiography might not be typical. With specific treatments now available, timely diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is more important than ever. In this Review, we discuss the current and novel approaches for the diagnostic imaging of cardiac amyloidosis.

Knowledge About Diagnosis of Cardiac Amyloidosis

Overall, the survey indicated a high level of perceived awareness about cardiac amyloidosis, with 82.7% of participants considering themselves to be “somewhat or extremely familiar” with signs and symptoms of cardiac amyloidosis. However, survey respondents did not suspect the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis frequently enough, with 61.4% having suspected this diagnosis less than once a month on average and another 25.0% who had never suspected cardiac amyloidosis in patients they evaluated. Furthermore, when asked about disease processes considered during the evaluation of patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction, amyloidosis, with a mean response of 3.6 ± 1.5, was less likely to be considered by survey participants compared with hypertension (4.4 ± 0.9), diabetes (4.1 ± 1.0), and obesity (3.8 ± 1.2).

Importantly, the survey identified gaps in physicians’ knowledge about the role of noninvasive modalities in diagnosing amyloid heart disease. Whereas echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were believed to be useful for the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis by 82.0% and 91.9% of survey participants, respectively, only 60.5% of physicians considered cardiac scintigraphy with bone-avid radiotracers to be useful, while 33.3% were unsure of the role of this modality in confirming cardiac amyloidosis diagnosis. Moreover, the survey uncovered significant gaps in the perceived importance of laboratory studies to exclude monoclonal protein abnormalities, with 52.9% of participants reporting serum and urine electrophoresis to be extremely useful, whereas serum free light-chain assays and immunofixation studies (serum and urine) were considered useful by 49.4% and 41.9% of survey participants, respectively. Urine free light-chain assay, not routinely obtained for evaluation of plasma cell dyscrasias, was believed to be useful by 42.1% of physicians completing the survey.

Step 2: diagnosis of amyloidosis

Once amyloidosis is suspected, there are several tests that can be undertaken to verify the diagnosis, detect the presence of an underlying PCD, and determine which organs are involved (Figure 3). Free light chain (FLC) assays can detect abnormal levels of Ig light chain in serum.Serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis assays are used to quantify and determine the type of abnormal Ig light chains or monoclonal protein.Positive results in these assays would indicate the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, multiple myeloma, indolent B cell lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, or AL amyloidosis.,The combination of these assays can be very effective in detecting amyloidogenic light chain in most patients with AL amyloidosis.The absence of a detectable monoclonal protein in the serum and urine by immunofixation electrophoresis and serum FLC assays makes AL amyloidosis less likely. Congo red staining of a tissue biopsy sample is required for confirmation of the diagnosis. Abdominal fat pad biopsies are a fast and safe option to detect amyloid deposits.Although the presence of amyloid deposits by Congo red staining in fat pad confirms the diagnosis of amyloidosis, their absence does not rule out disease.Bone marrow examination is an essential component of AL amyloidosis diagnosis. Combination of abdominal fat and bone marrow biopsies will identify 85% of patients with AL amyloidosis.In case of a negative biopsy result, alternative sites (labial salivary glands, gut) or a biopsy of the affected organ (eg, heart, kidney) should be considered.There are structural and functional differences between cardiac AL amyloidosis and other hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, but significant overlap exists.Echocardiography can provide an assessment of the likelihood of cardiac amyloid infiltration vs other hypertrophic cardiomyopathies and can assess the severity of cardiac involvement.,Although echocardiography is useful in patients with proven amyloidosis for both diagnosis and monitoring of heart involvement, the overlap of echocardiographic features among multiple diseases makes echocardiography poorly suited to rule out the diagnosis definitively.Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) offers accurate information regarding the heart’s structure and function with precision advantages over echocardiography; the key is its unique ability to give information about the tissue composition by “myocardial tissue characterization,” making it a highly sensitive and specific imaging modality to distinguish cardiac amyloidosis from other hypertrophic phenocopies.,,,,,,,,CMR with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) can visualize the continuum of cardiac infiltration, from subendocardial LGE to increasing transmurality as the disease progresses. When combined with T1 mapping, CMR with LGE can be used to characterize and measure the degree of cardiac amyloid infiltration with 70% to 80% accuracy in patients with known systemic AL amyloidosis.,,,,,It should be mentioned that although CMR is sensitive for distinguishing AL from other cardiomyopathies, it may not be suggestive in patients with early involvement of the heart by AL amyloidosis (ie, the absence of LGE on CMR does not rule out early cardiac involvement). Extracellular volume mapping should be considered in the CMR protocol to exclude early cardiac amyloid infiltration.

Discussion—diagnostic evolution and implications in cardiac amyloidosis—As recently as 10 to 15 years ago cardiac amyloidosis was not routinely considered as a diagnosis to explain the etiology of heart failure (HF); the advent of an accurate, noninvasive imaging means to diagnose ATTR cardiac amyloidosis facilitated enhanced recognition of ATTR amyloidosis and its prevalence among patients with HFpEF and AS, and testing for ATTR amyloidosis has identified unrecognized cases of AL amyloidosis. Development of effective therapies to improve survival in patients with both AL and ATTR amyloidosis makes understanding diagnosis and management paramount, and the document emphasizes that the disease is more common than previously thought, has multisystem manifestations requiring appropriate referral to skilled subspecialists, and that although noninvasive diagnosis of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis appears potentially straightforward, diagnostic pitfalls may result in misdiagnosis with catastrophic consequences.

Application of cardiac biomarkers to patients with AL amyloidosis

Several studies demonstrate that cardiac biomarkers, particularly NT-proBNP, are powerful predictors of prognosis in AL amyloidosis. Current staging systems for this disease are based on serum levels of NT-proBNP, cardiac troponin T and the concentration of circulating amyloidogenic-free LCs.In addition to the relevance of NT-proBNP in prognostic stratification at baseline, changes in NT-proBNP concentration after therapy predict clinical outcomes for patients. Specifically, NT-proBNP response or progression predicts attenuation or progression of cardiac dysfunction, with significant impact on survival.

### AL amyloidosis for cardiologists: awareness, diagnosis, and future prospects: state-of-the-art review [^ae8ad7a1]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare, debilitating, often fatal disease. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy are common presenting features, and patients often are referred to cardiologists. Cardiac amyloid infiltration is the leading predictor of death. However, the variable presentation and perceived rarity of the disease frequently lead to delay in suspecting amyloidosis as a cause of heart failure, leading to misdiagnoses and a marked delay in diagnosis, with devastating consequences for the patient. A median time from symptom onset to correct diagnosis of about 2 years is often too long when median survival from diagnosis for patients with AL amyloidosis and cardiomyopathy is 4 months to 2 years. The authors highlight the challenges to diagnosis, identify gaps in the current knowledge, and summarize novel treatments on the horizon to raise awareness about the critical need for early recognition of symptoms and diagnosis of AL amyloidosis aimed at accelerating treatment and improving outcomes for patients.

### Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis: diagnosis and risk assessment [^661650f8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a clonal plasma cell disorder with multiple clinical presentations. The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis requires a high index of suspicion, making a delay in diagnosis common, which contributes to the high early mortality seen in this disease. Establishing the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis requires the demonstration of tissue deposition of amyloid fibrils. A bone marrow biopsy and fat pad aspirate performed concurrently have a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis and negate the need for organ biopsies in most patients. An accurate diagnosis requires amyloid typing via additional testing, including tissue mass spectrometry. Prognostication for AL amyloidosis is largely driven by the organs impacted. Cardiac involvement represents the single most important prognostic marker, and the existing staging systems are driven by cardiac biomarkers. Apart from organ involvement, plasma cell percentage on the bone marrow biopsy, specific fluorescence in situ hybridization findings, age at diagnosis, and performance status are important prognostic markers. This review elaborates on the diagnostic testing and prognostication for patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis.

### Changing treatment landscape in transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^c83d602c]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Advances in diagnostic imaging techniques such as echocardiography with global longitudinal strain, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and bone scintigraphy contribute to the earlier diagnosis of ATTR-CM. – Access to bone scintigraphy and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, which can diagnose patients even before the appearance of echocardiographic abnormalities,, has fueled earlier diagnosis in patients presenting with less severe symptoms. Most patients are now diagnosed noninvasively (via laboratory testing and bone scintigraphy), whereas in the era of the ATTR-ACT trial, most patients required endomyocardial biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.Because patients are being diagnosed and treated when they have milder disease compared with patients a decade ago, outcomes have greatly improved.Initiating treatment that can stabilize or slow the progression to more severe disease earlier in the disease course leads to patients with ATTR-CM living longer, healthier lives.Other important factors include improvements in the management of heart failure in patients with ATTR-CM,, potentially leading to overall better outcomes in these patients.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: diagnosis and treatment strategies [^f5290abf]. Current Oncology Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis in the United States is most often due to myocardial infiltration by immunoglobulin protein, such as in AL amyloidosis, or by the protein transthyretin, such as in hereditary and senile amyloidosis. Cardiac amyloidosis often portends a poor prognosis especially in patients with systemic AL amyloidosis. Despite better understanding of the pathophysiology of amyloid, many patients are still diagnosed late in the disease course. This review investigates the current understanding and new research on the diagnosis and treatment strategies in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. Myocardial amyloid infiltration distribution occurs in a variety of patterns. Structural and functional changes on echocardiography can suggest presence of amyloid, but CMR and nuclear imaging provide important complementary information on amyloid burden and the amyloid subtype, respectively. While for AL amyloid, treatment success largely depends on early diagnosis, for ATTR amyloid, new investigational agents that reduce production of transthyretin protein may have significant impact on clinical outcomes. Advancements in the non-invasive diagnostic detection and improvements in early disease recognition will undoubtedly facilitate a larger proportion of patients to receive early therapy when it is most effective.

Markers of poor prognosis and staging limitations in cardiac amyloidosis—biomarkers, thresholds, and performance: “For both AL-CM and ATTR-CM, troponin and NT-proBNP are powerful indicators of disease burden and prognosis,” and “There are additional biomarkers that are uniquely prognostic for the type of amyloidosis: free light chains (dFLC) and kidney function for AL-CM and ATTR-CM, respectively.” Limitations include that “the staging systems were developed before current effective therapies,” and reliance on staging alone “may identify those patients who are either too well or too sick for advanced HF therapies.” In ATTR-CM, “the median survival in the more severe cohort from all staging systems … is still roughly 2 years,” and kidney function nuances include that those with “eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 observe only a moderate reduction in survival from the UK staging system for ATTR amyloidosis.” For risk stratification across AL-CM and ATTR-CM, “the combination of peak VO2 <13 mL/kg/min coupled with NT-proBNP ≥1,800 ng/L predicted an increase in all-cause death or HF hospitalization.”

Cardiac amyloidosis—biomarkers and staging: In AL amyloidosis, the affected free light chain (FLC) concentration together with N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin T or I can be used to assign a disease stage with highly reproducible prognostic information, and a staging system based on NT-proBNP and cardiac troponins (with differential FLC levels) is widely used to stratify therapy intensity. A European study identified a stage 3 subgroup with very advanced cardiac involvement with NT-proBNP (> 8500 ng/L) and a very poor prognosis; reductions in FLC after anti–plasma cell treatment are typically followed within 6 to 12 months by reductions in NT-pro-BNP and troponin (an organ-specific response) associated with improved symptoms and extended survival. FLC-based and NT-proBNP-based hematologic and cardiac responses have been extensively validated in AL amyloidosis; in ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, NT-proBNP, cardiac troponin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate have been validated in risk-prediction models, with changes in NT pro-BNP useful to follow disease progression, and biomarker evaluation is an integral part of management in both AL and ATTR.

AL amyloidosis tissue typing and confirmation—mass spectrometry-based analysis (LC-MS/MS) of the biopsy is described as the gold standard for tissue diagnosis, with a reported sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 96%. Samples with positive Congo red staining can be transferred to a reference laboratory for LC-MS/MS to establish the amyloidogenic protein, and tissue biopsy precursor typing is particularly important in MGUS with suspected ATTR cardiac amyloidosis because Congo red staining alone is insufficient. After a tissue diagnosis of amyloidosis, confirmation of AL amyloidosis requires demonstration of a plasma cell disorder by identification of a monoclonal light chain in the blood or urine and bone marrow biopsy showing clonal proliferation of lambda or kappa-producing plasma cells (or B cells). SPEP/UPEP should not be used to exclude a monoclonal protein in suspected AL amyloidosis.

Biomarkers and biopsy in cardiac amyloidosis—Endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis because it is virtually 100% accurate, assuming appropriate sampling, for the detection of amyloid deposits, but it is impractical as a screening test despite being highly sensitive (100%). While ATTR cardiac amyloidosis can now be diagnosed accurately without the need of cardiac biopsy, AL amyloidosis requires demonstration of light-chain amyloid fibrils in tissue prior to chemotherapy, and even for ATTR cardiac amyloidosis a cardiac biopsy remains necessary in the context of equivocal imaging or the co-existence of a monoclonal gammopathy. The current diagnostic approach involves the use of one or more contemporary imaging modalities in conjunction with assessment of a plasma-cell disorder, and serum and urine immunofixation with measurement of serum free light chains (FLC) are necessary for the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis; in confirmed ATTR amyloidosis, TTR gene sequencing is performed to establish ATTRwt versus ATTRv. In AL amyloidosis, a European study identified a stage 3b subgroup with very advanced cardiac involvement with high concentrations of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (>8500 ng/L) and a very poor prognosis, and a reduction in FLC following anti-plasma cell treatment is typically followed within 6 to 12 months by a reduction in NT-proBNP and troponin that is associated with improved symptoms of heart failure and extended survival.

### Cardiac amyloidosis imaging, part 1: amyloidosis etiology and image acquisition [^a168a48d]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis is a systemic form of amyloidosis in which protein-based infiltrates are deposited in myocardial extracellular space. The accumulation of amyloid fibrils causes the myocardium to thicken and stiffen, leading to diastolic dysfunction and, eventually, heart failure. Until recently, cardiac amyloidosis was considered rare. However, the recent adoption of noninvasive diagnostic testing, including 99m Tc-pyrophosphate imaging, has revealed a previously undiagnosed sizable disease prevalence. Light-chain amyloidosis (AL) and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), the 2 primary types, account for 95% of cardiac amyloidosis diagnoses. AL results from plasma cell dyscrasia and has a very poor prognosis. The usual treatment for cardiac AL is chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Cardiac ATTR is more chronic, usually resulting from age-related instability and misfolding of the transthyretin protein. ATTR is treated by managing heart failure and using new pharmacotherapeutic drugs. 99m Tc-pyrophosphate imaging can efficiently and effectively distinguish between ATTR and cardiac AL. Although the exact mechanism of myocardial 99m Tc-pyrophosphate uptake is unknown, it is believed to bind to amyloid plaque microcalcifications. 99m Tc-pyrophosphate imaging has a 97% sensitivity and nearly 100% sensitivity for identifying cardiac ATTR when the AL form of the disease is ruled out through serum free light-chain and serum and urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation testing. Although there are no published 99m Tc-pyrophosphate cardiac amyloidosis imaging guidelines, the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, and others have published consensus recommendations to standardize test performance and interpretation. This article, part 1 of a 3-part series in this issue of the Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology, describes amyloidosis etiology and cardiac amyloidosis characteristics, including the types, prevalence, signs and symptoms, and disease course. It further explains the scan acquisition protocol. Part 2 of the series focuses on image/data quantification and technical considerations. Finally, part 3 describes scan interpretation, along with the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac amyloidosis.

Consensus algorithm for non-invasive diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis—testing pathway: The consensus algorithm attributes a central role to 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP cardiac scintigraphy. If cardiac amyloidosis is suspected clinically or based on echocardiography/CMR, blood and urine should be analyzed for evidence of a monoclonal protein and 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP cardiac scintigraphy should be considered if ATTR cardiac amyloidosis is suspected. If both tests are negative, the current evidence suggests that cardiac amyloidosis is very unlikely.

Diagnostic algorithm for cardiac amyloidosis—Clues from history, ECG, echocardiogram, or CMR prompt a monoclonal protein screen using serum kappa/lambda free light chain (abnormal if ratio is <0.26 or >1.65) and serum/urine IFE; SPEP/UPEP is not as sensitive as IFE and the normal K/L ratio in severe kidney disease is 0.54-3.30. If monoclonal protein is detected, proceed with consultation with hematologist and biopsy of the affected organ or a surrogate site with positive Congo red and tissue typing by mass spectrometry, noting the surrogate site (fat pad) lacks sensitivity, to diagnose AL-CM. If no monoclonal protein is detected, perform Tc-99m/PYP and diagnose ATTR-CM when there is Grade 2/3 uptake, otherwise cardiac amyloidosis is unlikely. Cardiac scintigraphy could be ordered simultaneously for efficiency but must be interpreted in the context of the negative monoclonal protein screen; to avoid false positives, obtain SPECT imaging to exclude blood pool uptake, and to avoid false negatives, consider biopsy if the scan is negative/equivocal but clinical suspicion is high. Following ATTR-CM diagnosis, genetic testing distinguishes ATTRwt-CM from ATTRv-CM.

### Cardiac amyloidosis due to transthyretin protein (...) [^0e55437c]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance Systemic amyloidosis from transthyretin protein is the most common type of amyloidosis that causes cardiomyopathy. Observations. Transthyretin protein transports thyroxine and retinol and is synthesized predominantly by the liver. When the TTR protein misfolds, it can form amyloid fibrils that deposit in the heart causing heart failure, heart conduction block, or arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation. The biological processes by which amyloid fibrils form are incompletely understood but are associated with aging and, in some patients, affected by inherited variants in the TTR genetic sequence. ATTR amyloidosis results from misfolded TTR protein deposition. ATTR can occur in association with normal TTR genetic sequence or with abnormal TTR genetic sequence. Wild-type ATTR primarily manifests as cardiomyopathy while ATTR due to a genetic variant manifests as cardiomyopathy and/or polyneuropathy.

Approximately 50 000 to 150 000 people in the US have heart failure due to ATTR amyloidosis. Without treatment, heart failure due to ATTR amyloidosis is associated with a median survival of approximately 5 years. The diagnosis can be made using serum free light chain assay and immunofixation electrophoresis to exclude light chain amyloidosis combined with cardiac nuclear scintigraphy to detect radiotracer uptake in a pattern consistent with amyloidosis. Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide, are the primary treatment for fluid overload and symptomatic relief of patients with ATTR heart failure. An ATTR-directed therapy that inhibited misfolding of the TTR protein, compared with placebo, reduced mortality from 42. 9% to
29. 5%, reduced hospitalizations from 0. 7/year to
0. 48/year, and was most effective when administered early in disease course.

Conclusions and Relevance ATTR amyloidosis causes cardiomyopathy in up to approximately 150 000 people in the US and tafamidis is the only currently approved therapy. Tafamidis slowed progression of ATTR amyloidosis and improved survival and prevented hospitalization, compared with placebo, in people with ATTR-associated cardiomyopathy.

### Recent advances and current dilemmas in the diagnosis and management of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^3a177631]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis is a pathological disease process in which abnormally folded proteins deposit within various tissues, leading to marked interstitial expansion, end organ dysfunction, and damage. When it involves the heart, amyloidosis associates with particularly high morbidity and mortality. 1, 2, 3 The 2 most common causes of cardiac amyloidosis (CA) are transthyretin and immunoglobulin light chain proteins, which combined account for 95% of cases of CA. TTR amyloidosis (ATTR) can occur either spontaneously (ATTR wild‐type) or because of a pathologic germline mutation (ATTR variant). While previously thought to be rare, the presence of CA is increasingly recognized to be more common, with an estimated prevalence of 13% to 16% among patients presenting with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and severe aortic stenosis. 4, 5, 6 Recently, the development of several drugs, which stabilize or prevent the production of the TTR protein, have dramatically improved the outcomes of patients with ATTR. 1, 2, 3 With effective therapies now available for ATTR, it is becoming imperative to make an early diagnosis of ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTR‐CM) in order to streamline effective therapies. Significant advances in both cardiac imaging and blood‐based biomarkers in the field of CA have helped make this possible.

Yet, despite the recent strides there remain several key unanswered questions in the rapidly evolving field of ATTR‐CM. These include:

The evaluation of ATTR gene mutation carriers with early (preclinical) forms of CA,
The interpretation of indeterminate diagnostic findings in the presence of clinically manifested disease,
The efficacy of applying novel therapies approved for noncardiac ATTR for the control of cardiac symptoms and pathology,
The optimal methods for screening asymptomatic variant transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) carriers, and
The potential (bio)markers for monitoring response to therapy in ATTR‐CM.

Accordingly, within this review we will highlight recent advances in cardiac imaging and therapeutics for CA, while focusing on key opportunities for further optimization of care and outcomes among this growing population. We will also highlight ongoing clinical trials and areas of active research within this emerging field.

The systemic amyloidoses are an uncommon group of disorders characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid in one or more organs. Cardiac deposition, leading to an infiltrative/restrictive cardiomyopathy, is a common feature of amyloidosis. It may be the presenting feature of the disease or may be discovered while investigating a patient presenting with non-cardiac amyloidosis.

If CMR is suspicious for cardiac amyloidosis and monoclonal protein is present, bone marrow and tissue biopsy with or without other organ biopsy with congo red staining and LC-MS on any identified amyloid deposit should be performed; if results indicate SLCA, treat accordingly, and if results are negative for SLCA, a cardiac biopsy is warranted. If no monoclonal protein is present in the suspicious CMR branch, the NCCN Panel recommends cardiac scintigraphy followed by treatment according to semiquantitative grade. If CMR is not suspicious and monoclonal protein is present with other signs of SLCA, a bone marrow and fat pad biopsy with or without other organ biopsy with congo red staining and LC-MS should be performed; if systemic signs of amyloidosis are not present, the patient should be worked up for other diagnoses such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smoldering multiple myeloma, or multiple myeloma, and if no monoclonal protein is present, other causes of cardiac disease should be investigated.

Cardiac amyloidosis—baseline cardiac testing, triggers for cardiac/neurologic imaging, and follow-up of gene carriers are outlined as follows: necessary clinical testing will include, at a bare minimum, a screening ECG, cardiac biomarkers (natriuretic peptide and troponin), and an echocardiogram, ideally with strain imaging; if there are symptoms or abnormal laboratory or imaging tests, cardiac scintigraphy or CMR may be warranted; if there is evidence of neurologic involvement (peripheral neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, or carpal tunnel syndrome), neurology consultation may be warranted with assessment using the Neurologic Impairment Score (NIS), questionnaires (SFN-SIQ, ASP, COMPASS), neurophysiological studies (electromyography [EMG] with nerve conduction), and autonomic function tests (postural blood pressure monitoring, sudomotor testing, and heart rate [R-R] variability); for asymptomatic gene carriers, if no clinical evidence of TTR amyloidosis is found, repeat clinical testing is reasonable every 3 to 5 years, and all patients should be counseled to return before the next scheduled screening visit if new symptoms arise or as the predicted age of disease onset approaches.

Specialized testing based on organ involvement—systemic light chain amyloidosis details organ-directed evaluations. Cardiac involvement is diagnosed by imaging techniques such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in certain circumstances, and transthoracic echocardiogram with global longitudinal strain imaging is also an option in patients where CMR is not feasible/optimal. Low voltages and rhythm abnormalities can also be captured on ECG in individuals with cardiac amyloid involvement, and cardiovascular MRI has been successfully used for the diagnosis and prognosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy; characteristic findings on cardiac MRI include global subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement (subendocardial or transmural involvement) with abnormal myocardial and blood-pool gadolinium kinetics, and when appropriate, imaging should be done with contrast unless contraindicated. Liver and GI involvement may be confirmed by a gastric emptying scan if gastroparesis is present, abdominal ultrasound or CT scan to determine craniocaudal liver span, and upper and lower endoscopies with random biopsies of suspected affected portions to confirm AL involvement of the GI tract. An electromyogram or nerve conduction testing can be performed if there is significant peripheral neuropathy, and endocrine tests and pulmonary function tests may be performed if endocrine or lung involvement is suspected; chest CT without contrast may be performed if clinically indicated.

### AL amyloidosis for cardiologists: awareness, diagnosis, and future prospects: state-of-the-art review [^7101a75c]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

AL amyloidosis is a very devastating disease with continuing high early mortality. A significant majority of patients present with cardiomyopathy and are usually referred to cardiologists for diagnosis. However, for a substantial number of these patients, accurate diagnosis is either delayed or completely missed. These delays lead to poor prognosis and survival. It is therefore critical to increase awareness, knowledge, and understanding of AL amyloidosis among all health care providers, cardiologists in particular. In this review, we have attempted to provide a concise overview of this very complex rare disease. Furthermore, we have summarized the promising novel interventions under investigation to address removal of amyloid fibrils already deposited in the organs, an important treatment gap that currently exists. This review is but one step toward improving the diagnostic and treatment odysseys experienced by patients with AL amyloidosis.

### Proposed cardiac end points for clinical trials in immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis: report from the amyloidosis forum cardiac working group [^4283eba4]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers: Pathophysiological Role and Predictive Value in AL Amyloidosis

The Working Group reviewed available evidence from the literature for troponin and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) as relevant biomarkers in AL amyloidosis and considered utility in clinical practice (Table 1). High sensitivity cardiac troponin and changes in NT-proBNP have been shown to correlate with outcome,and troponin in combination with NT-proBNP improves the prognostic staging of patients with AL amyloidosis.However, there are currently no data on the use of cardiac troponin (including high sensitivity) in defining cardiac response criteria, particularly in the context of a prospective interventional clinical trial.

Of the circulating biomarkers considered, NT-proBNP is currently the cardiac biomarker best positioned as an end point. Available data from numerous retrospective and prospective studies suggest NT-proBNP could be considered a surrogate for survival in AL amyloidosis in response to antiplasma cell therapy. In non-AL amyloidosis heart failure, multiple mechanisms may influence NT-proBNP levels, and these may not be causally related to the pathobiology of the condition (Figure 2). These multiple mechanisms play a role in influencing the NT-proBNP plasma levels in cardiac AL amyloidosis as well, but other mechanisms such as toxic free light chain injury are possibly the main determinants of NT-proBNP elevation. It has been postulated that NT-proBNP levels in AL cardiac amyloidosis reflect, in addition to the mechanisms found in non-AL amyloidosis heart failure, cardiac damage due to direct insult to ventricular cardiomyocytes by toxic light chains or amyloid fibrils, thereby providing biologic plausibility as a relevant biomarker. Reductions in NT-proBNP levels in patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis follow the achievement of hematologic response and are not sustained in the absence of a very good partial or complete hematologic response.

### Subtype-specific interactions and prognosis in cardiac amyloidosis [^1f24ef7a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Amyloidosis is a protein‐misfolding disorder characterized by the deposition of insoluble abnormal amyloid fibrils into tissues, leading to organ dysfunction. Cardiac amyloid infiltration is most commonly due to immunoglobulin light chains (AL) secreted by clonal plasma cells or by transthyretin (ATTR), a protein produced by the liver (formerly called prealbumin).

The “gold standard” to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis is an endomyocardial biopsy. In cases of histologically confirmed extracardiac amyloid, echocardiographic criteria of septal thickness >12 mm in the absence of hypertension or valvular heart disease was used to define cardiac involvement. 1 However, in the era of multimodality imaging, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), 2 echocardiography with strain, 3 and technetium‐99m‐pyrophosphate [(99m)Tc‐PYP] scintigraphy 4 are commonly relied upon to confirm the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis in the absence of a cardiac biopsy.

The prognosis for cardiac amyloidosis has notoriously been poor. Few studies have examined predictors of mortality at the time of a cardiac diagnosis of amyloidosis. Diastolic filling velocity and deceleration time, 5 New York Heart Association (NHYA) class III‐IV symptoms, 6, 7 low ECG voltage, 8 global longitudinal strain, 7 and estimated glomerular filtration rate 7 have all been found to predict mortality in combined amyloidosis cohorts. However, there are significant differences between the 2 types of cardiac amyloidosis with respect to treatment options and prognosis, underscoring the importance of differentiating the 2 types. When compared to ATTR amyloidosis, patients with AL have a more rapid development of cardiac disease and worse survival. 7, 9 Prognostic staging scores have been developed to recognize early cardiac involvement in AL and include troponin T (or high‐sensitivity troponin T), N‐terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP), and the serum free light chain difference. 10 In ATTR, troponin T has been found to be the strongest predictor of mortality. 11

A major limitation in previously published literature is that small sample size and event rate limited the ability to determine differences in predictors of mortality between the AL and ATTR subtypes. We sought to comprehensively describe clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic, and electrocardiographic variables in patients with newly diagnosed cardiac amyloidosis and compare subtype‐specific interactions and prognosis.

### Primer on the differential diagnosis and workup for transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^5ddaec12]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis has often been referred to as a "great masquerader," mimicking other systemic and cardiac diseases. As diagnostic techniques such as echocardiography with longitudinal strain, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear scintigraphy have advanced, identification of cardiac amyloidosis has become less daunting. This review covers the differential diagnosis and workup of patients with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, with a specific focus on developing a clinical suspicion through demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic features of the disease. The most common mimics of cardiac amyloidosis, i.e., conditions that likewise cause heart failure with preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction, are also explored with respect to differential diagnosis, both for patients with normal and increased ventricular wall thickness. Ultimately, this review aims to demystify the diagnostic process by offering an algorithmic approach to the identification of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis.

Cardiac amyloidosis—noninvasive diagnostic algorithm with bone scintigraphy and monoclonal protein testing—starts when there is 'Heart failure, syncope, or bradyarrhythmia, with echocardiogram and/or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) suggesting/indicating cardiac amyloid', followed by 'Bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-DPD/HMDP/PYP' and 'Serum immunofixation + Urine immunofixation + serum free light chain assay (Freelite) Monoclonal protein present?'. 'Grade 2 or 3 uptake of 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP uptake in the absence of a clonal abnormality is highly specific to diagnose ATTR cardiac amyloidosis avoiding the need for endomyocardial biopsy', whereas 'If both tests are negative, then current evidence suggests that cardiac amyloidosis is very unlikely'. Individuals with any abnormal monoclonal studies 'should be referred for further evaluation to a hematologist ideally with amyloidosis experience'. The figure’s terminal labels include 'Cardiac AL/ATTR amyloidosis unlikely', 'Cardiac ATTR amyloidosis', 'Variant ATTR amyloidosis', and 'Wild-Type ATTR amyloidosis'.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: a practical approach to diagnosis and management [^13f1d64e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis, the primary determinant of prognosis in systemic amyloidoses, is characterized by infiltration of myocardium by amyloid protein resulting in cardiomyopathy and conduction disturbances. Cardiac involvement is primarily encountered in immunoglobulin (AL) and transthyretin-associated (hereditary/familial and senile) amyloidoses. Although the latter variants could be indolent, untreated AL amyloidosis with clinical cardiac involvement is a rapidly fatal disease. The management decisions of cardiac amyloidosis are based on the underlying cause. Although treatment of senile systemic amyloidosis is largely supportive, the therapeutic approaches for AL amyloidosis include chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplantation, and, rarely, cardiac transplantation. The familial variant is potentially curable with a liver ± cardiac transplantation. This narrative review outlines a practical approach to these challenging diagnoses in the face of rapidly evolving management strategies.

Cardiac amyloidosis is increasingly recognized as an underdiagnosed cause of heart failure. This review article provides an overview of the role of multimodality cardiovascular imaging in raising the suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis, confirming the diagnosis, providing risk assessment and detection of myocardial changes in response to therapy. The clinical use of multimodality imaging in diagnosing cardiac amyloidosis is illustrated through a case-based approach. Finally, the emerging role of cardiac positron emission tomography as well as artificial intelligence in cardiac amyloidosis is discussed.

Conclusions

Searching for CA in specific settings allows to identify a relatively high number of cases who may be eligible for treatment if the diagnosis is unequivocal (i.e. when there is a combination of evidence of amyloid deposits, structural heart disease, and symptoms of cardiac disease). ATTR‐CA accounts for many cases of CA across the different settings, but AL‐CA is not infrequent and should be searched. Median age at diagnosis falls in the eighth or ninth decades. Many patients diagnosed with CA are women (for example, 36% of cases of CA among patients operated for CTS).

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^d6cc7200]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis—natriuretic peptide biomarkers show diagnostic and prognostic utility: Elevations in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) occur even without evidence of clinical heart failure (HF) or increased wall stress, and increased natriuretic peptide levels suggest cardiac involvement with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 90%. Elevated BNP levels have been demonstrated to predict development of clinical cardiac involvement in the future, have been shown to predict prognosis and mortality, and decrease with chemotherapeutic treatment of AL amyloidosis.
