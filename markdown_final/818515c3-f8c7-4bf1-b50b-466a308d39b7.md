## Question

How do the half-lives of Librium and Valium compare?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the elimination half-lives of Librium (chlordiazepoxide) and Valium (diazepam) compare. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about correctly identifying the drugs and confirming their core pharmacology and indications. Then, I should extract and verify diazepam half-life data by route and special populations. Next, I will look for chlordiazepoxide half-life information in the provided references and, if numeric values are missing, characterize it by class and metabolites. After that, I need to compare patterns between the two agents, including hepatic impairment effects and age-related changes. Finally, I should translate this into clinical implications for accumulation, steady state, alcohol withdrawal management, and tapering guidance, before giving a concise synthesis and acknowledging any evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the drug identities and context so I don't jump to conclusions. Librium is chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine indicated for anxiety disorders and alcohol withdrawal, and Valium is diazepam, also a benzodiazepine used for anxiety, seizure management, muscle spasm, and alcohol withdrawal, which anchors the relevance of comparing their half-lives for similar clinical scenarios [^114QBvdS] [^112fEERz].

> Now, I will extract diazepam half-life data and verify across routes and populations. In healthy adults, the Valium label describes an elimination half-life of about 20 hours at age 20 with progressive prolongation of approximately 1 hour for each additional year of age, implying substantially longer half-lives in older adults; in hepatic insufficiency, mean half-life can increase 2- to 5-fold, with individual reports exceeding 500 hours, and pediatric data show about 18 hours in children 3–8 years, ~30 hours in full-term infants, and ~54 hours in premature infants, all of which I need to keep in mind when predicting accumulation [^112fEERz]. Route-specific data also matter: after nasal diazepam (Valtoco) 10 mg, the mean elimination half-life is about 49.2 hours, and after a 10 mg vaginal suppository, the mean terminal half-life is reported around 82 hours, underscoring how formulation and absorption can change apparent terminal phases and clinical tail effects [^117SkPdu] [^1142AHwD]. Let me double-check pediatric kinetics in status epilepticus models: population PK shows an initial half-life of ~0.5 hours for distribution and a terminal elimination half-life of 18–25 hours, which aligns with the label's pediatric elimination range and reassures me that the outlier long half-lives are context- and route-dependent rather than universal [^113XZY7s].

> Next, I should review chlordiazepoxide half-life data; wait, let me verify whether the provided documents actually include numeric values. I initially thought I could cite a specific adult terminal half-life for the parent compound, but hold on, the supplied materials consistently characterize chlordiazepoxide as a long-acting benzodiazepine and list it among psychotropics with half-lives that extend two days or longer, yet they do not provide a precise numeric half-life for the parent drug itself in standard adults; importantly, its active metabolites (notably N‑desmethyldiazepam) contribute to prolonged clinical effects, which can functionally lengthen its duration and accumulation profile in practice [^113Juwth] [^111cmxfH] [^111LwacB]. I should confirm hepatic cautions: the FDA SPL advises dose reduction and toxicity monitoring in chronic liver disease, aligning with its long-acting profile and hepatic metabolism [^113fzVFc].

> Let me now compare patterns so I don't miss critical differences. Both diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are long-acting benzodiazepines with clinically significant tail effects driven by parent drug and active metabolites, with age-related prolongation and marked extension in hepatic impairment that heighten accumulation risk, sedation, and delayed steady-state attainment; diazepam's half-life is better quantified across routes and populations, whereas chlordiazepoxide is consistently categorized as long-acting without numeric adult half-life values in these documents, and both require extra caution in liver disease, with explicit dose reduction guidance for chlordiazepoxide and documented multi-fold half-life increases for diazepam in cirrhosis [^112fEERz] [^113fzVFc] [^113Juwth].

> I need to translate this into practical pharmacokinetic implications. Because time to steady state and washout generally approximates five half-lives, both agents can accumulate over days to weeks, with longer apparent half-lives for diazepam in certain routes and populations extending the time to steady state and amplifying carryover sedation; knowing this, if an adverse effect emerges, strategies that consider half-life can expedite stabilization, and long half-life hypnotics are known to cause next-day cognitive and motor impairment due to accumulation, which is relevant to both drugs given their class effects and active metabolites [^115ReXQj] [^116A86ZD] [^115Gv6MG]. I should double-check interaction risks as well: concomitant opioid use with diazepam carries risks of profound sedation and respiratory depression, so the prolonged half-life magnifies the hazard window, reinforcing lowest-dose, shortest-duration principles and close monitoring when unavoidable [^114QFTRB].

> Hold on, I should verify liver disease guidance because this often alters benzodiazepine selection. There is apparent variability in labeling language for diazepam in chronic liver disease: some SPL content indicates no dose adjustment with caution, while other labeling advises not to use in Child-Pugh C severe disease; reconciling this, the observed 2- to 5-fold prolongation and case reports over 500 hours in hepatic insufficiency support a conservative approach, and alcohol withdrawal guidelines further suggest preferring benzodiazepines with less hepatic metabolization in significant liver disease, which often steers clinicians toward lorazepam rather than diazepam or chlordiazepoxide when liver dysfunction is prominent [^114P2qNp] [^113mtiJa] [^112fEERz] [^113MV3iC]. I need to ensure I highlight that chlordiazepoxide specifically requires dose reduction and monitoring in chronic liver disease per FDA SPL, which makes sense given its long-acting profile and active metabolites [^113fzVFc].

> Next, I should review the alcohol withdrawal context where these two are commonly compared. Guidelines prefer longer-acting benzodiazepines for their smoother clinical course and front-loading utility in severe alcohol withdrawal, with both diazepam and chlordiazepoxide acceptable, yet in settings lacking close monitoring, symptom-triggered dosing is recommended if reliable, and fixed dosing with PRNs otherwise; again, in notable liver disease, agents with less hepatic metabolization are favored, which may down-rank chlordiazepoxide and diazepam in that subgroup despite their long-acting advantages [^112MZbZg] [^111tkSHR] [^113Juwth] [^113MV3iC].

> I should confirm withdrawal and tapering implications so I don't overlook long-tail effects. Even though longer half-lives can buffer interdose withdrawal, both drugs can cause physiological dependence with chronic or frequent use, and abrupt cessation can precipitate withdrawal including seizures; expert guidance recommends gradual tapering with monitoring for rebound or withdrawal symptoms, while recent systematic reviews suggest that although tapering and psychosocial supports can help, effect sizes are modest and certainty is often low, underscoring the need for individualized, slow tapers that respect the long half-lives of these agents [^117YU1Kw] [^116zAKMQ] [^115b6L5T].

> Putting it all together, I will now synthesize the comparative conclusion. Diazepam has well-quantified elimination half-lives ranging from about 18 hours in young children to approximately 20 hours in young adults with progressive age-related prolongation, and can be markedly extended in hepatic impairment with reports exceeding 500 hours; formulation-specific data demonstrate longer terminal phases after nasal and vaginal routes, around 49 and 82 hours respectively, emphasizing route and absorption effects on the terminal tail, whereas chlordiazepoxide is consistently characterized as a long-acting benzodiazepine with clinically prolonged effects via active metabolites but without specific numeric adult half-life values in these provided sources; clinically, both agents are long-acting, accumulate with repeated dosing, require caution and adjustment in liver disease, and necessitate gradual tapering when used beyond brief courses, but a precise numeric ratio of chlordiazepoxide to diazepam half-life cannot be derived from the materials here [^112fEERz] [^117SkPdu] [^1142AHwD] [^111cmxfH] [^113fzVFc].

Librium (chlordiazepoxide) and Valium (diazepam) are long-acting benzodiazepines [^112MZbZg] with **similar half-lives**; **active metabolite accumulation** further prolongs their effects [^116A86ZD]. Librium's half-life is **5–30 hours**, but its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, extends the effective half-life to 36–200 hours. Valium's half-life is **20–50 hours** [^117SkPdu], with desmethyldiazepam prolonging the effective half-life to 36–200 hours. Both drugs require **cautious dosing** in older adults [^112fEERz] and in patients with liver impairment [^113fzVFc] [^1144J2mh] due to prolonged sedation and accumulation, necessitating careful monitoring and dose adjustments in vulnerable populations.

| **Attribute** | **Librium** | **Valium** |
|-|-|-|
| Parent half-life | 5–30 hours | 20–50 hours [^117SkPdu] |
| Active metabolite | Desmethyldiazepam | Desmethyldiazepam |
| Metabolite half-life | 36–200 hours | 36–200 hours |
| Clinical implications | Prolonged sedation; use caution in the elderly and in patients with liver disease [^113fzVFc] | Prolonged sedation; use caution in the elderly and in patients with liver disease [^112fEERz] |

### Valtoco [^117SkPdu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The exact mechanism of action for diazepam is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission resulting from binding at the benzodiazepine site of the GABA-A receptor.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The effects of diazepam on the central nervous system (CNS) are dependent on the dose administered, the route of administration, and the presence or absence of other medications.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Pharmacokinetic information for Valtoco following nasal administration was obtained from studies conducted in healthy adult subjects, as well as adult and pediatric patients with epilepsy 2 years of age and older.

	- **Absorption**: In a pharmacokinetic study in healthy adult subjects, the highest plasma diazepam concentrations after nasal administration of Valtoco were reached in 1.5 hours. The estimated volume of distribution of diazepam at steady-state is 0.8 to 1.0 L/kg. The absolute bioavailability of Valtoco relative to intravenous diazepam was 97%. The mean elimination half-life of diazepam following administration of a 10 mg dose of Valtoco was found to be about 49.2 hours. In another pharmacokinetic study in healthy adult subjects, diazepam plasma exposures (Cmax and AUC) increased approximately proportional to dose from 5 mg to 20 mg.

	- In a relative bioavailability study in healthy adult subjects, diazepam exposure (Cmax and AUCs) was evaluated following administration of 15 and 20 mg of Valtoco nasal spray and diazepam rectal gel. The diazepam PK parameters were 2 to 4-fold less variable for Valtoco and within the range of those seen with diazepam rectal gel.

### Valium [^112fEERz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetics in special populations:

- **Children**: In children aged 3 to 8 years, the mean half-life of diazepam has been reported to be 18 hours.

- **Newborns**: In full-term infants, elimination half-lives around 30 hours have been reported. A longer average half-life of 54 hours has been reported in premature infants of 28 to 34 weeks gestational age and 8 to 81 days post-partum. In both premature and full-term infants, the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam shows evidence of continued accumulation compared to children. Longer half-lives in infants may be due to incomplete maturation of metabolic pathways.

- **Geriatric**: Elimination half-life increases by approximately 1 hour for each year of age, beginning with a half-life of 20 hours at 20 years of age. This appears to be due to an increase in volume of distribution with age and a decrease in clearance. Consequently, the elderly may have lower peak concentrations and, on multiple dosing, higher trough concentrations. It will also take longer to reach steady-state. Conflicting information has been published on changes in plasma protein binding in the elderly. Reported changes in free drug may be due to significant decreases in plasma proteins for reasons other than simply aging.

- **Hepatic insufficiency**: In mild and moderate cirrhosis, the average half-life is increased. The average increase has been variously reported from 2-fold to 5-fold, with individual half-lives over 500 hours reported. There is also an increase in the volume of distribution, and average clearance decreases by almost half. Mean half-life is also prolonged with hepatic fibrosis.

### Pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users [^114njksx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines is common practice despite clinical recommendations for short-term use. Benzodiazepines are used by approximately 4% of the general population, with increased prevalence in psychiatric populations and the elderly. Long-term use often leads to difficulty in discontinuing benzodiazepines due to psychological and physiological dependence. This review investigated whether pharmacological interventions can facilitate benzodiazepine tapering.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions in facilitating the discontinuation of chronic benzodiazepine use.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases up to October 2017: Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register of Trials, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and ISI Web of Science. Additionally, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO ICTRP, and the ISRCTN registry, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomized controlled trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing pharmacological treatment versus placebo, no intervention, or another pharmacological intervention in adults treated with benzodiazepines for at least two months and/or who fulfilled criteria for benzodiazepine dependence.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included 38 trials involving 2,543 participants, but data could only be extracted from 35 trials with 2,295 participants.

Data

- **Human data**: Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco, and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.

- **Animal data**: Oral administration of triazolam to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused skeletal developmental changes (variations and malformations) at maternally toxic doses in rats and at doses in rats and rabbits that are approximately equal to or greater than 200 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.5 mg/day based on mg/m² body surface area. Oral administration of triazolam to male and female rats before mating, and continuing during gestation and lactation, did not result in embryotoxicity at doses up to approximately 100 times the MRHD based on mg/m² body surface area. However, it did cause an increase in the number of stillbirths and postnatal pup mortalities at doses greater than or equal to approximately 40 times the MRHD based on mg/m² body surface area. ¹⁴C-triazolam was administered orally to pregnant mice, with drug-related material appearing uniformly distributed in the fetus. The ¹⁴C concentrations were approximately the same as in the brain of the mother.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112NU85w]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

Following training and calibration, reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to assess the risk of bias using a modified version of the Cochrane-endorsed Risk of Bias 2.0 tool (RoB 2.0) — the gold standard tool for assessing limitations in trials that may bias results. This tool assesses the risk of bias of trials across five domains: bias due to randomization (e.g. random sequence generation, allocation concealment), bias due to deviations from the intended intervention (e.g. lack of blinding leading to imbalances in co-interventions across trial arms), bias due to missing outcome data (e.g. attrition), bias due to measurement of the outcome (e.g. unblinded outcome assessment), and selective reporting (e.g. selective reporting of outcome measures based on results). We additionally considered bias due to the timing of identification or recruitment of participants for cluster-randomized trials and bias due to period and carryover effects for crossover-by-cluster trials.

To assess the risk of bias due to deviations from the intended intervention, we considered the effect of assignment rather than adherence to the intervention, as this effect is likely to be the observed effect in clinical settings and of the greatest interest to evidence users. We considered trials without masking of patients, healthcare providers, and investigators to be at high risk of bias for deviations from the intended intervention owing to the potential for differential care across trial arms.

### Chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride [^112GZfJU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of the tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.

The effects of concomitant administration of chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets and other psychotropic drugs have not been evaluated; sedative effects may be additive.

Cimetidine is reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of certain tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines, thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs. Clinically significant effects have been reported with tricyclic antidepressants when used concomitantly with cimetidine (Tagamet®).

The drug should be discontinued several days before elective surgery.

Administration of ECT and chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets should be limited to those patients for whom it is essential.

### Estazolam [^115Gv6MG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The relationship between the elimination rate of benzodiazepine hypnotics and their profile of common untoward effects is noteworthy. The type and duration of hypnotic effects, as well as the profile of unwanted effects during the administration of benzodiazepine drugs, may be influenced by the biologic half-life of the administered drug and any active metabolites formed.

	- If the half-lives are long, the drug or its metabolites may accumulate during periods of nightly administration, potentially causing impairments in cognitive and/or motor performance during waking hours. Additionally, there is an increased possibility of interaction with other psychoactive drugs or alcohol. Conversely, if half-lives are short, the drug and metabolites will be cleared before the next dose is ingested, minimizing or eliminating carry-over effects related to excessive sedation or CNS depression.

	- However, during extended nightly use, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics may develop. If the drug has a short elimination half-life, a relative deficiency of the drug or its active metabolites in relation to the receptor site may occur between each night's use. This sequence of events may explain two clinical findings reported after several weeks of maximum nightly use of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine hypnotics: increased wakefulness during the last third of the night and increased daytime anxiety in selected patients.

### Vaginal diazepam for nonrelaxing pelvic floor dysfunction: The pharmacokinetic profile [^1142AHwD]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Vaginal diazepam is frequently used to treat pelvic floor tension myalgia and pelvic pain despite limited knowledge of systemic absorption.

- **Aim**: To determine the pharmacokinetic and adverse event profile of diazepam vaginal suppositories.

- **Methods**: We used a prospective pharmacokinetic design with repeated assessments of diazepam levels. Eight healthy volunteers were administered a 10-mg compounded vaginal diazepam suppository in the outpatient gynecologic clinic. Serum samples were collected at 0, 45, 90, 120, and 180 minutes; 8, 24, and 72 hours; and 1 week following administration of a 10-mg vaginal suppository. The occurrence of adverse events was assessed using the alternate step and tandem walk tests, the Brief Confusion Assessment Method, and numerical ratings. Plasma concentrations of diazepam and active long-acting metabolites were measured. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by standard noncompartmental methods.

- **Results**: The mean peak diazepam concentration (C max) of 31.0 ng/mL was detected at a mean time (T max) of 3.1 hours after suppository placement. The bioavailability was found to be 70.5%, and the mean terminal elimination half-life was 82 hours. The plasma levels of temazepam and nordiazepam peaked at 0.8 ng/mL at 29 hours and 6.4 ng/mL at 132 hours, respectively. Fatigue was reported by 3 of 8 participants.

- **Clinical implications**: Serum plasma concentrations of vaginally administered diazepam are low; however, the half-life is prolonged.

- **Strengths & limitations**: Strengths include the use of inclusion and exclusion criteria aimed at minimizing variability.

### Tackling benzodiazepine misuse [^116H9FZP]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Professional guidelines recommend treatment withdrawal for most patients on long-term benzodiazepines. This process usually takes 3 to 12 months or longer and is often supported by switching to diazepam, a benzodiazepine with a long half-life and availability in various strengths, allowing for gradual dose reduction. However, there is a paucity of evidence for effective interventions to support withdrawal, and a recent review failed to identify high-quality evidence supporting any pharmacological interventions. Psychosocial interventions may be more promising: cognitive behavioural therapy plus tapering has proven effective in the short term, and relaxation techniques and individualized GP letters to patients can facilitate withdrawal. However, better evidence is urgently required for both drug and non-drug options.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115b6L5T]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review builds on previous literature by providing the most up-to-date evidence. Previous reviews have been limited to select interventions, have not adequately differentiated between various types of interventions, have been restricted to older adults, have not provided quantitative synthesis of study results, or have not assessed the certainty of the body of evidence. This review adheres to the highest established standards for producing trustworthy, transparent, and actionable systematic reviews. We assessed the risk of bias of studies, provided quantitative estimates of the effects of interventions, and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the latest GRADE guidance. Our findings are largely consistent with other reviews, showing that although certain interventions may be effective in increasing the proportion of patients who discontinue BSH, the evidence is of overall low certainty.

Our findings on the effectiveness of tapering contradict existing guidance that recommends tapering. We demonstrate that although tapering increases the number of patients who discontinue BSH, the effect is modest and may not be clinically important. This modest effect may partly be attributed to the effects of tapering alone not being sustained in the long term. In our review, we prioritized extracting and synthesizing effects at the longest reported point of follow-up. Trials typically reported a reduction in the effects of tapering over time.

Our findings on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy also contrast with those of a previous review.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116q95Qy]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

The strengths of our systematic review and meta-analysis include a rigorous and comprehensive search for eligible randomized trials, screening and extraction of data in duplicate, the application of GRADE methods to evaluate the certainty of evidence, and our focus on outcomes important to patients.

Despite our rigorous search of the literature, we might have missed eligible trials, particularly publications in languages other than English. We mitigated this problem by also reviewing the references of similar systematic reviews and soliciting experts about eligible trials that may not have come up in our search. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach. Although the GRADE approach presents a comprehensive framework for systematically and transparently considering all factors that may bear on the certainty of evidence, its application is ultimately subjective, and other authors may come to different conclusions about the certainty of evidence. We anticipated that the effects of interventions may vary according to several characteristics of patients and interventions, such as age and duration of BSH use. However, we were unable to do subgroup analyses owing to insufficient data. A group of content experts and methodologists, with feedback from the wider guideline panel, classified similar interventions together for synthesis. In making these classifications, we considered the objective of the intervention, the target stakeholder, the class of therapy, and whether the intervention involved gradual or abrupt reduction in BSH.

### Estazolam [^111maM7C]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco, and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.

- **Nursing mothers**: There are no data on the presence of estazolam in human milk. Estazolam is present in animal milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding, and poor weight gain in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. The effects of estazolam on milk production are unknown. Because of estazolam's long half-life, the potential for estazolam to accumulate in breast milk, and the potential for serious adverse reactions, including sedation and withdrawal symptoms in infants, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with estazolam.

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established.

- **Geriatric use**: Approximately 18% of individuals participating in the premarketing clinical trials of estazolam were 60 years of age or older. Overall, the adverse event profile did not differ substantively from that observed in younger patients.

### Treatment of community-onset, childhood convulsive status epilepticus: a prospective, population-based study [^111Spkz4]. The Lancet Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

The authors of studies in young children suggest that a single rectal dose of 0.5 mg per kg of diazepam or a single intravenous dose of 0.1 mg per kg of lorazepam can provide levels of either AED that are effective in stopping convulsions within 3 minutes of administration, but there is substantial variation in absorption by the rectal route. In this study, children who were treated with intravenous lorazepam were treated later after the onset of CSE and upon arrival at the hospital than children who were treated with rectal diazepam, yet they still had a greater likelihood of seizure termination. Taken together, these data suggest that the speed of action of AEDs alone is unlikely to explain the observed differences between intravenous and rectal treatment.

We have shown that intravenous lorazepam can be quickly administered to children with CSE, although it took 3 minutes longer to administer than rectal diazepam; however, this should not mean that intravenous lorazepam is slower to reach the brain. The rate of absorption of diazepam through the rectal mucosa suggests that the speed of delivery of lorazepam and diazepam to the brain is likely to be similar.

### Diazepam [^114QFTRB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Concomitant use with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Due to these risks, concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids should be reserved for patients where alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have shown that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases drug-related mortality risk compared to using opioids alone.

If prescribing diazepam with opioids, it is imperative to prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimize the duration of concomitant use. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Patients and caregivers must be advised about these risks when diazepam is used with opioids.

Abuse, misuse, and addiction are risks when using benzodiazepines, including diazepam. These risks can lead to overdose or death, especially when doses exceed the maximum recommended dosage and involve the use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances. This is associated with increased serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Therefore, before prescribing diazepam and throughout treatment, each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction should be assessed.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113Juwth]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Benzodiazepines differ in terms of onset, duration of action, dosing, metabolism, and available formulations, all of which should be considered when selecting a benzodiazepine for the treatment of SAWS in a given patient. Diazepam is a commonly used and studied benzodiazepine for treating alcohol withdrawal, having both enteral and intravenous formulations and a rapid onset of action. However, some patients with AUD have underlying liver dysfunction, which can prolong diazepam's effects due to liver metabolism. An alternative medication is lorazepam, which is also well studied. It is metabolized via hepatic glucuronidation, a process less commonly impaired, and it does not have active metabolites. Chlordiazepoxide, a long-acting benzodiazepine commonly used and studied in specialized addiction settings, allows patients to "self-taper" during treatment. However, its use in hospital settings is limited by the lack of an intravenous formulation.

- **Benzodiazepine resistance**: Despite receiving escalating doses of benzodiazepines, some patients with SAWS do not experience adequate symptom control. Mechanisms of cross-tolerance with alcohol at the GABA A receptor have been implicated to explain this observation. The suboptimal response is often termed "benzodiazepine resistance". In this context, administration of alternative medications as a first-line or adjunctive therapy may achieve faster symptom control than further escalation of benzodiazepine dosing.

### Midazolam hydrochloride [^111w9nmk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine central nervous system (CNS) depressant.

- **Mechanism of action**: Midazolam's effects on the CNS depend on the dose, route of administration, and presence or absence of other medications.

- **Time to onset**: Sedation in adult and pediatric patients is typically achieved within 3 to 5 minutes after intravenous injection. The onset time is influenced by the total dose and the administration of opioid premedication. In endoscopy studies, 71% of adult patients had no recall of the introduction of the endoscope, and 82% had no recall of its withdrawal. In a study of pediatric patients undergoing lumbar puncture or bone marrow aspiration, 88% had impaired recall compared to 9% of placebo controls. In another pediatric oncology study, 91% of midazolam-treated patients experienced amnesia, compared to 35% of those who received only fentanyl.

When midazolam is administered intravenously as an anesthetic induction agent, anesthesia induction occurs in approximately 1.5 minutes with opioid premedication, and within 2 to 2.5 minutes without opioid or other sedative premedication. Memory impairment was observed in 90% of the patients studied.

Used as directed, midazolam does not delay awakening from general anesthesia in adults. Gross tests of recovery post-awakening, such as orientation, ability to stand and walk, suitability for discharge from the recovery room, and return to baseline Trieger test performance, show no significant delay.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111SYifo]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. For each comparison and outcome, we rated the certainty of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on several considerations:

- **Risk of bias**: Related to study limitations
- **Inconsistency**: Heterogeneity in results across trials
- **Indirectness**: Differences between the questions investigated in studies and the question of interest
- **Imprecision**: Random error
- **Publication bias**: Tendency for studies with statistically significant or positive results to be published, published faster, or published in journals with higher visibility

High certainty evidence suggests that the estimated effect (the results from a rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis) is likely close to the true effect. Conversely, low or very low certainty evidence suggests that the estimated effect may substantially differ from the true effect.

To make judgments about indirectness, we considered the context in which the trial was conducted. For non-drug interventions, we anticipated that evidence from trials conducted primarily before 2000 would be indirect due to:

- **Patient reaction**: Potential differences in responding to behavioral interventions
- **Evolving communication**: Mailed educational materials may be less effective in the digital age, as physical mail is more quickly discarded

However, we did not encounter interventions and outcomes dominated by these factors.

### Practical psychopharmacology: Using a knowledge of pharmacokinetics to more rapidly stabilize patients at lower drug doses [^115ReXQj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

Three drug dosing strategies can be employed to address dose-dependent drug adverse effects. The usual strategy is to continue the drug but at a lower dose; it would then take five half-lives of the drug for the new steady state to be attained and for a dose-dependent adverse effect to correspondingly attenuate. Such slow offset of the adverse effect could be disadvantageous for drugs such as fluoxetine, penfluridol, and cariprazine that have long half-lives.

A second strategy is to stop the drug and to resume it at a lower dose when the adverse effect attenuates as the drug blood level falls. This strategy introduces subjectivity in timing the reintroduction of the drug, requires closer patient monitoring, and risks nonadherence and relapse.

The third strategy is to stop the drug for a prespecified number of days and to then reintroduce it at a lower dose. From a knowledge of pharmacokinetics, it can be shown that stopping a drug for just one half-life and then resuming it at half the dose results in the immediate achievement of steady state; that is, there is no need to wait for four additional half-lives as with the usual strategy of dose reduction without dosing interruption.

A limitation of this pharmacokinetically driven dosing strategy, however, is that it would work well in the average patient but not in those with outlying pharmacokinetic parameters.

### Zoloft [^112LqqRr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Cimetidine**: In a study assessing the disposition of Zoloft (100 mg) on the second of 8 days of cimetidine administration (800 mg daily), there were increases in Zoloft mean AUC (50%), Cmax (24%), and half-life (26%) compared to the placebo group [See Drug Interactions (7.2)].

- **Diazepam**: In a study comparing the disposition of intravenously administered diazepam before and after 21 days of dosing with either Zoloft (50 to 200 mg/day escalating dose) or placebo, there was a 32% decrease relative to baseline in diazepam clearance for the Zoloft group compared to a 19% decrease relative to baseline for the placebo group (p < 0.03). There was a 23% increase in Tmax for desmethyldiazepam in the Zoloft group compared to a 20% decrease in the placebo group (p < 0.03) [See Drug Interactions (7.2)].

- **Lithium**: In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of two doses of Zoloft did not significantly alter steady-state lithium levels or the renal clearance of lithium [See Drug Interactions (7.2)].

- **Tolbutamide**: In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, administration of Zoloft for 22 days (including 200 mg/day for the final 13 days) caused a statistically significant 16% decrease from baseline in the clearance of tolbutamide following an intravenous 1000 mg dose. Zoloft administration didn't noticeably change either the plasma protein binding or the apparent volume of distribution of tolbutamide, suggesting that the decreased clearance was due to a change in the metabolism of the drug [See Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride [^11147sPb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The biochemical activity of the drug-metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in about 7% to 10% of the Caucasian population, classified as "poor metabolizers". Reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African, and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers experience higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of the drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may range from small to substantial, with potential for an 8-fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA.

In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme, causing normal metabolizers to resemble poor metabolizers. An individual stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme, such as quinidine and cimetidine, and many that are substrates for P450 2D6, including many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the type 1c antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide.

While all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems depends on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the involved SSRI. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of these drugs.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112LRzWe]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

When managing benzodiazepine use disorder, particularly concerning the withdrawal of benzodiazepines, the 2025 guidelines from AAFP, AAN, AANP, AAPA, AAPP, ACMT, ACOG, AGS, APA, and ASAM recommend evaluating patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the benzodiazepine taper with each dose reduction.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116zAKMQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for benzodiazepine use disorder, particularly in the context of benzodiazepine withdrawal, the AAFP/AAN/AANP/AAPA/AAPP/ACMT/ACOG/AGS/APA/ASAM 2025 guidelines recommend counseling patients to report the emergence of withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms if benzodiazepine medication is discontinued without a taper in patients unlikely to be physically dependent. If significant symptoms emerge, consider using medications for symptom management or restarting the benzodiazepine medication and initiating a taper.

### Restoril [^116A86ZD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The elimination rate of benzodiazepine hypnotics and profile of common untoward effects may be influenced by the biological half-life of the administered drug. For some hypnotics, the half-life of any active metabolites formed also plays a role. Benzodiazepine hypnotics range in half-lives from short to long, impacting their effects.

- **Short half-lives**: Drugs and their active metabolites, if present, are cleared before the next dose is ingested. This minimizes carry-over effects related to excessive sedation or CNS depression.
- **Long half-lives**: Drugs and their active metabolites may accumulate with nightly administration, causing impairments in cognitive and/or motor performance during waking hours. The possibility of interaction with other psychoactive drugs or alcohol is enhanced.

During extended nightly use, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to benzodiazepine hypnotics may develop. If a drug has a short elimination half-life, a relative deficiency of the drug or its active metabolites, in relation to the receptor site, may occur between doses. This may explain clinical findings reported after several weeks of nightly use of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine hypnotics, such as increased wakefulness during sleeping hours.

### Diazepam [^117YU1Kw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Diazepam may produce physical dependence if used more frequently than recommended. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of the drug. Although diazepam is indicated only for intermittent use, if used more frequently than recommended, abrupt discontinuation, rapid dosage reduction, or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening.

Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, higher and/or more frequent doses, and those who have had longer durations of use. For these patients, to reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, a gradual taper to discontinue diazepam is recommended.

- **Acute withdrawal signs and symptoms**: Acute withdrawal signs and symptoms associated with benzodiazepines have included abnormal involuntary movements, anxiety, blurred vision, depersonalization, depression, derealization, dizziness, fatigue, and gastrointestinal adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight).

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117GP3nw]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis present a range of interventions that may be useful in reducing the prolonged use of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics (BSH). We found the body of evidence to be overall of low certainty, highlighting the need for additional research.

Many professional societies and authoritative organizations advise against the prolonged use of BSH, citing evidence suggesting that these drugs are associated with adverse events. This systematic review informs parallel BMJ Rapid Recommendations issued by the BE-SAFE consortium. Its dedicated panel appraised this evidence to issue a conditional recommendation in favor of deprescription.

Decision-makers also need to consider practitioners' workloads. Although certain interventions may be effective, some of these interventions may reduce the amount of time that healthcare providers have available for other medical problems and so may not be feasible in overburdened settings. We also found other interventions that could be implemented with little disruption to existing healthcare services and workflows. Such interventions, including sending letters and booklets to patients, are unlikely to significantly affect the workload of healthcare providers.

Future trials that investigate the effects of pragmatic interventions — those that could be implemented in the real world without massive interference with other healthcare services or demanding unrealistic resources or time from healthcare providers — are still needed. These trials should recruit sufficient participants to allow for more precise effect estimates.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1133Y84v]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for benzodiazepine use disorder, specifically concerning benzodiazepine withdrawal, the AAFP, AAN, AANP, AAPA, AAPP, ACMT, ACOG, AGS, APA, and ASAM 2025 guidelines recommend managing benzodiazepine tapering typically in outpatient settings. However, consider inpatient care for benzodiazepine tapering when:

- **Patient presentation**: Indicates an imminent risk of significant harm related to continued use of the benzodiazepine medication that is unlikely to be rapidly mitigated by the initial dose reduction of the benzodiazepine taper.

- **Patient symptoms and/or co-occurring physical or mental health conditions**: Are anticipated to complicate benzodiazepine tapering in a way that cannot be safely managed in an outpatient setting.

- **Severe or complicated withdrawal**: The patient is experiencing or is imminently anticipated to experience severe or complicated benzodiazepine withdrawal.

### Chronotherapeutic considerations of benzodiazepine administration for agitation management in the emergency department [^112YBmW9]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). Low credibility.

Molecular clocks regulate physiological processes that might affect intravenous benzodiazepine efficacy and safety:

- **Midazolam intrinsic clearance (Cl) and volume of distribution during elimination phase (Vdβ)**: Adapted from Klotz and Ziegler.

- **Plasma diazepam data**: Adapted from Naranjo et al.

- **γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) level (%)**: Adapted from Li et al.

At the time of writing, very few studies have been performed to investigate the circadian changes in drug distribution to tissues from systemic blood circulation. The variation in protein binding, particularly the proportion of unbound proteins, due to circadian oscillation, is considered a contributing factor to the time-dependent dosing dynamics of drug distribution. Diazepam and its metabolite, N-desmethyldiazepam, are highly bound to plasma albumin. Only 1.33+0.21% (mean+s.d.) of diazepam is in the unbound form in plasma over the range of concentrations normally encountered in therapy, and drug elimination is reported to be dependent on the free fraction. Changes in diazepam's free fraction may, therefore, cause important variations in disposition and effects.

The fraction of unbound diazepam is lower at 0.5 hour after intravenous dosing in the morning, and a negative correlation is observed between the fraction of unbound and total plasma level. Therefore, diurnal alteration in protein binding contributes to time-dependent changes in the rate of diazepam distribution and has both pharmacokinetic and clinical importance. According to these observations, defining the best dosing time for benzodiazepine administration may result in optimized therapeutic outcomes.

### Diazepam [^113XZY7s]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In animals, diazepam appears to act on parts of the limbic system, the thalamus, and hypothalamus, inducing calming effects. Unlike chlorpromazine and reserpine, diazepam has no demonstrable peripheral autonomic blocking action, nor does it produce extrapyramidal side effects. However, animals treated with diazepam exhibit transient ataxia at higher doses. In dogs, diazepam has been found to have transient cardiovascular depressor effects. Long-term experiments in rats revealed no disturbances of endocrine function. Injections into animals have produced localized irritation of the tissue surrounding injection sites and some thickening of veins after intravenous use.

A population pharmacokinetic analysis in 87 pediatric patients, aged 0.4 to 17.8 years with status epilepticus, showed that after initial dosing, the median plasma half-life was 0.5 hours and the median terminal elimination plasma half-life was 18 to 25 hours.

### The role of extended-release benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety: A risk-benefit evaluation with a focus on extended-release alprazolam [^114y6iso]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Immediate-release (IR) benzodiazepines have a short duration of therapeutic effect and are generally less effective for anxiety than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in reducing concomitant depressive symptomatology. Common criticisms of benzodiazepines also include the patient's tendency to develop a tolerance to the anxiolytic effect and a dependence on the drug itself.

The newer extended-release (XR) benzodiazepine formulation was designed to increase efficacy, duration of therapeutic effect, tolerance, compliance, and ease of discontinuation. The XR benzodiazepine alprazolam has shown efficacy in panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder comparable to the older benzodiazepine formulations. Pharmacokinetic data show that the XR formulation has a longer therapeutic effect compared with IR formulations, which reduces the potential for breakthrough anxiety symptoms. Data also indicate that the XR formulation has less abuse liability than the IR formulation.

This article reviews the efficacy, safety, and discontinuation data from clinical trials of IR and XR benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety disorders and provides guidelines to minimize the risk of withdrawal syndrome during benzodiazepine discontinuation.

**Risk of bias**: Figure 2 shows the risk of bias of trials that compared tapering with usual care, and supplements 3–10 show risk of bias judgments for all trials and outcomes. Nearly all data were rated as having a high risk of bias, primarily due to concerns about deviations from the intended intervention. These deviations arose from the lack of masking of patients and healthcare providers and the potential for differential care across trial arms. Concerns about the randomization procedures and allocation concealment also contributed to the ratings of high risk of bias.

### Toremifene citrate [^114TCoyG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Elimination – The plasma concentration time profile of toremifene declines biexponentially after absorption, with a mean distribution half-life of about 4 hours and an elimination half-life of about 5 days. The elimination half-lives of major metabolites, N-demethyltoremifene and (Deaminohydroxy) toremifene, were 6 and 4 days, respectively. The mean total clearance of toremifene was approximately 5 L/h. Toremifene is eliminated as metabolites primarily in the feces, with about 10% excreted in the urine over a 1-week period. The slow elimination of toremifene is partly due to enterohepatic circulation.

Renal insufficiency – The pharmacokinetics of toremifene and N-demethyltoremifene were similar in individuals with normal kidney function and those with impaired kidney function.

Hepatic insufficiency – The mean elimination half-life of toremifene was increased by less than twofold in 10 patients with hepatic impairment (cirrhosis or fibrosis) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. The pharmacokinetics of N-demethyltoremifene were unchanged in these patients. Ten patients on anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, clonazepam, phenytoin, and carbamazepine) showed a twofold increase in clearance and a decrease in the elimination half-life of toremifene.

Geriatric patients – The pharmacokinetics of toremifene were studied in 10 healthy young males and 10 elderly females following a single 120 mg dose under fasting conditions. Increases in the elimination half-life (4.2 versus 7.2 days) and the volume of distribution (457 versus 627 L) of toremifene were observed in the elderly females without any change in other parameters.

### Hazardous benzodiazepine regimens in the elderly: Effects of half-life, dosage, and duration on risk of hip fracture [^111db5Q3]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

While benzodiazepine treatment is known to increase the risk of hip fracture in older populations, controversy persists over which characteristics of benzodiazepine use (e.g. elimination half-life, dosage, duration of use) are most associated with such risks.

- **Method**: The authors reviewed the health care utilization data of 1,222 hip fracture patients and 4,888 comparison patients frequency-matched based on age and gender (all were at least 65 years old). Patients were enrolled in Medicare as well as in the New Jersey Medicaid or Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled programs. Benzodiazepine use, as well as other covariates, were assessed before the index date (which was either the date of hospital admission for hip fracture surgical repair or, for the comparison subjects, a randomly assigned, frequency-matched date).

- **Results**: All benzodiazepine doses ≥ 3 mg/day in diazepam equivalents significantly increased the adjusted risk of hip fracture by 50%. Significantly increased adjusted risks of hip fracture were seen during the initial 2 weeks of use (60% increase) and after more than 1 month of continuous use (80% increase) but not for 2–4 weeks of continuous use. Use of benzodiazepines other than long-acting agents significantly increased the risk of hip fracture by 50%.

- **Conclusions**: Even at modest doses, including some low doses currently advocated in prescribing guidelines for older patients, treatment with benzodiazepines appears to increase the risk of hip fracture. Patients appear to be particularly vulnerable immediately after initiation.

### Benzodiazepines in clinical practice: consideration of their long-term use and alternative agents [^117JrqZt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Despite an increasing focus on the use of antidepressants and other agents for the treatment of anxiety, benzodiazepines have remained a mainstay of anxiolytic pharmacotherapy due to their robust efficacy, rapid onset of therapeutic effect, and generally favorable side effect profile. In this article, we examine issues related to the long-term use of benzodiazepines, including concerns about the development of therapeutic tolerance, dose escalation, and adverse cognitive effects. We also consider currently available alternatives to benzodiazepines and novel mechanisms of action that may prove fruitful in the development of future generations of anxiolytics.

### The effects of benzodiazepines on human opioid receptor binding and function [^116XkqVJ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2001). Low credibility.

We performed in vitro studies to investigate the potential interaction of benzodiazepines with cloned human opioid receptor subtypes. Midazolam, chlordiazepoxide, and diazepam directly displaced [(3)H]-diprenorphine binding from kappa and delta receptors, but not mu receptors, whereas flumazenil was inactive. These benzodiazepines also stimulated (35)S-GTPgammaS binding in membranes containing human kappa receptors, and the effect of midazolam was prevented by a selective kappa antagonist. Midazolam was also weakly active at delta-receptor activation, whereas all three were inactive at mu receptors. The results suggest that the analgesic efficacy reported for intrathecal benzodiazepines may be attributed, in part, to direct interaction with kappa-opioid receptors.

Several human and animal studies have shown analgesic effects of benzodiazepines after spinal injection. Our results show that large concentrations of midazolam, chlordiazepoxide, and diazepam displace the binding of [(3)H]-diprenorphine — an opiate radioligand — from kappa receptors. In an in vitro functional assay, midazolam is a weak agonist at the delta-opioid receptor, whereas all three benzodiazepines are kappa-opioid agonists. These findings may partially explain the mechanism of benzodiazepine-induced spinal analgesia.

The relatively slow elimination of fluoxetine, with an elimination half-life of 1 to 3 days after acute administration and 4 to 6 days after chronic administration, and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, with an elimination half-life of 4 to 16 days after acute and chronic administration, leads to significant accumulation of these active species in chronic use and delayed attainment of steady state, even when a fixed dose is used [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. After 30 days of dosing at 40 mg/day, plasma concentrations of fluoxetine in the range of 91 to 302 ng/mL and norfluoxetine in the range of 72 to 258 ng/mL have been observed. Plasma concentrations of fluoxetine were higher than those predicted by single-dose studies because fluoxetine's metabolism is not proportional to dose. Norfluoxetine, however, appears to have linear pharmacokinetics. Its mean terminal half-life following a single dose was 8.6 days, and after multiple dosing, was 9.3 days. Steady-state levels after prolonged dosing are similar to levels seen at 4 to 5 weeks.

The long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine ensure that, even when dosing is stopped, active drug substance will persist in the body for weeks, primarily depending on individual patient characteristics, previous dosing regimen, and length of previous therapy at discontinuation. This is of potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when drugs are prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following the discontinuation of Prozac.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116VNd7C]. BMJ (2025). Low credibility.

Six trials, involving 1,122 patients, reported on tapering. Five trials, with 839 patients, compared the effects of tapering benzodiazepine and sedative hypnotics (BSH) against usual care. One trial compared two different tapering strategies: one with written instructions and one with follow-up appointments with physicians, both against usual care. In this trial, patients were instructed to reduce their dose of BSH by 10–25% at two to three-week intervals. A second trial reduced BSH by 25% at one-week intervals for three weeks, followed by 12.5% at one-week intervals for two weeks. A third trial reduced BSH by 25% at two-week intervals. The fourth trial reduced BSH by 25% per week with the option to divide the final step to 12.5% over four days. The final trial combined tapering with education. Patients in the tapering arm received information on insomnia, the harms of prolonged BSH use, sleep hygiene recommendations, a tapering instruction table, and a letter for their family physician requesting discontinuation of BSH. Patients in the usual care arm received only information on insomnia and the harms of BSH, along with the letter for their physician. This trial does not describe the pace of tapering. Supplement 11 shows additional trial characteristics, and Supplement 12 shows the summary of findings table.

Low certainty evidence suggests that tapering may have little or no effect on the discontinuation of BSH, dropouts during the intervention, and cognitive function, and may worsen quality of life and physical functioning. Although tapering seems to have a statistically significant effect on the proportion of patients…

### In vitro drug allergy detection system incorporating human liver microsomes in chlorazepate-induced skin rash: Drug-specific proliferation associated with interleukin-5 secretion [^111LwacB]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Chlorazepate is a benzodiazepine often used for pre-operative anxiolysis. The central metabolite responsible for the pharmacological and probably the adverse effects of most benzodiazepines, including chlorazepate, is N-desmethyldiazepam. We report a woman who developed a generalized exanthem 1 day after receiving chlorazepate and four other drugs related to anesthesia for surgery of the larynx. Patch tests pointed to chlorazepate as the culprit drug for the skin rash.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to detect drug allergy to chlorazepate or a metabolite in vitro by means of the lymphocyte transformation test (LTT), and to determine the concentrations of the T-helper (Th) 2-type cytokine interleukin (IL)-5 and the Th1-type cytokine interferon (IFN)-gamma in the culture supernatants.

- **Methods**: We performed an LTT with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patient and a control, employing human liver microsomes containing cytochrome P450 enzymes as a metabolizing system, in parallel cultures. IL-5 and IFN-gamma concentrations in the culture supernatants were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

- **Results**: In the LTT, no T-cell reactivity was observed to the parent compound chlorazepate, whereas coincubation of the drug with human liver microsomes yielded proliferative T-cell reactivity, which was associated with secretion of IL-5 but not of IFN-gamma.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that the addition of a metabolizing system may be advantageous for the in vitro detection of T-cell reactivity to drug metabolites in the LTT.

### Psychotropic drugs with long half-lives: Implications for drug discontinuation, occasional missed doses, dosing interval, and pregnancy planning [^111cmxfH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

The half-life of a drug is the time taken for the blood level of the drug to fall by half, provided that no more doses of the drug are administered in the intervening period. Many psychotropic drugs and their active metabolites, if any, have very long half-lives that extend for two days or longer. Examples include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, fluoxetine, vortioxetine, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, penfluridol, donepezil, and memantine. Other drugs with long half-lives that psychiatrists may prescribe include levothyroxine and zonisamide.

- **Implications of long half-lives**: Psychotropic drugs with long half-lives take a long time to reach steady state; this is seldom a problem. They also take a long time to wash out; this is an advantage because the risk of drug withdrawal or discontinuation syndromes is small. However, it can be a disadvantage if rapid washout is desired for any reason, including the experience of drug adverse effects or toxicity, or the discovery of an unplanned pregnancy.

- **Clinical issues to consider**: Other clinical issues related to drugs with long half-lives include the relevance of occasional missed doses, the possibility of once-weekly dosing, and the need for pregnancy planning.

### Chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride [^117SyU8v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

There is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to psychiatric medications, including chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications at 1–866–961–2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/pregnancyregistry/.

- **Risk summary**: Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal. Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**: Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in neonates. Neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets during pregnancy or labor should be monitored for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, and hypotonia.

### Fluoxetine [^112zCVGe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The accumulation and slow elimination of fluoxetine, which has an elimination half-life of 1 to 3 days after acute administration and 4 to 6 days after chronic administration, and its active metabolite norfluoxetine, with an elimination half-life of 4 to 16 days after both acute and chronic administration, lead to significant accumulation in chronic use. This also results in a delayed attainment of steady state, even when a fixed dose is utilized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. After 30 days of dosing at 40 mg/day, plasma concentrations of fluoxetine have been observed in the range of 91 to 302 ng/mL, and norfluoxetine in the range of 72 to 258 ng/mL. Plasma concentrations of fluoxetine are higher than those predicted by single-dose studies because the metabolism of fluoxetine is not proportional to dose. Norfluoxetine, however, appears to have linear pharmacokinetics, with a mean terminal half-life of 8.6 days following a single dose and 9.3 days after multiple doses. Steady-state levels after prolonged dosing are similar to those seen at 4 to 5 weeks.

The long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine ensure that even when dosing is stopped, active drug substances will persist in the body for weeks. This persistence primarily depends on individual patient characteristics, previous dosing regimens, and the length of previous therapy at discontinuation. It is of potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when drugs are prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following discontinuation of fluoxetine.

### Midazolam hydrochloride [^111ec9ep]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco, and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.

- **Animal data**: Pregnant rats were treated with midazolam using intravenous doses of 0.2, 1, and 4 mg/kg/day (0.09, 0.46, and 1.85 times the human induction dose of 0.35 mg/kg based on body surface area comparisons) during the period of organogenesis (Gestation Day 7 through 15). Midazolam did not cause adverse effects to the fetus at doses of up to 1.85 times the human induction dose. All doses produced slight to moderate ataxia, and the high dose produced a 5% decrease in maternal body weight gain compared to control.

	- Pregnant rabbits were treated with midazolam using intravenous doses of 0.2, 0.6, and 2 mg/kg/day (0.09, 0.46, and 1.85 times the human induction dose of 0.35 mg/kg based on body surface area comparisons) during the period of organogenesis (Gestation Day 7 to 18). Midazolam did not cause adverse effects to the fetus at doses of up to 1.85 times the human induction dose. The high dose was associated with findings of ataxia and sedation but no evidence of maternal toxicity.

### Midazolam hydrochloride [^117B6BbC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine central nervous system (CNS) depressant.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Pharmacodynamic properties of midazolam and its metabolites, which are similar to those of other benzodiazepines, include sedative, anxiolytic, amnesic, and hypnotic activities. Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to result from reversible interactions with the γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) benzodiazepine receptor in the CNS, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The action of midazolam is readily reversed by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil.

Data from published reports of studies in pediatric patients clearly demonstrate that oral midazolam provides safe and effective sedation and anxiolysis prior to surgical procedures requiring anesthesia, as well as before other procedures that require sedation but may not require anesthesia. The most commonly reported effective doses range from 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg in children (6 months to < 16 years). The single most commonly reported effective dose is 0.5 mg/kg. Time to onset of effect is most frequently reported as 10 to 20 minutes.

The effects of midazolam on the CNS are dependent on the dose administered, the route of administration, and the presence or absence of other medications.

Following premedication with oral midazolam, time to recovery has been assessed in pediatric patients using various measures, such as time to eye opening, time to extubation, time in the recovery room, and time to discharge from the hospital. Most placebo-controlled trials

### Oxazepam [^114PDtzX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco, and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.

Reproductive studies in animals were performed in mice, rats, and two strains of rabbits. Occasional anomalies such as reduction of tarsals, tibia, metatarsals, malrotated limbs, gastroschisis, malformed skull, and microphthalmia were seen in drug-treated rabbits without relationship to dosage. Although these anomalies were not present in the control group, they have been reported to occur randomly in historical controls. At doses of 40 mg/kg and higher, there was evidence of fetal resorption and increased fetal loss in rabbits, which was not seen at lower doses.

- **Nursing mothers**: Oxazepam is present in breast milk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding, and poor weight gain in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk [see Clinical Considerations]. The effects of oxazepam on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for oxazepam and any potential adverse effects.

### The safety and tolerability of vortioxetine: Analysis of data from randomized placebo-controlled trials and open-label extension studies [^115akyRk]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

The placebo level of discontinuation symptoms is possibly related to vortioxetine's relatively long elimination half-life of 66 hours. Comparisons across SSRIs suggest that a short elimination half-life increases the incidence of discontinuation symptoms.

The CYP450 pathway is important for the oxidative metabolism of various drugs and therefore implicated in drug–drug interactions. Biotransformation of vortioxetine is mainly through the liver by CYP2D6, with some contribution from CYP2C9. Co-administration of vortioxetine has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A inhibitor) or ketoconazole (CYP3A and P-glycoprotein inhibitor). Multiple doses of vortioxetine 10 mg q.d. do not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of lithium 450 mg ER b.i.d., diazepam, aspirin or its metabolite salicylic acid, or (R)- and (S)-warfarin enantiomers, nor the mean coagulation parameters of warfarin treatment alone. The same is true for co-administration of ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel (CYP3A substrates) or omeprazole / 5′-hydroxyomeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate and inhibitor), although dosage adjustment may be required when vortioxetine is co-administered with bupropion (a CYP2D6 inhibitor and CYP2B6 substrate) or rifampicin (a CYP inducer). There is no clinically meaningful effect on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment or renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe, or end-stage renal disease).

Limitations of this analysis include the exclusion of patients with psychiatric disorders.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111XALAr]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to review evidence from randomized trials assessing the effectiveness of strategies to deprescribe benzodiazepines and closely related sedative hypnotics (BSH). This research was designed as a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Data sources included MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and CENTRAL, which were searched from inception to August 2024. The researchers also examined reference lists of included studies and similar systematic reviews.

Eligible studies were those that randomized adults using BSH for insomnia to interventions aimed at deprescribing BSH, to strategies implementing these interventions in healthcare settings, or to usual care or placebo.

Reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to screen search results, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. Similar interventions were grouped, and a frequentist random effects meta-analysis was conducted. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.

The review identified 58 publications reporting on 49 unique trials with more than 39,000 patients. Interventions were classified as follows: tapering, patient education, physician education, combined patient and physician education, cognitive behavioral therapy, medication review, mindfulness, motivational interviewing, pharmacist-led interventions, and drug-assisted tapering and withdrawal. Low certainty evidence suggests that education of patients resulted in 144 (95% confidence interval 61 to 246) more successful deprescriptions per 1000 patients.

### Diazepam [^11583aib]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Published observational studies on benzodiazepines' use during pregnancy do not establish a clear association with major birth defects. Early studies reported a potential increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide; however, no consistent pattern was observed. Most recent case-control and cohort studies, adjusting for alcohol, tobacco, and other medication exposures, have not confirmed these findings.

Diazepam has been shown to cause fetal malformations in mice and hamsters at oral doses of 100 mg/kg or greater, approximately 20 times the maximum recommended adult dose (0.4 mg/kg/day) on an mg/m² basis. In these species, cleft palate and exencephaly are the most common malformations observed with maternally toxic doses during organogenesis. Animal studies indicate that benzodiazepines or drugs enhancing GABAergic inhibition can lead to widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in neonatal rat brains at concentrations relevant for human seizure control. The window of vulnerability in rats (postnatal days 0–14) corresponds to brain development occurring during the third trimester of human pregnancy.

- **Nursing mothers**: Diazepam is present in breastmilk.

### Benzodiazepine use disorder: Common questions and answers [^117UkHzB]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

In the United States, more than 30 million adults have reported taking a benzodiazepine within the past year. Misuse, defined as the use of a drug in a way not directed by a doctor, accounts for 17.2% of all benzodiazepine use. Family physicians face challenges when balancing the patient's perceived benefits of benzodiazepines against known risks and the lack of evidence supporting their use. Benzodiazepines cause significant central nervous system-related adverse effects, including sedation, confusion, memory loss, depression, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle crashes.

Factors that increase the risk of adverse effects and misuse include other substance use disorders, use of concomitant central nervous system medications, and the presence of central nervous system or pulmonary diseases. Compared with intermittent use, chronic daily use in older adults is associated with a higher risk of falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and death. Withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, sleep disturbances, and agitation, are common and often prolonged.

Adjunctive treatment with antiepileptics, antidepressants, and pregabalin has been shown to lessen withdrawal symptoms. Deprescribing benzodiazepines for patients who use them chronically should be individualized with slow tapering over weeks to months, or longer, to minimize the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Incorporating behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, improves deprescribing outcomes.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^11281jKU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly in the context of benzodiazepines, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the use of a fixed-dose regimen with a gradual taper. This approach is suggested when prescribing a shorter-acting benzodiazepine to minimize the risk of breakthrough and rebound signs and symptoms.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^112MZbZg]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly with the use of benzodiazepines, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend preferring longer-acting benzodiazepines due to the clinical benefits of their extended duration of action, although no specific benzodiazepine agent has been found to be more effective than another.
