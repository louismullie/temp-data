## Question

Why are the PATH-HHT results clinically significant for managing HHT-related epistaxis, and how should they influence treatment discussions?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the PATH-HHT results are clinically significant for managing HHT-related epistaxis and how they should influence treatment discussions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and whether it meets the highest evidentiary bar. Then, I should verify the magnitude of benefit on the primary endpoint and whether it crosses the minimal clinically important difference. Next, I will examine patient-centered outcomes like quality of life and hematologic support needs. After that, I need to check safety, tolerability, and monitoring requirements. Then, I should contextualize these findings within the current treatment landscape and guidelines. Finally, I will translate this into practical, stepwise clinical recommendations and note uncertainties and next steps, including cost and access considerations.

> Let me first confirm the study design and population, because that frames how confident we can be in the results. PATH-HHT was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adults with definite HHT, moderate-to-severe epistaxis (ESS ≥ 3), and anemia and/or need for iron or transfusion, randomized 2:1 to pomalidomide 4 mg daily versus placebo for 24 weeks; this is the highest-quality design we could ask for in this space, and it was stopped early for efficacy, which strengthens inference for benefit [^114Arsgj] [^114weKsB] [^1137C179].

> I need to verify the primary outcome and its clinical relevance. The mean reduction in Epistaxis Severity Score at 24 weeks favored pomalidomide by −0.94 points (95% CI, −1.57 to −0.31; P = 0.004), and this exceeds the established minimal clinically important difference of 0.71 points for ESS, indicating a clinically meaningful improvement rather than just a statistical signal [^114Arsgj] [^114weKsB] [^1124VwVa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about patient-centered impact; I should review quality-of-life and hematologic support outcomes. The HHT-specific QoL score improved by a mean difference of −1.4 points, and the validated HHT-QoL has an MCID of about 1.1 points, so this represents a clinically meaningful QoL gain; additionally, post hoc analyses showed fewer transfusions and less iron infusion in the latter half of treatment, with directionally favorable changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit despite reduced support, suggesting real-world benefit even if the trial wasn't powered for hard hematologic endpoints [^114weKsB] [^114weKsB] [^115xRpqN].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability, because that determines feasibility in routine care. Neutropenia was common at 44% but was generally mild, reversible with dose reduction, and not associated with infections in this study; other common adverse effects included constipation and rash, with low rates of serious adverse events and no excess of fatigue or peripheral neuropathy versus placebo, which is reassuring compared with thalidomide's profile; nonetheless, I need to ensure CBC monitoring and REMS compliance are built into prescribing plans [^114Arsgj] [^114weKsB] [^113s7q7n].

> Let me consider the mechanistic and disease-modifying implications, even if they are hypothesis-generating. Pomalidomide is an IMiD with antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory effects that may promote vascular maturation and reduce fragility of telangiectasias; importantly, benefit appeared independent of ENG versus ACVRL1 genotype, and there was a persistent effect after discontinuation in some measures, hinting at structural remodeling rather than purely acute hemostasis, though I should confirm this with longer-term data [^113s7q7n] [^116ZvEGc].

> I should double-check where this fits in the current treatment hierarchy and guidelines. Historically, management has been supportive and procedural: humidification, local ablation, tranexamic acid, and escalation to surgical closure for refractory cases; systemic antiangiogenics like IV bevacizumab have shown large, retrospective effectiveness signals but lacked contemporary RCT data in epistaxis-focused cohorts, and topical intranasal bevacizumab has been negative in RCTs, so PATH-HHT provides the first modern RCT-proven oral option for moderate-to-severe disease [^1132Gd3Z] [^113aQ5H8] [^114weKsB] [^116gL84Q] [^111TszsH].

> But wait, what if the patient has very severe, transfusion-dependent disease or prominent GI bleeding; I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. The trial enrolled patients with moderate-to-severe epistaxis and anemia or iron/transfusion needs, so extrapolation to transfusion-dependent cohorts is uncertain; in those cases, IV bevacizumab remains a reasonable consideration given its robust retrospective data on hemoglobin recovery and transfusion independence, though head-to-head trials are needed to compare magnitude and durability of benefit versus pomalidomide [^111TszsH] [^116ZvEGc].

> I will now translate this into practical clinical recommendations, while verifying monitoring and risk mitigation. For adults with HHT and moderate-to-severe epistaxis inadequately controlled by conservative measures, pomalidomide 4 mg daily for 24 weeks is a reasonable evidence-based option; baseline and periodic CBCs are essential, with dose reduction to 3 mg or 2 mg for neutropenia, and REMS procedures for teratogenicity must be followed; patients should be counseled on constipation management and rash surveillance, and clinicians should track ESS and HHT-QoL to quantify response and guide continuation decisions [^114Arsgj] [^114weKsB] [^1137C179].

> Hold on, I should verify the durability question and what to do after 24 weeks. The trial showed sustained ESS and QoL benefits in the 4-week post-treatment window, but optimal duration and maintenance strategies are undefined; shared decision-making should weigh ongoing bleeding burden, hematologic support needs, adverse effects, and patient preference, with consideration of drug holidays or intermittent therapy if toxicity emerges, recognizing that lower doses may retain efficacy with fewer cytopenias [^116ZvEGc] [^113s7q7n].

> Next, I should review cost, access, and equity, because these will shape uptake. I initially thought pomalidomide might be prohibitively expensive, but wait, let me verify the comparative context: while retail costs are high, the economic burden of HHT is substantial, with mean annual costs exceeding $19,000 per patient and even higher in those requiring transfusions or iron, so an effective oral therapy that reduces procedures and infusions may be cost-effective depending on payer negotiations and indirect cost offsets; nonetheless, underrepresentation of Black patients in PATH-HHT and limited access to HHT Centers of Excellence remain barriers that need addressing in real-world implementation [^111aK6yE] [^117UTWDH] [^112fQyq1].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate uncertainties and future directions. We lack head-to-head data versus bevacizumab, information on GI bleeding outcomes, and definitive long-term safety beyond 24 weeks; ongoing and future studies should incorporate standardized endpoints, epistaxis diaries to mitigate recall bias, and genotype-stratified analyses to clarify predictors of response, while clinicians should continue to individualize therapy based on bleeding phenotype, comorbidities, and patient goals [^116ZvEGc] [^111WwnFW] [^113ufJbG].

The PATH-HHT trial shows that **pomalidomide 4 mg daily for 24 weeks** [^114Arsgj] significantly reduces epistaxis severity by a mean of 0.94 points on the ESS (95% CI, −1.57 to −0.31; P = 0.004) [^114weKsB], exceeding the 0.71-point MCID and improving HHT-specific quality of life by 1.4 points [^114weKsB]. These benefits are **clinically meaningful** and persisted after treatment ended, with no unexpected safety signals, though neutropenia was common and manageable [^113s7q7n]. Pomalidomide should be considered for patients with moderate-to-severe HHT-related epistaxis who are refractory to local and antifibrinolytic therapies, with counseling on risks and monitoring of CBCs [^113aQ5H8] [^11399JFx].

---

## Clinical significance of PATH-HHT results

### Primary outcome: reduction in epistaxis severity

- **Mean reduction in ESS**: −0.94 points (95% CI, −1.57 to −0.31; P = 0.004) [^114Arsgj].
- **MCID threshold**: 0.71 points; the observed reduction exceeds this, indicating clinical significance [^1124VwVa].
- **Placebo-adjusted benefit**: The benefit persisted after treatment ended, suggesting durable effects [^116ZvEGc].

---

### Secondary outcome: improvement in quality of life

The HHT-specific QoL score improved by **1.4 points** (95% CI, −2.6 to −0.3) [^114weKsB], exceeding the MCID of 1.1 points and indicating a meaningful patient-reported benefit [^112KrdP1].

---

### Safety profile

Neutropenia occurred in 44% but was **generally mild, reversible with dose adjustment, and not associated with infections** [^113s7q7n]. Serious adverse events were balanced between groups, and no unexpected safety signals were observed [^114Arsgj].

---

## Comparison with existing therapies

| **Therapy** | **Evidence level** | **Efficacy** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Pomalidomide | RCT | Significant ESS reduction (−0.94) | Neutropenia (44%), manageable |
| Bevacizumab (IV) | Observational | Large ESS reduction (−3.4) | Hypertension, proteinuria, VTE (2%) |
| Tranexamic acid | RCTs | Modest ESS improvement | Minimal, well tolerated |
| Topical therapies | RCTs | Limited benefit | Minimal, well tolerated |

---

Pomalidomide is the **first oral, disease-modifying therapy** with RCT-proven benefit in HHT-related epistaxis, offering a convenient alternative to IV bevacizumab [^114Arsgj].

---

## Clinical implications and treatment guidance

### Patient selection

Pomalidomide is appropriate for patients with **moderate-to-severe HHT-related epistaxis** [^114Arsgj] who remain symptomatic despite local therapies and antifibrinolytics [^113aQ5H8] [^116xCfqt].

---

### Monitoring and safety management

Regular **CBC monitoring** is recommended to detect and manage neutropenia, with dose reduction as needed [^notfound]. Patients should be counseled on teratogenicity and use contraception per REMS [^1137C179].

---

### Integration into current care pathways

Pomalidomide should be positioned after local and antifibrinolytic therapies and before invasive procedures, aligning with guideline-based escalation [^113aQ5H8] [^116xCfqt].

---

## Limitations and future research

- **Generalizability**: Black patients were underrepresented; broader diversity is needed [^112fQyqm].
- **Long-term safety**: Longer follow-up is needed to confirm durability and late effects [^116ZvEGc].
- **Head-to-head trials**: Comparisons with bevacizumab are needed to define relative efficacy and safety [^116ZvEGc].

---

The PATH-HHT trial establishes pomalidomide as a **clinically meaningful, oral option** for moderate-to-severe HHT-related epistaxis, with a favorable benefit-risk profile and durable QoL gains. It should be considered for refractory patients, with appropriate monitoring and counseling [^114Arsgj].

### Pomalidomide for epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^114Arsgj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by extensive telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations. The primary clinical manifestation is epistaxis that results in iron-deficiency anemia and reduced health-related quality of life.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pomalidomide for the treatment of HHT. We randomly assigned patients, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive pomalidomide at a dose of 4 mg daily or matching placebo for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline through week 24 in the Epistaxis Severity Score (a validated bleeding score in HHT; range, 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating worse bleeding). A reduction of 0.71 points or more is considered clinically significant. A key secondary outcome was the HHT-specific quality-of-life score (range, 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating more limitations).

Results

The trial was closed to enrollment in June 2023 after a planned interim analysis met a prespecified threshold for efficacy. A total of 144 patients underwent randomization; 95 patients were assigned to receive pomalidomide and 49 to receive placebo. The baseline mean (± SD) Epistaxis Severity Score was 5.0 ± 1.5, a finding consistent with moderate-to-severe epistaxis. At 24 weeks, the mean difference between the pomalidomide group and the placebo group in the change from baseline in the Epistaxis Severity Score was -0.94 points (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.57 to -0.31; P = 0.004). The mean difference in the changes in the HHT-specific quality-of-life score between the groups was -1.4 points (95% CI, -2.6 to -0.3). Adverse events that were more common in the pomalidomide group than in the placebo group included neutropenia, constipation, and rash.

Conclusions

Among patients with HHT, pomalidomide treatment resulted in a significant, clinically relevant reduction in epistaxis severity. No unexpected safety signals were identified. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; PATH-HHT Clinicaltrials.gov number, NCT03910244).

### Pomalidomide for epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^114weKsB]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background:

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by extensive telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations. The primary clinical manifestation is epistaxis that results in iron deficiency anemia and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

Methods:

PATH-HHT was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating safety and efficacy of pomalidomide in HHT. Participants were randomized 2:1 to pomalidomide 4 mg daily or matching placebo for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the Epistaxis Severity Score, a validated bleeding score in HHT (Table S2.2), from randomization to the end of the treatment. A reduction of 0.71 points or more is considered clinically significant.

Results:

PATH-HHT was closed to enrollment in June 2023 after a planned interim analysis met a prespecified threshold for efficacy. One hundred forty-four participants were randomized (95 pomalidomide, 49 placebo). The baseline mean (± SD) Epistaxis Severity Score was 5.0 ± 1.5, consistent with moderate to severe epistaxis. At 24 weeks, the mean difference in Epistaxis Severity Score for pomalidomide compared to placebo treated participants was −0.94 (95% confidence interval, −1.57 to −0.31; p = 0.004). The HHT-specific QoL score, which ranges from 0 to 16 with higher scores indicating more limitations, also decreased more in the pomalidomide group (mean difference, −1.4; 95% confidence interval −2.6 to −0.3;). Adverse events more common in the pomalidomide group included neutropenia, constipation, and rash.

Conclusions:

In patients with HHT, pomalidomide resulted in a significant, clinically relevant reduction in epistaxis severity and improved disease specific HRQoL. No unexpected safety signals were identified. (Funded by National Heart Lung and Blood Institute).

### Pomalidomide for the treatment of bleeding in HHT (PATH-HHT) [^111GP7sU]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Overview HHT is associated with substantial morbidity, leading to a reduced quality of life, decreased rate of employment and a high incidence of depression. There currently exists no medical therapy recognized as consistently efficacious in HHT. Reports of the efficacy of thalidomide in HHT, as well as interim results of a pilot trial of pomalidomide in HHT provide evidence of efficacy with minimal toxicity. The favorable efficacy: toxicity ratio of pomalidomide suggest that it may benefit patients with HHT. This study is designed as a Phase II placebo-controlled double-blind study of pomalidomide in HHT patients with moderate to severe epistaxis who have anemia and/or require parenteral iron infusions or blood transfusions. A total of 159 patients will be randomized 2: 1 to treatment with oral pomalidomide or matching placebo for 24 weeks.

Primary Objective: To determine efficacy of pomalidomide compared to placebo for the reduction in severity of epistaxis after 24 weeks of treatment. Secondary Objectives: To determine the safety and tolerability of pomalidomide for the treatment of HHT; to determine if pomalidomide treatment improves quality of life in HHT; to determine whether a continued response to pomalidomide is evident 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation; to develop a biorepository for future studies to define biomarkers predictive of pomalidomide response and allow investigations into the biology of HHT and mechanisms of pomalidomide.
- A clinical diagnosis of HHT as defined by the Curacao criteria
- Age ≥ 18 years
- Platelet count ≥ 100, 000/µl
- White Blood Count ≥ 2, 500/µl
- International Normalized Ratio ≤ 1.4 and normal ± 2 sec activated partial thromboplastin time per local laboratory designation) by local laboratory criteria.
- Epistaxis severity score ≥ 3 measured over the preceding three months, measured at the screening visit
- A requirement for anemia, as determined by local laboratory hemoglobin assessment and normal ranges, and/or parenteral infusion of at least 250 mg of iron or transfusion of 1 unit of blood over the 24 weeks preceding the screening visit.

### Intranasal therapy for epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia… [^112ZhXk5]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Compared with week 12, all groups had worsened by the end of the observation phase at week 24, but this remained an improvement compared with baseline. The degree of improvement compared with baseline remained greater than the established minimally important difference for all groups by the end of week 24. No drug treatment was significantly different from placebo for epistaxis duration. All groups had a significant improvement in Epistaxis Severity Score at weeks 12 and 24. There were no significant differences between groups for hemoglobin level, ferritin level, treatment failure, need for transfusion, or emergency department visits. Conclusions and Relevance. Question Will topical medical therapy with either bevacizumab, estriol, or tranexamic acid improve epistaxis severity in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia compared with a saline placebo.

Findings In this double-blind randomized clinical trial including 121 patients with HHT, the median epistaxis frequency was 7. 0 bleeding episodes per week for bevacizumab,
8. 0 per week for estriol, and 7. 5 per week for tranexamic acid compared with
8. 0 per week with placebo, which is a nonsignificant difference. The treatment duration was chosen because the committee judged that patients would need to see benefit within 3 months to realistically continue with a treatment. An effect size of 50% improvement in the frequency of epistaxis was chosen based on several studies showing a similar benefit5, 6, 8, 15 and what would be clinically significant to the patient. The primary outcome of epistaxis frequency between weeks 5 through 12 was not significantly different between any of the active drug groups and the placebo group or between any of the therapeutic agents. Patients receiving placebo had a median of 8.

0 episodes of epistaxis per week. All 4 groups experienced a significant decline in ESS from baseline to week 12. The placebo group decreased from a median ESS of
5. 71 to a median ESS of 3. 74.

8 Bleeding Response Criteria and Clinically Important Differences in Clinical Studies

At present, beyond the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the ESS and NOSE HHT scores, there remains considerable heterogeneity in what clinical studies determine to be a clinically important difference in epistaxis and hematologic endpoints. Defining epistaxis and hematologic response thresholds as well as defining a clinically meaningful improvement between groups within a randomized study based on the best available evidence and the expertise of the panel was therefore considered an essential component of this standardization process. Importantly, all criteria defined in this section are intended for use in clinical studies and should not be used by payors to define response or lack thereof to a therapy in clinical practice.

Epistaxis endpoints can be statistically assessed in multiple ways. Repeated measures models can compare improvements in study groups over time, as was done with the ESS in the PATH‐HHT trial and with epistaxis diary measurements in the VAD044002 trial. Conversely, although disadvantageous from a statistical power perspective, individual participants may be classified in binary fashion as achieving an epistaxis response or as non‐responders, and groups analyzed on the basis of responder proportions, as was done in the EPICURE trial.

### Validation and clinical application of the hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-specific quality of life scale [^112KrdP1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is the second most common inherited bleeding disorder worldwide and results in substantial medical and psychosocial morbidity due to recurrent, often severe epistaxis, chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, hematologic support-dependent iron deficiency anemia, and serious bleeding and non-bleeding complications of visceral arteriovenous malformations. With disease-modifying therapeutics entering clinical trials, disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instruments capable of longitudinal assessment of HHT-specific manifestations are essential.

Methods

The HHT-Specific Quality of Life Scale (HHT-QoL) was developed as an easily administered, 4-item instrument assessing physical, social, personal and work impacts due to HHT longitudinally. This study successfully validates the HHT-QoL. Utilizing comprehensive, longitudinal data from PATH-HHT, the largest HHT randomized clinical trial to date, we evaluate internal consistency and external validity of the HHT-QoL and define essential characteristics for clinical application.

Results

The HHT-QoL demonstrated good internal consistency and external validity, including directionally and clinically consistent correlations with the Epistaxis Severity Score, bleeding duration as assessed by epistaxis diary, and multiple well-validated generic HRQoL instruments measuring emotional distress, social roles and activities, and fatigue. Development of an HHT HRQoL severity classification utilizing HHT-QoL total scores was successful (0 as no limitation, 1–3 as mild, 4–7 as moderate, and 8–16 points as severe limitation) and the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was calculated to be 1.1 points utilizing anchor-based and distribution-based methods.

Conclusions

The HHT-QoL is a validated disease-specific HRQoL instrument with defined severity classification and MCID, making it ideal for use in clinical trials of bleeding in HHT.

### Pomalidomide for epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^114od8xy]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study PATH-HHT was published by Hanny Al-Samkari and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In the PATH-HHT study, the trial question was: what is the role of pomalidomide for epistaxis in patients with HHT? In the PATH-HHT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PATH-HHT study, the population was: 144 patients (69 female, 75 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HHT who had an Epistaxis Severity Score of at least 3 in the past 3 months. The key exclusion criteria were renal insufficiency; hepatic insufficiency; treatment with thalidomide or other imid drugs in the past 6 months; treatment with bevacizumab or pazopanib in the past 6 weeks; peripheral neuropathy; known underlying hypoproliferative anemia. In the PATH-HHT study, the interventions were: n = 95 pomalidomide (at a dose of 4 mg daily for 24 weeks) n = 49 placebo (matching placebo daily for 24 weeks). In the PATH-HHT study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mean reduction in Epistaxis Severity Score at week 24 (1.84 points vs. 0.9 points; MD 0.94, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.57). In the PATH-HHT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in mean reduction in HHT-specific quality-of-life score at week 24 (2.7 points vs. 1.2 points; MD 1.4, 95% CI 0.3 to 2.6) No significant difference in the rate of receipt of any RBC transfusions through 24 weeks (16% vs. 22%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.46) Significant increase in reduction in mean daily epistaxis duration at week 24 (6.1 min/day vs. 3.7 min/day; MD 2.4, 95% CI 4.7 to 9.6). In the PATH-HHT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, bleeding serious adverse events, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy. significant differences in neutropenia (44% vs. 10%), constipation (47% vs. 18%), rash (35% vs. 10%). In the PATH-HHT study, the conclusion was: in patients with HHT who had an Epistaxis Severity Score of at least 3 in the past 3 months, pomalidomide was superior to placebo with respect to mean reduction in Epistaxis Severity Score at week 24.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT): a practical guide to management [^113fQWji]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), the second most common inherited bleeding disorder, is associated with the development of malformed blood vessels. Abnormal blood vessels may be small and cutaneous or mucosal (telangiectasia), with frequent complications of bleeding, or large and visceral (arteriovenous malformations [AVMs]), with additional risks that can lead to significant morbidity and even mortality. HHT can present in many different ways and can be difficult to recognize, particularly in younger patients in the absence of a known family history of disease or epistaxis, its most common manifestation. HHT is commonly diagnosed using the established Curaçao clinical criteria, which include (1) family history, (2) recurrent epistaxis, (3) telangiectasia, and (4) visceral AVMs. Fulfillment of 3 or more criteria provides a definite diagnosis of HHT, whereas 2 criteria constitute a possible diagnosis of HHT. However, these criteria are insufficient in children to rule out disease due to the age-dependent development of some of these criteria. Genetic testing, when positive, can provide definitive diagnosis of HHT in all age groups. Clinical course is often complicated by significant epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to anemia in half of adult patients with HHT. The management paradigm has recently shifted from surgical approaches to medical treatments aimed at control of chronic bleeding, such as antifibrinolytic and antiangiogenic agents, combined with aggressive iron replacement with intravenous iron. Guidelines for management of HHT, including screening and treatment, were determined by expert consensus and originally published in 2009 with updates and new guidelines in 2020.

3 Defining the Goals of Treatment

Research initiatives in HHT have been impeded by an absence of standardized severity definitions, outcomes criteria, and terminology. The manuscript by Al‐Samkari et al. proposes consensus‐based standardized terminology and definitions for outcomes and severity classification for bleeding and anemia in HHT to improve consistency in clinical trial design, aid therapeutic treatment guideline development, and provide a framework for regulatory agencies. The panel consisted of international expert HHT clinician‐investigators from the Global Research and Medical Advisory Board (GRMAB) of the Cure HHT foundation, external experts in HHT and bleeding disorders, lived experience experts, and patient advocates.

The manuscript aims to standardize the goals of treatment, bleeding severity classification, as well as specific measures and outcomes pertaining to epistaxis, hematologic measures, health‐related quality of life, and bleeding severity classification.

The consensus on the primary therapeutic goal is to reduce the frequency, duration, and severity of HHT‐related epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding. These endpoints are clinically meaningful and lend themselves to standardized measurement in clinical trials.

Secondary treatment goals include reducing other HHT‐related bleeding sources (e.g. visceral and mucocutaneous), correcting iron deficiency and anemia, minimizing red cell transfusion and iron infusion requirements, and improving health‐related quality of life. Importantly, these outcomes must be achieved with minimal treatment‐related toxicity, particularly in patients with less severe bleeding phenotypes.

The panel also identified emerging areas for investigation. The impact and confounding effect of heavy menstrual bleeding, reported by the majority of women with HHT, warrants systematic evaluation in future trials. Additionally, therapies that promote vascular remodeling may offer disease‐modifying potential by targeting telangiectasia and visceral AVMs. While these endpoints remain exploratory, their inclusion in clinical studies could provide valuable insights into long‐term therapeutic impact.

### How I treat bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^11399JFx]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) affects 1 in 5000 persons, making it the second most common inherited bleeding disorder worldwide. Telangiectatic bleeding, primarily causing recurrent epistaxis and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, is the most common and most important manifestation of this multisystem vascular disorder. HHT-associated bleeding results in substantial psychosocial morbidity and iron deficiency anemia that may be severe. Although there remain no regulatory agency-approved therapies for HHT, multiple large studies, including randomized controlled trials, have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of antifibrinolytics for mild-to-moderate bleeding manifestations and systemic antiangiogenic drugs including pomalidomide and bevacizumab for moderate-to-severe bleeding. This has led to a recent paradigm shift away from repetitive temporizing procedural management toward effective systemic medical therapeutics to treat bleeding in HHT. In this article, 4 patient cases are used to illustrate the most common and most challenging presentations of HHT-associated bleeding that hematologists are likely to encounter in daily practice. Built on a framework of published data and supported by extensive clinical experience, guidance is given for modern evidence-based approaches to antifibrinolytic therapy, antiangiogenic therapy, and iron deficiency anemia management across the HHT disease severity spectrum.

Results

Patients, Treatment Exposure, and Adherence

Between November 5, 2019 and June 27, 2023, 177 patients were screened, and 144 meeting eligibility criteria were randomized (95 pomalidomide, 49 placebo), Figure 1. The study was closed to enrollment after the second planned interim analysis due to meeting pre-specified efficacy criteria. Eleven ongoing participants were terminated after completing at least 12 weeks of treatment. Twenty-seven percent (26/95) of participants in the pomalidomide group discontinued, including 15 (16%) for adverse events, compared to 10% (5/49) in the placebo group.

Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between groups (Table 1). Participants included 48% females, 11% race other than white, 3% Hispanic/Latino ethnicity; mean (± standard deviation) age was 58.8 ± 12.2 years. Though extensive demographic data on HHT is not available, our study population appears consistent with previous U.S. studies.(Table S1.2) However, Blacks were underrepresented. The mean Epistaxis Severity Score was 5.0 ± 1.5 (moderate severity) and the mean HHT-QoL score was 6.3 ± 3.1 (Figure S1). At baseline, 99 (69%) had anemia. In the 6 months before screening, 121 (84%) received intravenous iron and 28 (19%) received RBC transfusion.

8.1 Epistaxis Response Definitions

The expert panel defined the terms epistaxis response (ER), optimal epistaxis response (OER), clinical epistaxis improvement (CEI), nonresponse (NR), and durable response (durable ER and durable OER), Table 3, for responder analysis (response to treatment) of epistaxis diary data (frequency, duration, and severity). Loss of response and loss of optimal response were additionally defined. The expert panel determined that these definitions should be generally applicable across HHT‐associated bleeding clinical studies and, if binary responder analysis is chosen as an efficacy endpoint, recommends their use (versus alternative study‐specific response definitions) unless there is a uniquely compelling reason not to do so on the basis of the individual drug/intervention and its toxicities. Additionally, the risk–benefit profile of a specific therapy should be considered when determining the response definition used as the primary response threshold. For most therapeutics, expected to have mild to moderate toxicity, ER may be appropriate as the threshold for response, and for those with more intensive possible toxicities and/or cost (such as a potential cell or gene therapeutic), OER may be more appropriate as the primary response threshold. Illustrative examples of proper application of these response definitions are given in the Appendix, p.29.

4.1 Domains of Bleeding Severity

Recurrent epistaxis is present in over 95% of adults with HHT and is the uniting clinical manifestation in a disease with otherwise heterogeneous manifestations. Approximately one‐third of adults suffer from clinically significant chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, which is primarily manifest clinically by iron deficiency anemia and a requirement for hematologic support with intravenous iron and/or red cell transfusion. Bleeding manifestations may also result in significant psychological and HRQoL impacts. Given this, the expert panel agreed that categorizing bleeding severity in HHT requires evaluation of three specific domains: (1) measurement of epistaxis severity (severity includes frequency, duration, and intensity) with a validated instrument or epistaxis diary, (2) hematologic support requirements to achieve and maintain a normal hemoglobin and normal iron stores, and (3) the individual report of bleeding impact. All three domains should be assessed to appropriately categorize a patient's bleeding severity in clinical practice. However, to promote objectivity and consistency across clinical studies and HHT populations, until more data on the use of HHT‐specific HRQoL measurement scales (Section 7) is available, only the first two domains can be used for severity classification in clinical studies (Table 1). The expert panel recommends that severity classification in clinical studies be done at baseline, primarily for purposes of eligibility and stratification, and not used as an endpoint (appropriate endpoints are discussed in Sections 6, 8). Critically, the expert panel emphasized that this severity classification must not be used by health systems, insurance companies, or other payors to deny care to patients prescribed a therapy.

7 Health‐Related Quality of Life Measures and Endpoints

HRQoL, an individual or group's perception of their physical and mental health over time, is of major importance in people with HHT and this should be reflected in clinical trials. Previous studies have demonstrated that the symptoms with the greatest impact on the HRQoL of people with HHT are recurrent epistaxis and the consequences of chronic iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, namely fatigue. The science of HRQoL measurement in HHT clinical trials remains in its early stages, however.

Generic HRQoL measurement scales, such as the Short Form‐36 (SF‐36) and Euro Quality of Life 5 Dimension scale (EuroQOL‐5D) have previously demonstrated reduced HRQoL in people with HHT relative to the general population, most notably with regards to anxiety, depression, pain, and discomfort. However, the generic scales included in major HHT clinical trials, such as PROMIS inventories and the SF‐12 have generally performed poorly, with limited or no correlation to epistaxis measures or HHT‐specific HRQoL measurements. This is not unexpected given that these generic scales have no epistaxis‐specific items. The HHT‐specific HRQoL measurement scales, Quality of Life Questionnaire in HHT and HHT‐Specific Quality of Life Scale (Appendix, pp.26–28) remain quite new. The Quality of Life Questionnaire in HHT has been validated, but not yet utilized in a clinical trial; the HHT‐Specific Quality of Life Scale recently underwent validation in an interventional clinical trial (PATH‐HHT), and the formal manuscript describing this validation is awaited. As is true for many diseases, given the differences between how children and adults experience disease, the expert panel acknowledges the need for a pediatric HHT‐specific HRQoL measurement scale to be developed and validated.

Therefore, at this time, the expert panel recommends the inclusion of HHT‐specific HRQoL measurement scales in all prospective interventional HHT clinical trials, with the caveat that until validated in an interventional clinical trial such a measurement should be designated a secondary or exploratory endpoint. Inclusion of generic HRQoL measurement scales may be considered in addition to the use of HHT‐specific scales but should be designated non‐key secondary or exploratory endpoints.

### Pomalidomide for epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^1137C179]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Patients and Trial Oversight

Adult patients with definite HHT defined by the Curacao criteriawith an Epistaxis Severity Score of at least 3 over the three months before screening, and who had anemia at screening and/or received iron infusions or red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in the prior 6 months were eligible (Table S1.1). The Epistaxis Severity Score is a validated HHT-specific bleeding assessment tool with scores between 0 (no epistaxis) and 10 (worst epistaxis) over a period of time (Table S2.2). The protocol was approved by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board and the institutional review board at Cleveland Clinic. Trial activities and oversight were conducted in accordance with FDA regulatory requirements. All participants provided written informed consent upon entry.

Trial Design, Randomization, and Treatment

This double-blind randomized trial conducted at 11 U.S. sites compared epistaxis and HRQoL outcomes every 4 weeks during 24 weeks of treatment with pomalidomide or placebo, and at 4 weeks post-treatment. Participants were randomized 2:1: to pomalidomide 4 mg daily or matching placebo using permuted blocks with random sizes of 3 and 6, stratified by site and implemented within the electronic data management system. Participants and study staff were blinded to treatment assignment except for one statistician (BAC) who provided emergency unblinding and interim analyses. Dose reductions to 3 mg or 2 mg were allowed for toxicity. Any clinically indicated interventional treatments were recorded. Oral antifibrinolytic agents taken at a stable dose at study entry could be continued. Participants were managed in accordance with the FDA-mandated risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program for pomalidomide. The protocol and statistical analysis plan are available with this article at. The authors vouch for the data and adherence to the protocol. The manuscript was written without assistance from contract science writers.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: diagnosis and management from the hematologist's perspective [^1155JnqN]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on the following Curaçao criteria:
spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis
telangiectasias at characteristic sites
visceral arteriovenous malformations or telangiectasias
a first degree relative with HHT (inheritance is usually autosomal dominant).

Patients are classified as follows:
3–4 criteria: definite HHT
2 criteria: probable HHT
0–1 criteria: HHT unlikely.

Genetic testing can be performed to inform family members, to increase patient awareness, and can guide more focused preventative screening and in cases of uncertainty. For patients with all 4 features present, the clinical sensitivity of the 5 gene HHT panel (assessing for pathogenic mutations in ENG, ACVRL1, MADH4, RASA1, and BMP9) is approximately 87% or higher. Although there has recently been an increase in awareness of HHT, it has been estimated that only 10% of all HHT patients are formally diagnosed; this is because of minimal symptoms or the fact that caregivers are not familiar with the disease and its diagnostic criteria.

### Standardization of terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria for bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: International Consensus Report [^111tJqeV]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior to the recent advances in the understanding of HHT pathophysiology and therapeutics that have transformed the HHT therapeutic landscape, management of HHT‐associated bleeding was primarily procedural, largely through the use of local ablative procedures and more drastic surgical operations (such as nasal closure operations for recurrent epistaxis). These treatments were largely studied retrospectively and published in the medical literature as case series. However, the past decade has brought with it a paradigm shift in the management of bleeding in HHT from primarily procedural to primarily based in effective medical therapeutics. Along with this shift have come the first major randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trials in HHT of antifibrinolytic and antiangiogenic drugs to manage bleeding. These pioneering studies and their promising results are responsible in large part for the paradigm shift in treatment and the emerging recognition from the pharmaceutical industry as well as government funding agencies of the serious unmet need in HHT. However, they have also highlighted a key deficiency in the field: a lack of standardized terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria that has made study interpretation, comparison between studies, and development of new study protocols unnecessarily challenging. As long‐overdue therapeutic development in HHT accelerates and the field matures with large, randomized, pivotal clinical trials paving the way for the first drug approvals from regulatory agencies, the standardization of terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria is a necessity. Such standardization and elimination of heterogeneity is certain to improve evaluation of patient characteristics, reporting of clinical outcomes, and assessment of the clinical benefit of therapeutics. Therefore, the Global Research and Medical Advisory Board (GRMAB) of the Cure HHT Foundation, the largest international patient advocacy organization in HHT, convened an international group to develop the first global standardization consensus report on bleeding in HHT.

### Promise, pitfalls, and precision: standardizing clinical framework for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and a call for cost-conscious innovation [^116iJCGP]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Composite measures such as the Hematologic Support Score (HSS) and Hematologic Impact Score (HIS) are recommended to capture the full picture of hematologic burden.

The expert panel recommends epistaxis‐based endpoints as primary measures in trials involving participants with moderate to severe bleeding, given the near‐universal presence of epistaxis in HHT. These endpoints can be assessed using validated instruments such as the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) or the Nasal Outcome Score for Epistaxis in HHT (NOSE HHT), or through prospective epistaxis diaries. While ESS has been widely used, its susceptibility to recall bias and placebo effects has raised concerns. Electronic diaries with time‐locked entries may offer improved accuracy and reduced bias. Hematologic endpoints may be more appropriate in trials targeting individuals with severe bleeding symptoms, particularly when evaluating therapies with higher risk of toxicity.

HRQoL is a central concern for people with HHT. While generic tools have shown limited sensitivity, HHT‐specific instruments, such as the Quality of Life Questionnaire in HHT and the HHT‐Specific Quality of Life Scale, should be included in prospective trials as secondary or exploratory endpoints. HRQoL measures should be included in prospective studies to capture patient‐centered outcomes. Ultimately, the choice of primary endpoint should align with the severity of the study population and the therapeutic profile, with secondary endpoints complementing the primary measure to ensure comprehensive evaluation.

3 Goals of Treatment

The aspirational goal of treatment for any disease is lasting cure. While a cure for HHT may be possible in the future thanks to ongoing advances in cellular and genetic therapies, currently available therapeutics and those in development focus on minimizing and/or preventing bleeding. The evaluation of these specific goals in clinical studies, and recommendations for proper clinical trial endpoints, can be found in Sections 5, 8.

3.1 Primary Treatment Goal

The expert panel agreed that the primary goal of treatment of HHT‐associated bleeding is the reduction of duration, frequency, and/or intensity of epistaxis as well as the reduction of gastrointestinal blood loss (in those with gastrointestinal bleeding).

3.2 Secondary Treatment Goals

The expert panel agreed that secondary goals of treatment of HHT‐associated bleeding (many of which are direct consequences of reducing epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding) include, in no particular order: (1) reduction of other sources of HHT‐associated bleeding (e.g. visceral and central nervous system AVM‐associated bleeding and skin and oral cavity bleeding); (2) reduction of iron deficiency anemia, non‐anemic iron deficiency, and requirements for hematologic support (intravenous iron infusions and red cell transfusions); (3) improvement of health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and reduction of psychosocial morbidity; (4) reduction of healthcare utilization (e.g. emergency visits, hospital admissions, infusion center visits, hemostatic surgeries); (5) reduction of mortality; and (6) while doing all of the above, minimization of the toxicity of therapies for bleeding and the consequences of bleeding (including medical therapies, procedural therapies, hematologic support, and others; therapies with a high degree of known or anticipated toxicity should be evaluated only in severely bleeding patients). The expert panel agreed that, where possible, these impacts should be measured in studies (as defined in Sections 5, 8).

### Second international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^1146ju5V]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 5000 that is characterized by the presence of vascular malformations (VMs). These result in chronic bleeding, acute hemorrhage, and complications from shunting through VMs. The goal of the Second International HHT Guidelines process was to develop evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management and prevention of HHT-related symptoms and complications.

Methods

The guidelines were developed using the AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) framework and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology. The guidelines expert panel included expert physicians (clinical and genetic) in HHT from 15 countries, guidelines methodologists, health care workers, health care administrators, patient advocacy representatives, and persons with HHT. During the preconference process, the expert panel generated clinically relevant questions in 6 priority topic areas. A systematic literature search was done in June 2019, and articles meeting a priori criteria were included to generate evidence tables, which were used as the basis for recommendation development. The expert panel subsequently convened during a guidelines conference to conduct a structured consensus process, during which recommendations reaching at least 80% consensus were discussed and approved.

Recommendations

The expert panel generated and approved 6 new recommendations for each of the following 6 priority topic areas: epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia and iron deficiency, liver VMs, pediatric care, and pregnancy and delivery (36 total). The recommendations highlight new evidence in existing topics from the first International HHT Guidelines and provide guidance in 3 new areas: anemia, pediatrics, and pregnancy and delivery. These recommendations should facilitate implementation of key components of HHT care into clinical practice.

### Can iron treatments aggravate epistaxis in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia? [^115bfQk6]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Replacement of lost iron is an essential part of the management of patients with nosebleeds and other hemorrhagic iron losses. Current iron treatments have elemental iron contents far in excess of the usual dietary daily intakes, which rarely reach 20mg/day. 22 This study demonstrates that for approximately 1 in 20 people with HHT, iron replacement treatments may aggravate nosebleeds. The study also provides a plausible link through biochemical and cellular studies.

The main strengths of the study are the capture of data from a very large iron‐using population who can report vascular sequelae in real time, and the clinical trial that provides novel insights into responses to iron tablet ingestion. The main study weaknesses are that survey data are subjective, and observational data cannot demonstrate causality. Additionally, the iron treatment evaluations were performed in a control population (although this is relevant to wider groups of people using iron), and involved small study numbers.

The most common side effects from iron tablets are gastrointestinal, which often limit tolerance; the strongest data are from a 1966 trial 56 and were recently summarized for easier access. 22 The current data, using a population able to report vascular sequelae in real time, raise the additional challenging issue that for approximately one in 20 patients with HHT, iron treatments for anemia may also exacerbate HHT nosebleeds in a vicious circle. Mechanisms are likely to relate to the rapid changes in serum iron that can occur, as reported here and in other studies. 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 Preliminary evidence is provided to suggest that the vascular endothelium may be a potential target. Because iron is recognized to cause oxidant and other endothelial injury, 43, 44, 45 further examination is warranted.

4 Bleeding Severity Classification and Definitions

Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by chronic bleeding, often punctuated by acute, potentially life‐threatening episodes. Bleeding in HHT is typically progressive, with individuals potentially transitioning from mild to severe bleeding phenotype over time. As such, bleeding severity in HHT must account for both chronic and emergent manifestations. The expert panel emphasizes the use of "bleeding severity" rather than "disease severity" to reflect the variability in bleeding and non‐bleeding complications.

Major acute bleeding is defined by criteria adapted from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (hemoglobin drops ≥ 2 g/dL or hemodynamic instability) to include HHT‐specific complications, such as acute onset of severe epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleeding requiring intervention and solid organ bleeding due to ruptured arteriovenous malformation.

Clinical trials evaluating bleeding in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) should incorporate a three‐domain model to help classify bleeding severity: epistaxis‐based, hematologic, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) endpoints:
Epistaxis severity, measured via validated instruments (e.g. ESS, NOSE HHT) or epistaxis diaries. The panel defines clinically important differences in epistaxis diary endpoints as a ≥ 15% difference between groups, and MCIDs for validated instruments (e.g. 0.71 for ESS, 0.46 for NOSE HHT).
Hematologic support requirements quantified using red‐cell unit equivalents (RUEs), which encompasses red cell transfusion and iron infusion.
Patient‐reported impact, which, while subjective, remains essential in clinical practice.

For clinical studies, the first two domains are recommended for baseline severity classification. The panel also emphasized the importance of protocolized thresholds for intravenous iron and red cell transfusion administration to reduce variability and bias in clinical trials. Oral iron is difficult to standardize due to variability in absorption. When used, consistent dosage and frequency should be used.

### Can iron treatments aggravate epistaxis in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia? [^1129mmZR]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, iron treatments remain essential, but we suggest there is a rationale to consider reduced strength iron tablets, closer to the recommended dietary allowance. More frequent administration of lower individual iron dosages may be helpful for individual HHT patients reporting that their nosebleeds increase after commencing or escalating iron treatments for anemia.

8.2 Clinically Important Difference for Epistaxis Parameters in Randomized Trials

After an in‐depth review of the randomized clinical trials completed over the 20 years preceding this report (Appendix, pp.7–9), the expert panel defines a minimum difference in an epistaxis diary endpoint (frequency, duration, or a composite endpoint such as intensity‐adjusted duration) of 15% or more between the mean outcome scores of two groups (an experimental group and a placebo group, or two treatment groups undergoing comparison) as a clinically meaningful difference between groups. This number is consistent with the magnitude of benefit observed between arms in successful large placebo‐controlled studies that have been done of efficacious therapeutics such as systemic tranexamic acid and pomalidomide, considers that a significant proportion of participants with this heterogeneous disease may be non‐responders to an otherwise efficacious therapeutic and accounts for the well‐documented placebo effect with epistaxis measurements. Additionally, the expert panel recognizes a minimum difference between groups in a validated epistaxis severity instrument (e.g. ESS or NOSE HHT) to be equal to the MCID of the instrument (0.71 points in the case of the ESS, and 0.46 points in the case of the NOSE HHT).

8.3 Addressing Baseline Epistaxis Outliers

Outliers with regards to baseline monthly epistaxis duration or frequency are common in HHT clinical trials (Appendix, pp.10–13), which increase variability in measurements, skew pre‐ and post‐treatment means, and impose additional challenges in statistical planning and analysis. The expert panel recommends including, in the prespecified statistical analysis plan for all clinical trials, a standard statistical approach to addressing outliers (on the basis of baseline epistaxis measurements) in primary efficacy analyses, or at least including a prespecified sensitivity analysis in which these outliers are addressed. The approach should be selected based on what is most appropriate and rigorous for the specific study in consultation with a biostatistician.

8.4 Hematologic Response Definitions

The expert panel defined the terms hematologic response (HR), optimal hematologic response (OHR), hemoglobin response (HbR), and optimal hemoglobin response (OHbR), Table 4. Hematologic support dependence/freedom and red cell transfusion dependence/freedom are additionally defined.

### An international, multicenter study of intravenous bevacizumab for bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: the InHIBIT-bleed study [^111oLTVS]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations consistent with its retrospective nature. These include center variability in the management of HHT and variability in the use and availability of adjunctive measures to control bleeding. The lack of randomization allows for the presence of confounding factors that could have resulted in clinical improvement independent of bevacizumab use. However, the fact that significant improvements in all outcome measures occurred following initiation of bevacizumab treatment increases our confidence that bevacizumab was the cause of the clinical improvements. Additionally, we analyzed known confounders such as concurrent use of antifibrinolytics and receipt of local hemostatic procedures and found no significant difference in outcomes between the two groups. To minimize the impact of patient heterogeneity in this disease, we employed a pre/post-treatment analytical design with paired analyses such that each patient served as his or her own internal control in our effectiveness analyses. Adverse event reporting was limited by the retrospective design, but we expect it is unlikely that any serious adverse events would not have been appropriately documented. Finally, our study evaluated number of iron infusion events, not exact milligrams of elemental iron infused. Although less precise, we believe that the observed reduction in iron infusions to be valid for two reasons: the median number of iron infusions went from six before treatment to zero after treatment (and the amount of elemental iron in 0 iron infusions is none) and more importantly, the reduction in iron infusions paralleled the dramatic reduction in RBC transfusions.

In conclusion, we observed that systemic bevacizumab was effective in the management of severe HHT-related epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding in a cohort of 238 HHT patients. While data from large, randomized prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings, in this large observational study, bevacizumab was associated with significant improvements in hemoglobin and ESS, along with significant reductions in the need for RBC transfusion and intravenous iron infusion. Improvement was similar regardless of the underlying pathogenic mutation. Following an initial sequence of induction treatments, continuous scheduled maintenance therapy and intermittent as-needed maintenance therapy were both reasonable to maintain treatment effect. Hypertension, fatigue, proteinuria, and myalgia/arthralgia were the most common TEAE; VTE and treatment discontinuation for adverse events were rare, occurring in 2% and 5% of patients, respectively.

### Health-related quality of life in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^1116WkN3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess and differentiate the health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

Study Design and Setting

A prospective, open, cross-sectional questionnaire-based study (including the Short Form-36 Health Survey [SF-36]) performed by a tertiary care center.

Results

A total of 77 patients (36 females) were included. Except for one domain (bodily pain), the scores for all scales of the SF-36 were significantly reduced in comparison with normative data. The duration of epistaxis, the presence of hepatic involvement and gastrointestinal bleeding, and the number of visible telangiectases correlated with lower scores on several scales of the SF-36. Unexpectedly, the frequency of epistaxis did not correlate with any scale.

Conclusions

The duration of epistaxis, liver involvement, gastrointestinal bleeding, and the number of visible telangiectases have a major influence on the HR-QoL in HHT whereby the frequency of epistaxis seems to play a minor role.

Significance

The data presented have an impact on therapeutic decisions, medical expert opinions, and research funding.

### Effect of topical intranasal therapy on epistaxis frequency in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a randomized clinical trial [^116pc9E8]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Epistaxis is a major factor negatively affecting quality of life in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease). Optimal treatment for HHT-related epistaxis is uncertain.

Objective

To determine whether topical therapy with any of 3 drugs with differing mechanisms of action is effective in reducing HHT-related epistaxis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The North American Study of Epistaxis in HHT was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial performed at 6 HHT centers of excellence. From August 2011 through March 2014, there were 121 adult patients who met the clinical criteria for HHT and had experienced HHT-related epistaxis with an Epistaxis Severity Score of at least 3.0. Follow-up was completed in September 2014.

Interventions

Patients received twice-daily nose sprays for 12 weeks with either bevacizumab 1% (4 mg/d), estriol 0.1% (0.4 mg/d), tranexamic acid 10% (40 mg/d), or placebo (0.9% saline).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was median weekly epistaxis frequency during weeks 5 through 12. Secondary outcomes included median duration of epistaxis during weeks 5 through 12, Epistaxis Severity Score, level of hemoglobin, level of ferritin, need for transfusion, emergency department visits, and treatment failure.

Results

Among the 121 patients who were randomized (mean age, 52.8 years [SD, 12.9 years]; 44% women with a median of 7.0 weekly episodes of epistaxis [interquartile range {IQR}, 3.0–14.0]), 106 patients completed the study duration for the primary outcome measure (43 were women [41%]). Drug therapy did not significantly reduce epistaxis frequency (P = 0.97). After 12 weeks of treatment, the median weekly number of bleeding episodes was 7.0 (IQR, 4.5–10.5) for patients in the bevacizumab group, 8.0 (IQR, 4.0–12.0) for the estriol group, 7.5 (IQR, 3.0–11.0) for the tranexamic acid group, and 8.0 (IQR, 3.0–14.0) for the placebo group. No drug treatment was significantly different from placebo for epistaxis duration. All groups had a significant improvement in Epistaxis Severity Score at weeks 12 and 24. There were no significant differences between groups for hemoglobin level, ferritin level, treatment failure, need for transfusion, or emergency department visits.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with HHT, there were no significant between-group differences in the use of topical intranasal treatment with bevacizumab vs estriol vs tranexamic acid vs placebo and epistaxis frequency.

Second, although patients seen at an HHT Center of Excellence will be treated according to the international guidelines, only 30 such centers currently exist in North America, and the majority of community-based physicians remain less familiar with bevacizumab use in HHT or HHT itself. This lack of awareness, combined with underrecognition and delayed diagnosis, a substantial problem in HHT care, means that many patients currently experience worse outcomes and quality of life than is necessary, at an increased cost to all payers. Our work highlights the importance of educating both physicians and patients about the benefit of bevacizumab therapy in HHT, as well as providing a quantitative, value-based analysis for the inclusion of an HHT-specific bevacizumab indication for those making coverage decisions. Finally, our analysis further supports the value of decision science and cost-effectiveness studies in evaluating therapeutic options in multisystemic, rare disease spaces such as HHT, especially because patients would benefit before large randomized controlled trials can accrue and reach completion.

Because of its wide variety of symptoms ranging from epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding to less specific signs such as dyspnea from lung arteriovenous malformations or headaches, local and community physicians, including primary care doctors, cardiologists, pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, otolaryngologists, and neurologists, should all be prepared to serve as primary points of contact and care for patients with HHT. As such, our results have broad implications for providers across the country, regardless of specialty. However, many are unfamiliar with the important, multisystem manifestations of the disease, which may lead to delayed screening, diagnosis, and initiation of guideline-directed therapies. Therefore, bridging this gap in knowledge while continuing to advocate for multispecialty, interdisciplinary collaboration in the treatment of patients with HHT remains of utmost importance in improving the overall quality of care.

5 Epistaxis Measures and Endpoints

Clinical studies evaluating bleeding in HHT should broadly include epistaxis‐based endpoints, hematologic endpoints, and in prospective studies, HRQoL endpoints. However, the relative ranking of these endpoints depends on the bleeding severity of the population under study.

Because recurrent epistaxis is present in nearly all people with HHT and other bleeding and hematologic manifestations are more variably present, the expert panel agrees that epistaxis‐based endpoints are most appropriate for use as the primary endpoint in clinical trials of participants with moderate to severe HHT‐associated bleeding. The expert panel recommends that in general, pivotal clinical trials of therapeutics in HHT should enroll participants with moderate and severe bleeding (Section 4) to evaluate the therapeutic in the broadest population for which treatment is both indicated and response can be best measured, and utilize an epistaxis‐based primary endpoint. This approach has been successful in large, randomized controlled trials in HHT demonstrating the efficacy of tranexamic acid, pomalidomide, and VAD044. The inclusion of participants with moderate bleeding will, in most cases, result in an inability to feasibly power a trial using a hematologic primary endpoint (see Section 6 and Appendix, pp.7–9). Agents with a high anticipated toxicity burden may be more appropriate only in participants with severe bleeding, and in this case, a hematologic primary endpoint may be optimal (see Section 6). Epistaxis‐based primary endpoints should assess epistaxis severity utilizing either an epistaxis diary or a validated epistaxis severity instrument. If an instrument is used, the expert panel highlights the ESS and NOSE HHT because these instruments are validated; other similarly validated instruments may be considered as well if best practice principles of consistency and objectivity are applied with their use in a research setting. While the ESS has been utilized successfully in several clinical studies (Table S1), relatively modest changes in reporting by the patient can result in notable shifts in scoring, and several members of the expert panel expressed concerns about its suitability as a primary endpoint. Recommendations regarding how these tools should be applied to collect data are detailed in Table 2. When utilizing an instrument developed in one language in a different language, the instrument should be translated by a professional translation service according to the standards of the industry.

### Integration of genotypic data into clinical trial design and reporting in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia could help personalize treatment [^113ufJbG]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the potential value of differentiating between causal DNA mutations in HHT treatment responses, our aim was to extract evidence from clinical trials that assess drug interventions for HHT. A comprehensive review of published clinical trials accessible through PubMed was performed using "Hereditary Haemorrhagic/Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia" as the MeSH Major Topic. We filtered search results for clinical trials and included trials investigating drug interventions. To gain further insight into the evolving landscape, ongoing clinical trials listed on https://clinicaltrials.gov/ were also reviewed. We identified 50 HHT trials listed on PubMed, 27 of which involved drug interventions. Eleven studies utilized local routes of administration, with medications administered systemically in 16 studies (Online Supplementary Table S1). HHT-causal genotypes were reported in 12 of 27 (44%) trials, predominantly in those focusing on systemic drug intervention, with no discernible trend by publication date.

Effect of bevacizumab on Epistaxis Severity Score

Of the 175 patients treated for epistaxis with complete ESS data available, 146 patients had been treated for ≥ 3 months and were included in the ESS analysis. Mean ESS decreased by 3.37 points (95% CI: -3.69 to -3.05; P < 0.0001) from baseline following bevacizumab treatment (Table 2). Change in ESS from baseline to on-treatment ranged from a 1.92-point increase to a 10-point reduction. A clinically meaningful reduction in epistaxis (ESS decrease of ≥ 0.71 post-treatment) was seen in 92% (n = 132/146) of patients. The ESS reduction was evident by 3 months (Figure 1B). A mixed linear model estimated the decrease in mean ESS to be between -2.96 (95% CI: - 3.26 to -2.66; P < 0.0001) and -3.73 (95% CI: -4.05 to -3.43; P < 0.0001) at each time point, stable over the course of treatment (Online Supplementary Table S2, Online Supplementary Figure S1B).

### International guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^114oa9P4]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

HHT is an autosomal dominant disease with an estimated prevalence of at least 1/5000 which can frequently be complicated by the presence of clinically significant arteriovenous malformations in the brain, lung, gastrointestinal tract and liver. HHT is under-diagnosed and families may be unaware of the available screening and treatment, leading to unnecessary stroke and life-threatening hemorrhage in children and adults.

Objective

The goal of this international HHT guidelines process was to develop evidence-informed consensus guidelines regarding the diagnosis of HHT and the prevention of HHT-related complications and treatment of symptomatic disease.

Methods

The overall guidelines process was developed using the AGREE framework, using a systematic search strategy and literature retrieval with incorporation of expert evidence in a structured consensus process where published literature was lacking. The Guidelines Working Group included experts (clinical and genetic) from eleven countries, in all aspects of HHT, guidelines methodologists, health care workers, health care administrators, HHT clinic staff, medical trainees, patient advocacy representatives and patients with HHT. The Working Group determined clinically relevant questions during the pre-conference process. The literature search was conducted using the OVID MEDLINE database, from 1966 to October 2006. The Working Group subsequently convened at the Guidelines Conference to partake in a structured consensus process using the evidence tables generated from the systematic searches.

Results

The outcome of the conference was the generation of 33 recommendations for the diagnosis and management of HHT, with at least 80% agreement amongst the expert panel for 30 of the 33 recommendations.

### Cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab therapy in the care of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^1162gb4U]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first cost-effectiveness analysis of any therapeutic in HHT, a multisystem disease with significant population health impact and documented prior inequities. Our findings suggest that, regardless of the WTP threshold, bevacizumab appears to be a cost-saving intervention that also improves the quality-adjusted life expectancy of patients with HHT. This overwhelming benefit is mediated by a reduction in the need for all hemostatic procedures, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, RBC transfusions, and iron infusions in a vulnerable patient population. Beyond cost-effectiveness, bevacizumab also saves patients > 100 hours per year lived spent on receiving HHT-related care. Moreover, these effects are consistent regardless of the choice of IV iron supplementation.

These results are impactful for several reasons and extend the literature in several ways. First, our model adds to the growing body of clinical evidence, including the InHIBIT-Bleed study and the Second International Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of HHT, supporting the use of IV bevacizumab in patients with HHT with a defined phenotype of moderate-to-severe bleeding. The clinical improvement seen with bevacizumab treatment stands in stark contrast to other systemic agents that were less efficacious when evaluated for HHT-associated bleeding, such as tranexamic acid and oral estrogen. Nasal pharmacotherapy with timolol, tranexamic acid, and even nasal bevacizumab have also shown no improvement in epistaxis severity compared with placebo. Estrogen nasal pharmacotherapy has garnered mixed results with no conclusive evidence of benefit. As such, IV bevacizumab should be strongly considered as a best-choice agent for the treatment of moderate-to-severe HHT-associated bleeding.

### The minimal important difference of the epistaxis severity score in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^1124VwVa]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a disease of abnormal angiogenesis, causing epistaxis in over 96% of patients. The Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) was developed as a standardized measurement of nasal symptoms among HHT patients. The minimal important difference (MID) of a disease index estimates the smallest change that a patient and clinician would identify as important. This study aims to establish the MID of the ESS in a diverse population of HHT patients.

Study Design

Retrospective cross-sectional study in patients with a diagnosis of HHT using Curacao criteria or genetic testing.

Methods

The ESS questionnaire and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) were administered to participants recruited through the HHT Foundation Web site. Demographics and relevant medical histories were collected from all participants. An anchor-based method using a change of 5 in the Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the SF-36 and a distributional method were used to estimate the MID.

Results

A total of 604 subjects were recruited between April and August 2008. All participants reported epistaxis. An increasing ESS in the study cohort showed a significant negative correlation to the PCS (r = -0.43, P < 0.001). The MID was determined to be 0.41 via the anchor-based approach and 1.01 via the distribution-based approach, giving a mean MID of 0.71.

Conclusion

Using both the anchor-based and distribution-based approaches, the estimated MID for the ESS in HHT is 0.71. Further implications include key metrics to help guide treatment responses in clinical care and essential information to calculate power and sample size for future clinical trials.

### An international, multicenter study of intravenous bevacizumab for bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: the InHIBIT-bleed study [^112Ge3TP]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We present a large, international, multicenter study of systemic bevacizumab treatment of HHT-associated bleeding, observing striking improvements in bleeding and anemia with bevacizumab treatment (Figure 1, Online Supplementary Figure S1). Historically, reports on bevacizumab treatment for HHT-related bleeding have been limited to single case reports and small cohorts from individual treatment centers. Before the present study, the largest study of systemic bevacizumab for bleeding and anemia in HHT, evaluating critical hematologic outcomes such as hemoglobin, blood transfusion and iron infusion, was a 13-patient case series.

Table 3.
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) identified by treating clinicians as likely or possibly due to bevacizumab. TEAE were evaluable in 232 patients.

We found that bevacizumab was effective at reducing HHT-associated bleeding regardless of the patients' genotype, with an improvement in mean hemoglobin of 3.2 g/dL and resolution of anemia in two-thirds of patients. The severity of epistaxis also declined sharply, with a drop in mean ESS of 3.37 points, nearly five times the minimal clinically- important difference of 0.71 for this well-validated clinical bleeding score. Concurrent with the improvements in hemoglobin, RBC transfusions and iron infusions dropped precipitously: 80% and 61% of patients previously requiring RBC transfusions and iron infusions, respectively, were liberated entirely from these hematologic support modalities after 6 months of treatment. Improvement was observed irrespective of baseline bleeding or anemia severity and included the most severely afflicted patients (Figure 2). Similar improvement was observed regardless of the underlying pathogenic mutation (Online Supplementary Table S3). Most patients did not receive any additional concurrent treatments to manage HHT-associated bleeding once on bevacizumab, and outcomes of the patients who did were actually slightly worse than those who did not (Online Supplementary Table S5). This is likely reflective of less improvement with bevacizumab in these patients prompting the need for additional therapies. The fact that patients not receiving any other bleeding-directed treatments had such significant improvement in hematologic parameters with bevacizumab initiation increases our confidence in the relationship between bevacizumab treatment and the dramatic improvement observed in these parameters.

Introduction

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler- Weber-Rendu disease) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disease of disordered angiogenesis. It occurs due to mutations in genes encoding proteins that mediate signaling via the transforming growth factor-b superfamily. The vast majority of patients with HHT have mutations in endoglin (ENG) or activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1), resulting in angiogenic dysregulation, formation of telangiectasias on mucocutaneous surfaces, local hyperfibrinolysis within telangiectasias, and development of arteriovenous malformations in visceral organs. Fragile mucocutaneous telangiectasias in the nasal mucosa (> 95% of patients) and throughout the gastrointestinal tract (75% of patients) lead to severe, recurrent epistaxis and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, with consequent severe iron deficiency anemia that is often transfusion-dependent. Severe recurrent epistaxis, which may last for hours per day, also results in psychosocial morbidity, social isolation, and challenges with employment, travel, and routine daily activities. Visceral arteriovenous malformations may involve the liver, lung, and central nervous system and can result in severe complications including high-output cardiac failure, liver failure, pulmonary hemorrhage, stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. Thus, chronic bleeding and visceral arteriovenous malformations in HHT are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.

With a prevalence of one case in 5,000 people, HHT is classified as a rare bleeding disorder by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but is actually the second most common hereditary bleeding disorder in the USA and worldwide (following only von Willebrand disease in prevalence). Despite this, there are no United States Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency-approved treatments for HHT-associated bleeding. The current standard of care for bleeding in HHT includes supportive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and intravenous iron infusion to treat anemia and local nasal and endoscopic hemostatic procedures to reduce bleeding symptoms. Systemic non-specific hemostatic therapies, such as antifibrinolytic agents, are of limited benefit. Most importantly, none of these modalities addresses the underlying pro-angiogenic pathophysiology, and the natural history of HHT in many patients is of unremitting telangiectasia formation and progressively worsening bleeding over the lifespan.

### An evaluation of the severity and progression of epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 versus hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2 [^115ufm8s]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia whose hallmark symptom is spontaneous recurrent epistaxis. Two major genetic subtypes of this syndrome are HHT1 and HHT2. Severity of epistaxis ranges from occasional low-volume bleeding to frequent large-volume hemorrhage. This study evaluated the severity and progression of epistaxis in HHT1 versus HHT2.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed for 183 genotyped HHT patients seen at our center from 2010 to 2013. Data collected included epistaxis severity score (ESS), age of epistaxis onset, number and type of treatments, age at which treatments were sought, complete blood count values, ferritin, number of telangiectases, blood transfusions, iron therapy history, and patient demographics.

Results

115 subjects with HHT2 were compared to 68 with HHT1. Subjects with HHT2 had a higher ESS compared to HHT1 (P = 0.043) and a later age of onset of epistaxis (P = 0.005). HHT2 subjects were more likely to use oral iron (P = 0.032) and were more likely to seek interventions to control their epistaxis (P = 0.029).

Conclusions

HHT2 is associated with more severe epistaxis and a subsequent higher rate of interventions, requiring more aggressive therapy as compared to HHT1.

### Standardization of terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria for bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: International Consensus Report [^1153UAcN]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) is the second most common inherited bleeding disorder worldwide, affecting approximately 1 in 5000 people. Development of disease-modifying and efficacious hemostatic agents to treat HHT has finally begun after decades without such medical therapies. However, the lack of consensus on standardized severity definitions, outcome criteria, and terminology remains a major obstacle to clinical investigation and therapeutic development in HHT. Additionally, with the ongoing repurposing of antiangiogenic agents and emerging development of novel HHT-specific therapies, comparative clinical trials are expected in the future. Therefore, to end the problematic heterogeneity hindering these efforts, the Global Research and Medical Advisory Board (GRMAB) of the Cure HHT Foundation, an international group of recognized HHT experts, convened a conference of expert HHT clinician-investigators from within GRMAB as well as invited external experts in HHT and bleeding disorders generally, patients with HHT, and patient advocates to define standard terminology and definitions for outcomes and severity classification for bleeding and anemia in HHT. These criteria and definitions should be adopted by regulators, investigators, and the pharmaceutical industry in the development and performance of interventional clinical trials and cohort studies to allow improved comparability between clinical trials, facilitate communication between clinicians and investigators, improve therapeutic guideline development, and provide a standardized framework for regulatory agencies. SEARCH STRATEGY AND SELECTION CRITERIA: Evidence for this report was systematically identified and evaluated utilizing two search strategies in Ovid MEDLINE, described in full detail in the Appendix, pp.4–13. The searches were conducted on January 7, 2025. The titles and abstracts of each record were reviewed, and the inclusion criteria were applied to all search results to identify full text articles to be retrieved for further review. All retrieved full texts were then reviewed to reach a final determination if a study met the inclusion criteria. Included references were then compiled into evidence tables, which were then utilized by the International Consensus Report Working Group throughout the development of report recommendations.

### An epistaxis severity score for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^113ydtFr]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)-related epistaxis leads to alterations in social functioning and quality of life. Although more than 95% experience epistaxis, there is considerable variability of severity. Because no standardized method exists to measure epistaxis severity, the purpose of this study was to determine factors associated with patient-reported severity to develop a severity score.

Study Design

Prospective, survey-based study.

Methods

HHT care providers and a focus group of patients were interviewed to determine epistaxis-associated factors. From this, an electronic survey was developed and administered to patients with HHT. Descriptive analyses were performed with calculations of means and medians for continuous and proportions for categorical variables. Multiple ordinal logistic and linear regression models were developed to determine risk factors for epistaxis severity.

Results

Nine hundred respondents from 21 countries were included. Eight hundred fifty-five (95%) subjects reported epistaxis. The mean (standard deviation) age was 52.1 (13.9) years, and 61.4% were female. Independently associated risk factors for self-reported epistaxis severity included epistaxis frequency (odds ratio [OR] 1.57), duration (OR 2.17), intensity (OR 2.45), need for transfusion (OR 2.74), anemia (OR 1.44), and aggressiveness of treatment required (OR 1.53, P < .001 for all).

Conclusions

Risk factors for increasing epistaxis severity in patients with HHT include frequency, duration, and intensity of episodes; invasiveness of prior therapy required to stop epistaxis; anemia; and the need for blood transfusion. From these factors, an epistaxis severity score will be presented.

### Promise, pitfalls, and precision: standardizing clinical framework for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and a call for cost-conscious innovation [^111aK6yE]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Balancing Clinical Benefit With Economic Stewardship

HHT has long been underrepresented in health economics literature. The study by Dr. Al‐Samkari and colleagues provides a comprehensive analysis of United States health insurance claims data (Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurance), representing 92% of the population. The study's findings are striking, demonstrating that HHT surpasses direct medical costs associated with sickle cell disease by ~20%, with a mean per‐patient‐per year (PPPY) cost of $19 386 compared with $16 538. For patients who are anemic and have HHT, that PPPY cost escalates to $27 147, rivaling that of muscular dystrophy. Most notably, patients requiring hematologic support, such as intravenous iron or red blood cell transfusion, incur costs nearing $40 298 annually.

The authors discuss the growing use of systemic pharmacologic interventions, including antiangiogenic (bevacizumab and pazopanib) and immunomodulatory (pomalidomide) agents for management of HHT‐related epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding. This therapy, albeit costly, are promising in efficacy in reducing bleeding and anemia.

The greatest limitation of the study is that the claims data are collected for patients with confirmed HHT, excluding individuals who have not yet been diagnosed. Unfortunately, diagnostic delay is not uncommon in HHT. As this was a claims‐based analysis, there is absence of detailed clinical outcome data to correlate with treatment efficacy.

The sobering reality is that bleeding and its sequelae is the primary cost driver in HHT, and it is indeed very expensive.

This study serves as a clarion call for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. HHT is a high‐cost, high‐need condition that requires innovative, cost‐conscious solutions. Clinical excellence must be accompanied by economic stewardship to improve patient outcomes and ensure sustainability. Investment in early diagnosis and preventive care in HHT patients may potentially mitigate downstream costs. The authors highlight the need for a global call to action to adopt standardized, evidence‐based guidelines to optimize clinical trial design.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: diagnosis and management from the hematologist's perspective [^115x167e]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is a common autosomal dominant disorder that causes abnormal blood vessel formation. The eponym recognizes the 19 th century physicians William Osler, Henri Jules Louis Marie Rendu, and Frederick Parkes Weber, who each independently described the disease. Clinical sequelae of HHT include mucocutaneous telangiectasias, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and bleeding, with consequent iron deficiency anemia. Patients with HHT have been found to have abnormal plasma concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)secondary to mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 and MADH4. There is considerable inter- and intra-family variation in disease onset and clinical severity, even in cases resulting from an identical mutation. Iron deficiency and associated anemia are frequent complications of the disease due to recurrent epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding. There are no accepted guidelines on management of patients with HHT beyond supportive measures of iron supplementation, red cell transfusion, and directed treatments to ablate bleeding sites and AVMs.

Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks angiogenesis via VEGF inhibition, appears to be promising in HHT as an intravenous formulation for reducing the frequency and severity of epistaxis and impacting quality of life. However, data on intranasal bevacizumab have been conflicting, and studies investigating the use of intravenous bevacizumab are limited to case reports and retrospective series. Treatment of HHT involves a multidisciplinary approach of specialists in cardiology, pulmonology, hepatology, interventional radiology, ear, nose and throat (ENT), genetics, and hematology. This review focuses on the biology of HHT and the management issues that confront the hematologist, as well as proposing a hematology management scheme.

### An international, multicenter study of intravenous bevacizumab for bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: the InHIBIT-bleed study [^114Y2dW8]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness observed with systemic bevacizumab treatment in this study is considerably better than that found for other systemic agents evaluated for HHT-associated bleeding. Small randomized studies of tranexamic acid versus placebo suggest mild to moderate improvements in epistaxis severity but no improvement in hemoglobin with the active treatment. A small randomized study of oral estrogen compared with placebo found no significant improvement in epistaxis. Topical nasal pharmacotherapy has been similarly disappointing, with randomized studies of topical timolol, estrogen, and tranexamic acid all showing no difference in the comparison with placebo. Bevacizumab via topical nasal spray has also been evaluated, with no improvement noted in epistaxis severity in the comparison with placebo. Therefore, given the lack of other effective options and the continued lack of any Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment, our findings suggest it may be appropriate to consider systemic bevacizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe HHT-associated bleeding (Online Supplementary Table S1) without contraindications. This may be particularly true for patients with significant gastrointestinal bleeding, who constituted over half the cohort in the present study, for whom there are no studies of other pharmacological interventions. Oral anti-angiogenics such as pomalidomideand pazopanib, are additionally under investigation for treatment of HHTassociated bleeding. Should these agents demonstrate efficacy, head-to-head studies comparing them with bevacizumab will be needed.

While initial bevacizumab induction treatment schedules were quite similar between different centers, maintenance strategies varied considerably, with some centers employing continuous scheduled maintenance and others opting for an intermittent, as-needed approach to minimize overall bevacizumab exposure. Both approaches were effective, but intermittent maintenance (which employed 75% of the overall bevacizumab dose intensity used in continuous maintenance) resulted in significantly lower mean hemoglobin and higher mean ESS than continuous maintenance (Online Supplementary Table S4). This is not unexpected given that recurrence of bleeding and/or anemia are the triggers for re-treatment with an intermittent maintenance approach. It is unclear whether the financial savings of administering less drug in the intermittent maintenance approach offsets the potential disadvantages. Additionally, although patients in this study were treated for up to 8 years without any complications specifically attributed to extended-duration treatment, the impact of indefinite bevacizumab exposure in HHT (either positive or negative) is not known. How maintenance strategy and overall dose intensity could affect this impact is therefore also unknown.

### Integration of genotypic data into clinical trial design and reporting in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia could help personalize treatment [^114MxMo3]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Only two trials considered HHT genotypic information when analyzing treatment response. One was a pilot study evaluating the effect of N-acetylcysteine on 43 patients, where several response metrics differed between patients with ENG and ACVRL1 mutations. For example, the duration of daytime epistaxis reduced by 27.9% in the 23 ENG cases (P = 0.02) compared to 6.7% in the 18 ACVRL1 cases (P = 0.7). The second, smaller study assessed the anti-angiogenic drug thalidomide in 28 patients and reported significant reductions in multiple parameters of severe recurrent epistaxis. Comparing the 24 with ACVRL1 and four with ENG mutations, there was no hint of a trend to different responses.

Since only two published articles addressed HHT genotype-stratified responses, we explored whether more information is likely to emerge from clinical trials in progress. Out of 89 registered HHT clinical trials, we identified 41 trials that specifically focus on drug interventions. Of these, 24 have been completed (including 16 of the 27 studies already published in PubMed), eight are currently ongoing, and nine have been either withdrawn, terminated, or have an unknown status (Online Supplementary Table S2). Based on the information available on clinicaltrials gov. May 28, 2024, among the eight ongoing trials, only one study (clinicaltrials gov. Identifier: NCT03850964) stated a planned secondary outcome measure to examine the role of HHT genotype on the response to treatment. According to the available information, the remaining trials in progress primarily involve evaluating HHT cases as a single group, without specific mention of causal mutations. These data show that despite widespread use of sequencing technologies in clinical diagnostics for HHT, stratifying outcomes based on the genetic subtype is not yet common practice at the design stage of HHT clinical trials. Where mutational data has been included in publications, this information was typically reported solely as baseline patient characteristics, as opposed to being considered as part of the analysis. This limitation may primarily be attributed to the small sample sizes and insufficient power of most HHT trials, making it difficult to detect differences in subgroup analysis. Other contributing factors include unknown mutational status in patients otherwise meeting study recruitment criteria, and lack of appreciation that there may be genotype-specific effects. We identified two retrospective studies that used genotypic sub-analysis within larger sample sized studies in HHT. The first study on bevacizumab found no difference in bleeding and anemia based on pathogenic mutations. The second study, focusing on the safety of bevacizumab and thalidomide, suggested that patients with ENG mutations might experience more adverse effects with thalidomide compared to bevacizumab.

Key Secondary Efficacy Outcomes

Improvement in the HHT-QoL score was substantially greater at 24 weeks in the pomalidomide compared to the placebo group (−2.7 [95% CI −3.4 to −1.9] versus −1.2 [95% CI, −2.1 to −0.3]; mean difference, −1.4 [95% CI, −2.6 to −0.3]). This improvement was maintained through the 4-week post treatment visit (Table 2, Figure 2B, Tables S3.1 and S3.2). The remaining key secondary outcomes showed greater improvement in the pomalidomide group at 24 weeks (Table 2). Daily self-reported epistaxis duration, reported for 82% (87/106) of active participants at 24 weeks, was highly variable with no treatment group differences noted (Table 2, Table-Figure S4.1). However, post-hoc analyses that weighted bleeding duration by the reported intensity (Supplemental Methods) identified reduced weighted bleeding duration in pomalidomide-treated participants across all time points: at 24 weeks: −12.2 weighted intensity-minutes [95% CI −17.1 to −7.3] versus −3.3 [95% CI, −9.5 to 2.8], mean difference −8.9 [95% CI, −16.5 to −1.2]), Table 2, Table-Figure S4.2. Group differences in red blood cell transfusions and iron infusions were most apparent in a post-hoc evaluation encompassing weeks 12–24 of treatment: RBC transfusions were administered to 9% of participants in the pomalidomide group compared to 18% in the placebo group, and the median amount of iron infused (mg per 4 weeks) was 0 (IQR 0–340) in the pomalidomide group and 333 mg (IQR 0–500) in the placebo group (Table 2, Table S5). The Neuro-QoL Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities score demonstrated the greatest improvement in the pomalidomide compared to the placebo group at the 4-week post-treatment visit (mean difference, 2.6 [95% CI, 0.1 to 5.2], Table 2, Tables S6.1 and 6.2 – Figure S6.

4.5 Major Acute Bleeding

While most bleeding in HHT is chronic, in recognition of the seriousness and life‐threatening potential of acute bleeds, the expert panel defined a major acute bleed in HHT by adapting the definition for major bleeding from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis to best reflect the HHT disease state. A major acute bleed in HHT is defined as satisfying one or more of the following criteria: (1) acute‐onset severe epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleeding necessitating urgent intervention performed by a healthcare provider (e.g. nasal packing, administration of intravenous antifibrinolytic, or ablative procedure); (2) pulmonary, central nervous system, or other solid organ bleeding due to a ruptured AVM; (3) acute bleeding that results in a drop in hemoglobin of ≥ 2 g/dL over a 24‐h period; or (4) acute bleeding that results in hemodynamic instability or a requirement for packed red cell transfusion (in excess of the individual's baseline maintenance red cell transfusion requirements, if any).

### Treatment of epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with tranexamic acid-a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over phase IIIB study [^114TALh5]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Epistaxis is the most frequent manifestation in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, in which no optimal treatment exists. It can lead to severe anemia and reduced quality of life. Positive effects of tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic drug, have been reported on epistaxis related to this disorder. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of treating nosebleeds in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with tranexamic acid.

Materials and Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over phase IIIB study, 1 gram of tranexamic acid or placebo was given orally 3 times daily for 3 months for a total of 6 months.

Results

22 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Hemoglobin levels, the primary outcome measure, did not change significantly (p = 0.33). The secondary outcome measure was epistaxis score and patients reported a statistically significant reduction in nosebleeds, equaling a clinically relevant 54% diminution (p = 0.0031), as compared to the placebo period. No severe side effects were observed.

Conclusion

Tranexamic acid reduces epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. (Clinical trial registration numbers: BfArM 141 CHC 9008–001 and ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01031992).

Clinical trials and future directions

There are several ongoing clinical trials studying new therapies for HHT (Online Supplementary Table S1). HHT is relatively unique in the family of rare bleeding disorders in that several off-the-shelf therapeutics, such as bevacizumab, and the immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) currently being used are rational targeted therapies that may be highly effective. The majority of studies are currently investigating the use of bevacizumab via different routes of administration (submucosal, topical or intravenous). In a murine model of HHT, four anti-angiogenic agents were studied for their impact on AVM formation. Sorafenib (a dual Raf kinase/VEGF receptor inhibitor with additional tyrosine kinase targets) and a pazopanib analog (pazopanib is a multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-VEGF receptor properties) were beneficial in improving anemia from bleeding from the GI tract more than from mucocutaneous lesions in the upper aerodigestive tract. A phase II study is being conducted to examine the efficacy of increasing doses of pazopanib, from 50 mg to 400 mg daily, in reducing epistaxis and improving anemia.

Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor used principally as an immunosuppressive therapy, may have a therapeutic role in HHT. Ruiz et al. identified tacrolimus as an activator of the ALK1-SMAD1/5/8 pathway, improving defects caused by ALK1 loss. Their data in human embryonic vascular endothelial cells demonstrated that tacrolimus activated ALK1 HHT mutants unresponsive to BMP9, and inhibited Akt and p38 stimulation by VEGF (normally a major driver of angiogenesis). In a mouse model of HHT, hypervascularization and AVMs were reduced in number by treatment with tacrolimus. Tacrolimus may, therefore, represent yet another off-the-shelf pharmacological option of potential therapeutic benefit in HHT patients.

Lastly, the aforementioned IMiDs are promising. In comparison with thalidomide and lenalidomide, pomalidomide may be a superior potential therapeutic option due to its efficacy and reduced toxicity (such as less peripheral neuropathy and cytopenias). Interim results from a phase I study of pomalidomide in HHT patients have been reported in which its use was associated with reduced bleeding outcomes in a small cohort of patients. Larger studies are needed to better evaluate the efficacy of this and other IMiDs in the management of bleeding in HHT.

Use of novel systemic anti-angiogenic therapies

Anti-VEGF therapies are relatively new for patients with HHT, and their use has been increasing. Thalidomide, used commonly in the management of multiple myeloma, is thought to have both vascular and immunomodulatory effects. Its anti-angiogenic activity may be due to the suppression of production of VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Serum levels of VEGF were found to be decreased after thalidomide treatment in patients with GI bleeding. Nasal mucosal biopsies in HHT patients with epistaxis treated with thalidomide demonstrated vessel maturation and improved vessel wall defects.

Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody, is a rational therapeutic for HHT as it may reduce excessive angiogenesis (Figure 4). To date, all of the studies describing the use of systemic bevacizumab for the management of HHT have been retrospective cohorts, small case series, or single patient case reports (Table 3). A very recent retrospective study by Iyer et al. describes a large cohort of HHT patients receiving bevacizumab to treat GI bleeding and epistaxis. Thirty-four patients were given intravenous bevacizumab according to a standardized protocol, resulting in a statistically significant reduction in epistaxis severity scores and RBC transfusion requirements, although 4 patients developed new-onset or worsened hypertension. Most published studies have used bevacizumab at a dose of 5–10 mg/kg every 2–4 weeks for up to 6 cycles. A lower dose may be sufficient based on pharmacokinetic data showing VEGF suppression at 0.3 mg/kg. Adverse effects of bevacizumab may include hypertension, proteinuria, venous thromboembolism, intestinal perforation, and poor wound healing. Interestingly, epistaxis, which is often cited as a side effect in non-HHT patients, has not been a major complication in published studies or in our center's extensive experience. Bevacizumab may have an impact on high output states in reducing cardiac output. In one study,25 patients with severe hepatic vascular AVMs were treated with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 14 days for 6 cycles and showed an improvement in cardiac index at three months, reduced epistaxis, and improved quality of life. Bevacizumab nasal spray has been studied as a treatment for epistaxis. In a randomized phase I study (the ELLIPSE study), 40 patients received a single day treatment of 0.05–0.1 mL of (dose escalated) bevacizumab nasal spray into each nostril for a total dose of 12.5–100 mg. Initial results suggested that intranasal treatment was safe but not effective.

4.2 Validated Epistaxis Severity Measurement

The expert panel agreed that epistaxis severity measurement should be performed with one or more validated, HHT‐specific epistaxis severity instruments that assess epistaxis severity retrospectively and/or measured prospectively using an epistaxis diary (electronic epistaxis tracker app or paper diary), Table 1. The instruments currently highlighted for use are the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), a validated instrument used for evaluation of epistaxis severity in HHT (assessed over a reference time frame of 1–3 months; initially validated for 3 months), or the Nasal Outcome Score for Epistaxis in HHT (NOSE HHT), a more comprehensive instrument assessing epistaxis over a reference time frame of 2 weeks. Both instruments assess frequency, duration, and intensity of epistaxis and have simple numeric ranges and scoring that define mild, moderate, and severe epistaxis (additional details on each instrument can be found in the Appendix, pp.16–21). By nature, as patient‐reported outcome measures, these instruments are at least partially subjective. There are several important nuances in scoring the ESS, and best practices must be followed (as detailed in Table 2). In the setting of prospective studies, measurement of epistaxis frequency and duration using an epistaxis diary can supplement or substitute for an instrument‐based measurement in defining domain 1 epistaxis severity, an approach that may be a more precise measurement of overall epistaxis severity. The expert panel recognizes that other epistaxis severity instruments have been developed for use in HHT and that additional instruments will be developed in the future that may supplant the ESS and NOSE HHT and does not object to the use of alternative instruments in place of these, so long as they are appropriately validated. Given the potential week‐to‐week variability in epistaxis in a person with HHT, the expert panel recommends a reference time frame of evaluation of at least 4 weeks for baseline severity classification in clinical studies.

### Cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab therapy in the care of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^112Z47Wn]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

We also recognize several limitations in our model. Although our model is based on prospectively collected health resource utilization data across multiple international centers, the health resource utilization data from these same patients (ie, intrapatient comparison) before initiating bevacizumab was retrospective. Although it is subject to the typical limitations of retrospective data collection, the data were directly pulled by investigators from physician records over the preceding year. Second, these results only apply to patients with HHT with a strictly defined moderate-to-severe phenotype (supplemental Appendix for clinical definition). We also acknowledge that, on a population level, the severity of bleeding symptoms in HHT generally increase with age, and older patients bear a significantly greater burden of disease and subsequent degree of health care resource utilization than their younger counterparts. As such, the results of our 1-way sensitivity analysis on age must be carefully interpreted in this context; although severe symptoms (epistaxis and gastrointestinal) can and does occur in patients as young as 18 years, the majority of those experiencing moderate-to-severe bleeding are of an older age, on which the base-case and scenario analyses are all focused. Furthermore, alternative oral antiangiogenic agents that are currently underinvestigated for the treatment of HHT-associated bleeding, including pomalidomide, are outside the scope of this analysis.

### Can iron treatments aggravate epistaxis in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia? [^117YFzZM]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) poses a substantial burden on otorhinolaryngological practice. Inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, HHT is caused by gene defects, most commonly in ENG, ACVRL1, or SMAD4, and leads to the development of nasal and gastrointestinal telangiectasia, in addition to visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). 1, 2 Recurrent epistaxis (nosebleeds) is the hallmark of HHT 1, 2, 3, 4, and results from fragile nasal telangiectasia, which are often lined by a single endothelial layer with no smooth muscles cells or pericytes, despite acting as conduits for blood at arterial pressure 5 (see Supporting Fig. 1 in the online version of this article). Nosebleeds often occur daily, and can be associated with acute hemodynamic disturbances 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and reduced quality of life. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Treatments include surgically based therapies such as cauterization, laser photocoagulation, 13 septal dermoplasty, 14 and Young's procedure, 15 and medical therapies such as antioestrogens, 16 tranexamic acid, 17, 18 and bevacizumab (Avastin). 19, 20 Therapeutics are generally graded according to the severity of epistaxis, 21 and many patients require more than one modality. Further treatment modalities are currently under evaluation in clinical trials.

The epistaxis that can be so difficult to manage in clinical practice also causes additional problems. HHT patients are commonly iron deficient and/or anemic because replacing iron lost through recurrent hemorrhage demands very high iron intakes, and it is difficult to meet the hemorrhage‐adjusted iron requirement by dietary intake alone. 22 The diverse detrimental consequences of iron deficiency 23, 24, 25, 26 include anemia and transfusional requirements that occur because iron deficiency restricts erythropoeisis, 27 leading to low hemoglobin, 28 and reduced arterial oxygen content. 29, 30 The development of iron deficiency predicts development of high output cardiac failure for HHT patients with severe hepatic AVMs. 31 Additionally, low serum iron is associated with venous thromboemboli, 32 paradoxical embolic stroke through pulmonary AVMs, 33 exuberant platelet aggregation to 5HT, 33, 34 and elevated coagulation factor VIII. 32

Use of concurrent therapies to treat hereditary hemorrhagic telengiectasia-associated bleeding

Fifty-three patients (22%) received one (39 patients) or more (14 patients) local hemostatic procedures to treat epistaxis (41 patients, 17%), gastrointestinal bleeding (12 patients, 5%), or both (1 patient) in the first year after initiating bevacizumab. Thirty-three patients (14%) received antifibrinolytic therapy and one patient received an erythropoiesis- stimulating agent during the first year after initiating bevacizumab. In total, 73 patients (31%) did receive and 165 patients (69%) did not receive any of these therapies.

Patients receiving concurrent therapies were similar at baseline to those not receiving them, except for a slightly higher mean ESS (Online Supplementary Table S5). On bevacizumab treatment, patients receiving concurrent treatments for HHT-associated bleeding had slightly lower ontreatment mean hemoglobin and slightly higher on-treatment mean ESS, median number of RBC transfusions, and median number of iron infusions than those not receiving concurrent treatments (Online Supplementary Table S5).

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) is a rare multisystem vascular disorder causing chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, epistaxis, and severe anemia. Bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, may be effective to treat bleeding in HHT. This international, multicenter, retrospective study evaluated the use of systemic bevacizumab to treat HHT-associated bleeding and anemia at 12 HHT treatment centers. Hemoglobin, epistaxis severity score, red cell units transfused, and intravenous iron infusions before and after treatment were evaluated using paired means testing and mixed-effects linear models. 238 HHT patients received bevacizumab for a median of 12 (range, 1–96) months. Compared with pretreatment, bevacizumab increased mean hemoglobin by 3.2 g/dL (95% CI, 2.9–3.5 g/dL) [mean hemoglobin 8.6 (8.5, 8.8) g/dL versus 11.8 (11.5, 12.1) g/dL, p < 0.0001)] and decreased the epistaxis severity score (ESS) by 3.4 (3.2–3.7) points [mean ESS 6.8 (6.6–7.1) versus 3.4 (3.2–3.7), P < 0.0001] during the first year of treatment. Compared with 6 months pretreatment, RBC units transfused decreased by 82% [median of 6.0 (IQR 0.0–13.0) units versus 0 (IQR, 0.0–1.0) units, P < 0.0001] and iron infusions decreased by 70% [median of 6.0 (1.0–18.0) infusions versus 1.0 (0.0–4.0) infusions, P < 0.0001] during the first 6 months of bevacizumab treatment. Outcomes were similar regardless of underlying pathogenic mutation. Following initial induction infusions, continuous/scheduled bevacizumab maintenance achieved higher hemoglobin and lower ESS than intermittent/as needed maintenance but with more drug exposure. Bevacizumab was well tolerated: hypertension, fatigue, and proteinuria were the most common adverse events. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 2% of patients. In conclusion, systemic bevacizumab was safe and effective to manage chronic bleeding and anemia in HHT.

### Nasal outcome score for epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia… [^116RTusu]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Question Can a quality-of-life instrument be developed and validated to determine the outcome of epistaxis on physical problems, functional limitations, and emotional consequences in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Findings This survey study with 401 patients found that the 29-item Nasal Outcome Score for Epistaxis in HHT patient-reported outcome measure, with total scores ranging continuously from 0 to 4, was internally consistent, highly correlated with epistaxis severity, and responsive to change. It had a high test-retest reliability and a minimal clinically important difference of 0. 46 points. Conclusions and Relevance Evaluation of the consistency, reliability, and responsiveness of the NOSE HHT survey found it to be a valid instrument to assess severity and change in epistaxis. Study results suggest that the NOSE HHT survey is clinically applicable and useful as an outcome measure of future HHT-associated epistaxis trials.

Figure 2 shows that the NOSE HHT was responsive and sensitive to change among patients reporting Much improved, No change, and Much worse. We developed and validated the NOSE HHT with a total of 401 patients with HHT, assessing for consistency, validity, and responsiveness of the instrument. As noted, the emotional consequences subsection had the highest average score of the 3 domains, consistent with our clinical experience, as the toll that daily epistaxis can take on patients with HHT is readily apparent. From the consistency, reliability, and responsiveness of the NOSE HHT survey in our cohort, we propose that the NOSE HHT be used as an outcome measure in future HHT-associated epistaxis treatment trials.

The 2-week reference interval of the NOSE HHT permits monitoring of epistaxis every 2 weeks to allow determination of the time frame in which a particular intervention takes its effect, an approach routinely used in large chronic rhinosinusitis trials repeatedly assessing change on the widely used 20-Item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test. 20, 21.

### Standardization of terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria for bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: International Consensus Report [^111WwnFW]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

A placebo effect has been consistently observed with ESS, NOSE HHT, and epistaxis diary‐based endpoints in HHT trials. The expert panel has noted that based on the available data, this effect appears to be more pronounced with recall‐based instruments such as the ESS as opposed to epistaxis diary‐based endpoints (e.g. epistaxis duration). Moreover, electronic epistaxis diaries with built‐in data entry lockout after a reasonable length of time (e.g. 3–5 days) likely reduce epistaxis diary recall bias relative to paper diaries which can be filled in at any time between visits. This reduction in recall bias may minimize the placebo effect. Though more operationally challenging and more burdensome to the participant, a well‐implemented epistaxis diary is likely superior to the use of a recall‐based instrument as a primary endpoint. Whenever one is selected as a primary endpoint, however, the expert panel recommends inclusion of the other as a secondary efficacy endpoint.

After beginning bevacizumab 5 mg/kg at time 0, she became transfusion independent immediately and her hemoglobin normalized within two weeks. Bevacizumab was administered every other week for the first 4 infusions, then monthly as maintenance. Duration of maintenance therapy is patient-dependent and optimal dose and duration is not known.

Use of anticoagulation in patients with thrombosis

Patients who develop thrombotic complications present a difficult therapeutic dilemma given the inherent bleeding of the disease. The low serum iron levels in HHT patients have been associated with elevated factor VIII levels, along with a 2.5-fold increased risk of VTE events. In those patients who develop a VTE, therapeutic anticoagulation can be administered. This should be managed with caution and the patient should be screened for pulmonary and cerebral AVMs that may increase their bleeding risk.

Methods

Patients and data collection

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Partners Healthcare (approval 2016P002753/PHS). Nine centers in the USA and one center each in Argentina, Israel, and France participated in the study. All patients aged > 18 years treated with systemic (intravenous) bevacizumab for HHT-associated bleeding (epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or both) from January 1, 2011 until May 1, 2019 were identified at each participating institution. General criteria used by centers to offer systemic bevacizumab for HHT-associated bleeding are detailed in Online Supplementary Table S1. Additional data collection information is given in the Online Supplementary Methods.

Effectiveness measures

Hemoglobin

Anemia was defined as a baseline hemoglobin (Hb) < 11 g/dL regardless of gender. Baseline hemoglobin was calculated as the average of all measured hemoglobin values in the 6 months prior to bevacizumab initiation (at least 2 values required) and compared with mean on-treatment hemoglobin (mean of values collected at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months depending on treatment duration).

Epistaxis Severity Score

Background information regarding the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) is provided in the Online Supplementary Methods. The baseline ESS at initiation of bevacizumab was compared with the mean on-treatment ESS (mean of values collected at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months depending on treatment duration).

Red blood cell transfusion and iron infusion

The number of red blood cell (RBC) units transfused in the first 6 months on treatment was compared with the number of units transfused in the 6 months prior to treatment. Additionally, events in the second 6 months on treatment were compared with those in the first 6 months on treatment to evaluate ongoing response. The same analysis was performed for the number of intravenous iron infusions administered.

To be included in effectiveness analyses, patients needed to receive ≥ 3 months of treatment (Hb and ESS) or ≥ 6 months of treatment (RBC transfusion and iron infusion).

Subgroup analyses

Subgroup analyses for each effectiveness outcome were performed by genotype (ENG vs. ACVRL1 mutation) as well as by maintenance dosing method (continuous vs. intermittent bevacizumab maintenance following an initial series of induction infusions).

Receipt of concurrent bleeding and anemia-directed therapies

Rates of freedom from hemostatic procedures and medical treatments (antifibrinolytic or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents) in the year following bevacizumab initiation were calculated, and effectiveness outcomes in patients who received these concurrent HHT-directed therapies were compared to those in patients who did not receive concurrent HHT-directed therapies.

Results

Patients' characteristics

Two hundred fifty-seven HHT patients were treated with systemic bevacizumab for epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or both for the purpose of alleviating bleeding and consequent iron-deficiency anemia at the 12 participating centers during the study period. After 19 patients had been excluded because of inadequate chart data (missing baseline data or incomplete bevacizumab dosing information), 238 patients were included in the data analysis. Table 1 lists the patients' baseline characteristics. Patients were treated for a median of 12 (range, 1–96) months, receiving a median of 11 (range, 1–74) infusions of intravenous bevacizumab. This totaled 343.9 patientyears of systemic bevacizumab treatment of HHT-associated bleeding in the cohort.

Bevacizumab induction and maintenance dosing

Specific dosing protocols were institution-dependent. Two hundred twenty-one patients (93%) began treatment by receiving four to six induction infusions of bevacizumab 5 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks; 46 (19%) also received an additional four induction infusions administered every 4 weeks. Induction courses typically lasted 2–4 months but never extended beyond 6 months. A total of 181 patients received maintenance treatment, which was defined as additional bevacizumab doses administered to prevent or treat recurrent bleeding after completion of the initial induction infusion course. These maintenance doses were administered using one of two different protocols. The majority of patients (n = 136) received continuous maintenance, defined as bevacizumab administered on a regular schedule every 4–12 weeks. The remainder (n = 45) received intermittent maintenance, defined as retreatment only following recurrence or worsening of bleeding symptoms or anemia, with one to four doses administered every 2 weeks once the need for maintenance was triggered. Ninety-two percent of patients were given maintenance doses of 5 mg/kg per infusion (regardless of maintenance schedule) but doses of 1, 2.5, 3, and 7.5 mg/kg were also used occasionally. Compared with the relatively universal induction dose intensity of 10.0 mg/kg/month, mean maintenance dose intensity was 4.0 mg/kg/month in patients receiving continuous maintenance and 3.0 mg/kg/month in patients receiving intermittent maintenance.

Introduction

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a well-defined endothelial vasculopathywith established clinical diagnostic criteria, known causal genes, and expert consensus informing clinical practice across general and subspecialty management. Estimated to affect approximately 1.5 million individuals worldwide, HHT usually results from a heterozygous null allele in ACVRL1, ENG, or SMAD4 and is transmissible as an autosomal dominant trait. Evidence from early family-based analyseshas been supported by decades of studies in patientsand animal models, confirming that loss-of-function causes abnormal vascular structures, including telangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).

Telangiectasia and larger AVMs are characterized by defective vascular walls predisposing to hemorrhage. Individuals affected by HHT experience spontaneous, recurrent nosebleeds due to abnormal nasal vasculature and exhibit small, visible telangiectatic vessels that tend to develop on the lips, oral cavity, and finger pads. Many have long-term excellent health with modest hemorrhagic losses, although most experience nosebleeds sufficient to lead to iron deficiency anemia unless dietary iron intake is supplemented, and significant proportions require surgical interventional treatments and/or disease-modifying drugs such as antiangiogenic agents.-Patients are commonly found to have silent visceral AVMs, and screening/primary prevention strategies have led to improved life expectancy.

### Medical treatment for epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a meta-analysis [^1129Z2tB]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study (PROSPERO ID: CRD42017081952) was to evaluate medical treatment for epistaxis from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were interrogated from their inceptions to November 2017.

Review Methods

Randomized clinical trials comparing medical treatment with placebo for epistaxis of HHT were included. We used a random-effects model to synthesize overall effects. Heterogeneity was evaluated with the I² statistic.

Results

Eight studies were identified after systematic searching. The use of bevacizumab (BV), tranexamic acid, and estrogen, regardless of the route of administration, had no significant influence on frequency of episodes. Tamoxifen was superior to placebo in both frequency and severity of epistaxis. For duration of epistaxis, nasal spray BV, oral or nasal spray tranexamic acid, and nasal spray estrogen had no significant differences versus placebo, but patients receiving submucosal BV showed lower duration of epistaxis (mean difference: -219.00 min/mo, 95% CI: -271.90 to -166.10). Medical treatment for HHT had no significant changes of mean hemoglobin concentration (pooled mean difference: -0.23 mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.65 to 0.20, I² = 0%) or quality of life (pooled standardized mean difference: 0.07, 95% CI: -0.16 to 0.30, I² = 0%).

Conclusions

Only limited evidence provides a benefit on frequency of epistaxis by treatment with tamoxifen and duration of epistaxis by treatment with submucosal BV among patients with HHT. Mean hemoglobin concentration and quality of life were not influenced by medical treatment.

Patients requiring prior iron infusion

In the analysis of only those patients who received iron infusion in the 6 months prior to treatment (n = 155), median number of iron infusions decreased from 8.0 (IQR, 3.0–20.0) in the 6 months before treatment to 2.0 (IQR, 0.0–5.0) in the first 6 months after treatment (P < 0.0001); 48/155 (31%) patients were iron infusion-free. There was a maintained and continued reduction into the second 6 months of bevacizumab treatment (median of 0.0 units, IQR 0.0–3.0), with 84/138 (61%) patients being iron infusion-free (Figure 1D). The decline in iron infusion requirements was observed regardless of baseline disease severity (Figure 2B).

Subgroup analysis by genotype

There were no significant differences between baseline hematologic parameters or effect of bevacizumab treatment on these parameters between patients with ENG and ACVRL1 mutations (Online Supplementary Table S3).

Subgroup analysis by maintenance dosing strategy

As compared with patients receiving continuous scheduled bevacizumab maintenance, those receiving intermittent (as-needed) bevacizumab maintenance had a lower mean hemoglobin (10.8 g/dL vs. 12.3 g/dL; P = 0.0002) and higher ESS (4.96 vs. 2.88; P < 0.0001) during the second 6 months of bevacizumab treatment (Online Supplementary Table S4). There were no significant differences in iron infusions or RBC transfusions between the two groups.

### Standardization of terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria for bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: International Consensus Report [^111Bt9YG]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Consistent with the expert panel's recommendation above to include participants with moderate and severe bleeding in pivotal clinical trials of agents to treat HHT‐associated bleeding, the expert panel recommends caution with the use of a hematologic endpoint (solitary or composite) as a primary or co‐primary endpoint in such trials. The panel makes this recommendation given the substantial heterogeneity in baseline hematologic support requirements among participants with moderate bleeding, resulting in a high risk of randomization failure between study groups and challenges properly powering such a trial (Appendix, pp.7–9). Conversely, for trials limiting the studied population to those with severe bleeding, a composite hematologic endpoint such as the HSS is an ideal primary endpoint. The severe bleeding population has sufficiently high baseline hematologic support requirements to adequately power such a trial and is typically enriched with participants suffering from chronic gastrointestinal bleeding who have high baseline hematologic support requirements. Evaluation of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding remains reliant on hematologic measurements (ideally composite hematologic endpoints) as there is currently no reliable means to quantify gastrointestinal blood loss specifically or to separate it from concurrent epistaxis blood loss.

Additionally, the expert panel recommends the use of protocolized thresholds for the administration of hematologic support in prospective HHT clinical trials. Practice variation between investigators, countries, and hospitals introduces a major source of potential confounding and bias pertaining to the administration of red cell transfusions and intravenous iron and may cause a failure to accurately assess the therapeutic potential of a drug. Protocolized ferritin and transferrin saturation thresholds (e.g. ferritin < 50 ng/mL and/or transferrin saturation < 20%) should be utilized to trigger iron infusion, which should require infusion of a narrow range of iron quantity (e.g. 400–600 mg or 800–1000 mg) for each occurrence. A narrow range of iron quantity is crucial in allowing for necessary flexibility to use one of many different IV iron formulations while controlling the amount of iron administered with each triggered infusion. Similarly, explicit hemoglobin transfusion thresholds should be defined in the protocol to trigger transfusion of a certain number of red‐cell units (e.g. hemoglobin < 8.5 g/L triggers transfusion of 1 unit, hemoglobin < 7.5 g/dL triggers transfusion of 2 units, etc.). For red‐cell transfusion‐dependent participants, investigators may choose to make transfusion thresholds individualized to a given participant, if they desire, as has been done successfully in other trials enrolling participants with transfusion‐dependent anemia.

### Pomalidomide for epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^113s7q7n]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This randomized double-blind trial demonstrated that pomalidomide resulted in a significant improvement in the epistaxis severity score and substantially improved disease specific HRQoL. These improvements occurred despite a strong placebo effect that dissipated following discontinuation of blinded study drug. Additional objective measures, including incidence of blood transfusion, quantity of infused iron, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV and MCHC were all directionally consistent with these outcomes. The benefits of pomalidomide were most apparent over the second twelve weeks of the study, not dependent on HHT genotype or epistaxis severity and persisted during the four weeks after treatment discontinuation.

Pomalidomide is structurally related to other IMiD family drugs, particularly thalidomide. These agents share similar properties, including therapeutic efficacy in multiple myeloma. Compared to thalidomide, however, pomalidomide displays an improved safety profile, with a lower incidence of cytopenias and peripheral neuropathy. Given that fatigue and thrombosis have been observed in populations with multiple myeloma receiving IMiDs and are relevant in HHT, the low and similar rates of these adverse events in treatment and placebo arms suggest feasibility for the use of pomalidomide in HHT.

Pomalidomide was generally associated with low grade toxicities. The most notable adverse event was neutropenia that was generally mild, not associated with opportunistic infections, and promptly reversible with dose modification. We observed no reduction in efficacy in patients in whom the pomalidomide dose was decreased, suggesting that, as with thalidomide, lower doses of pomalidomide may be similarly efficacious in HHT with fewer adverse events.

HHT is characterized by mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 or SMAD4 in more than 90% of patients. These genes encode proteins involved in signaling through the TGF-β/BMP pathway and the beneficial effects of pomalidomide in HHT might reflect reversal of angiogenic dysregulation by bypassing or reversing abnormalities in TGF-β/BMP signaling. We found that the Epistaxis Severity Score improved similarly in patients with either ENG or ACVRL1 mutations. In a seven patient pilot study, participants treated with thalidomide underwent biopsy of nasal telangiectasia before and after treatment. Examination of post-treatment biopsies did not demonstrate inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, but rather enhanced mural cell coverage of the vasculature.

A 64-year-old woman with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) characterized by a pathological variant in ACVRL1 presents to the clinic for follow-up. Manifestations of HHT include frequent epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to iron-deficiency anemia. Bevacizumab is initiated, with resolution of the anemia. While maintained on a regimen of bevacizumab every 6 weeks, she continues to report frequent epistaxis and has ongoing iron-deficiency requiring periodic iron infusions. She also finds the bevacizumab infusions inconvenient. She is interested in discussing other options for managing her disease.

### Standardization of terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria for bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: International Consensus Report [^1118cYAw]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

9 Conclusions

This ICR harmonizes definitions, terminology, and response criteria for bleeding in HHT, providing an evidence‐ and expertise‐based framework for the development and implementation of clinical studies in this field. It is also expected to be useful in the future development of clinical guidelines. This was achieved through the use of rigorous evidence review, a large and international group of experts, inclusion of the patient and patient advocate voice, achievement of consensus over multiple face‐to‐face meetings and multiple rounds of review and revision, and rigorous external review prior to finalization. It stands out as the largest effort to date in the global harmonization of HHT terminology, definitions, and clinical trial planning and design. Ultimately, standardization efforts such as this one must evolve with time and acquisition of new evidence, and the ICR Working Group members are committed to the ongoing re‐evaluation of this report.

### An international, multicenter study of intravenous bevacizumab for bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: the InHIBIT-bleed study [^115EF3aw]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) is a rare multisystem vascular disorder that causes chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, epistaxis, and severe anemia. Bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, may be effective to treat bleeding in HHT. This international, multicenter, retrospective study evaluated the use of systemic bevacizumab to treat HHTassociated bleeding and anemia at 12 HHT treatment centers. Hemoglobin, Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), red cell units transfused, and intravenous iron infusions before and after treatment were evaluated using paired means testing and mixed-effects linear models. Bevacizumab was given to 238 HHT patients for a median of 12 (range, 1–96) months. Compared with pretreatment, bevacizumab increased mean hemoglobin by 3.2 g/dL (95% confidence interval: 2.9–3.5 g/dL); i.e. from a mean hemoglobin of 8.6 (8.5–8.8) g/dL to 11.8 (11.5–12.1) g/dL; P < 0.0001) and decreased the ESS by 3.4 (3.2–3.7) points (mean ESS 6.8 [6.6–7.1] versus 3.4 [3.2–3.7]; P < 0.0001) during the first year of treatment. Compared with 6 months before treatment, the number of red blood cell units transfused decreased by 82% (median of 6.0 [interquartile range, 0.0–13.0] units versus 0 [0.0–1.0] units; P < 0.0001) and iron infusions decreased by 70% (median of 6.0 [1.0–18.0] infusions versus 1.0 [0.0–4.0] infusions, P < 0.0001) during the first 6 months of bevacizumab treatment. Outcomes were similar regardless of the underlying pathogenic mutation. Following initial induction infusions, continuous/scheduled bevacizumab maintenance achieved higher hemoglobin and lower ESS than intermittent/as-needed maintenance but with more drug exposure. Bevacizumab was well tolerated: hypertension, fatigue, and proteinuria were the most common adverse events. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 2% of patients. In conclusion, systemic bevacizumab was safe and effective for managing chronic bleeding and anemia in HHT.

### Bevacizumab in the treatment of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^114FB9BF]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare multisystem vascular disorder characterized by epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases and visceral arteriovenous malformations predisposing to shunting and hemorrhage. Angiogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HHT and therefore angiogenesis inhibitors appear to be the most promising agents. A literature search was performed to identify all articles reporting bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We focused on the HHT pathogenesis, mechanism of action of the drug, its impact on the HHT symptoms and safety profile.

Areas Covered

Systemic intravenous administration of bevacizumab improves the frequency and intensity of epistaxis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding episodes and liver arteriovenous malformations consequences. The safety profile of the systematic administration of the drug appears to be excellent with hypertension as the unique adverse effect reported so far. Its intranasal administration significantly decreases frequency and severity of nosebleeds and blood transfusion requirements.

Expert Opinion

In the absence of randomized controlled trials in HHT, criteria of selecting patients and formal recommendations for treatment are lacking. For life-threatening epistaxis requiring blood transfusion, topical treatment with bevacizumab may be beneficial. Systemic treatment with bevacizumab is promising in symptomatic patients with organ involvement and life-threatening conditions.

### Pomalidomide for epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^116ZvEGc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Participants treated with pomalidomide demonstrated increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. These occurred despite a substantial decrease in intravenous iron infusions and red cell transfusions.

We observed a persistent reduction in the Epistaxis Severity Score below baseline in the four weeks following pomalidomide treatment, accompanied by further improvement in the HHT-specific quality-of-life score, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. These results suggest that pomalidomide effects may extend beyond the duration of treatment in HHT, and that the failure to more substantially increase hemoglobin levels during treatment may represent a component of bone marrow suppression by pomalidomide at the 4 mg daily dosing regimen used in this study.

The efficacy of pomalidomide compared to bevacizumab in HHT can only be discerned by head-to-head trials. Retrospective reports of intravenous bevacizumab enrolled patients with a higher mean Epistaxis Severity Score than our study, though the reduction in Epistaxis Severity Score in pomalidomide treated patients with Epistaxis Severity Score ≥ 6 compared to those in series of bevacizumab is similar. An advantage of pomalidomide, unlike bevacizumab, is that it is an oral medication and might be more convenient for patients without access to infusion centers. Whether pomalidomide or bevacizumab are more effective in patients with different types of bleeding or sites of arteriovenous malformations is uncertain and will need to be determined in future studies. Since pomalidomide and bevacizumab may have different mechanisms of action, they may have additive or synergistic activity in severe cases of HHT.

Strengths of this study include double-blind treatment, adequate power for the primary outcome, broad inclusion criteria, and thorough collection of secondary outcomes. Evidence of efficacy based on changes in the Epistaxis Severity Score led to early study termination, resulting in reduction from the planned sample size, thus impacting power for secondary outcome analyses. A potential weakness of the study is that similar efficacy might have been observed with lower doses of pomalidomide with less toxicity. In addition, Black patients were underrepresented.

Though our study provides evidence of efficacy and safety of pomalidomide for HHT-related epistaxis, whether similar effects are evident in patients with GI bleeding, or pulmonary, liver or brain arteriovenous malformations is uncertain. Moreover, defining mechanisms of action of pomalidomide in HHT will require additional studies. Most importantly, however, PATH-HHT demonstrates efficacy of a new agent for HHT that may provide improved quality of life for this population for whom no approved therapies exist.

### Effect of bevacizumab nasal spray on epistaxis duration in hereditary hemorrhagic telangectasia: a randomized clinical trial [^116gL84Q]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Epistaxis is the most frequent and disabling manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The efficacy of intravenous bevacizumab (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody) for epistaxis has been shown. However, the efficacy of intranasal bevacizumab has yet to be evaluated.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of 3 different doses of bevacizumab administered as a nasal spray in a repeated manner for the duration of nosebleeds in patients with HHT.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 clinical trial with dose selection at an intermediate analysis and prespecified stopping rules (nonbinding stopping for futility). Patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of HHT were recruited from 5 French centers from April 2014 to January 2015 with a 6-month follow-up after the end of treatment. Participants had a history of self-reported nosebleeds with a monthly duration of more than 20 minutes in at least the 3 months prior to inclusion corroborated by epistaxis grids completed during the same preinclusion period.

Interventions

Eighty consecutive HHT patients were randomized and treated in the phase 2 study, with 4 parallel groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. One group received placebo (n = 21); the other 3 received bevacizumab nasal spray. Each bevacizumab group received a different dose of the drug (25 mg [n = 20], 50 mg [n = 20], or 75 mg [n = 19] per treatment) in 3 doses 14 days apart for a total treatment duration of 4 weeks, resulting in a total dose of 75 mg, 150 mg, and 225 mg in each treatment group.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mean monthly epistaxis duration for 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of the treatment.

Results

Of the 80 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60.47 [SD, 10.61] years; 37 women [46.25%]), 75 completed the study. Mean monthly epistaxis duration measured at 3 months was not significantly different in the 59 patients receiving bevacizumab in comparison with the placebo group (P = 0.57) or between the bevacizumab groups. The mean monthly epistaxis duration was 259.2 minutes (95% CI, 82.1–436.3 minutes) in the 25-mg group, 244.0 minutes (95% CI, 81.8–406.2 minutes) in the 50-mg group, 215.0 minutes (95% CI, 102.8–327.2 minutes) in the 75-mg group, and 200.4 minutes (95% CI, 109.3–291.5 minutes) in the placebo group. Toxicity was low and no severe adverse events were reported. This study was terminated prior to phase 3 for treatment futility after interim analysis on the recommendations of an independent data monitoring committee.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with HHT, a bevacizumab nasal spray treatment of 3 administrations at 14-day intervals with doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg per spray, compared with a placebo, did not reduce monthly epistaxis duration in the 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of treatment.

### Tranexamic acid for epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients: a European cross-over controlled trial in a rare disease [^1179FPsv]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disorder associated with abnormal angiogenesis and disabling epistaxis. Tranexamic acid (TA) has been widely used in the treatment of these severe bleeds but with no properly designed trial.

Objectives

To demonstrate the efficacy of TA in epistaxis in HHT patients and to explore its safety of use.

Patients/Methods

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial was conducted. Participants were randomized to receive TA (3 g a day) then placebo or the opposite sequence. The main analysis compared intra-individual mean duration of epistaxis under TA vs. placebo on a log scale. The primary outcome was the mean duration of epistaxis per month, assessed with specific grids to be completed by participants. The number of epistaxis episodes was recorded as a secondary outcome.

Results

A total of 118 randomized patients contributed to the statistical analysis. The mean duration of epistaxis per month was significantly shorter with TA than placebo (0.19 on the log scale; SD = 0.07; P = 0.005), corresponding to a decrease of 17.3% (15.7 min) in the duration of epistaxis per month (CI 95%, 5.5–27.6). The median number of epistaxis episodes per month was 22.1 episodes in the placebo arm vs. 23.3 episodes in the TA arm. No thrombophlebitis was observed.

Conclusions

In the ATERO study, we demonstrated a significant decrease in the duration of epistaxis in HHT patients taking TA. No safety issues were recorded in our cohort of patients.

### Pomalidomide for epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^115oF1dm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Affecting approximately 1 in 3800 persons, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is the second most common inherited bleeding disorder.HHT is an autosomal dominant vasculopathy caused by mutations affecting transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/BMP signaling, resulting in fragile mucocutaneous telangiectasias and visceral arteriovenous malformations. Over 95% of patients develop recurrent epistaxis, with frequent psychiatric comorbidity (depression and post-traumatic stress disorder) and reduction in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). – One-third of patients exhibit gastrointestinal bleeding, and most develop iron deficiency anemia. HHT-associated bleeding usually worsens over the lifespan and results in a requirement for frequent iron infusions and/or red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Visceral arteriovenous malformations also occur in the lung (~50%), liver (~70%), and brain (~20%)andmay result in embolic stroke, pulmonary hemorrhage, tissue or brain abscesses, high output heart failure, hepatic disease, hemorrhagic stroke, and epilepsy. Despite the morbidity of visceral arteriovenous malformations, patients distinctly identify bleeding as their most important disease manifestation. Patients with HHT may have reduced overall survival relative to the general population.

No treatments for HHT are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency. Management of bleeding involves temporizing ablative procedures on telangiectasias in the nose and gastrointestinal tract, off-label use of antifibrinolytic drugs, and potentially more aggressive surgery (e.g. surgical closure of the nares). However, given the systemic angiogenic dysregulation inherent to HHT, repurposing systemic antiangiogenic agents for its treatment has been explored. – Non-randomized and/or underpowered studies with bevacizumab or thalidomide suggest some effectiveness in treating HHT-associated bleeding. – Thalidomide, an immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD), is the only antiangiogenic agent with positive prospective efficacy in HHT, demonstrated in a 31-patient study. However, thalidomide is associated with serious toxicities, such as thromboembolism and irreversible peripheral neuropathy.

We wished to determine whether pomalidomide, a thalidomide derivative, may have efficacy in treating HHT with a more favorable toxicity profile. IMiDs such as pomalidomide may be disease-modifying in HHT, improving the integrity of fragile telangiectasias and exerting an antiangiogenic effect.

### Intranasal submucosal bevacizumab for epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^113mCict]. Head & Neck (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of bevacizumab ("Avastin") for the treatment of epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

Methods

In this double blind, placebo controlled trial, 15 adult patients with HHT with a minimum of 2 epistaxis episodes per week were randomized. A history of thromboembolic events or recent or planned surgery led to exclusion. Patients received a single intranasal submucosal injection (10 mL) of 100 mg bevacizumab or placebo. The primary outcome was the relative reduction of average daily epistaxis visual analog score (VAS).

Results

Average daily posttreatment VAS scores decreased by 27% in the bevacizumab group and by 3% in the placebo group (p = .57). The reduction in HHT epistaxis severity scores was -0.61 greater in the bevacizumab group compared to the placebo group (p = .34).

Conclusion

Results show a trend toward reduced epistaxis with bevacizumab. This further supports the use of bevacizumab in HHT. Clincial Trials. gov number: NCT01314274

### Reviewing the efficiency of the initial work-up for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in a tertiary referral university center in Belgium [^111E4ymA]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is under-recognized, and specialized referral centers are limited, specifically in Belgium. The primary aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of our patients with HHT, in particular the prevalence of vascular malformations (VMs). Secondary objective was to describe associations between patient's current work-up and anemia.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of 118 patients treated at our center between 2015 and 2024. We analyzed documented VM and correlation with genetic work-up, prevalence of epistaxis, and referral of patients to specialist ENT services. We studied the correlation between anemia and clinical parameters such as documented digestive telangiectasia.

Results

The main results confirmed the dominance of epistaxis among the documented symptoms. Anemia was correlated with age and presence of documented digestive telangiectasia. Only 55% of patients with epistaxis were referred to an otorhinolaryngologist. The majority of patients (65%) had documented multisystem involvement of at least 2 organs, and the majority of important VMs (lung and liver) were documented properly. However, liver malformations remain not documented in 41% of cases and lung malformations in 31% of cases. In our cohort, 61% of patients underwent genetic analysis (80% ENG and/or ACVRL1). However, there was no significant association between genetic and multisystem work-up or specific phenotype.

Conclusions

We highlighted the importance of epistaxis as a cardinal symptom in the management of HHT. We also highlighted strengths and gaps that could lead to future improvements, such as systematic referral of patients with epistaxis to ENT and improved coordination of care. Further longitudinal studies would allow us to assess the impact of improved pathways to improve patient care nationwide.

### Pazopanib in treatment of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding [^115m7RTu]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a bleeding disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations, commonly presenting with epistaxis and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Bleeding symptoms may be difficult to manage and may become life-threatening, with many patients developing dependence on parenteral iron and/or blood transfusion. There is a growing body of evidence that antiangiogenic therapies may be effective in management of bleeding symptoms, presumably targeting pathogenic HHT pathways such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor.

Objectives

To report single-center, retrospective real-world use of pazopanib, an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, in 6 patients with HHT-associated epistaxis and/or GI bleeding.

Methods

A retrospective observational analysis was performed to assess the safety/efficacy of pazopanib use in patients with confirmed HHT-associated epistaxis and/or GI bleeding between January 1, 2019, and June 14, 2023. The Indiana Hemophilia and Thrombosis institutional electronic medical record was queried for HHT patients who were treated with pazopanib for ≥ 3 months. Patient data were obtained from patient documentation, physician/nursing notes, and on-call documentation. Institutional review board approval was obtained for data pull as an exempt study.

Results

Our observations on the real-world use of pazopanib in 6 HHT patients with moderate-to-severe bleeding showed improvement in hemoglobin levels, with reduction in iron infusions and red blood cell transfusion requirement.

Conclusion

Pazopanib may be a reasonable option for patients with HHT with epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleeding that are refractory to standard treatment.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia / avastin [^112EW3Tf]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

This is the first scientific report of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) epistaxis treatment by intranasal spraying of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor bevacizumab (Avastin). Epistaxis in patients with HHT is a morbid, mortal condition that is difficult and unpleasant to manage. Nasal telangiectasia growth is modulated by VEGF, which is elevated in HHT patients. Bevacizumab is a VEGF inhibitor that diminishes epistaxis when administered intravenously or injected locally, or as reported here when sprayed topically onto the nasal mucosa.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^1166fVm1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Nosebleed (Epistaxis) — hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia identification is recommended: The clinician should assess for the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients with recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

### Integration of genotypic data into clinical trial design and reporting in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia could help personalize treatment [^114njzJs]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited vascular malformation syndrome that has diverse consequences including recurrent bleeding which often results in anemia requiring iron supplementation or transfusion. Hemorrhage interventions range from nasal topical humidification, to oral agents such as tranexamic acid, local ablative treatments, and for patients still requiring intravenous iron supplementation or red cell transfusions, systemic anti-angiogenic therapies which have demonstrated promise in observational studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) indicate benefit from topical saline, oral tranexamic acid, tamoxifen, and high-dose oestrogen-progesterone. The number of eligible patients limits the trial size for anti-angiogenic agents. This was evident in the only bevacizumab RCT, which, with 24 transfusion-dependent recruits, was underpowered due to interpatient heterogeneity and did not meet its primary endpoint. This prompted us to explore across all reported HHT treatments, whether causal DNA mutations may affect patient responses to drug treatments utilized in HHT clinical trials.

HHT results from the disruption of the BMP9/BMP10 signaling pathway, due to loss-of-function mutations usually in endoglin (ENG) or activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1). Both genes encode proteins that are constituents of the BMP9 receptor complex, although pathogenic mutations are associated with subtly different clinical phenotypes, such as variations in the distribution of arteriovenous malformations. Furthermore, there is variability in the type of loss-of-function mutations in these genes: in ENG, frameshift and nonsense mutations are predominant, leading to premature termination codons (PTC), while ACVRL1 shows a higher prevalence of missense substitutions. Notably, a recent study of over 400 patients demonstrated that those with PTC-generating mutations exhibited different HHT bleeding patterns, supported by distinct endothelial cell phenotypes.
