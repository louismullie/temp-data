## Question

What are the different types of fundoplication procedures?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the different types of fundoplication procedures are, distinguishing approaches and specific wrap configurations, including endoscopic TIF variants. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching procedural approaches, namely surgical versus endoscopic. Then, I should classify the surgical wraps by geometry and orientation, such as total (360°) versus partial (posterior 270°, anterior 180° or 90°). Next, I will review the endoscopic transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) iterations and their morphological targets. Finally, I should verify comparative outcomes, guideline-aligned indications, and technical modifiers that influence selection and performance, making sure I don't overstate claims and that I reconcile any conflicting data before concluding [^1143gjn4] [^111R9p44].

> Let me first confirm the two main approaches. Hold on, I need to ensure I'm not conflating device-based alternatives with fundoplication itself. The literature consistently separates surgical fundoplications performed open or laparoscopically from endoscopic/transoral methods, with contemporary comparative analyses often including magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA) alongside surgical wraps and TIF, although MSA is not a fundoplication per se [^1143gjn4]. Endoscopic fundoplication is represented primarily by transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF), which aims to recreate an antireflux valve endoluminally in carefully selected patients [^113gweD5].

> Now, I will examine the canonical surgical total fundoplication. The Nissen procedure is a complete 360° wrap of the gastric fundus around the distal esophagus; wait, I should verify both its prevalence and its status as the benchmark. Multilevel meta-analyses show that Nissen is the most commonly performed surgical intervention in contemporary cohorts and often achieves greater improvement in objective reflux metrics like DeMeester scores compared to partial wraps and TIF, supporting its role as the reference standard in many studies and guidelines [^1143gjn4] [^116FYiMh] [^111VGGqN].

> Next, I should review posterior partial fundoplication. Toupet fundoplication is a 270° posterior wrap; let me double-check its symptomatic trade-offs. Network meta-analyses and randomized data suggest Toupet provides reflux control comparable to Nissen while tending to reduce dysphagia risk, though absolute differences attenuate over longer-term follow-up in some series, which I should keep in mind before overgeneralizing [^116spx5P] [^114bSNBE] [^116P6DnX].

> I will now examine anterior partial wraps. Dor fundoplication is typically an anterior partial wrap performed at 180° and commonly paired with Heller myotomy for achalasia; wait, I initially stated 180° exactly, but I should correct that some trials define Dor as 180°–200°, so I'll acknowledge that range to stay precise. Anterior 90° (often called Watson) is a less extensive anterior wrap; long-term randomized data show fewer side effects than Nissen but inferior reflux control for the 90° configuration, whereas posterior partial wraps have demonstrated superior reflux control compared with an anterior partial in head-to-head trials, which matters when dysphagia avoidance must be balanced against reflux suppression [^116P6DnX] [^111fBKd2] [^116eKU4v] [^112FTJ76].

> Hold on, I should verify technical modifiers that influence outcomes. Wrap length and construction details can affect failure rates and symptom profiles, so I need to check that before concluding equivalence across techniques. Five-year data suggest wrap length interacts with failure patterns for both Nissen and Toupet, and guidelines advise against tailoring the degree of fundoplication to preoperative manometry alone in the absence of achalasia, which I should emphasize to avoid overinterpreting motility tests in GERD. Additionally, longer-term randomized follow-up shows that differences in mechanical side effects between total and partial wraps can diminish over decades, and contemporary series report similar persistent dysphagia rates across total versus partial fundoplications when adjusted for confounders [^113EsdqQ] [^111PXSV2] [^112ZJDft] [^1134j6Sj].

> Next, I should review endoscopic fundoplication types. Initially, I almost conflated the TIF versions, but wait, let me verify the evolution. TIF 1.0 employed a longitudinally oriented plication, whereas TIF 2.0 added a rotational component wrapping the cardia and fundus around the distal esophagus, aiming for a 2–4 cm intra-abdominal neovalve that morphologically mimics surgical fundoplication with an approximately 200–300° valve geometry, which is a key distinction I need to maintain. Contemporary reviews and RCTs show TIF 2.0 can improve symptoms in selected patients with appropriate anatomy, with guideline recommendations positioning TIF for those with troublesome regurgitation or heartburn who do not have severe esophagitis or a large hiatal hernia and prefer to avoid surgery [^1112JwCh] [^116ninkV] [^113gweD5] [^111R9p44].

> But wait, what if a patient has a significant hiatal hernia or severe esophagitis; I need to check guideline thresholds. The ACG recommends considering TIF in the absence of severe esophagitis (LA grade C/D) and when hiatal hernia is ≤ 2 cm, whereas patients with larger hernias generally require crural repair, sometimes combined with TIF in a convergent cTIF workflow, though patient selection remains critical. For larger paraesophageal hernias, SAGES guidance supports formal hernia repair, typically with a surgical fundoplication at the time of repair, which is important to remember when classifying options by anatomy rather than by symptom profile alone [^111R9p44] [^111vL8Bg] [^1118XhUv].

> I should now reconcile comparative effectiveness to avoid overclaiming. Meta-analyses that pool longitudinal measurements indicate that Nissen generally achieves greater improvements in objective reflux metrics than TIF and, in some analyses, greater than Toupet, although symptom-based outcomes often converge and Toupet can reduce dysphagia risk relative to Nissen in selected series. Anterior 90° partial wraps tend to have fewer side effects but offer inferior reflux control versus Nissen at long-term follow-up, which aligns with the mechanical expectations of a smaller anterior wrap [^1143gjn4] [^116FYiMh] [^116eKU4v] [^116spx5P].

> Let me consider alternatives to ensure clarity of scope. Magnetic sphincter augmentation frequently appears in the same comparative frameworks and is an important non-fundoplication option, but it is not a fundoplication; its inclusion in meta-analyses should not blur the classification task here. Finally, I should confirm that reoperation patterns after failed fundoplication often favor redo fundoplication, with conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass considered especially in obese patients, reinforcing that initial procedure choice and patient selection influence later pathways, even though that extends beyond the taxonomy requested [^1143gjn4] [^113hLXvx].

Fundoplication procedures are classified by wrap degree and approach [^116spx5P], with **Nissen (360°)** providing the most robust reflux control [^1143gjn4] but with a higher dysphagia risk [^116P6DnX], and **Toupet (270°)** or **Dor (180–200°)** offering comparable reflux control [^114bSNBE] with fewer side effects [^116P6DnX]. Anterior partial wraps (90–180°) have fewer side effects [^116eKU4v] but provide less durable reflux control. TIF is a **minimally invasive option** for select patients [^115sXEEF] with a small or no hiatal hernia and mild GERD [^111R9p44]. Procedure selection should be **individualized** based on reflux severity, esophageal motility, and patient preference [^114bSNBE] [^112xMC5x].

| **Attribute** | **Nissen** | **Toupet** | **Dor** | **Anterior partial** | **TIF** |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Degree of wrap | 360° | 270° | 180–200° | 90–180° | 270° [^116ninkV] |
| Approach | Posterior [^112G6KnF] | Posterior [^112G6KnF] | Anterior [^113Qq6tT] | Anterior [^112FTJ76] | Endoscopic [^113gweD5] |
| Indications | Severe GERD with normal motility | Weak motility or achalasia [^113iU4uf] | Heller myotomy [^113Qq6tT] | Mild GERD in patients at high dysphagia risk [^116eKU4v] | Mild GERD with a small or no hernia [^111R9p44] |
| Advantages | Excellent reflux control [^1143gjn4] | Lower dysphagia and good reflux control [^116P6DnX] | Lower dysphagia and protection of the myotomy [^113Qq6tT] | Fewer side effects [^116eKU4v] | Minimally invasive and low dysphagia [^113gweD5] |
| Disadvantages | Higher dysphagia and gas-bloat | Slightly higher reflux recurrence [^1143gjn4] | Less effective reflux control [^113Qq6tT] | Less durable reflux control [^114sJuv9] | Limited long-term data [^112oapG8] |

Nissen fundoplication is best for **severe GERD with normal motility**, while **Toupet or Dor** are preferred for weak motility or after Heller myotomy. Anterior partial wraps are suitable for mild GERD in patients at high dysphagia risk [^116eKU4v], and **TIF** is appropriate for select mild cases [^111R9p44].

### Fundoplication significantly improves objective and subjective reflux outcomes-a meta-analysis [^1143gjn4]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

A total of 31 unique studies provided 49 total follow-up observations from 2997 patients, of which 1195 (39.9%; 17 studies) underwent Nissen fundoplication, 971 (32.4%; 4 studies) underwent magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA), 347 (11.6%; 6 studies) underwent transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF), and 204 (6.8%; 4 studies) underwent a Toupet fundoplication. The remaining 9.3% underwent an unspecified laparoscopic fundoplication. The multilevel meta-analysis model fit significantly better than the traditional meta-analysis (−2LL difference = 4.61, p = 0.032).

Significant between-study heterogeneity was observed, with much of the variability at the study level (Tau-squared: 19.51 at level 3 and 3.00 at level 2, Higgins–Thompson I²: 95.9% at level 3 and 2.3% at level 2). Overall, undergoing a GERD procedure provided statistically significant improvement in DeMeester score (mean improvement: 30.65, 95% CI: 23.56 to 37.73, p < 0.001). Although statistically significant improvement was observed for all GERD procedures, Nissen fundoplication averaged greater mean improvement compared to TIF (mean difference: 20.72, 95% CI: 2.89 to 38.55, p = 0.023) and Toupet fundoplication (mean difference: 5.45, 95% CI: 0.97 to 9.92, p = 0.017); no other differences were statistically significant.

Meta-regression indicated that studies including a greater percentage of patients with grade C or D esophagitis were associated with greater improvement.

### Assessing the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic antireflux procedures for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease: A systematic review with network meta-analysis [^116spx5P]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Low credibility.

Despite the extensive literature on laparoscopic antireflux surgery, comparative evidence across different procedures is scarce. The aim of this study was to assess and rank the most efficacious and safe laparoscopic procedures for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

- **Methods**: Medline, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and OpenGrey databases were queried for randomized trials comparing two or more laparoscopic antireflux procedures with each other or with medical treatment for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Pairwise meta-analyses were conducted for each pair of interventions using a random-effects model. Network meta-analysis was employed to assess the relative efficacy and safety of laparoscopic antireflux procedures for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

- **Results**: Forty-four publications reporting 29 randomized trials which included 1,892 patients were identified. The network of treatments was sparse with only a closed loop between different types of wraps: 270°, 360°, anterior 180°, and anterior 90°, and a star network between 360° and other treatments, and between anterior 180° and other treatments. Laparoscopic 270° (odds ratio, OR 1.19, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.64–2.22), anterior 180°, and anterior 90° were equally effective as 360° for control of heartburn, although this finding was supported by low quality of evidence according to the GRADE modification for NMA. The odds for dysphagia were lower after 270° (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24–0.60), anterior 90° (moderate quality evidence), and anterior 180° (low-quality evidence).

### Midterm follow-up evaluation following a novel approach to anterior fundoplication for achalasia [^111fBKd2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare the outcomes for Heller myotomy alone and combined with different partial fundoplications.

- **Methods**: The authors retrospectively reviewed their experience with 69 laparoscopic myotomies and 14 Heller myotomies, 80% of which were performed with partial fundoplication, including 20 Toupet, 18 Dor, and 17 modified Dor procedures. In the modified Dor procedure, the fundoplication is sutured to both sides of the crura and not the myotomy.

- **Results**: The mean age of the study patients was 69 years (range, 15–80 years). Four mucosal perforations were repaired intraoperatively. There was one small bowel fistula in an area of open hernia repair distant from the myotomy. One patient with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died of pneumonia. Phone follow-up evaluation was achieved in 68% of the cases at a mean of 37 months (range, 2–97 months). The results for no dysphagia and for heartburn requiring proton pump inhibitors, respectively, were as follows: Heller myotomy (85.7%, 28.5%), Toupet (66.6%, 33.3%), Dor (83.3%, 20%), and modified Dor (84.6%, 15.3%). Two patients with reflux strictures required annual dilation (Toupet, Dor). Two patients required revisions: one redo Heller myotomy (Dor) and one esophageal replacement (Toupet).

- **Conclusion**: Heller myotomy provides excellent dysphagia relief with or without fundoplication. Heartburn is a significant problem for a minority of patients. In the authors' hands, Toupet had the worst results and modified Dor was most protective for heartburn.

### Long-term efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen versus Toupet fundoplication for the management of types III and IV hiatal hernias [^111oSYDE]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair via Toupet or Nissen fundoplication remains the most commonly performed procedures for the management of large hiatal hernias. However, few studies have compared the procedures' long-term effectiveness. This study sought to characterize the efficacy of laparoscopic Toupet versus Nissen fundoplication for types III and IV hiatal hernias.

- **Methods**: With IRB approval, a review of all laparoscopic hiatal hernia repairs with mesh reinforcement performed over 7 years at a single center by one surgeon was conducted. Hiatal hernias were classified as type III or IV using operative reports and preoperative imaging. Patients with type I, II, or recurrent hiatal hernia and those receiving concomitant procedures were excluded. The GERD-Health Related Quality of Life Survey was administered by telephone no earlier than 18 months postoperatively.

- **Results**: A total of 473 patients underwent laparoscopic fundoplication; 179 had type III or IV hiatal hernia and met inclusion criteria. Of these, 62 underwent Toupet and 117 underwent Nissen fundoplication. The average patient age was 64 years, and 63% of the patients were female. The cohorts were similar in demographics, comorbidities, and intraoperative factors. The survey was completed by 77 patients (43%): 50 having Nissen and 27 Toupet. The median time of survey completion after surgery was 54 months for Nissen and 25 months for Toupet. Median survey responses across all items for both groups were 0 (no symptoms), with no significant variation between groups. Of patients who had Nissen, 26% reported proton-pump inhibitor use versus 31% of those who had Toupet.

### The evolution of TIF: Transoral incisionless fundoplication [^111vL8Bg]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

The spectrum of reflux treatment: The most common and early presentation of reflux disease is heartburn. When symptoms initially present, lifestyle changes, a change in food choices, and weight loss often resolve symptoms. Many times, antacids will resolve the acute condition. If symptoms persist, a 6–8 week trial of H2 antagonists often will heal the underlying esophagitis, and if not, a 6- to 8-week trial of PPI therapy is very effective. Patients that continue to have symptoms beyond a second 6- to 8-week trial may have a different etiology to their reflux, possibly due to anatomic changes. These anatomic defects are amenable to repair using TIF with or without hiatal repair. With easy access to over-the-counter PPI therapy, many patients remain on PPI therapy for several years before seeking alternative treatment. Studies indicate progression of the disease during the prolonged use of PPI therapy. Additionally, an increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has been identified during this period of PPI use.

Based on the studies discussed, TIF 2.0 is a viable alternative to chronic medical therapy in patients who fail to resolve their reflux symptoms after 6 months of medical therapy. This provides ample time to allow for maximal medical care without subjecting patients to the risks associated with prolonged PPI therapy. Early disease without dilation of the hiatus can be treated with the TIF 2.0 technique alone, whereas patients with chronic and late disease often have a hiatal hernia requiring repair. A recent study demonstrates that these patients can be.

### Long-term outcomes following Dor, Toupet, and Nissen fundoplication: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116P6DnX]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

In the surgical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the traditional procedure is laparoscopic total (Nissen) fundoplication. However, partial fundoplication has been advocated as providing similar reflux control while potentially minimizing dysphagia. The comparative outcomes of different approaches to fundoplication are a topic of ongoing debate and long-term outcomes remain uncertain. This study aims to compare long-term GERD-related outcomes following different fundoplication procedures.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and CENTRAL databases were searched up to November 2022 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different types of fundoplications reporting long-term (> 5 years) outcomes. The primary outcome was the incidence of dysphagia. Secondary outcomes included incidence of heartburn/reflux, regurgitation, inability to belch, abdominal bloating, reoperation, and patient satisfaction. DataParty, which uses Python 3.8.10, was used to perform the network meta-analysis. We evaluated the overall certainty of evidence with the GRADE framework.

- **Results**: Thirteen RCTs were included, with 2,063 patients across Nissen (360°), Dor (anterior 180°-200°), and Toupet (posterior 270°) fundoplications. Network estimates demonstrated that Toupet had a lower incidence of dysphagia compared to Nissen (OR 0.285; 95% CrI 0.06–0.958). There were no differences in dysphagia between Toupet and Dor (OR 0.473, 95% CrI 0.072–2.835) or between Dor and Nissen (OR 1.689, 95% CrI 0.403–7.699). The three fundoplication types were comparable in all other outcomes.

### The evolution of TIF: Transoral incisionless fundoplication [^1112JwCh]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Over the same timeline, four different procedures emerged. The initial device was used to perform the endoluminal gastro-gastric fundoplication, called "ELF". This demonstrated the ability of the device to safely manipulate and suture gastric to gastric tissue, but it did not develop a significant clinical application. The second procedure was called TIF 1.0 and was a longitudinally oriented plication of the gastric cardia onto the distal esophagus just proximal to the gastroesophageal junction.

The third procedure was named TIF 2.0 and incorporated a rotational wrap of the cardia and fundus around the circumference of the distal esophagus, in addition to providing a 2–4 cm length of the wrap over the intra-abdominal distal esophagus. This procedure was identified as morphologically and physiologically most similar to the gold standard Nissen fundoplication. During this time period, the expanded use of the device brought the treatment of reflux disease into the realm of possibility. Like the research performed by Belsey to identify the five tenets of reflux surgery, the TIF procedure developed with time to address each of these requirements.

- **Fundoplication requirements**:
	- The fundoplication must bring the fundus over the esophagus and secure it to the esophagus.
	- The fundoplication must be constructed without stricture.
	- The fundoplication is most effective when constructed 2–4 cm in length.
	- The fundoplication must remain below the diaphragm.
	- The diaphragmatic crura must be approximated to the esophagus.

The device improvements and transition from ELF to TIF 1.0 to TIF 2.0 allowed the creation of procedures that adhered more closely to these standards.

### Long-term follow-up of two randomized trials comparing laparoscopic Nissen 360° with anterior 90° partial fundoplication [^116eKU4v]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). High credibility.

The side-effects of Nissen fundoplication have led to modifications, including partial fundoplications such as an anterior 90° wrap. A five-year follow-up of two randomized trials suggested fewer side-effects following anterior 90° partial fundoplication, but better reflux control after Nissen fundoplication. However, longer-term outcomes have not been reported. This study combined data from previous trials to determine 10-year outcomes.

- **Methods**: From 1999 to 2003, 191 patients were enrolled in two randomized trials comparing anterior 90° partial versus Nissen fundoplication. Trial protocols were similar, and data were combined to determine long-term clinical outcomes. Patients completed annual questionnaires assessing dysphagia, heartburn, medications, satisfaction, and other symptoms. Visual analogue scales (0–10), a composite dysphagia score (0–45), and yes/no responses were used.

- **Results**: Of the 191 patients, 152 (79.6 per cent) were available for 10-year follow-up. After anterior 90° fundoplication, patients reported less dysphagia to solids (score 2.03 versus 3.18 for the Nissen procedure; P = 0.037). Heartburn scores were lower after Nissen fundoplication (1.90 versus 2.83 for anterior 90° fundoplication; P = 0.035) and fewer patients required proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (22 versus 39 per cent respectively; P = 0.035). Satisfaction scores were similar for both anterior 90° and Nissen groups (7.45 versus 7.36 respectively; P = 0.566), and the majority considered their original decision for surgery to be correct (86 versus 84 per cent; P = 0.818).

### Endoscopic GERD therapy: A primer for the transoral incisionless fundoplication procedure [^113gweD5]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with medically refractory GERD have the option of surgery but may opt for effective minimally invasive interventions when available. However, the primary GERD pharmacologic therapy, proton pump inhibitors, does not satisfactorily address the pathophysiology of the disease. Moreover, a therapeutic gap exists in those severely symptomatic patients who fail medical management and are poor candidates for surgical fundoplication. Recently, a revival of minimally invasive endoscopic interventions aiming to correct the antireflux barrier has followed existing device modifications, enhancing their safety and efficacy profile.

Of these technologies, the transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) technique, in its current 2.0 iteration, has been studied in several randomized controlled trials with favorable outcomes and a low rate of adverse events. In this review, we discuss the landscape of endoscopic GERD therapy, focusing on recent updates in the TIF 2.0 procedure with the EsophyX-Z device (EndoGastric Solutions, Redmond, Wash, USA). We discuss the evolution, differences, and improvements in this technique across different generations of the EsophyX device. We also present a framework for candidate selection, based on medical and anatomic considerations. When streamlined within a milieu of comprehensive multidisciplinary programs, these improved endoscopic interventions can provide viable avenues for a carefully selected patient population, bridging therapy gaps and selectively targeting the primary pathophysiology of the disease.

### Efficacy of an anterior as compared with a posterior laparoscopic partial fundoplication: results of a randomized, controlled clinical trial [^112FTJ76]. Annals of Surgery (2003). High credibility.

The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy and mechanical consequences of two partial fundoplications performed laparoscopically under the framework of a randomized, controlled clinical trial.

Although laparoscopic total fundoplication procedures have proven their effectiveness in the control of gastroesophageal reflux, problems remain with the functional consequences following a supra-competent gastric cardia high-pressure zone. Partial fundoplications have been found to be associated with fewer mechanical side effects.

During a two-year period, 95 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease were enrolled into a randomized, controlled single-institution clinical trial comparing a partial posterior (Toupét, n = 48) fundoplication and an anterior partial wrap (Watson, n = 47). All patients were assessed postoperatively at predefined time points, and the 12-month follow-up data are presented in terms of clinical results and 24-hour pH monitoring variables.

Both patient groups were strictly comparable at the time of randomization. All operations were completed laparoscopically, and no serious complications were encountered. During the first postoperative year, a difference regarding the control of reflux symptoms was observed in favor of the posterior fundoplication. Esophageal acid exposure (% time pH < 4) was substantially reduced by both operations but to a significantly lower level following a Toupét compared with the Watson partial fundoplication (1.0 ± 0.3 vs. 5.6 ± 1.1 mean ± SEM; p < 0.001).

### Unwrapping the problems: Endoscopic repair of fundoplication fistula [^115KL5YX]. Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

Fundoplication is the recommended surgical management for gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, common postoperative complications, such as dysphagia in up to 46%, and rare complications, such as esophagogastric fistula (EGF), can develop. Surgical revision is needed in approximately 11% of those undergoing fundoplication. We present a case of endoscopic management of EGF in the setting of prior fundoplication.

A 38-year-old patient with a history of Nissen fundoplication with subsequent takedown with myotomy and partial fundoplication experienced multiple food impactions requiring 38 endoscopies in the past four years. Prior endoscopy was notable for an EGF at the gastroesophageal junction, with the distal orifice in the area of the fundus. This fistula was leading to repeated food impactions that required endoscopic removal. Given the frequency of endoscopic interventions, the patient agreed to pursue endoscopic dissection of the plicated tissue forming the EGF and gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) to manage gastroparesis.

The shelf of the EGF formed from the plicated tissue was dissected with a hybrid knife (Video 1). The fistula was completely obliterated after complete dissection. G-POEM was also performed successfully and was uneventful. An overall improvement in symptoms was noted following the procedure, and reflux disease was controlled on medication.

EGF is a rare complication of fundoplication and can cause a myriad of symptoms depending on the size and location of the fistulous tract. There are case reports on EGF, but the literature is limited.

### Endoscopic plication compared to laparoscopic fundoplication in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115wNfaH]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

Endoscopic plication offers an alternative to surgical fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate outcomes following endoscopic plication compared to laparoscopic fundoplication.

- **Methods and procedures**: A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted in September 2022. The study followed PRISMA guidelines. Studies comparing endoscopic plication to laparoscopic fundoplication with n > 5 were included. The primary outcome was PPI cessation, with secondary outcomes including complications, procedure duration, length of stay, change in lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone, and DeMeester score.

- **Results**: We reviewed 1544 studies, with five included comparing 105 (46.1%) patients receiving endoscopic plication (ENDO) to 123 (53.9%) undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication (LAP). The average patient age was 47.6 years, with those undergoing plication being younger (46.4 ENDO vs. 48.5 LAP). BMI (26.6 kg/m² ENDO vs. 26.2 kg/m² LAP) and the proportion of females (42.9% ENDO vs. 37.4% LAP) were similar. Patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures had worse baseline LES pressure (12.8 mmHg ENDO vs. 9.0 mmHg LAP) and lower preoperative DeMeester scores (34.6 ENDO vs. 34.1 LAP). The primary outcome demonstrated that 89.2% of patients undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication discontinued PPI compared to 69.4% for those receiving plication. The meta-analysis revealed that plication had significantly reduced odds of PPI discontinuation (OR 0.27, studies = 3, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.64, P = 0.003, I² = 0%).

### Influence of wrap length on the effectiveness of Nissen and Toupet fundoplications: 5-year results of prospective, randomized study [^113EsdqQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Long-term results in antireflux surgery may depend on fundoplication type and wrap length. This study compared the outcome of two different wrap lengths among patients undergoing partial or total fundoplications and is part of a 5-year follow-up assessment.

- **Methods**: A total of 153 patients were randomized to undergo either Nissen or Toupet fundoplication with 1.5- or 3-cm wraps. The primary endpoint, treatment failure rate, was defined as recurrence of GERD or persistent dysphagia. Secondary outcomes, such as the intensity of heartburn, dysphagia, gas-bloating, and the presence of esophagitis, were assessed at 1-year and 5-year follow-ups.

- **Results**: At 5-year follow-up, data were collected from 129 (85%) patients. At 1-year follow-up, 17 (11%) treatment failures were detected. By the end of the fifth year, the number of failures reached 23 (15%), being more common in the 1.5-cm Toupet (25%) and the 3-cm Nissen group (18.2%). A significant difference in failure rates was found between the 1.5-cm and 3-cm Toupet groups (P < 0.05). Dysphagia remained low during the follow-up in all groups. Higher heartburn scores after 5 years were detected in the Nissen 1.5-cm group (20.8%), while the lowest scores were observed in the Toupet 3-cm group. Bloating symptoms were more prevalent among both Nissen and Toupet 3-cm group patients at 5-year follow-up. By the end of the fifth year, the prevalence of esophagitis was lower in the Nissen 1.5-cm (19.3%) and Toupet 3-cm (13.3%) groups. The highest prevalence of esophagitis, 32.4%, was found in the Toupet 1.5-cm group.

### Interventional anti-reflux management for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in lung transplant recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115oW2gP]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

There were seven studies in which the Nissen fundoplication was the preferred surgical method. These included 205 patients, of which 197 underwent a Nissen fundoplication. In comparison, there were five studies which included 307 patients, of which 297 underwent a Toupet fundoplication.

- **Comparison of fundoplication techniques**: Pooled analysis revealed a similar increase in FEV1 in those that underwent a Nissen fundoplication in comparison to the single study that reported on FEV1 changes in which patients underwent a Toupet's fundoplication (0.125 L/s [95% CI; −0.016, 0.306] vs. 0.09 L/s [95% CI; −0.262, 0.442]) (I² = 0.0%) (Fig. 8).

Changes in %FEV1 were also comparable in those that underwent a Nissen to those who underwent a Toupet fundoplication (−0.003% [95% CI −0.042, 0.035] vs. −0.001% [95% CI −0.045, 0.043], respectively [I² = 10.9%, 11.9%]) (Fig. 9 A, B). Contrastingly, those who underwent a Nissen fundoplication had a greater decrease in the rate of change of FEV1 of −2.353 mL/d [95% CI; −3.058, −1.649], compared to 0.056 mL/d [95% CI; −0.068, 0.180] in those who underwent a Toupet fundoplication (I² = 37.4%, 21.9%, respectively) (Fig. 10 A, B).

### Transoral incisionless fundoplication: Current status [^115sXEEF]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Thus, based on the critical analysis of recent data, ideal candidates for the TIF procedure are chronic GERD patients with partial but inadequate symptom control on high-dose PPI therapy who have only mild to moderate deterioration of the GEJ (absent or small hiatal hernia ≤ 2 cm, Hill grade I or II), and effective esophageal motility.

### Comparison of laparoscopic 270° posterior partial fundoplication vs total fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease: A randomized clinical trial [^114bSNBE]. JAMA Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Restoration of the esophagogastric junction competence is critical for effective long-term treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Surgical repair results in such restoration, but mechanical adverse effects seem unavoidable. Minimizing these adverse effects without jeopardizing reflux control is warranted.

The objective of this study was to determine whether partial fundoplication (PF) or total fundoplication (TF) is superior in laparoscopic antireflux surgery.

In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial of 1171 patients scheduled for laparoscopic antireflux surgery at a single university-affiliated center between November 19, 2001, and January 24, 2006, 456 patients were randomized and followed up for 5 years. Data were collected from November 2001 to April 2012, and data were analyzed from April 2012 to September 2018.

- **Interventions**: A 270° posterior PF or a 360° Nissen TF.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Esophageal acid exposure at 3 years after surgery.

Of the 456 randomized patients, 268 (58.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 49.0 (11.7) years. A total of 229 patients were randomized to PF, and 227 patients were randomized to TF. At 3 years postoperatively, the median (interquartile range) esophageal acid exposure was reduced from 14.6% (9.8–21.9) to 1.8% (0.7–4.4) after PF and from 16.0% (10.4–22.7) to 2.5% (0.8–6.8) after TF (P = 0.31). Likewise, reflux symptoms were equally and effectively controlled. Early postoperative dysphagia (6 weeks) was common in both groups but then decreased toward normality.

### Fundoplication significantly improves objective and subjective reflux outcomes-a meta-analysis [^116FYiMh]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed in accordance with the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA 2020). The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate longitudinal follow-up of objective and subjective symptom relief following surgery for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Our study is unique in that we included all repeated follow-up measurements.

- **Study eligibility**: We considered only randomized controlled trials or cohort designs that included adult patients diagnosed with GERD (or GORD) who underwent a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (complete or total fundoplication), Toupet fundoplication (partial fundoplication, 270°), magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA, LINX Reflux Management System), or transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF 1.0, TIF 2.0) for GERD. Outcomes included pre-to-post-operative changes in acid exposure time (AET; percent of time with pH < 4), DeMeester score, or subjective symptom relief score as measured by the GERD-HRQL, GIQLI, QOLRAD, or VAS. As such, patients served as their own control. We excluded studies in which the patients had comorbid achalasia, reoperation for GERD, underwent a concomitant weight loss procedure, or esophagectomy.

- **Search strategy**: Two authors (YT, DN) systematically searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases from inception through November 22, 2023. The search strategy was developed with the assistance of a research librarian at our institution.

### Total or posterior partial fundoplication in the treatment of GERD: Results of a randomized trial after 2 decades of follow-up [^112ZJDft]. Annals of Surgery (2011). High credibility.

Objective and Background: We lack long-term data (> 10 years) on the efficacy of antireflux surgery when evaluated within the framework of randomized clinical trials. Hereby, we report the outcome of a randomized trial comparing open total (I) and Toupet posterior partial fundoplication (II) performed between 1983 and 1991.

Methods: One hundred and thirty-seven patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease were enrolled in the study. The mean follow-up has now reached 18 years. During these years, 26% had died, and 16% were unable to be traced for follow-up. Symptom outcomes were assessed using validated self-reporting questionnaires.

Results: Long-term control of heartburn and acid regurgitation (reported as no or mild symptoms) were reported by 80% and 82% following a total fundoplication (I), and corresponding figures were 87% and 90% following a partial posterior fundoplication (II), respectively (not significant). The dysphagia scores were low: 4.6 ± 1.3 (SEM) in group I and 3.3 ± 0.9 (SEM) in group II (not significant). The point prevalences of rectal flatulence and gas distension-related complaints were of similar magnitude in the two groups. Twenty-three percent of the patients in the total fundoplication group noted some ability to vomit compared with 31% in the partial posterior fundoplication group.

Conclusions: Both a total and a partial posterior fundoplication maintain a high level of reflux control after 2 decades of follow-up. The previously reported differences in mechanical side effects, in favor of the partial wrap, seemed to disappear over time.

### Patterns of reoperation after failed fundoplication: An analysis of 9462 patients [^113hLXvx]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Little is known about the choice of reoperation after failed fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Both redo fundoplication and conversion procedures to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are safe and effective. We aimed to characterize the rates of different revisional procedures and to identify risk factors associated with failed fundoplication.

- **Methods**: Using a statewide database, we examined records for patients who underwent fundoplication between 2000 and 2010. The primary outcomes were the rate of each type of reoperation and the pattern of subsequent procedures. Demographics and comorbidities were used in a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors associated with reoperation after fundoplication.

- **Results**: A total of 9462 patients were included. Overall, 430 (4.5%) patients underwent reoperation. Of those, 46 (10.7%) patients underwent RYGB at first reoperation, with the remainder having a redo fundoplication. An additional five patients were converted to RYGB after undergoing a redo fundoplication (51 total patients converted to RYGB at any point, 11.9%). Eighty-three percent of patients converted to RYGB were obese, as opposed to 8% for redo fundoplication. A single redo fundoplication was done in 81% of patients, while 35 patients (8.1%) underwent two or more revisional procedures. On average, any reoperation was performed 2.9 years after fundoplication, with redo fundoplication occurring 2.5 years and RYGB 6.5 years later. Age 30–49 years (vs. > 70 years; OR 2.01, p = 0.011) and 50–69 years (vs. > 70 years; OR 1.61, p = 0.011).

The analysis underscores the importance of understanding patient demographics and comorbidities in determining the likelihood and type of reoperation after failed fundoplication.

### Laparoscopic Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication with routine use of intraoperative endoscopy and manometry: Technical aspects of a standardized technique [^114SYqLW]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Several different ways of fashioning a total fundoplication lead to different outcomes. This article addresses the technical details of the antireflux technique we adopted without modifications for all patients with GERD beginning in 1972. In particular, it aims to discuss the relation between the mechanism of function of the wrap and the physiology of the esophagus.

- **Methods**: The study population consisted of 380 patients affected by GERD with a 1-year minimum of follow-up who underwent laparoscopic Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication by a single surgeon.

- **Results**: No conversion to open surgery and no mortality occurred. Major complications occurred in 4 patients (1.1%). Follow-up (median 83 months; range: 1–13 years) was achieved in 96% of the patients. Ninety-two percent of the patients were satisfied with the results of the procedure and would undergo the same operation again. Postoperative dysphagia occurred in 3.5% of the patients, and heartburn was observed in 3.8%.

- **Conclusions**: Laparoscopic Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication with the routine use of intraoperative manometry and endoscopy achieved good outcomes and long-term patient satisfaction with few complications and side effects. Appropriate preoperative investigation and a correct surgical technique are important in securing these results.

### Minimal access surgery compared with medical management for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: five year follow-up of a randomised controlled trial (REFLUX) [^115b5xhQ]. BMJ (2013). High credibility.

Unanswered questions and future research

Patients and doctors making decisions about laparoscopic fundoplication would benefit from clearer evidence regarding the risks of long-term morbidity and its associations with surgical technique. Individuals with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) are usually managed in primary care, and it is currently unclear how many might seek fundoplication in light of the findings of this and other trials.

### A proposed classification for uniform endoscopic description of surgical fundoplication [^1133fYat]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective assessment of postfundoplication anatomy is of utmost importance, especially if reoperative intervention is being planned. There is a lack of uniformity in the description of endoscopic findings in these patients. The purpose of this study was to propose a classification for standardized endoscopic reporting of postfundoplication anatomy.

- **Methods**: After institutional review board approval, preoperative endoscopic findings of patients who underwent reoperative intervention from 1992 to 2011 were reviewed and classified. The classification included four factors: E (distance of GEJ to crus), S (amount of gastric tissue between the GEJ and fundoplication), F (fundoplication configuration), and P (paraesophageal hernia).

- **Results**: The endoscopic findings of 310 patients who underwent reoperative antireflux surgery were classified using the newly proposed classification model. A significant increase in the number of procedures was noted over the years. There was no change in presenting symptoms and patterns of failure over the years. The classification model was easily applicable to previous endoscopy reports. There was good symptom association with our classification model.

- **Discussion**: An endoscopic anatomical classification is proposed for the description of failed fundoplication. With this classification, we hope to fill the gap in developing a uniform classification of failed fundoplications. Further studies addressing widespread applicability and outcome analysis are needed.

### Transoral incisionless fundoplication: Current status [^112oapG8]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The quality of high-level clinical evidence found in the recent literature supports the efficacy, safety, and durability of the TIF procedure performed with the EsophyX device and justifies its use as a therapeutic option for well-selected patients with chronic GERD. The value of TIF has been demonstrated in select cases where PPIs fail to achieve complete symptomatic control. Ongoing studies focusing on the durability of TIF and comparing it to established treatments, such as laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, are likely to further solidify its position in the armamentarium of antireflux therapies.

### Measuring outcomes of laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery: Quality of life versus symptom scores [^114r7Xva]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The outcome following fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux can be measured using objective tests, symptom scores, and quality of life (QoL) measures. The best method and how these assessments correlate remain uncertain. To determine the utility of assessment measures, we compared a general QoL measure (SF-36) and a disease-specific measure (GERD-hr-QoL) with symptom and satisfaction scores in individuals following fundoplication.

- **Methods**: 329 individuals underwent fundoplication between 2000 and 2015 in two centers in Australia and the Netherlands. Patients were assessed before and 3, 12, and 24 months after surgery using 10-point Likert scales to assess heartburn and satisfaction, the SF-36 questionnaire, and the GERD-hr-QoL questionnaire. SF-36 scores were converted into component scores: Physical Component Scale (PCS) score and Mental Component Scale (MCS) score. Correlations between QoL measures and clinical outcomes were determined.

- **Results**: Surgery relieved heartburn (7.0 vs. 0.0 median, P < 0.001) and patients were highly satisfied with the outcome (median 9.0). PCS and MCS scores improved after surgery (PCS 40.9 vs. 46.0, P < 0.001; MCS 47.6 vs. 50.3, P = 0.027). GERD-hr-QoL scores also improved after surgery (15.7 vs. 3.7, P < 0.001). Correlations between PCS and MCS scores versus heartburn and satisfaction scores were generally weak or absent. However, correlations between GERD-hr-QoL versus heartburn and satisfaction scores were moderate to strong.

- **Conclusion**: Despite improvements in scores, the SF-36 correlated poorly with clinical outcome measures.

### Twenty years of laparoscopic fundoplication for GERD [^116vUDSz]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The first laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was performed 20 years ago. Surgical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) should be offered only to appropriately studied and selected patients, with the ultimate aim of improving the well-being of the individual and their quality of life. The choice of fundoplication should be dictated by the surgeon's preference and experience.

### Esophagogastric junction distensibility is greater following Toupet compared to Nissen fundoplication [^116tfhJX]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

The goal of antireflux surgery is to create a competent antireflux valve at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ). The two most common types of fundoplications are the 360° Nissen and the 270° Toupet. We sought to determine whether there was a significant difference in distensibility at the EGJ based on fundoplication geometry (full vs. partial).

This study is a retrospective review of prospective data. All subjects underwent laparoscopic fundoplication over a 47-month period for primary GERD or failed fundoplication. An endoluminal functional luminal-imaging probe (EndoFLIP®) was used to assess EGJ distensibility intraoperatively. Minimum esophageal diameter (D min), cross-sectional area (CSA), and distensibility index (DI) were measured at 30- and 40-mL balloon distension volumes prior to abdominal insufflation, after hiatal dissection, and following fundoplication. DI is defined as the narrowest CSA divided by the corresponding pressure expressed in mm²/mmHg. Analysis compared distensibility metrics based on the type of fundoplication (Nissen or Toupet). A secondary outcome was the difference in distensibility of the EGJ prior to surgery in patients with primary GERD compared to those with reGERD following a failed fundoplication.

A total of 75 patients underwent fundoplications during the study interval: 44 primary and 31 reoperative fundoplications. Nissen fundoplication was constructed in 45 and Toupet in 30 patients. Based on the distensibility index, the findings suggest that esophagogastric junction distensibility is greater following Toupet compared to Nissen fundoplication.

### Transoral incisionless fundoplication: current status [^113hCTrs]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Consistently, across all studies, low complication rates for TIF have been reported. A 2013 systematic review of the published TIF literature found that the major complication rate was 3.2%, which is comparable with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. In a database from the manufacturer of the EsophyX device, serious adverse events occurred in 0.41% of more than 17,000 TIF patients at the time of writing, and there have been no reported mortalities following the procedure. In the RESPECT study, with the exception of brief postoperative epigastric pain, complications and adverse effects were no different between TIF/placebo and sham/PPI groups. Authors of the TEMPO trial attribute the absence of any serious adverse events in their study to the experience of the investigators, each having performed more than 20 TIF procedures before study initiation.

Although improvements in the device and technique over the last few years have made the procedure more operator-friendly, rigorous, standardized training and a strict educational curriculum for any new user is critical to preserving the safety profile of the TIF.

- **Safety and side-effects**: In addition to a strong safety profile, the very low incidence of new dysphagia, gas bloat, and excessive flatulence is perhaps one of the most attractive features of the TIF procedure. Postfundoplication syndromes were found to be very low.

### Laparoscopic fundoplication surgery versus medical management for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in adults [^117EUZu6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common condition affecting 3% to 33% of individuals worldwide. There is considerable uncertainty about whether individuals with GORD should undergo surgery or receive medical treatment to control the condition.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of laparoscopic fundoplication versus medical treatment for individuals with GORD.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group (UGPD) Trials Register (June 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 6, 2015), Ovid MEDLINE (1966 to June 2015), and EMBASE (1980 to June 2015) to identify randomised controlled trials. References of included trials were also reviewed for further relevant studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We only considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing laparoscopic fundoplication with medical treatment in individuals with GORD, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, for inclusion in the review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently identified trials and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models with RevMan 5, based on available case analysis.

- **Main results**: Four studies met the inclusion criteria for the review, providing information on one or more outcomes. A total of 1,160 participants were included in these studies.

### Nissen versus Toupet fundoplication: Results of a randomized and multicenter trial [^114CUM31]. Surgical Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication (TF) is reported to be as effective as Nissen fundoplication (NF), but is associated with fewer unfavorable postoperative side effects. This study evaluates the one- and three-year clinical outcomes of 140 randomized patients following a laparoscopic NF or TF.

- **Patients and methods**: Inclusion criteria included patients over 16 years old with complications of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and persistence or recurrence of symptoms after three months of treatment. Subjects with a previous history of gastric surgery, repeated fundoplication, brachy-oesophagus, or severe abnormal manometry results were excluded. Seventy-seven NF and 63 TF were performed. The severity of symptoms was assessed before and after the procedure.

- **Results**: One hundred and twenty-one of the 140 patients after one year, and 118 after three years, were evaluated, and no statistically significant clinical difference was observed. The level of satisfaction concerning the outcome of the operation remained high after one or three years regardless of the type of fundoplication performed.

- **Conclusions**: Functional complications after NF are not avoided with TF.

### Training for laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with a newly designed model: A replacement for animal tissue models [^116CapDD]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

To bridge the early learning curve for laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication from the clinical setting to a safe environment, training models can be used. This study aimed to develop a reusable, low-cost model for training in the laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication procedure as an alternative to the use of animal tissue models.

- **Methods**: From artificial organs and tissue, an anatomic model of the human upper abdomen was developed for training in performing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. The 20 participants and tutors in the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) upper gastrointestinal surgery course completed four complementary tasks of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with the artificial model. They then compared the realism, haptic feedback, and training properties of the model with those of animal tissue models.

- **Results**: The main difference between the two training models was observed in the properties of the stomach. The wrapping of the stomach in the artificial model was rated significantly lower than in the animal tissue model (mean, 3.6 vs. 4.2; p = 0.010). The main criticism of the stomach of the artificial model was that it was too rigid for making a proper wrap. However, the suturing of the stomach wall was regarded as fairly realistic (mean, 3.6). The crura on the artificial model were rated better (mean, 4.3) than those on the animal tissue (mean, 4.0), although the difference was not significant. The participants regarded the model as a good to excellent (mean, 4.3) training tool.

The newly developed model is regarded…

### Five-year clinical outcomes of RefluxStop surgery in the treatment of acid reflux: a prospective multicenter trial of safety and effectiveness [^111VGGqN]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Out of the available fundoplication techniques, Nissen fundoplication was used for comparison since it is considered the gold standard (i.e. standard of care) as per several clinical practice guidelines, such as the 2022 American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) recommendations. RCTs and one systematic literature review with meta-analysis comparing Nissen and Toupet fundoplication indicated that although there are some differences in postoperative dysphagia during short-term follow-up, outcomes seem to approximate after 1 year with no statistically significant difference in the long-term.

For instance, the randomized study by Qin et al. with 383 cases followed for 5.6 years concluded that no symptom recurrence occurred following Nissen fundoplication, whereas 18 patients experienced symptom recurrence following Toupet fundoplication. Furthermore, the cure rate of esophagitis was superior in the Nissen group (88.4%) compared to the Toupet group (67.7%), and the incidence of dysphagia between groups was comparable at 1-year postoperatively (i.e. 1.5% and 0.8%, respectively), supporting Nissen fundoplication's position as the standard of care.

An appropriate methodology for establishing de facto treatment effect involves the validation of patient-reported outcomes with objective testing. This study reports the first data of long-term (≥ 5 years) clinical outcomes using the novel RefluxStop procedure in the treatment of chronic GERD. Our report correlates subjective and objective outcomes for a comprehensive understanding of the long-term safety and effectiveness of RefluxStop surgery.

### Analysis of the causes of failed antireflux surgery and the principles of treatment: A review [^112xMC5x]. JAMA Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Although the diagnostic evaluation and technical elements for a successful laparoscopic fundoplication have been clearly identified, 10% to 20% of patients will eventually experience recurrence of their symptoms. The management of patients who fail antireflux surgery is complex and not well codified.

To provide an evidence- and experience-based analysis of the causes of failed antireflux surgery and to underscore the principles of treatment, a review was conducted. PubMed was searched for articles published between 1980 and 2014. The search terms included heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, cough, aspiration, laryngitis, GERD, GORD, endoscopy, manometry, pH monitoring, proton pump inhibitors, and Nissen fundoplication.

Before planning therapy, a careful workup is necessary to determine whether the symptoms are due to re-reflux and to understand what caused the recurrence. Subsequently, therapy needs to be individualized based on the symptoms and on the findings of the workup. In some patients, a non-esophageal cause will be identified. Among patients with re-reflux, some will do well with acid-reducing medications, and others will need another operation.

Laparoscopic antireflux surgery is a very effective and long-lasting treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Its success is based on a careful preoperative evaluation and on the performance of a fundoplication that respects the key technical elements.

### Recurrence after laparoscopic and open Nissen fundoplication: A comparison of the mechanisms of failure [^1164zQKf]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication as treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in adults has a reported recurrence rate of 2–17%. We investigated the rates and mechanisms of failure after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in children.

- **Methods**: All patients who underwent a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for GERD and who subsequently required a redo Nissen were reviewed (n = 15). The control group consisted of the most recent 15 patients who developed recurrent GERD after an open Nissen fundoplication.

- **Results**: Between 1994 and 2000, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was performed in 179 patients. Fifteen patients (8.7%) underwent revision. The mechanisms of failure were herniation in four patients, wrap dehiscence in four, a too-short wrap in three, a loosened wrap in two, and other reasons in two. The reoperation was performed laparoscopically in five patients (33%). The failure mechanisms were different in the open patients: eight were due to slipped wraps, three to dehiscences, and two to herniations.

- **Conclusion**: The failure rate after laparoscopic Nissen is acceptably low. A redo laparoscopic Nissen can be performed safely after an initial laparoscopic approach.

### Excellent quality of life after Nissen fundoplication depends on successful elimination of reflux symptoms and not the invasiveness of the surgical approach [^112uR6pJ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Quality of life, which is often poor in patients with reflux disease, improves significantly after an antireflux operation. The aim of this study was to determine the relative importance of the operative approach used for a fundoplication, as well as the successful elimination of reflux symptoms on the long-term quality of life in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.

- **Methods**: A questionnaire, including the Medical Outcome Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), was completed by 105 patients who had undergone either a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (n = 72) or a transthoracic Nissen fundoplication (n = 33). The median follow-up was 25 and 31 months, respectively. Patients were classified as completely or incompletely relieved of reflux symptoms based on the frequency of reflux symptoms and the use of acid-suppression medication.

- **Results**: Patients selected for transthoracic Nissen fundoplication had significantly worse preoperative gastroesophageal reflux disease, based on the presence of a large hiatal hernia, Barrett's esophagus, or stricture. Long-term quality of life was similar for the two approaches, but was significantly decreased in patients with recurrent reflux symptoms. Compared with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication patients, transthoracic Nissen fundoplication patients were less likely to use acid-suppression medication and tended to be more satisfied with their operation.

- **Conclusions**: Long-term quality of life was independent of the invasiveness of the procedure but significantly dependent on the successful elimination of reflux symptoms and the necessity for intervention to manage symptoms effectively.

### Fundoplication significantly improves objective and subjective reflux outcomes-a meta-analysis [^111hBmLm]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) impacts 10–30% of the population in the Western world. Surgical interventions, including laparoscopic fundoplication (LF), transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF), and magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA), have proven effective in managing GERD. This meta-analysis aims to compare short- and long-term outcomes of these surgical options.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Medline from 1980 to 2024 was conducted to identify randomized control trials or cohort designs that included adults with GERD who underwent fundoplication (Nissen, Toupet), MSA, or TIF and had preoperative and post-operative acid exposure time (AET), DeMeester score, and/or relief score (e.g. GERD-HRQL). We considered all post-operative outcome measurements. We excluded studies with any surgical variations of the procedures, reoperations, and studies not published in English. Risk of bias was assessed using the Oxford scoring system for randomized control trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for cohort designs. A total of 3912 studies were identified initially, with our review including 78 unique studies providing 166 post-operative outcome measurements. Given studies could include multiple post-operative outcome measurements, we used multilevel random-effects meta-analysis. Between-procedure comparisons were made using multilevel meta-regression. For all outcomes, more positive values indicated greater improvement; mean differences (MD) were estimated for AET and DeMeester scores, whereas standardized mean differences were calculated when necessary.

### Antireflux surgery in patients with moderate obesity - Fundoplication or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^116ixVhJ]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), characterized by the reflux of stomach contents, which includes primarily acid or bile reflux and less commonly volume reflux, into the esophagus, significantly impairs quality of life. It can lead to complications such as aspiration, esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Obesity exacerbates the pathophysiological mechanisms of GERD by increasing intra-abdominal pressure, making its management in patients with obesity particularly challenging.

Surgical interventions, specifically fundoplication and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), have been recognized as effective treatments for patients with GERD refractory to medical management. Fundoplication, which enhances the barrier to reflux by wrapping the upper stomach around the lower esophagus, has been widely used with satisfactory outcomes. RYGB, on the other hand, not only aids in significant and sustained weight loss but also alters gastric anatomy and physiology, potentially providing superior control of GERD symptoms in patients with obesity. By creating a small gastric pouch and disconnecting the bile inflow from the stomach, less stomach acid is produced, bile reflux is prevented, and the intragastric pressure is reduced due to the exclusion of the gastric pylorus.

Only a few studies have focused on the comparison between fundoplication and RYGB in patients with World Health Organization (WHO) class III obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²), but it has been shown that RYGB leads to less in-hospital morbidity, more weight loss, and better control.

### Strategies for surgical remediation of the multi-fundoplication failure patient [^111xtqMJ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Outcomes are not well studied in patients undergoing remediation for multi-fundoplication failure, which refers to two or more prior failed fundoplications. Re-operation must balance reflux control and restoration of the ability to eat with the challenge of reconstructing a distorted hiatus and gastroesophageal (GE) junction. The purpose of this study is to present our experience with surgical remediation for multi-fundoplication failure.

- **Methods**: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for 91 patients who underwent a third or more esophagogastric operation for fundoplication failure at a single institution from 2007 to 2016. Dysphagia was present in 56%, and heartburn in 51% of the cases. The median number of prior operations was 2, with a range up to 6. Anatomic failure included slipped wrap in 26 cases, wrap herniation in 23, hiatal stenosis in 24, hiatal mesh complication in 8, and wrap dehiscence in 10. Operative approaches generally followed an institutional algorithm and consisted of hiatal hernia repair with: re-do fundoplication in 55%, takedown of fundoplication alone in 24%, Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy in 14%, and GE junction resection in 7%. A laparoscopic approach was successful in 81% of the cases.

- **Results**: Mean duration of operations was 217 minutes, and the median length of stay was 3 days. The complication rate was 13%, with 7% undergoing unplanned early re-operation. Patients were followed for a mean of 11 months, and recurrence of hiatal hernia was detected in 13%. Late re-operation was performed in 6% for recurrent hiatal hernia. Reflux symptomatology resolved in 93% of patients, and dysphagia resolved in 84%.

### Fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux and factors associated with the outcome 6 to 10 years after the operation: multivariate analysis of prognostic factors using the propensity score [^114eeyqa]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

The impact of the mode of operation (partial vs. total fundoplication) on long-term outcomes after fundoplication remains unknown, although short-term randomized studies have not shown significant differences in the efficacy of reflux control. To gain insight into long-term results, data from a nonrandomized cohort were analyzed using propensity score statistics.

- **Methods**: For 134 patients who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the time until recurrence of reflux symptoms was assessed. The impact of putative prognostic factors and the mode of operation (partial vs. total fundoplication) on outcomes was tested for significance using univariate and multivariate statistics, including the propensity score, to correct for nonrandomized treatment groups. The follow-up period was 60 to 123 months (median, 93 months). In this study, 45 patients had a partial (Toupet) fundoplication, and 89 patients underwent a total (Nissen) fundoplication.

- **Results**: The rate of recurrence after 93 months (the median follow-up interval) was 14% after Nissen and 9% after Toupet fundoplication, a nonsignificant difference, as estimated according to Kaplan and Meier. Massive acid exposure to the esophagus was associated with an increased risk of recurrence for 23% of the patients with a DeMeester score of 50 or higher, but only for 9% of the patients with less severe reflux (DeMeester score < 50; p < 0.05). Multiple proportional hazard regression using the propensity score did not show additional significance for the variables.

### Transoral incisionless fundoplication: Current status [^116Cu8et]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The first transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) procedure using the EsophyX device was performed in 2005. Since then, more than 17,000 procedures have been completed. The initial European experience and publications focused on the early iterations of this procedure (endoluminal fundoplication and TIF 1.0) and led to the 2007 Food and Drug Administration clearance of the EsophyX device in the United States.

During those early years on the US market, struggling to define its precise role in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients, the TIF procedure was met with a lack of enthusiasm from leading gastroenterological and surgical societies. This may be explained by the unfair comparison of TIF to the first generation of GERD endoluminal therapies (e.g. EndoCinch, Enteryx, Gatekeeper, and Endoscopic Plicator System, NDO Surgical, INC, Mansfield, Massachusetts, USA), which, with the exception of the Stretta procedure, are no longer available because of safety concerns or lack of effectiveness. Further, the absence of long-term data and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) at that time resulted in inconsistent coverage by third-party payers and limited adoption of TIF by physicians.

More recently, however, the TIF procedure performed with the EsophyX device has emerged as a viable alternative in the management of GERD patients with hiatal hernias 2 cm or less. In 2015, the publication of well-designed, multicenter RCTs confirmed its effectiveness and demonstrated its superiority over proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) in selected patients.

### Fundoplication significantly improves objective and subjective reflux outcomes-a meta-analysis [^116iFhDg]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

A total of 26 unique studies provided 34 follow-up observations from 2574 patients. Of these, 924 patients (35.9%; 11 studies) underwent a Nissen fundoplication, 915 patients (35.5%; 4 studies) underwent an MSA, 485 patients (18.8%; 9 studies) underwent a TIF, and 50 patients (1.9%; 1 study) underwent a Toupet fundoplication. The remaining 7.8% underwent an unspecified laparoscopic fundoplication. The multilevel meta-analysis model did not estimate. Significant between-study heterogeneity was observed (Tau-squared: 4.02, Higgins–Thompson I²: 93.8%).

Overall, undergoing a GERD procedure provided statistically significant improvement in acid exposure time (mean improvement: 7.80, 95% CI: 6.12 to 9.48, p < 0.001). Although statistically significant improvement was observed for all GERD procedures, Nissen fundoplication averaged greater mean improvement compared to TIF (mean difference: 4.05, 95% CI: 0.13 to 7.96, p = 0.043). No other differences were statistically significant.

Further, meta-regression indicated that no study-specific variable, including longer lengths of follow-up, was associated with mean improvement.

### Randomized clinical trial of laparoscopic total (Nissen) versus posterior partial (Toupet) fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease based on preoperative oesophageal manometry [^112G6KnF]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic fundoplication is an accepted treatment for symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The aim of this study was to clarify whether total (Nissen) or partial (Toupet) fundoplication is preferable, and whether preoperative oesophageal manometry should be used to determine the degree of fundoplication performed.

- **Methods**: Preoperative oesophageal manometry was used to stratify 127 patients with established gastro-oesophageal reflux disease into effective (75) and ineffective (52) oesophageal motility groups. Patients in each group were randomized to Nissen (64) or Toupet (63) fundoplication.

- **Results**: No significant differences between the operative groups were seen in heartburn, regurgitation, or other reflux-related symptoms up to 1 year after surgery. Dysphagia of any degree (27 versus 9 percent; P = 0.018) and chest pain on eating (22 versus 5 percent; P = 0.018) were more prevalent at 1 year in the Nissen group. There were no differences in postoperative symptoms between the effective and ineffective motility groups. Surgery failed in eight patients based on postoperative pH criteria, three in the Nissen group and five in the Toupet group.

- **Conclusion**: Any differences in the symptomatic outcome of laparoscopic Nissen and Toupet fundoplication appear minimal. There is no reason to tailor the degree of fundoplication to preoperative oesophageal manometry.

### Endoscopic assessment of failed fundoplication: A case for standardization [^113mdJho]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Preoperative endoscopic assessment of failed fundoplication is instrumental in diagnosis and surgical management. Endoscopy is a routine and essential part of the workup for a failed fundoplication, but no clear guidelines exist for reporting endoscopic findings. This study aimed to compare endoscopic findings reported by community physicians — such as gastroenterologists and surgeons — with the findings of the authors from an esophageal center for patients who underwent reoperative intervention following a previous antireflux procedure.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed to identify patients who underwent reoperation following a failed antireflux operation between 1 December 2003 and 30 June 2010. Endoscopic findings as reported by the outside physician and by the esophageal center endoscopist were reviewed and compared.

- **Results**: During the study period, 229 patients underwent reoperation. Of these patients, 20 did not have endoscopy performed by an outside physician and were excluded from the study, leaving 208 patients. The endoscopic reports of the esophageal center physician included 97 cases of hiatal hernia (64 type 1 and 33 types 2 and 3), 52 slipped fundoplications, 61 disrupted fundoplications, 30 intrathoracic fundoplications, 25 twisted fundoplications, 14 two-compartment stomachs, and 27 cases of Barrett's esophagus. Outside physicians identified 68% of the hiatal hernias and 61% of the paraesophageal hernias reported by the authors. Only 32% of the outside reports mentioned a previous fundoplication.

### Transoral incisionless fundoplication for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease in clinical practice [^116ninkV]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

The TIF procedure was designed, in contrast to most early endoscopic anti-reflux procedures, to resemble parts of the surgical fundoplication. The goal is to increase the competence of the antireflux barrier by constructing a full-thickness partial fundoplication through the deployment of transmurally placed polypropylene tissue fasteners in conjunction with circumferential tightening of the distal esophagus. Serosa-to-serosa or serosa-to-muscularis fusion results in the recreation of a 200–300° gastroesophageal valve that can be tailored to the individual patient. The most important difference compared with the surgical approach is the inability of extragastric dissection to reduce larger hiatal hernia and to perform cruraplasty.

In the present study, the TIF1 procedure was relatively safe among the 38 patients. We experienced postoperative bleeding in one patient. Another adverse event was an esophageal mucosal tear. After experiencing this event, we started to use olive oil as a lubricant for device introduction, which has successfully prevented this complication further in our series. The postoperative dysphagia experienced by 11% of patients was mild and resolved within 7 days without intervention and could result from edema at the GE junction. Early gas bloating and nausea present in 11% of patients could be caused by insufflation of the stomach during the procedure, anesthesia, or manipulations of tissue at the GE junction that possibly caused vagal irritation. These mild adverse events were also reported by others, as well as postoperative bleeding. However, two full-thickness eso…

### Laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) vs. conventional laparoscopic fundoplication for GERD: Is there a difference [^113Nqtq2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

This report details our experience with laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) fundoplication for GERD and provides a comparison to earlier contiguous patients undergoing conventional laparoscopic fundoplication.

- **Methods**: With institutional review board approval, symptoms before and after LESS fundoplications and conventional laparoscopic fundoplications were scored by patients. Outcomes after 130 consecutive LESS fundoplications were compared to 130 contiguous consecutive outcomes after conventional laparoscopic fundoplications.

- **Results**: Patients undergoing conventional laparoscopic vs. LESS fundoplication were very similar. There were no conversions to "open" operations and no notable complications with LESS fundoplication. Symptom reduction was broad and dramatic for patients undergoing LESS or conventional laparoscopic fundoplication; 96% of patients who underwent LESS fundoplication scored their incision as ≥ 8 (1 = revolting to 10 = beautiful).

- **Conclusions**: Relative to conventional laparoscopy, LESS surgery provides excellent resolution of symptoms without an apparent scar. In comparison to conventional laparoscopy, LESS fundoplication is as safe with similar symptom improvement and superior cosmesis.

### Laparoscopic Nissen versus Toupet fundoplication: Objective and subjective results of a prospective randomized trial [^116moGWQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). High credibility.

Although symptom outcomes following laparoscopic fundoplication have been adequately evaluated in the past, comparative subjective data of laparoscopic Nissen and Toupet fundoplications are scarce. Multichannel intraluminal impedance monitoring (MII) has not been used so far for comparison of objective data.

- **Methods**: One hundred patients with documented chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were randomly allocated to either floppy Nissen fundoplication (group I, n = 50) or Toupet fundoplication (group II, n = 50). Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI), symptom grading, esophageal manometry, and MII data were documented preoperatively and three months after surgery. Subjective and objective outcome data were compared to those of healthy individuals.

- **Results**: Symptom intensity was significantly more severe and GIQLI showed impairment in the examined patient population compared to healthy controls. Both procedures resulted in a significant improvement in GIQLI and GERD symptoms (p < 0.01). Dysphagia improved significantly only in group II, while cough, asthma, and distortion of taste improved significantly in both groups. Hoarseness symptoms showed some degree of improvement in both groups but reached statistical significance only in group I. Postoperatively, bowel symptoms partly increased and the ability to belch decreased in both groups (p < 0.05). Comparison of postoperative GIQLI and symptom scores showed no significant difference between the two groups, except for the ability to belch, which was more impaired after Nissen fundoplication.

### Fundoplication significantly improves objective and subjective reflux outcomes-a meta-analysis [^112cKRCf]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) impacts 10–30% of the population in the Western world. Surgical interventions, including laparoscopic fundoplication (LF), transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF), and magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA), have proven effective in managing GERD. This meta-analysis aims to compare short- and long-term outcomes of these surgical options.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Medline from 1980 to 2024 was conducted to identify randomized control trials or cohort designs that included adults with GERD who underwent fundoplication (Nissen, Toupet), MSA, or TIF and had preoperative and post-operative acid exposure time (AET), DeMeester score, and/or relief score (e.g. GERD-HRQL). We considered all post-operative outcome measurements. We excluded studies with any surgical variations of the procedures, reoperations, and studies not published in English. Risk of bias was assessed using the Oxford scoring system for randomized control trials and the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) for cohort designs. A total of 3912 studies were identified initially, with our review including 78 unique studies providing 166 post-operative outcome measurements. Given studies could include multiple post-operative outcome measurements, we used multilevel random-effects meta-analysis. Between-procedure comparisons were made using multilevel meta-regression. For all outcomes, more positive values indicated greater improvement; mean differences (MD) were estimated for AET and DeMeester scores, whereas standardized mean.

### Persistent dysphagia rate after antireflux surgery is similar for Nissen fundoplication and partial fundoplication [^1134j6Sj]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2019). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic fundoplication is the gold standard operation for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It has been suggested that persistent postoperative dysphagia is increased following Nissen fundoplication compared to partial fundoplication. This study aimed to determine risk factors for persistent postoperative dysphagia, specifically examining the type of fundoplication.

- **Methods**: Patients experiencing GERD symptoms who underwent laparoscopic Nissen, Toupet, or Dor fundoplication from 2009 to 2016 were identified from a single-institutional database. A dysphagia score was obtained as part of the GERD health-related quality of life questionnaire. Persistent dysphagia was defined as a difficulty swallowing score ≥ 1 (noticeable) on a scale from 0 to 5 at least 1 year postoperatively. Odds ratios of persistent dysphagia among those who underwent antireflux surgery were calculated in a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for fundoplication type, sex, age, body mass index, and redo operation.

- **Results**: Of the 441 patients who met inclusion criteria, 255 had ≥ 1 year of follow-up (57.8%). The median duration of follow-up was 3 years. In this cohort, 45.1% of patients underwent Nissen fundoplication and 54.9% underwent partial fundoplication. Persistent postoperative dysphagia was present in 25.9% (n = 66) of patients. On adjusted analysis, there was no statistically significant association between the type of fundoplication (Nissen versus partial) and the likelihood of postoperative dysphagia.

- **Conclusions**: Persistent postoperative dysphagia after a

### Fundoplication significantly improves objective and subjective reflux outcomes-a meta-analysis [^116fhMkM]. Surgical endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

A key strength of this study is its comprehensive approach, incorporating multiple follow-up time points into the meta-analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to provide such a longitudinal perspective, offering a more nuanced comparison of these commonly performed procedures. These findings highlight the importance of considering both objective reflux control and patient-reported outcomes when selecting the most appropriate surgical intervention for GERD. Further research with extended follow-up is warranted to better understand the longer-term trade-offs between reflux control and post-operative quality of life.

This study also bears several limitations, which include lack of hernia characteristics, technical details of hernia repair, and variations in TIF and MSA procedures within the meta-regression. Our analysis did not analyze post-operative complications such as dysphagia and bloating, which could impact post-operative quality of life questionnaire scores. Outcome differences between TIF1.0 and TIF2.0 or cTIF were not separated in this study.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis has increased our understanding of pre- and post-operative subjective and objective improvement from various surgical interventions. Overall, Nissen fundoplication demonstrated significantly better improvement in acid exposure and DeMeester score compared to MSA and TIF. However, symptom relief scores are significantly improved with Toupet fundoplication and MSA compared to other surgical treatment options.

### Five-year outcome after laparoscopic anterior partial versus Nissen fundoplication: four randomized trials [^114sJuv9]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

To compare the longer-term (5-year) outcomes for reflux control and postsurgery side effects after laparoscopic anterior (90° and 180°) partial versus Nissen fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux, four randomized controlled trials were conducted.

Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is the most frequently performed surgical procedure for gastroesophageal reflux. While it achieves excellent control of reflux, some patients experience troublesome side effects. To mitigate these side effects, laparoscopic anterior partial fundoplication variants have been proposed, though some studies suggest they offer poorer reflux control.

Between 1995 and 2003, a total of 461 patients with gastroesophageal reflux were enrolled in these trials, which compared anterior partial versus Nissen fundoplication. Two trials evaluated anterior 180° and two anterior 90° partial fundoplication. The original trial data were combined and reanalyzed to determine outcomes at 5 years follow-up. Reflux symptom control and side effects were evaluated in a blinded manner using standardized questionnaires, including 0 to 10 analog scores (0 = no symptoms, 10 = severe symptoms).

At 5 years, patients who underwent an anterior 90° or 180° partial fundoplication reported fewer side effects than those who underwent Nissen fundoplication and were equally satisfied with the overall outcome. Reflux control, measured by heartburn scores and antisecretory medication use, was similar for anterior 180° partial versus Nissen fundoplication but was inferior after anterior 90° partial versus Nissen fundoplication.

### Perioperative risk of laparoscopic fundoplication: Safer than previously reported-analysis of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 2005 to 2009 [^115GfZjY]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

Several prospective randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the equal effectiveness of surgical fundoplication and proton pump inhibitor therapy for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease. Despite the compelling evidence of its efficacy, surgical antireflux therapy is underutilized and is performed in a very small proportion of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. One important reason for this underutilization is the perceived morbidity and mortality associated with surgical intervention. Published data report perioperative morbidity ranging between 3% and 21% and mortality rates between 0.2% and 0.5%. These data are uncommon, largely derived from previous decades, and are almost exclusively from single institutional studies.

- **Study design**: The study population included all patients in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2005 through 2009 who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication, with or without related postoperative ICD-9 codes. Comorbidities, intraoperative occurrences, and 30-day postoperative outcomes were collected and analyzed using statistical software. Postoperative occurrences were categorized into overall and serious morbidity.

- **Results**: A total of 7,531 fundoplications were identified. Of these patients, 35% were younger than 50 years old, 47.1% were aged between 50 and 69 years, and 16.8% were older than 69 years. The overall 30-day mortality was 0.19% and morbidity was 3.8%. Mortality within 30 days was rare in patients younger than 70 years, occurring in 5 out of 10,000 (0.05%). However, mortality increased to 8 out of 1,000 (0.8%) in older patients.

### Laparoscopic dor versus Toupet fundoplication following Heller myotomy for achalasia: Results of a multicenter, prospective, randomized-controlled trial [^113Qq6tT]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

The type of fundoplication that should be performed in conjunction with Heller myotomy for esophageal achalasia is controversial. We prospectively compared anterior fundoplication (Dor) with partial posterior fundoplication (Toupet) in patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy.

- **Methods**: A multicenter, prospective, randomized-controlled trial was initiated to compare Dor versus Toupet fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Outcome measures were symptomatic GERD scores (0–4, five-point Likert scale questionnaire) and 24-hour pH testing at 6–12 months after surgery. Data are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and Friedman's test.

- **Results**: Sixty of the 85 originally enrolled and randomized patients underwent 36 Dor and 24 Toupet fundoplications, with follow-up data per protocol for analysis. The Dor and Toupet groups were similar in age (46.8 vs. 51.7 years) and gender (52.8% vs. 62.5% male). pH studies at 6–12 months in 43 patients (72%: Dor n = 24 and Toupet n = 19) showed that total DeMeester scores and the percentage time pH < 4 were not significantly different between the two groups. Abnormal acid reflux was present in 10 of 24 Dor group patients (41.7%) and in 4 of 19 Toupet patients (21.0%) (p = 0.152). Dysphagia and regurgitation symptom scores improved significantly in both groups compared to preoperative scores. No significant differences in any esophageal symptoms were noted between the two groups preoperatively or at follow-up. SF-36 quality-of-life measures changed significantly from pre- to postoperative for five of ten domains.
