## Question

two recurrent episodes of red, painful eye over two months

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing two recurrent episodes of a red, painful eye over two months. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the differential diagnosis and which entities are most likely versus vision-threatening. Then, I should verify the key history elements that distinguish these entities. Next, I will review the focused ophthalmic examination maneuvers and immediate tests. After that, I need to consider when to order systemic workup and imaging. Finally, I will outline initial management, escalation strategies, and follow-up plans, while double-checking for pitfalls and ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the differential diagnosis and prioritize by urgency and likelihood. The most common causes of recurrent red, painful eye include episcleritis, scleritis, anterior uveitis, dry eye with ocular surface disease, blepharitis/meibomian gland dysfunction, and medication-induced keratoconjunctivitis, while vision-threatening entities like acute angle-closure glaucoma, infectious keratitis, and endophthalmitis must be excluded early, even if less likely here given the recurrent pattern and lack of severe systemic illness described [^111tpUxQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should distinguish episcleritis from scleritis because management and implications differ substantially. Episcleritis typically presents with sectoral or diffuse superficial injection, mild discomfort, and vessel blanching with phenylephrine, whereas scleritis causes deep, boring pain, non-blanching deep scleral vessels, and may show scleral edema or thinning; failure of vessels to blanch with phenylephrine favors scleritis and mandates urgent ophthalmology referral and systemic evaluation for autoimmune disease [^113dKBpe].

> I need to check for anterior uveitis next, especially if there is photophobia, circumcorneal injection, or cells/flare in the anterior chamber. Recurrent anterior uveitis is classically associated with HLA-B27–related spondyloarthropathies, and missing this can delay sight-saving therapy; a careful review of systemic symptoms and joint history is essential, and topical steroids with cycloplegia are first-line once intraocular pressure is addressed [^111kwjFh].

> Let me consider dry eye and ocular surface disease as contributors or mimics. Dry eye often worsens toward the end of the day, shows conjunctival staining, and can coexist with blepharitis; importantly, about 10% of clinically significant dry eye is due to Sjögren's syndrome, so I should screen for sicca symptoms and consider rheumatology co-management if suspected, while treating with lubricants, lid hygiene, and anti-inflammatory therapy as indicated [^114KQs9c] [^116bHvzM].

> Wait, let me verify medication and preservative exposure because medication-induced keratoconjunctivitis is frequently overlooked in recurrent red eye. A detailed review of topical agents, including over-the-counter drops, glaucoma medications, and contact lens solutions, is critical; management centers on stopping the offending agent and using preservative-free lubricants, with a short, carefully monitored course of topical steroids for severe inflammation [^111rR31K].

> I should confirm the key history elements that narrow the differential. Onset and tempo, laterality, pain quality, photophobia, discharge, visual changes, diurnal variation, contact lens wear, recent trauma or surgery, systemic autoimmune symptoms, and a complete medication history are foundational; for recurrent disease, I must also ask about pattern, triggers, and prior treatments and responses, as this shapes both diagnosis and management [^114HHXTZ] [^114qm3HF].

> Next, I should review the focused ophthalmic examination. Visual acuity, external lids and lashes, corneal clarity with fluorescein, conjunctival injection pattern, anterior chamber depth and reaction, IOP, and a dilated fundus if media are clear are essential; phenylephrine blanching helps distinguish episcleritis from scleritis, and gonioscopy is indicated if angle closure is suspected or IOP is elevated, particularly in hyperopic or shallow anterior chambers [^114HHXTZ] [^113dKBpe].

> Let me think about immediate tests and when they change management. If infection is suspected or the presentation is atypical, conjunctival cultures can be considered, especially for recurrent, severe, or nonresponsive purulent conjunctivitis; in suspected scleritis, I should order ANA, ANCA, RF, CCP, and HLA-B27 to screen for systemic autoimmune disease, and consider chest imaging for sarcoidosis if clinically indicated [^117Pgase] [^113dKBpe].

> Hold on, I should verify when imaging is warranted. If posterior scleritis is suspected due to pain with choroidal folds or retinal striae, B-scan ultrasonography can demonstrate scleral thickening and fluid in Tenon's space; if there are neurological signs or concern for orbital or intracranial disease, MRI of the brain and orbits is appropriate [^notfound].

> For likely episcleritis, I will now examine conservative management. Artificial tears and reassurance are reasonable, and topical NSAIDs or low-potency topical steroids can be used for symptomatic flares, but I need to ensure IOP monitoring if steroids are used and avoid prolonged courses; if episodes recur frequently, I should reconsider the diagnosis and evaluate for scleritis or an underlying systemic process [^113dKBpe] [^113dKBpe].

> For suspected scleritis, I should act promptly. Systemic NSAIDs are first-line, but many patients require oral corticosteroids, and refractory or necrotizing disease often needs steroid-sparing immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or TNF inhibitors; urgent ophthalmology referral is mandatory, and infectious etiologies must be excluded before immunosuppression to avoid worsening occult infection [^115smt5G] [^113dKBpe].

> If anterior uveitis is present, I need to ensure I do not miss IOP management. Topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics are standard, but I should check IOP at each visit because both inflammation and steroids can elevate pressure; if HLA-B27–associated disease is suspected, I should coordinate rheumatology input for systemic management and uveitis surveillance [^113Ajjx7] [^113x4UNf].

> For dry eye and ocular surface disease, I should double-check adherence to lid hygiene and preservative-free lubricants before escalating. Anti-inflammatory options include topical cyclosporine or lifitegrast, and short courses of topical steroids can be used for flares with close IOP monitoring; if Sjögren's is suspected, I should arrange rheumatology co-management and consider serologic testing [^114Ge4aP] [^116bHvzM] [^115T1Bcu].

> But wait, what if the red eye is actually a manifestation of a systemic disease I am missing. Relapsing polychondritis can present with recurrent episcleritis or scleritis alongside auricular chondritis and arthritis; sarcoidosis can cause chronic uveitis with mutton-fat keratic precipitates; and long COVID has been associated with recurrent nodular episcleritis in case reports, so I should integrate systemic review and targeted testing when the ocular picture recurs or is atypical [^1161tzmQ] [^112iGRFW] [^112RRA9K].

> I should confirm follow-up cadence and safety netting. For recurrent or severe disease, close ophthalmology follow-up is needed to monitor treatment response, IOP, and corneal status; patients should be educated to seek urgent care for new photophobia, vision loss, severe pain, or corneal opacity, as these may signal angle closure, keratitis, or scleritis progression requiring immediate intervention [^117TFYUP] [^117HfzY6].

> Let me reconsider potential pitfalls. Mislabeling scleritis as episcleritis delays systemic therapy and risks vision loss; relying on telemedicine without slit-lamp examination can miss anterior chamber cells or corneal involvement; and failing to review medications can perpetuate preservative toxicity; I need to ensure a full slit-lamp exam and a meticulous medication history to avoid these errors [^111kwjFh] [^111rR31K].

> In summary, I need to ensure a structured approach: clarify history, perform a targeted examination with phenylephrine blanching and corneal fluorescein, exclude vision-threatening entities, treat empirically based on the most likely diagnosis while monitoring IOP, and escalate to systemic therapy or rheumatology co-management if scleritis or uveitis is confirmed or if recurrences persist, aligning each step with guideline-based care and patient-specific risk factors [^115smt5G] [^113dKBpe].

Two recurrent episodes of a red, painful eye over two months most commonly indicate **episcleritis or scleritis** [^notfound], often linked to systemic autoimmune disease [^notfound] or post-viral inflammation [^112RRA9K]. Other causes include **uveitis** [^111tpUxQ], dry eye [^114p3eCZ], blepharitis [^112MAxKs], contact lens-related keratitis [^111tpUxQ], and medication-induced conjunctivitis [^111rR31K]. Prompt **slit-lamp examination** [^114qm3HF] is essential to distinguish these entities, and recurrent or severe cases warrant a **systemic workup** (ANA, ANCA, HLA-B27, RF, CCP) [^113dKBpe] and rheumatology referral [^115smt5G]. Management is cause-specific: topical NSAIDs or steroids for episcleritis [^113dKBpe], systemic steroids or immunosuppressants for scleritis or uveitis [^115smt5G], and urgent ophthalmology care for vision-threatening disease [^113ttBcu].

## Diagnostic approach

- **Slit-lamp examination**: Essential to differentiate episcleritis, scleritis, uveitis, and conjunctivitis [^113dKBpe].
- **Systemic workup**: ANA, ANCA, HLA-B27, RF, CCP for recurrent or severe cases [^113dKBpe].
- **Rheumatology referral**: For suspected autoimmune disease [^115smt5G].

---

## Management strategies

- **Episcleritis**: Topical NSAIDs or low-potency topical corticosteroids [^113dKBpe].
- **Scleritis**: Systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents (methotrexate, azathioprine, TNF inhibitors) [^115smt5G].
- **Uveitis**: Topical corticosteroids, cycloplegic agents, and systemic immunosuppression if severe [^112bcwij].
- **Dry eye**: Lubricating drops, topical cyclosporine, and treatment of underlying systemic disease [^114Ge4aP].
- **Blepharitis**: Lid hygiene, warm compresses, and topical antibiotics [^111vjcXr].
- **Contact lens-related keratitis**: Discontinue lenses, topical antibiotics, and close follow-up [^notfound].
- **Medication-induced conjunctivitis**: Discontinue offending agent and consider topical steroids [^111rR31K].

## Prognosis and recurrence

Recurrence is **common**, particularly in autoimmune or inflammatory disease [^114KQs9c]; prognosis depends on the underlying cause and adherence to therapy. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are critical to prevent complications such as corneal scarring, vision loss, or systemic disease progression [^112ixh1k].

---

Two recurrent episodes of a red, painful eye over two months most commonly indicate episcleritis or scleritis, often linked to systemic autoimmune disease or post-viral inflammation. A **structured approach** with slit-lamp examination, targeted systemic workup, and cause-specific therapy is essential for optimal outcomes [^113dKBpe].

### Recurrent nodular episcleritis as a manifestation of long COVID [^112RRA9K]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A woman in her 50s presented with redness, eye pain, watering and photophobia of the left eye starting 1week after she tested positive for COVID-19. She was diagnosed with left eye episcleritis and started on topical steroids. As the steroids were being gradually tapered, she developed a recurrence. The cycle of treatment-tapering-recurrence repeated itself such that nine episodes were noted within a span of 3 years. An exhaustive diagnostic work-up including infective and autoimmune blood tests, rheumatology assessment and COVID-19 conjunctival swabs and tear samples were done, and no underlying conditions or triggers could be identified, attributing 'long COVID' as the likely causative. Long COVID is the continuation or development of new symptoms after the initial COVID-19 infection, with no other explanation. It is estimated to affect nearly 65million people worldwide, with > 200 symptoms, involving different organ systems. The ocular manifestations of long COVID are less well-known.

This is a case of a 63-year-old gentleman who presented with persistent red eyes to the eye clinic for several months. He had been seen in the eye department on several visits when he was noted to have red ears too. This led to further review in the rheumatology and ear, nose and throat clinic to confirm the diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis. He was treated successfully with systemic steroids.

Reassuringly, in 13 cases there were no concerns over the management decisions taken by the CUES optometrist. In three cases there was disagreement on diagnosis and management, although the disagreement posed a low level of risk to the patient's sight. All three cases were red eye or eye infection dealt with by telemedicine only, following a protocol created for primary care optometrists relevant at the material time, limiting face-to-face assessment of red eye during the pandemic to conditions that were potentially sight-threatening, albeit relying on a high-quality history and symptoms assessment to identify "red flags".

The remaining two cases, in which the disagreement on diagnosis and management was classified as 'C' (i.e. moderate-to-high risk of threat to sight), represented 0.23% (95% confidence interval 0.03–0.83%) of all non-referred cases. These cases are considered further: Case 4 (Table 1) involved a 56-year old female patient assessed by telemedicine, noted to have a red right eye with sticky discharge. The vision in the right eye was noted to be worse and the left was stable. After CUES assessment the patients was diagnosed with bacterial conjunctivitis and treatment with chloramphenicol and lubricants was advised. Although the patient subsequently reattended CUES for a face-to-face assessment and was referred, her referral was routine, and she attended EED herself complaining of a "pressure sensation" within the eyes and was found to have intra-ocular pressures of 31 mmHg bilaterally with very narrow angles due to bilateral peripheral anterior synechiae. The patient had a history of poorly controlled narrow angle glaucoma, treated with peripheral iridotomies, bilateral cataract surgery, and triple topical glaucoma therapy. Previously, following her right cataract procedure in 2019, she had attended EED for emergency treatment. Since her more recent EED episode post-CUES, she has undergone glaucoma surgery. In CUES, her complex glaucoma history did not appear to have been elucidated. Case 17 (Table 1) involved a 45-year old female diagnosed with bacterial conjunctivitis in CUES and treated with chloramphenicol for a red, painful, watery left eye. The patient attended EED 2 days later, where a history of recurrent acute anterior uveitis in association with ankylosing spondylitis was noted at triage. She was found to have a recurrence of uveitis with non-necrotizing anterior scleritis and was treated accordingly. A full history and symptoms assessment, including previous eye problems and general health status, would have alerted the CUES practitioner to the more likely diagnosis of uveitis.

### The diagnosis and management of recurrent ischemic priapism, priapism in sickle cell patients, and non-ischemic priapism: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^115FiM3r]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Recurrent ischemic priapism — definition and differentiation — For the purposes of the current guideline, recurrent ischemic priapism is narrowly defined as being a condition in which a patient experiences recurrent ischemic episodes, with any frequency or over any period of time, with or without meeting the previously cited 4-hour time criteria for 'acute priapism'. The key differentiating factor is the requirement of confirmed penile ischemia; using this definition, a patient with SCD and prior episodes of ischemic priapism who experiences recurrent painful episodes of prolonged erections would be considered as having recurrent ischemic priapism, whereas a patient with persistent nonnatural, painful erections which have not be shown to be ischemic or have led to true ischemic priapism would be diagnosed with a separate condition.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^112ixh1k]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Follow-up evaluation for corneal edema and opacification — the urgency in cases involving corneal edema and scarring is highly variable, and new or worse pain, redness, photophobia, and/or vision can herald disruption of the ocular surface, infection, inflammation, recurrence, or worsening that prompts immediate medical attention; timely diagnosis and intervention is paramount to limit ocular complications and improve outcomes; follow-up intervals to ensure clinical improvement or stability in the diagnostic phase is based on clinical judgment, and monitoring after intervention, whether it is conservative medical measures or postoperative care, requires acumen to dictate intervals of clinical visits; for corneal opacification, follow-up is required to monitor corneal clarity and the degree of surface irregularity, and coexisting problems, particularly intraocular inflammation and IOP, need to be reassessed regularly.

### The eye involvement in monogenic autoinflammatory diseases: literature review and update [^1122me4J]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs) are rare entities characterised by improper activation of the innate immune system. This in turn determines recurrent episodes of systemic inflammation characterised by fever, which is variously combined with a wide range of inflammatory manifestations involving the skin, joints, serous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system. As shown by research efforts conducted during the last decade, the eye is not exempt from the systemic inflammatory process and may be involved in almost all of the most frequent AIDs, with several distinct peculiarities. Ocular affections may severely impact patients' quality of life due to orbital pain, impairment of visual acuity, and/ or long-term, sight-threatening complications. Consequently, in the context of a multidisciplinary team, ophthalmologists should be aware of ocular manifestations related to these disorders as they may have a dominant diagnostic weight in patients with a challenging presentation as well as a salient role in therapeutic choice in sight-threatening situations. This review describes a variety of aspects of ophthalmologic involvement in AIDs, looking at both well-recognised eye manifestations as well as rarely reported ocular presentations, with a particular focus on the recent literature.

### Recurrent iris cyst discharge [^114yiuGx]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

A 23-year-old woman with the diagnosis of anterior uveitis in the left eye was referred to our clinic. Circumferential midzonal iris epithelial cysts were observed in the right eye and corneal endothelial pigment precipitates and diffuse pigment discharge in the anterior chamber of the left eye. Topical prednisolone acetate was prescribed. After 2 days, hyperemia and pain decreased in the left eye and started in the right eye. During the following 3 months, the patient experienced 3 similar episodes, which resulted in diffuse pigment deposition in the anterior chamber angles. Intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation was observed after 1 week and 3 weeks in the left eye and right eye, respectively. Topical antiglaucomatous medication was prescribed. Nine months after the last episode, the uncorrected distance visual acuity was 20/20 and the IOP was 15 mm Hg bilaterally. The iris showed diffuse transillumination, and the pupils were unresponsive to light.

An 89-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of chronic daily headaches that significantly worsened over the past 4 months. Initially episodic, the left-sided headaches became continuous and were accompanied by systemic symptoms such as weight loss and elevated inflammatory markers, specifically C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Over subsequent weeks, the neurologic examination revealed new-onset left-sided ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and marked visual acuity loss. This article explores the differential diagnosis for such a complex clinical presentation and highlights how a systematic diagnostic approach can guide clinicians toward the correct diagnosis.

### Familial limb pain and migraine: 8-year follow-up of four generations [^115E45CX]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Patient III1

Aged 46 years at the index time, this patient had episodic abdominal pain and motion sickness as a child. In her 20s and 30s she had episodes of a moderately severe deep ache in her right hip, lasting half an hour at a time, with normal examination during and between the pain. She could not recall the frequency of these episodes. At other times she had a sharp, severe, stabbing pain in her right or left hip, behind either eye, or in her right third toe. These pains came for a period of a day or two, occurred up to 20 times per day, and then abated for weeks or months. She had mild unilateral throbbing fronto-orbital headaches at other times, but never with the hip or stabbing pain. From her early 40s she had episodes of severe pain in the lower left half of her face, awakening her at night and localized to the lower molars, together with watering of both eyes. The pain lasted 20–40 minutes and was relieved by aspirin within 20–30 minutes. Sometimes she had the unilateral sensation that part of her face or her hand was enlarged for about 30 minutes just before the head pain started. From her early 40s she noted episodes of limb pain in her right or left hip, independently or associated in 50% of episodes with unilateral throbbing headache of moderate severity, nausea, photophobia and malaise. The limb pain occurred before and/or during the headache and lasted for about 30 minutes. The headache lasted longer than the limb pain (up to 60 minutes).

Patient III2

As a child, this patient had recurrent hip pain that was never diagnosed or investigated. As an adult, she had monthly (usually premenstrual) heavy, severe pain in her left jaw starting in the morning and accompanied later by pain in her left shoulder and left neck. During these pains she had blurring of her vision for 5–10 minutes and, at the same time, pain in her left hip and knee. The pains stopped her from doing her usual activities. The episodes lasted 2 hours.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^114p3eCZ]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Background — dry eye, alone or with other conditions, is a frequent cause of ocular irritation leading to ophthalmologic care; even when symptoms improve with treatment the disease is "usually not curable", and it causes reduced visual function and "may compromise results of corneal, cataract, keratorefractive, and other anterior segment surgery".

### A 13-year-old male with left eye swelling [^1177NfVi]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A 13-year-old male presented with a 10-day history of left eye swelling and pain. These symptoms prompted presentation to the emergency department. He had no significant past medical history and no preceding fevers or chills. He was found on examination of the eyes and the orbit to have left supraorbital erythema, edema, and pain with upward and medial gaze. Examination of the globe, fundus, and visual fields were normal. His white blood cell count was 6.2 (x1000/mm3) with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 4 (mm/hr). Diagnostic endoscopic biopsy was performed. Here we present this case alongside clinical reasoning and diagnostic evaluation with relevant input from respective experts. This case discussion reviews the final diagnosis, as well as the corresponding evaluation and management. Diagnostic algorithms based on literature review and clinical experience are also included.

### Fedratinib hydrochloride (Inrebic) [^116q6PPT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Amylase and Lipase Elevation

Grade 3 or higher amylase and/or lipase elevations developed in 2% and 10%, respectively, of INREBIC-treated patients. The median time to onset of any grade amylase or lipase elevation was 15 days, with 75% of cases occurring within 1 month of starting treatment. One patient developed pancreatitis in the fedratinib clinical development program (n = 608) and pancreatitis resolved with treatment discontinuation.

Monitor amylase and lipase at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 or higher amylase and/or lipase elevations, interrupt INREBIC until resolved to Grade 1 or less or to baseline. Restart dose at 100 mg daily below the last given dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.6 Uveitis

Uveitis has been observed in post-approval clinical studies with an overall incidence of 4% (11/251). Among patients with INREBIC-associated uveitis, more than half cases observed were in Japanese patients (55%; 6/11). INREBIC-associated uveitis is a late-onset adverse reaction, with the first episode occurring at a median of 14 months after starting treatment, with a range of 8 to 22 months. Recurrent uveitis was reported in some patients who continued INREBIC. The uveitis episodes varied in severity, with grade 1/2 in 60% of episodes, and grade 3/4 in 40% of episodes. Topical steroids were sufficient for treatment in 75% of episodes, and systemic steroids were required in 25% of episodes. Among the patients developing uveitis, INREBIC was discontinued due to uveitis in 27% of patients.

Advise patients on the risks of developing uveitis before starting INREBIC therapy. Common uveitis symptoms include eye pain, redness, photophobia, floaters, and decreased vision. In case of symptoms, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is recommended.

5.7 Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE)

Another Janus Kinase (JAK)-inhibitor has increased the risk of MACE, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke (compared to those treated with TNF blockers) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which INREBIC is not indicated.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with INREBIC, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur.

### Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias manifested as the only initial symptom of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV [^111M9MA6]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
(A) (a, b) Abdominal computed tomography angiogram (CTA) performed on 19 July 2018: partial infarction of right kidney (red arrow in a) and spleen (red arrow in b); (c, d) three-dimensional coronal reconstruction from CTA: dissection (red arrows) and small pseudoaneurysms (blue arrows) of right renal artery and splenic artery. (B) The upper chromatogram in each frame represents the reference sequence, and the lower one depicts the mutant sequence (c.799–1G > A within COL3A1) of the patient.

About 3 months after his right renal and spleen infarction, he underwent a third ultrasound of the urinary system. This implicated that he had recovered from the right renal infarction without abnormal findings. About 6 months after his ICAD, he underwent a Doppler ultrasound scan of the carotid artery, and the findings were normal. At a follow-up visit 11 months after the first discharge, the patient did not complain of any recurrence of painful episodes, although a slight enophthalmos, ptosis, and conjunctival injection in the right eye were still present.

His family history revealed that his father and grandmother had hypertension and had suffered intracerebral hemorrhage. However, the definite cause of their intracerebral hemorrhage was not clear.

Considering the recurrent arterial dissection of this young patient and his family history of intracerebral hemorrhage, we performed genetic investigation for the patient. Whole-exome sequencing was conducted, followed by Sanger sequencing. We found a novel splicing variant c.799–1G > A within COL3A1 (Figure 2B). This variant was absent in the ExAC, 1000G, GnomAD, ESP6500, and 200 in-house controls. It was predicted to be deleterious by MutationTaster, CADD, and DANN. The prediction tool Human Splicing Finder revealed that alteration of the WT acceptor site most probably affects splicing and this variant causes the activation of an intronic cryptic acceptor site and potential alteration of splicing. According to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, this variant should be assigned as a "likely pathogenic" variant (PVS1+PM2). Therefore, this patient was finally diagnosed with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type IV. However, genetic testing of the proband parents was not performed since they refused to participate.

### Clinical reasoning: a 62-year-old woman with transient vision loss [^112hVoBu]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Transient visual loss (TVL) is a common complaint in the emergency department, with numerous possible etiologies. Prompt evaluation and management of TVL can potentially prevent progression to permanent visual loss. In this case, a 62-year-old woman presented with acute, painless, unilateral TVL. Two weeks before presentation, the patient reported bitemporal headaches and paresthesia of the distal extremities. A review of systems revealed chronic fatigue, cough, diffuse arthralgias, and decreased appetite for the previous 6 months. This case highlights the diagnostic approach to patients with TVL. Some common and rare causes associated with this clinical manifestation are briefly reviewed.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^114KQs9c]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Natural history of dry eye disease — dry eye varies in severity, duration, and etiology, and in the majority of patients the condition is not sight-threatening and is characterized by fluctuating vision and troublesome symptoms of irritation that are usually worse at the end of the day. Elimination of exacerbating factors often leads to marked improvement, but the disease may exhibit chronicity with fluctuating severity of symptoms and/or a gradual increase in symptom severity with time. Reversible conjunctival squamous metaplasia and punctate epithelial erosions of the conjunctiva and cornea develop in many patients with clinically significant dry eye, and patients with severe dry eye and underlying inflammatory systemic conditions may develop complications such as ocular surface keratinization, conjunctival scarring, thinning, neovascularization and microbial or sterile corneal ulceration with possible perforation, and severe visual loss.

### Conjunctival involvement in chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis [^113bACWJ]. Cornea (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a case of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) with conjunctival involvement.

Methods

Retrospective chart review.

Results

A 10-year-old girl who complained of fatigue and debilitating pain in both hips and legs for > 1 year had recurrent episodes of redness and discharge in both eyes with little response to different topical medications. The diagnosis of CRMO was confirmed with the help of magnetic resonance imaging, bone scan, and bone biopsy results. She had moderate hyperemia and multiple discrete salmon-colored lesions in both palpebral and fornical conjunctivae. Biopsy revealed chronic inflammatory infiltration composed predominantly of lymphocytes forming a follicular pattern. Conjunctival lesions worsened during relapses of skeletal symptoms, improved during remission, and resolved shortly after the initiation of oral prednisolone therapy. No recurrence was observed during 16 months of follow-up.

Conclusions

Salmon-colored conjunctival lesions may accompany CRMO and respond favorably to systemic steroid therapy.

### Use of cyclosporine A 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion for a distinctive intrapalpebral phenotype of anterior scleritis [^111QW9UN]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The symptoms and severity of scleritis vary between types. Diffuse scleritis causes redness and pain but more significant inflammation than nodular scleritis. Nodular scleritis is characterised by deep red, immobile nodules that lift the vessels and the overlying episcleral and conjunctival tissues. It features distinctive avascular necrotic sclera and significant pain, typically associated with underlying scleral inflammation.

Both patients were diagnosed with nodular scleritis. However, their clinical presentation and the existence of a yellowish pinguecula-like structure overlying scleral nodules seem atypical compared with standard descriptions and presentations of nodular anterior scleritis. Yet, there are clear similarities in the symptomology of the two patients. We considered episcleritisor pingueculitisas alternative diagnoses but feel that the correct diagnosis is scleritis, perhaps a very anterior variant. Patient A presented with peripheral ulcerative keratitis during the clinical course, which is typically associated with scleritis and not episcleritis. Patient B had the absence of vessel blanching with phenylephrine and a biopsy confirming scleritis. Patient A was not biopsied as his condition came under control with therapy.

Our eventual realisation that patient A had scleritis and that the topical cyclosporine was the effective treatment modality took time and several rounds of recurrent inflammation. However, our experience with patient A was crucial for diagnosing and treating patient B, whose similar clinical appearance and symptom constellation prompted quicker initiation of topical cyclosporine use.

The three previously reported cases of scleritis treated by topical cyclosporine (table 1) involved patients with necrotising scleritis. Hoffmann and Wiederholtand Rosenfeld et al reported complete remission of necrotising scleritis of the right eye with 2% topical cyclosporine after 6 weeks in an 83-year-old woman and 4 weeks in a 68-year-old woman, respectively, after multimodal conventional therapy failed. Gumus et al reported successful treatment of orbital myositis with scleritis in a 35-year-old woman with 0.05% topical cyclosporine without recurrence after a 6-month follow-up. A case series found that topical cyclosporine A alone was ineffective in four out of five scleritis patients but was effective in combination with oral corticosteroids and azathioprine, allowing the tapering and discontinuation of all medications over 6 months. One patient discontinued cyclosporine A due to severe discomfort. However, the case series lacked details on the type of scleritis and patient histories.

### Managing cluster headache with sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation: a review [^112Bxy4V]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Cluster headache

Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache and is the most common form of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias that are grouped in the third section of the International Headache Society Classification (ICHD-III).CH is considered to be one of the worst pains known to man. Individuals often describe the pain like having a "red hot poker" penetrating one eye. They report that the intensity is so extreme it is unlike anything they have ever experienced, and female patients describe each attack as being worse than childbirth. The intensity of pain is so high that it can induce suicidal thoughts, and so CH has been named as "suicidal headache". Such severity justifies greater attention to this disease.

CH is characterized by recurrent attacks of very severe unilateral pain, usually located in and around the orbit. During an attack, ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms (lacrimation, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, ptosis, edema of the eyelid or the face, sweating of the forehead or the face, miosis) accompany the pain, and behavior is characterized by a marked sense of agitation and necessity to move. Attacks generally last 15 minutes to 3 hours and occur from once every day to eight times daily, sometimes with a striking circadian rhythmicity, with some patients reporting a predictability of onset during the day or, more frequently, during the night, waking from sleep. The term CH is related to the tendency of attacks to cluster together into bouts that last several weeks or months. In the episodic CH, the bouts occur at certain times of year and are separated by periods of remission, which last at least a month. Frequently, episodic CH has a striking circannual periodicity, with the bouts occurring in the same month of the year. However, about 10%–20% of individuals have the chronic form of CH and have continuous attacks with no respite or remission periods lasting less than 1 month.

### Multimorbidity and sickness absence / disability pension in patients with cluster headache and matched references: a Swedish register-based study [^113hn3cB]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cluster headache (CH) is a trigeminal autonomic headache disorder which manifests as recurrent attacks of excruciating pain behind the eye. Attacks occur at a frequency of 1 attack every other day to 8 attacks per day in active periods, which are often interspaced by attack-free episodes (remission) that can last for weeks up to several years. In cases with remission periods shorter than 3 months per year, the phenotype is classified as chronic CH (CCH). The pain experienced during an attack is known to be the most severe known to human. Patients with CH in active phase have been reported to have a higher prevalence of depression and feelings of hopelessness. There is also an increased risk of suicidal thoughts.CH has been reported to affect the quality of life of patients in active periods more severely than migraine and comparably with migraine during CH remission periods. It is not known today if depression and suicidal ideation are comorbidities of CH or a consequence of living with recurrent severe pain. Patients with CH are reported to be smokers to a greater extent, are reported to have a higher body mass index (BMI), and have been suggested to lead a less healthy lifestyle than the general population. Studies of comorbidities in patients with CH are few and lack replication. Other diagnoses that have been suggested to occur more frequently in patients with CH are sleep apnea, restless legs, bipolar disorder, dental problems, and deviated septum. Inversely, diabetes, gastrointestinal problems, and cardiovascular diseases seem rarer in patients with CH.

### Consensus disease definitions for ophthalmic immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors [^113dKBpe]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Immune-related scleritis

Common: Patients who are developing immune-related scleritis (irScl) typically present acutely with eye injection, photophobia, and deep pain exacerbated by touch. Supportive examination findings include deep scleral injection and edema, tenderness to palpation over the area of injection, failure of vessel blanching with instillation of phenylephrine, and absence of inflammation inside the eye on slit lamp examination. Areas of scleral thinning may be seen. Recommended treatment includes oral NSAIDs or oral systemic corticosteroids titrated to signs and symptoms (online supplemental table 21).

Possible: If the diagnosis of irScl is uncertain, then blood tests may be considered to rule out other causes of scleritis. These include testing for ANCA, ANA, rheumatoid factor (RF), cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), and HLA-B27.

Uncommon: If the irScl cannot be adequately controlled with the aforementioned therapies, then a scheduled break in ICI may be discussed with the oncology team. In addition, long-term immunomodulatory therapy may be discussed with the oncology team.

Immune-related episcleritis

Common: Patients who are developing immune-related episcleritis (irEpi) typically have an acute onset of eye injection, foreign body sensation, and/or blurred vision. Supportive examination findings include superficial episcleral injection, presence of vessel blanching with instillation of phenylephrine, and absence of inflammation inside the eye. Blood work is not required for typical cases. Recommended treatment includes lubricating eye drops, topical corticosteroids, and oral NSAIDs (online supplemental table 22).

Possible: If the diagnosis of irEpi is uncertain, then blood work and imaging may be considered to rule out causes of scleritis including ANCA, ANA, RF, CCP, and HLA-B27.

Uncommon: If irEpi appears atypical with findings of nodularity, recurrence, and resistance to conservative treatment, then the diagnosis may be more consistent with irScl, and diagnosis and treatment of irScl may be considered.

### Interventions for rosacea based on the phenotype approach: an updated systematic review including GRADE assessments [^113aNfER]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Consequently, revised diagnostic criteria have been proposed and recommendations made to abandon the subtyping approach. Both an international rosacea consensus panel and updated NRSEC guidance have recommended harmonized diagnostic criteria and a phenotype‐led approach. 6, 7 The following features represent independent diagnostic criteria of rosacea: fixed centrofacial erythema that may periodically intensify or phymatous changes. In their absence, diagnosis can also be established by two or more major features: papules/pustules, flushing, telangiectasia, ocular manifestations (lid margin telangiectasia, interpalpebral conjunctival injection, spade‐shaped infiltrates in the cornea, scleritis and sclerokeratitis). 7 While secondary features may occur – burning or stinging, oedema, dry appearance – these are not generally considered diagnostic, either alone or in combination. This redirection in diagnosis and elimination of subtypes should provide greater accuracy in diagnosis, establish clearly defined targets for research, facilitate development of severity measures and improve patient‐centred care. 7

Management strategies for people with rosacea should include phenotype‐based treatments, in accordance with current classification of rosacea (instead of the previous subtype‐classification). 7, 8 As rosacea can have an adverse impact on quality of life, these strategies should also be directed towards achieving improvements in general well‐being by targeting those aspects most bothersome to the patient. 1, 8, 9

The objectives of this systematic review were to examine the different management options and to determine the most effective strategies in the treatment of rosacea. Furthermore, this review more closely aligns evidence‐based treatment options with the new phenotype approach.

As the Cochrane Skin Group recently decided to facilitate the regular update of only a few systematic reviews, this update of the Cochrane review is published herein. The content of the full updated review is provided in Appendix S1 (see Supporting Information).

### Recurrent chikungunya retinitis [^112tjAkg]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Chikungunya is a systemic viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes in endemic areas of Africa, Asia and more recently in the Americas. Chikungunya infection produces a sudden onset of fever, joint pains and erythematous skin eruption. A plethora of ocular manifestations have been described ranging from a non-specific conjunctivitis to exudative retinal detachment. Ocular chikungunya seems to respond well to corticosteroid therapy, and outcomes are usually better if treated early. Our patient acquired this infection on a travel to Mexico jungle. This was confirmed by ReverseTranscriptase-PCR test once she returned to the UK. The peculiarity of the case is the inordinate delay of almost a year in the onset of eye symptoms, from acquiring the viral infection. The ocular inflammation responded to systemic corticosteroid therapy with a favourable visual outcome. She developed a recurrence many months later which again responded well to a course of oral steroids.

Case report

A 40-year-old man presented to the emergency department with bilateral conjunctival injection and associated purulent discharge, painful oral erosions, vesiculobullous rash, and fever to 103.5 F. Two weeks prior, he antigen-tested positive for COVID-19 and had 4 days of upper respiratory symptoms that self-resolved. Given the severity of presentation and his inability to maintain adequate oral intake, the patient was admitted for further evaluation and management.

This was the fourth and most severe flare of a mucocutaneous eruption dating back 2 years. Each episode had similar findings, including bilateral conjunctival injection 1 week prior to the development of painful lip and mouth erosions. Cutaneous findings were limited in prior episodes, with papules on the distal extremities and no involvement of the genitalia. These prior episodes resolved without a cause identified and did not require treatment with systemic medications.

On examination, the patient had scattered erythematous papulovesicular lesions on his trunk and extremities (Fig 1, A–E). Lesions were predominantly clustered around the hands and feet and mixed with a few bullae. Erosions and hemorrhagic crusting were noted in the oropharynx, tongue, and lips. No lymphadenopathy was appreciated. Ophthalmic examination revealed scant mucoid discharge, significant bilateral inferior conjunctival injection, and large confluent areas of inferior conjunctival ulceration, but no symblephara formation. The remainder of the patient's ocular anterior and posterior segment was unremarkable.

Introduction: Both skin and mucosal inflammation can be associated with conditions such as autoimmune diseases (SLE, Behçet's disease), erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), each linked to different triggers. Recently, the recognition of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections as a distinct cause has led to the identification of a unique clinical entity known as Mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis (MIRM)/Reactive Infectious Mucocutaneous Eruption (RIME).

Objectives: We present a case of recurrent RIME, highlighting the challenges in its diagnosis and treatment options.

Methods: 13-year-old female adolescent with multiple episodes of recurrent oral and genital ulcers over the past eighteen months, the first one requiring hospitalization due to extensive oral and genital mucositis, leading to reduced oral intake. A diagnosis of MIRM was assumed (positive Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG/IgM serology) and she was treated with IV methylprednisolone and azithromycin, with complete recovery after 3 weeks. During the next 6 months she had three mild new episodes of oral aphthosis, 3–5 days duration, with fast improvement with steroids. On the current episode she reported rhinorrhea and a productive cough over the past 7 days; four days after, aphtous lesions in the mouth, lips and peribuccal/labial edema were noted. She was seen by her pediatrician and prescribed oral steroids, without any improvement. Additionally, this time she developed bullous and edematous genital lesions, and she was hospitalized due to progression of the oral and genital lesions with increasing pain and refusal to eat. She reported no fever, eye redness, asthenia, fatigue, exanthema, arthralgia, myalgia, vaginal discharges, dysuria, headache, or other neurological symptoms. Laboratory results showed hemoglobin 15.4g/dl, leukocytes 21,700/ul, neutrophils 61%, ESR 9mm/h, CRP 1.34mg/dl. She was admitted and intravenous methylprednisolone 1mg/kg was started. She had no fever and was hemodynamically stable, yet there was a progressive and gradual worsening of oral and genital mucosal lesions, accompanied by bilateral non-exudative conjunctival hyperemia and nasal skin lesions. Observed by Ophthalmology, which ruled out episcleritis, scleritis or uveitis. A multidisciplinary approach (Dermatology, Gynecology) led to the application of local treatments and further investigation showed normal protein electrophoresis, immunoglobulins A, G, M, and E, C3, C4, CH50, as also negative anti-dsDNA antibody, ANA, anti-Sm and anti-RNP. Bacteriological and mycological exams of oral and genital lesions, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae and herpes virus 6/7 oral and genital polymerase chain reaction were negative. Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG/IgM serologies were positive. Skin biopsy, HLA-B51, anti-BP180, anti-BP230, anti-desmoglein IgG/IgM are pending. A diagnosis of recurrent RIME was assumed and given the lack of improvement after 4 days of intravenous corticosteroids, it was decided to administer IVIG 2g/kg as an addition to the treatment.

A patient in his sixth decade presented to us with redness, pain and a deterioration of vision in his left eye. He had previously been diagnosed with lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD). He was diagnosed with microbial keratitis, and mixed infection was confirmed on culture (bacteria and fungus) with a protracted healing period before resolution of keratitis. He presented 2years later with similar issues in the same eye and was noted to have a second episode of microbial keratitis, with microsporidia spores noted on gram, potassium hydroxide and calcofluor white stains. He was diagnosed with microsporidial stromal keratitis and underwent therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty. Unfortunately, he suffered a recurrence of microsporidial keratitis following surgery with eventual transplant failure. Microsporidia as an infection in LCD has, to our knowledge, not been previously reported. We aim to discuss microsporidial infection and recurrent microbial keratitis in the setting of LCD.

Case presentation

A 67-year-old man attended our department for evaluation of his turbid PD effluent. He also presented with sore throat, conjunctival hyperaemia, ocular pain, headache, and abdominal pain.

Three months prior, he had noticed a sore throat, and upon examination by his primary care physician, he was diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection and prescribed analgesics. The sore throat improved over the course of a few days. Two months before the current presentation, he also experienced redness and swelling on the left cheek, accompanied by heat sensation, and conjunctival hyperaemia in the right eye. Subsequently, he noted redness, swelling, pain, heat sensation extending from both eyelids to the cheek, and a fever of around 37.5 °C. He sought consultation with the dermatology department, where the serum CRP level was 7.36 mg/dL, and a diagnosis of cellulitis was made. He was initiated on oral antibiotics (amoxicillin hydrate). One week later, the skin lesions had diminished, but a tender erythematous plaque measuring 5 cm in diameter was newly observed in his right cheek region. With continued oral amoxicillin for another week, the skin lesions resolved. However, painful erythematous plaques with infiltrative features, measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter, newly appeared on the forehead and both auricles, accompanied by an increase in CRP levels to 9.97 mg/dL. He was admitted to dermatology department of our hospital to evaluate inflammatory skin lesions (Fig. 1 a).

A skin biopsy was performed, and the histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of nodular erythema. Treatment with oral prednisolone (PSL) at a dosage of 20 mg per day was initiated, resulting in a prompt resolution of the skin lesions. The PSL was gradually tapered over a period of 2 months and eventually discontinued. However, thereafter, the CRP levels began to rise again, and he experienced turbidity in the PD effluent, along with headaches and conjunctival hyperaemia.

### Uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome with sclera-fixed posterior-chamber two-haptic intraocular lens in a highly myopic eye: a case report [^1133uULs]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Unlike these previously reported eyes with UGH syndrome after in-the-bag implantation of an IOL, our patient had a sclera-fixed two-haptic IOL and a history of multiple previous eye surgeries. At the time of presentation, these had caused multiple tissue lesions and made the structure fragile. Because the eye was also highly myopic, the stability of the capsular bag and the support it provided to the IOL were further impaired, which might have been responsible for the initial displacement of the IOL.

In the first of several episodes of blurred vision, floaters, eye pain, and redness, the patient was only given symptomatic treatment to relieve the inflammation and reduce her IOP, with no clear diagnosis of the etiology or pathogenesis of her eye disease. This temporarily mitigated the complaint, but recurrent episodes followed. Delayed-onset postoperative endophthalmitis was first considered when the patient attended our hospital, based on the typical complaints of blurred vision, redness, and pain. Reduced media clarity and poor fundus visualization are among the major clinical signs of endophthalmitis. The recurrent episodes and remission after medication also suggested infection with hypovirulent bacteria. However, this did not fully explain the elevated IOP and bleeding. Although rare, UGH syndrome produces symptoms and signs that were observed in our patient. Under such circumstance, gonioscopy and particularly UBM allow the direct evaluation of the anterior chamber and the chamber angle, and provide essential clues to clarify the etiology. In this case, the identification of mechanical chaffing of the iris by the malpositioned IOL supported the diagnosis of UGH syndrome, and greatly assisted the doctor's selection of a therapeutic strategy. IOL explantation successfully eliminated the cause of chafing and the symptoms did not recur. Bacterial culture of the IOL was negative, excluding the possibility of endophthalmitis. The electron microscopic findings for the explanted IOL were similar to those reported by Asaria et al. in a patient with UGH syndrome, further supporting the diagnosis of UGH syndrome in this case.

### Causes of isolated recurrent ipsilateral sixth nerve palsies in older adults: a case series and review of the literature [^114tu612]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Results

In our consecutive series of seven patients who presented to a neuro-ophthalmology clinic over a 10-year period, five males and two females (≥ 50 years of age) were identified with a diagnosis of isolated recurrent sixth nerve palsies. They presented with recurrent horizontal diplopia without any associated headaches or ocular pain. The duration of these episodes of diplopia ranged from 2 weeks to 3 months. Intervals between these episodes ranged from 5 months to 2 years. Four of seven (57%) patients had a tumor; one patient out of seven (14.29%) had a recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy (IHS 13.9), previously termed ophthalmoplegic migraine; one-seventh (14.29%) had an intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm; and one out of seven patients (14.29%) had an ischemic mononeuropathy related to hypertension and diabetes. Of those patients who had a tumor, three-quarters (75%) had a meningioma and one-quarter (25%) had a metastatic melanoma (Table 1).

Case 1

A 13-year-old boy, from Moroccan descent, was referred for blurred vision on the left eye. He was heterozygous for the familial Mediterranean fever gene (M694I), and HLAB-51-positive. He suffered from recurrent fever and oral aphtosis which was diagnosed as PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis) syndrome from his third to his 7th year and was treated with colchicine. He was then lost to follow-up but reported having had recurrent oral ulcers from the age of 7 without genital involvement for which he had never sought medical attention. At the age of 13 he consulted for ocular pain, redness, and sudden drop in visual acuity of his left eye. He reported 3 previous episodes of red eye and floaters which were treated as conjunctivitis at the ages of 11 and 12. He also reported episodes of pseudo-folliculitis and headaches 1–2 times in the preceding 2 years.

BCVA was 20/20 in the right eye and counting fingers on the left eye. Slit lamp examination and intraocular pressure were normal OU. Left fundus examination showed a dense vitreous haze associated with optic nerve and macular edema, without peripheral retinal necrosis, while OD fundus disclosed a mild vitritis. Fluorescein angiogram showed bilateral diffuse capillaropathy, papillitis and peripheral occlusive vasculitis (Fig. 1 A, B). Macular OCT confirmed massive macula infiltrate and serous retinal detachment on the left eye (Fig. 1 C, D). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture were normal. PBD was diagnosed and the patient was treated with intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone, followed by infliximab tapering oral prednisone associated with colchicine and azathioprine. Macular edema and serous retinal detachment completely resolved (Fig. 1 E–H). Argon laser retinal photocoagulation was performed on non-perfused areas. Ocular inflammation was controlled after 3 months with this treatment regimen allowing a gradual decrease in treatment over a total of 4 years (cessation of corticosteroids and infliximab). At the last follow-up (69 months after onset) he had 20/20 OU and was still receiving colchicine and azathioprine.

### Health sequelae of human cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent patients [^117K4Wex]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

There have been no systematic studies following up the longer term health effects of cases of cryptosporidiosis for which genotype data exist.

Methods

We report a follow-up study of cases of laboratory-confirmed cryptosporidiosis. Case patients were sent a postal questionnaire asking about a wide range of symptoms occurring within 2 months after their initial diagnosis, and control subjects were sent the questionnaire 2 months after they had been recruited to the original study.

Results

Completed questionnaires were received from 235 case patients and 232 control subjects. For 111 of the case patients, the species of the infecting strain was known; 61 of these strains were Cryptosporidium hominis (human genotype), and 50 were Cryptosporidium parvum (bovine genotype). Forty percent of the case patients reported recurrence of intestinal symptoms after resolution of the acute stage of illness, irrespective of whether infection was with C. hominis or C. parvum. Reports of joint pain (odds ratio [OR], 2.8), eye pains (OR, 2.44), recurrent headache (OR, 2.10), dizzy spells (OR, 1.69), and fatigue (OR, 3.0) were significantly more common in case patients than in control subjects, but only in people who had experienced C. hominis infection. Joint symptoms experienced by case patients were of longer duration than those experienced by control subjects.

Conclusions

Our results confirm previous reports of a high rate of relapse of gastrointestinal symptoms following recovery from an acute episode of cryptosporidiosis and show that C. hominis but not C. parvum is associated with an increased risk of nonintestinal sequelae. This study demonstrates that the impact of cryptosporidiosis on public health extends beyond that of the acute diarrheal illness and can lead to significant health sequelae.

### Blau syndrome: a case report from palestine [^117QUMmF]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

An eighteen-year old female was referred to Saint John of Jerusalem Eye Hospital Group uveitis ophthalmology clinic for a specialist consultation regarding bilateral recurrent iridocyclitis. Her long medical history dated back to when she was just 1 year of age when she developed diffuse polyarthritis, mainly targeting both wrists and ankles. Her parents took her to the pediatric rheumatologist who diagnosed her with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and treated her mainly with prednisone and methotrexate. During the following years, and because of the lack of compliance to her medications, her arthritis was not well controlled. Therefore, she suffered from intermittent arthritis mainly affecting her wrists and hand joints which were associated with pain and swelling with spontaneous remissions. At the age of 7 years, she started having problems with her eyes; however, she had poor follow up for her condition. She presented multiple times to her local ophthalmologist with recurrent attacks of redness in her eyes and until just 1 year prior to presenting to us, when she was 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with bilateral anterior uveitis.

Patient #1: a longstanding disease with multiple system involvement and a dramatic response to vemurafenib

A 39 year-old woman of Turkish-Iraqi descent presented in September 2007 to the emergency department with low grade fever, signs of weakness and difficulty walking due to diffuse bone pain mostly in the knees and both pectoral and pelvic girdles. Shortly before her admission the patient began experiencing alternating hot flashes and cold bouts disproportionate to the weather or clothing and suffered from frequent night sweats. Approximately six months prior to this incident, fatigue and leg pain slowly developed. The pain originally began as a tingling sensation, accompanied by paresthesia. It had escalated over several months and progressed to fully fledged bone pain. At the time of presentation, the pain was described as initiating at rest and constant, occasionally accompanied by episodes of fever. The patient was admitted for several consecutive hospitalizations. Upon inspection of her face, both exophthalmos and yellowish peri-orbital xanthelasmae-like lesions were apparent. The remainder of her physical examination was unremarkable, without deformation or bony swelling and without neurological deficits. It is noteworthy that the patient was polydypsic and polyuric for approximately five years prior to the onset of bone pain, consuming and excreting up to 12 liters of water per day. Despite this, a diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus was established and treatment with intranasal desmopressin initiated only upon hospitalization, presumably due to the patient's adjustment to the gradual changes in water metabolism over the years. Apart from her known iron deficiency anemia, laboratory studies revealed increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP: 70 mg/L) and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR: 72 mm/hour). A broad panel of immunologic studies, including rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-nuclear antibodies was unremarkable. Negative blood and urine cultures ruled out an infectious etiology. Protein electrophoresis (PEP) yielded no monoclonal spike and the oncological markers were found to be within normal limits. Further investigations included radiography, which revealed bilateral sclerotic changes in the femoral and tibial bones and electromyography, which demonstrated normal muscle and nerve functionality. A subsequent 99m Tc bone scintigraphy demonstrated increased tracer uptake in the superior aspect of both orbits, the central sphenoidal region, left humeral head, right femoral greater trochanter and lateral superior aspect of the left iliac crest as well as diffuse, symmetric, bilateral increased tracer uptake in the femurs and tibiae enveloping both knees (Figure 1 A). A CT of the femurs and tibiae exhibited an irregular osseous texture demonstrating bones riddled with mixed patchy lesions of sclerotic and lytic nature. This was suggestive of either a metabolic, malignant or granulomatous process. An additional CT of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis revealed congestion of both renal sinuses with slightly distended ureters (Figure 2 A). CT and later MRI of the brain revealed bilateral retro-orbital nodular lesions (Figure 3 A), diffuse thickening and tortuosity of the optic nerves, enlargement of both lacrimal glands and soft tissue fullness of the sphenoid sinus (Figure 3 C). An MRI dedicated to the pituitary revealed no deviation from the normal anatomy. Over the two week period between two consecutive hospitalizations papilledema developed, accompanied by headaches, blurred vision and nausea. A lumbar puncture revealed an increased opening pressure of 44 cmH 2 O. Treatment with acetazolamide (250 mg X3 daily) was initiated, the increased intracranial pressure normalized and related symptoms abated. Biopsies were obtained from the tibial bone marrow and from a lacrimal gland. A microscopic examination of the tibial biopsy revealed bony trabeculae separated by a xanthomatous, diffuse spindle cell macrophage population with few interspersed giant cells (Figure 4 A). The spindle cells stained relatively uniformly for the presence of CD163, and in a more patchy fashion but quite strongly for factor XIIIa (Figure 4 C), surface staining for CD14 and granular intense staining for CD68 (Figure 4 B). CD1a and S-100 staining were globally negative (Figure 4 D) except for one focus of S-100(+) cells, suggesting infiltration of the marrow with Langerhans cells. Overall, these findings were most consistent with a diagnosis of ECD with a component of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Over the five years pursuant to her diagnosis on May 2007, the patient was treated with several treatment protocols. At first, steroids (prednisone, 60 mg/day) provided a temporary relief - a marked decrease in bone pain, decrease in CRP levels and normalization of fever. Two months later vinblastine (6 mg/m 2 /week) was introduced as a steroid sparing agent. This protocol failed to evoke a favorable long lasting response and was substituted for treatment with interferon-α. Since then, interferon-α has served as the primary therapeutic agent administered at dosages as low as 3 × 10 6 IU X 3 times weekly and as high as 6 × 10 6 IU X 5 times weekly. Initially, interferon-α was administered as a single agent. Later on, it was complemented by vinblastine (8 mg/1 to 4 months) and by pamidronic acid (60 mg/1 to 3 months) in order to better control the lytic lesions. It is noteworthy that this patient continued to deteriorate neurologically even at the highest doses of interferon-α administered (6 × 10 6 IU X 5 times weekly). However, the addition of vinblastine to this regimen succeeded in stabilizing the patient clinically and allowed for a gradual decrease in the dosage of interferon-α to a maintenance dose of 6 × 10 6 IU X 2 times weekly over a two year period. Three years after the diagnosis of ECD, a four-month trial of anakinra (100 mg/day) was attempted, mainly due to multifocal disease progression. However, this agent yielded unsatisfactory results. This attempt was followed by a five-month trial of cladribine (0.14 mg/kg/day for five consecutive days, every four weeks), a drug which yielded no apparent benefit to the patient and was very poorly tolerated. By this time, the patient's neurological symptoms, vis-à-vis her lingual and motor capabilities, had deteriorated greatly once again. She was markedly dysarthric and confined to a wheelchair. Consequently, a biopsy obtained from the peri-renal mass was attempted and found to contain ECD histiocytes which harbor the V600E BRAF mutation. After receiving proper counseling and signing an informed consent, treatment with vemurafenib (1,920 mg/day later tapered to 960 mg/day) was initiated with no less than a spectacular improvement. After two weeks of treatment the patient began to exhibit clinical improvement. Ultimately, following treatment with this agent, the patient regained her ability to walk distances of up to 500 meters and recovered her ability to speak fluently.

The fourth patient was a 20-year-old male who had a prior diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis and presented with recurrent blurred vision, redness, and intermittent eye pain in both eyes over a two-year period. The patient experienced cough and chest tightness but had no other systemic symptoms related to other organs. Laboratory tests did not reveal any clinically significant abnormalities. The patient's initial visual acuity (Snellen) was hand motion/ 30 cm and 0.25 in the right and left eyes respectively, and the intraocular pressure was 9 mmHg in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination revealed mutton-fat keratic precipitates, with 4 + in the right eye and 3 + in the left eye, as well as 2 + anterior chamber cells and anterior chamber flares in both eyes. Vitritis was graded as 1 + in both eyes. Additionally, iris nodules consistent with Busacca nodules were observed. The FP exhibited severe vitreous opacity in the right eye and milky white lesions in the peripheral retina of the left eye. Based on the IWOS criteria, the patient was diagnosed with definite OS. He was treated with a combination of oral corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, including methotrexate and cyclosporine. Due to economic constraints, adalimumab was not prescribed, and the patient continued on conventional therapy. The patient was followed up for six months, however, visual acuity did not fully recover in either eye. The patient experienced cough and chest tightness but no other significant extraocular involvement at the last follow-up.

### Clinical characteristics and visual outcomes in infectious scleritis: a review [^113V572h]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Infectious scleritis, though rare, is an important and imminently vision-threatening cause of scleritis. Therefore, it is critical for eye care professionals to maintain infectious etiologies in their differential diagnosis for all patients with presenting symptoms of scleral hyperemia and significant ocular pain. Of particular interest are patients with a history of ocular surgery or trauma, regardless of how remote the event, as infections appear to remain dormant within the sclera for months to years before reactivation. In addition, patients' refractory to treatment for presumed autoimmune scleritis should be promptly considered for infectious etiologies, as their immunosuppressive therapy will inevitably worsen their infection. Scleral abscesses and necrosis are common initial signs in infectious scleritis, though many patients will present with more advanced sequelae such as retinal or choroidal detachments and glaucoma. Bacterial, viral, and fungal etiologies exist for infectious scleritis, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most common overall cause and fungi having the worst overall prognosis. Appropriate diagnosis generally requires scleral scrapings with thorough culturing and immunohis-tochemical staining. However, empiric treatment may be necessary when these laboratory tests return inconclusive. The characteristics of presentation for specific microbes discussed in this review, along with ancillary tests such as ultrasound and optical coherence tomography, may facilitate appropriate diagnosis and therapy in these cases. Effective treatment of infectious scleritis requires both aggressive medical and surgical methods. In addition to microbe-specific medical therapy, repeat drainage and debridement of scleral abscesses and necrotic tissue with the use of various tissue grafts for scleral reinforcement is necessary for resolution. Interestingly, the area of involved sclera is consistently larger intraoperatively than is initially judged on clinical exam, further supporting the importance of surgical exploration. About half of all patients with infectious scleritis maintain functional vision after resolution. Recurrences rarely occur, but highlight the importance of continued close observation for an extended period of time even after clinical resolution in patients with infectious scleritis. With proactive prevention, efficient diagnosis, prompt initiation of aggressive treatment, and close observation, patients with infectious scleritis may have better outcomes.

Prevention and early detection — long-term low-dose oral antiviral prophylaxis: In HEDS prophylaxis trials, the first clinical trial "recruited 703 immunocompetent patients who had experienced an ocular HSV episode in the previous year", and "investigated the efficacy of oral acyclovir (400 mg bid) versus placebo… over 12 months and 18 months". "During the 12-month treatment period, patients treated with oral acyclovir experienced approximately half as many recurrences of ocular HSV as the placebo group", with "no statistical difference… in the six months after cessation of treatment". Benefit was most evident in prior stromal disease: "Among patients with a history of HSV stromal keratitis only 14% experienced recurrences compared to 28% in the placebo group", whereas "among patients with a history of ocular HSV other than stromal keratitis, 4% developed HSV stromal keratitis compared to 3% in the placebo group". Based on this, "a long-term (one year or greater), low-dose oral antiviral prophylaxis is recommended for patients with a history of recurrent HSV stromal keratitis… (Strong Recommendation, Good Quality)".

No recommendation — chronic monthly transfusion therapy for chronic pain in sickle cell disease (SCD): For adults and children with chronic pain from SCD, the ASH guideline panel chooses not to offer a recommendation for or against chronic monthly transfusion therapy as an option to prevent or reduce recurrent pain episodes. Remarks state that in unique circumstances when all other measures to control recurrent pain episodes have failed (eg, hydroxyurea, other disease-modifying therapies) and when shared decision making can be fully applied, a trial of monthly transfusions may be reasonable; the decision should be influenced primarily by patient preference where patients appreciate the uncertainty in benefit over the burden and risks of monthly transfusion; integration of education and informed shared decision making around initiation and/or cessation of chronic transfusion therapy are important; access and adherence to chelation and erythrocytapheresis are also considerations that could favor monthly transfusions in the exceptional circumstances noted above; and because the cessation of chronic transfusions can be associated with other SCD complications, it is important to ensure evaluation if cessation of chronic transfusion is considered, including initiation of other disease-modifying therapies and increased surveillance.

### Inflammatory eye disease for rheumatologists [^115smt5G]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review provides a framework for understanding inflammatory eye disease diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management for rheumatologists. Uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, peripheral ulcerative keratitis, and orbital inflammation are all discussed. The goal is to facilitate the development of approaches to inflammatory eye diseases that will help rheumatologists co-manage these patients with eye care providers specializing in ocular inflammation.

Recent Findings

In recent years, studies have aimed to advance biologic treatments and define standard-of-care therapy. Inflammatory eye diseases are highly heterogeneous and often rare, which poses significant challenges to their research and the interpretation of existing data. To date, glucocorticoids, mycophenolate, methotrexate, and TNF inhibitors remain the mainstay of treatment options for many of these diseases.

Summary

Patients with inflammatory eye diseases require multidisciplinary care for best outcomes, frequently including rheumatologists. Understanding the differentials, diagnostics, and treatment are essential to preserving vision in these patients. The diverse nature of the disease processes within this field requires focusing on specific disease phenotypes and endotypes in research and clinical practice.

### The eyes have it: a rheumatologist's view of uveitis [^113x4UNf]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Uveitis is defined as intraocular inflammation. It is an extraarticular manifestation of many forms of joint disease, which include spondyloarthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and Behçet's disease. Rheumatologists may be asked to consult on the ophthalmologic care of patients with uveitis in order to identify an associated systemic illness. Diagnoses such as spondyloarthritis, sarcoidosis, and interstitial nephritis with uveitis are frequently overlooked by referring ophthalmologists. Alternatively, rheumatologists may be asked to help manage the patient's immunosuppression, including biologic therapy, which can be required to treat a subset of patients with uveitis. This review is intended to provide rheumatologists with the necessary information to facilitate collaboration in the comanagement of patients with uveitis.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness: 2024 update [^112bcwij]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic iritis — diagnosis, treatment, and disposition state that it is acute inflammation of the anterior uveal tract after trauma; in the wilderness, diagnosis is based on a history of pain and photophobia that is often consensual, and inflammation can occur in the absence of visible ocular trauma. The condition is often self-limited; topical steroids such as prednisolone acetate 1%, 1 drop every 2 h while awake for the first week and then tapered slowly; NSAIDs such as ketorolac 0.5%, 1 drop every 8 h; and cycloplegics such as atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 h are described, and nonemergent evacuation is recommended if treatment is not available. Strength ratings are: NSAIDs — Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; Oral steroids — Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; Topical steroids — Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; Cycloplegics — Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; and Nonemergent evacuation — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Carotid dissection presenting as a prolonged cluster-like headache in a patient with episodic cluster headache [^113WfDK4]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 58-year-old-man with a 20-year history of episodic cluster headache presented in our neurological emergency room in December 2015 after an acute episode of severe neck pain. He had been pain free for several years until March 2015 when his headache recurred but responded well to a 3-week course of verapamil 240 mg/day These recurrent headaches would occur on the left frontal side and were associated with lacrimation and redness of the eye as well as congestion of the nose. The patient described the pain as 'knife stabbing'. During the last 6 months, he had suffered from cracking noises in the neck. Three months ago, he had visited an orthopaedist who performed a twisting manoeuvre of his neck. Furthermore, the patient reported practising stretching manoeuvres of his neck on his own to relieve his neck tension. On presentation in our hospital in December 2015, the patient reported an episode of acute severe neck pain radiating to the right frontal region, with an intensity of 10/10 on a numeric rating scale, that had already been present for 8 hours. The patient reported red eyes on both sides (right > left), lacrimation on the right as well as right nasal congestion. Nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia or urgency to move were all denied. The patient had tried different analgesics including acetyl salicylic acid, ibuprofen, sumatriptan nasal spray as well as multiple O 2 inhalations without effect. Finally, the pain remitted after admission to the ward. The patient reported to smoke 10 cigarettes per day and to drink alcohol rarely. Neurological examination was unremarkable except for minimal ptosis and miosis on the right (figure 1).

### Comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation preferred practice pattern ® [^1174yTHD]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation — category II: patients with risk factors — defines increased risk when the evaluation reveals signs that are suggestive of a potentially abnormal condition or when risk factors for developing ocular disease are identified but the patient does not yet require intervention. These situations may merit closer follow-up to monitor the patient's ocular health and to detect early signs of disease with additional testing. The ophthalmologist determines an appropriate follow-up interval for each patient based on the presence of early symptoms and signs, risk factors, the onset of ocular disease, and the potential rate of progression of a given disease.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^117Pgase]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Diagnostic tests for conjunctivitis are selectively used; some cases can be diagnosed on the basis of history and examination, but in other cases additional diagnostic tests may be helpful. Cultures for routine conjunctivitis in the absence of listed risk factors are rarely cost-effective or helpful in deciding on the treatment course, and cultures of the conjunctiva are indicated in all cases of suspected infectious neonatal conjunctivitis. Bacterial cultures and antibiotic susceptibility testing may be helpful for recurrent, severe, or chronic purulent conjunctivitis in any age group and in cases where the conjunctivitis has not responded to medication. Viral diagnostic tests are not routinely used in practice to establish the diagnosis of adenovirus, but they may prevent misdiagnosis, disease spread, unnecessary antibiotic use, increased health care costs, and lost productivity.

### Long-term follow-up and complications after cardiac transplantation [^116dwkuH]. NMDP (1993). Medium credibility.

Ocular — post-transplant care recommendations emphasize when to examine and counsel patients: An ocular exam is indicated "At onset of any chronic GVHD, dry eye symptoms, changes in vision or other eye symptoms", and the "NIH Consensus Development Project recommends consultation with an eye specialist every 3 months during the first year post-HCT and then at longer intervals thereafter". "Monitoring of IOP important in patients receiving any form of glucocorticoids", and clinicians should "Question about eye concerns" "At comprehensive survivorship visits", "Advise to report dryness, light sensitivity, excessive tearing, foreign body sensation, pain, redness, swelling, mucoid aggregates, vision changes", and "Inform about risk of premature cataracts for TBI recipients". For Hurler syndrome, provide "Ongoing ophthalmologic assessment for glaucoma, cataracts, progression of corneal clouding".

### Pharmacotherapy for uveitis: current management and emerging therapy [^114Vptzr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Uveitis, a group of conditions characterized by intraocular inflammation, is a major cause of sight loss in the working population. Most uveitis seen in Western countries is noninfectious and appears to be autoimmune or autoinflammatory in nature, requiring treatment with immunosuppressive and/or anti-inflammatory drugs. In this educational review, we outline the ideal characteristics of drugs for uveitis and review the data to support the use of current and emerging therapies in this context. It is crucial that we continue to develop new therapies for use in uveitis that aim to suppress disease activity, prevent accumulation of damage, and preserve visual function for patients with the minimum possible side effects.

### Ocular presentation of ischaemic optic neuropathy and recurrent episcleritis secondary to relapsing polychondritis [^1161tzmQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Relapsing polychondritis is a rare autoimmune-driven cause of cartilaginous inflammation with multi-systemic impact and disease. We present an acute presentation of optic neuropathy on an eight-month background of wandering oligoarthritis, auricular chondritis and recurrent episcleritis. Prompt courses of oral steroids and ongoing immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and anti-TNF treatment have ensured a swift recovery in ocular and systemic presenting signs and symptoms. This case highlights the clinical workup, multidisciplinary nature and patient factors that led to a prompt positive recovery.

### Recurrent episcleritis in relation to menstruation: a case report [^112YcFum]. Cornea (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a case of recurrent episcleritis associated with a patient's menstrual cycle.

Method

A retrospective case review of a 39-year-old woman who presented with a 12-year history of recurrent episcleritis in relation to her menstruation. She was seen during an acute attack and started on a reducing regime of topical steroids for 5 weeks. She was then advised to use it a week before and after menstruation.

Results

Examination and investigations revealed episcleritis with a negative systems review. After starting the treatment, she was symptom free when reviewed at 4, 8, 14, and 33 weeks. Now, the patient uses topical steroids only 1 week before menstruation.

Conclusions

Literature review revealed no recent case reports and provided insufficient evidence to understand this relationship. We recommend increased awareness and reporting because there is a need for more studies to understand this relationship and to provide evidence for management.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^116UjJj2]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) sickle cell disease — chronic transfusion therapy for pain: For adults and children with SCD and recurrent acute pain, the panel suggests against chronic monthly transfusion therapy as a first-line strategy to prevent or reduce recurrent acute pain episodes, with a conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects. In remarks, the panel notes that in unique circumstances when all other measures have failed and when shared decision making can be fully applied, a trial of monthly transfusions may be reasonable; decisions should be individualized and informed by patient preference with education and shared decision making around initiation and cessation; IV access and adherence to chelation and erythrocytapheresis can favor monthly transfusions in exceptional circumstances; and cessation can be associated with other SCD complications, so caution, initiation of other disease-modifying therapies, and increased surveillance are important. For adults and children with chronic pain from SCD, the panel makes no recommendation for or against chronic monthly transfusion therapy as an option for pain management.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^116bHvzM]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Sjögren's syndrome — epidemiology and comanagement: Among patients with clinically significant dry eye, about 10% have an underlying Sjögren's syndrome, and reported population metrics include prevalence approximately 0.4%, annual incidence 5.3 per 100,000 with prevalence 92.8 per 100,000 and a female-to-male ratio of 20:1, and an annual incidence of primary Sjögren's syndrome of 3.9 per 100,000. Patients with Sjögren's syndrome, whether or not they have secondary autoimmune disease, should be comanaged with a rheumatologist; ocular manifestations may include scleritis, sterile keratitis, and uveitis, and decreased C4 at diagnosis has been associated with a higher risk of developing lymphoma.

### Diagnosis and treatment… [^114Ge4aP]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS Allergic conjunctivitis is often associated with atopic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, eczema, and asthma. 27 Ocular allergies affect an estimated 25 percent of the population in the United States. 28 Itching of the eyes is the most apparent feature of allergic conjunctivitis. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is the most common form of the condition, and symptoms are related to season-specific aeroallergens. Perennial allergic conjunctivitis persists throughout the year. Allergic conjunctivitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis. DRY EYE Dry eye is a common condition caused by decreased tear production or poor tear quality. It is associated with increased age, female sex, medications, and some medical conditions. 5 Topical cyclosporine may take several months to provide subjective improvement. Systemic omega-3 fatty acids have also been shown to be helpful.

32 Topical corticosteroids are shown to be effective in treating inflammation associated with dry eye. 32 The goal of treatment is to prevent corneal scarring and perforation. Ophthalmology referral is indicated if the patient needs topical steroid therapy or surgical procedures. This regimen should continue indefinitely. Topical erythromycin or bacitracin ophthalmic ointment applied to eyelids may be used in patients who do not respond to eyelid hygiene. Azithromycin eye drops may also be used in the treatment of blepharitis. In severe cases, prolonged use of oral antibiotics may be beneficial. 33 Topical steroids may also be useful for severe cases.
30. 34 Studies show that eye patches do not improve patient comfort or healing of corneal abrasion. 35 All steroid preparations are contraindicated in patients with corneal abrasion. Referral to an ophthalmologist is indicated if symptoms worsen or do not resolve within 48 hours.

If pain is present, a cause must be identified. It is good practice to check for corneal involvement or penetrating injury, and to consider urgent referral to ophthalmology. Recurrent hemorrhages may require a workup for bleeding disorders. If the patient is taking warfarin, the International Normalized Ratio should be checked. 36 Topical steroids may be useful for severe cases. Ophthalmology referral is required for recurrent episodes, an unclear diagnosis, and worsening symptoms.

30.

Treatment includes supportive care, cycloplegics, and pain control. The need for topical antibiotics for uncomplicated abrasions has not been proven. Topical aminoglycosides should be avoided because they are toxic to corneal epi-thelium. If pain is present, a cause must be identified. It is good practice to check for corneal involvement or penetrating injury, and to consider urgent referral to ophthalmology. Recurrent hemorrhages may require a workup for bleeding disorders. If the patient is taking warfarin, the International Normalized Ratio should be checked. EPISCLERITIS Episcleritis is a localized area of inflammation involving superficial layers of episclera. It is usually self-limiting and is diagnosed clinically.

Investigation of underlying causes is needed only for recurrent episodes and for symptoms suggestive of associated systemic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment involves supportive care and use of artificial tears. Topical NSAIDs have not been shown to have significant benefit over placebo in the treatment of episcleritis. 36 Topical steroids may be useful for severe cases. Ophthalmology referral is required for recurrent episodes, an unclear diagnosis, and worsening symptoms.

### When is red eye not just conjunctivitis? [^111tpUxQ]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Although conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eyes presented to the family practitioner, a review by Vafidis emphasizes the importance of recognizing alternative diagnoses, some of which are vision-threatening. Insidious onset of symptoms over approximately 36 hours in a watery red eye is characteristic of viral conjunctivitis. Soreness can last up to 10 days, and the condition is infectious until the excessive watering stops. Daily cleaning to remove debris is adequate for mild conjunctivitis, hay fever–related inflammation, and blepharitis, but broad-spectrum topical antibiotics often are prescribed in the belief that they prevent secondary infection. Bacterial conjunctivitis usually starts suddenly with copious, sticky discharge and puffy eyelids. Treatment requires the use of topical antibiotics. Patients with allergic conjunctivitis have prominent chemosis and stringy secretions. Red hypertrophic papillae can be found under the upper eyelid.

Treatment consists of reducing response to the allergen, and use of hygiene and topical anti-allergy medications, such as cromolyn or lodoxamide. The four main causes of painful red eyes are corneal lesions, uveitis, acute glaucoma, and scleritis. Corneal problems such as keratitis, ulceration, and arc damage are intensely painful, often requiring local anesthetic before the eye can be examined. Ulcers or tears in the cornea can be identified with dilute fluorescein and blue-light examination. Abrasions are most painful on waking because of adhesions between the new epithelium and the eyelid. Lubrication can be required for up to six weeks, and the pain can require use of systemic analgesia. Corneal infections are frequently associated with herpes simplex or the use of contact lenses. Serious corneal abscess can develop, and herpetic lesions, which can recur, carry the risk of scarring. In both uveitis and acute glaucoma, patients complain of deep, aching pain with loss of vision.

The cornea is hazy with perilimbal redness and irregular pupils. Patients with uveitis are usually younger and have intense photophobia. Patients with acute glaucoma are likely to be older than 50 and to be profoundly ill, with pain and systemic upset, such as vomiting and anorexia. Both conditions should be urgently referred to a specialist. Emergency treatment for glaucoma includes antiemetics, analgesics, and acetazolamide.
