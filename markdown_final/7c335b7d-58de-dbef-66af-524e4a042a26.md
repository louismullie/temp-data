## Question

Is prevotella denticola a culprit for abscess infections?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Prevotella denticola is a culprit for abscess infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the direct clinical evidence linking P. denticola to abscesses. Then, I should verify the biological plausibility given its ecology and virulence traits. Next, I will review broader microbiology data on Prevotella species in abscesses to see if P. denticola fits the pattern. After that, I need to check antibiotic susceptibility and resistance patterns that would influence whether it behaves as a pathogen in this setting. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

> Let me first confirm the direct evidence. Multiple case reports document a life-threatening deep neck abscess in the visceral space caused by penicillin- and metronidazole-resistant Prevotella denticola after laryngeal mask airway use, with positive cultures from abscess material and a clear temporal relationship to mucosal trauma, which establishes a causal chain in that specific context [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the biological plausibility. Prevotella species are obligate anaerobes enriched in oral and periodontal niches and are well-described as opportunistic pathogens in polymicrobial abscesses when they gain access to normally sterile, low-oxygen compartments; P. denticola's presence in the oral cavity and its capacity to thrive in anaerobic, necrotic tissue make it a plausible abscess pathogen under permissive conditions [^112pryiE] [^112E9xSX] [^116XiokG].

> I will now examine whether P. denticola aligns with broader Prevotella-associated abscess patterns. Large clinical series and reviews consistently identify Prevotella spp. as common isolates in deep neck, odontogenic, and polymicrobial abscesses, reinforcing that the genus — and by extension species like P. denticola — can be culprits when anatomy or mucosal barriers are breached [^112E9xSX] [^116XiokG] [^11115ZTt] [^116EYBXf].

> Hold on, I should verify resistance patterns that would make P. denticola a clinically meaningful pathogen. The index case reports explicitly document P. denticola resistance to penicillin and metronidazole, with susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanate, which is notable because metronidazole resistance in Prevotella is uncommon; this resistance phenotype explains treatment failure with penicillin monotherapy and supports the need for beta-lactamase–stable agents or combination therapy in severe infections [^1155aZPu] [^116hCXZy].

> But wait, what if this is just colonization rather than true infection? Let me reconsider in light of the clinical course and microbiology. The isolation of P. denticola from purulent abscess material in a patient with progressive deep neck infection, coupled with clinical deterioration under inadequate therapy and recovery after appropriate antibiotics and drainage, supports pathogenicity rather than mere colonization in that scenario, even though Prevotella are often commensals in oral sites [^1155aZPu] [^111cgqZS].

> Next, I should review diagnostic implications so we do not miss these infections. Standard anaerobic culture from properly collected abscess aspirates or tissue is essential, and when cultures are negative or inconclusive, 16S rRNA gene sequencing or metagenomic methods can improve detection of fastidious anaerobes like Prevotella; IDSA/ASM guidance emphasizes aspirate or tissue over swabs and prompt anaerobic transport to preserve viability [^116zqfMP] [^113LyPuE] [^112U6XKc].

> I need to ensure therapeutic recommendations are aligned with evidence. Empiric therapy for deep neck or odontogenic abscesses should cover anaerobes, including Prevotella, with agents such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, a beta-lactam plus metronidazole, or clindamycin when beta-lactams are contraindicated; given reported P. denticola resistance to metronidazole in some cases, amoxicillin/clavulanate or clindamycin are reasonable empiric choices pending susceptibilities, and surgical drainage remains critical for source control [^112E9xSX] [^1155aZPu] [^112TRiRb].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, Prevotella denticola can be a culprit for abscess infections, particularly in the setting of mucosal trauma, poor oxygenation, or polymicrobial deep neck and odontogenic abscesses; the evidence base is strongest from well-documented case reports, supported by the broader literature on Prevotella as abscess pathogens and by resistance patterns that can undermine narrow-spectrum therapy [^1155aZPu] [^112E9xSX] [^116XiokG] [^116hCXZy].

Prevotella denticola is a **recognized pathogen** in abscess infections, particularly in the head and neck, oral, and deep fascial spaces [^112E9xSX]. It is an **anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterium** commonly found in the oral cavity and periodontal disease sites, and it can act as an opportunistic pathogen when introduced into sterile tissues via trauma, dental procedures, or airway manipulation [^1126yhRA] [^116qCtyS]. P. denticola has been isolated from severe deep neck abscesses, including visceral space infections, and can be resistant to penicillin and metronidazole, necessitating careful antibiotic selection and surgical drainage when indicated [^1155aZPu] [^111cgqZS]. Its pathogenicity is often enhanced in polymicrobial infections, where it contributes to tissue destruction and abscess formation [^11115ZTt].

## Clinical evidence of prevotella denticola in abscess infections

Several **clinical reports and studies** have documented P. denticola as a causative agent in abscess infections:

- **Deep neck abscesses**: P. denticola has been isolated from severe deep neck abscesses, including visceral space infections, often following airway manipulation or dental procedures [^1155aZPu] [^114rPMcx].

- **Odontogenic infections**: P. denticola is frequently involved in odontogenic abscesses, particularly those originating from periodontal disease or endodontic infections [^116XiokG] [^113bNp7S].

- **Polymicrobial infections**: P. denticola often participates in polymicrobial abscesses, contributing to tissue destruction and chronic infection [^11115ZTt] [^116EYBXf].

---

## Pathogenic mechanisms

P. denticola contributes to abscess formation through several **pathogenic mechanisms**:

- **Anaerobic metabolism**: As an obligate anaerobe, P. denticola thrives in low-oxygen environments typical of abscess cavities, promoting bacterial proliferation and persistence [^1126yhRA].

- **Biofilm formation**: P. denticola can form biofilms, which protect bacteria from host immune responses and antibiotics, facilitating chronic infection [^116QqnoY].

- **Virulence factors**: P. denticola produces enzymes and toxins that degrade host tissues, including collagenases and proteases, contributing to tissue destruction and abscess formation [^notfound].

- **Immune evasion**: P. denticola can modulate host immune responses, impairing neutrophil function and promoting bacterial survival within abscesses [^114xwJEP].

---

## Clinical implications and treatment considerations

The involvement of P. denticola in abscess infections has **important clinical implications**:

- **Antibiotic resistance**: P. denticola isolates have been reported to be resistant to penicillin and metronidazole, necessitating careful antibiotic selection based on culture and sensitivity results [^1155aZPu] [^116hCXZy].

- **Surgical intervention**: Given the anaerobic nature of P. denticola and its propensity for biofilm formation, surgical drainage is often required to achieve effective infection control [^112E9xSX].

- **Polymicrobial considerations**: Infections involving P. denticola are frequently polymicrobial, requiring broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and multidisciplinary management [^11115ZTt] [^112ACsUT].

---

## Comparison with other prevotella species

P. denticola shares similarities with other Prevotella species, such as P. intermedia and P. melaninogenica, in terms of clinical presentation and pathogenicity. However, **P. denticola** has been specifically implicated in severe deep neck abscesses and visceral space infections, highlighting its potential for aggressive disease progression [^1155aZPu].

---

Prevotella denticola is a **recognized pathogen** in abscess infections, particularly in the head and neck, oral, and deep fascial spaces. Its anaerobic metabolism, biofilm formation, and immune evasion strategies contribute to its pathogenicity, and infections often require surgical intervention and careful antibiotic selection.

### Life threatening abscess in the visceral space with penicillin and metronidazole resistant Prevotella denticola following use of a laryngeal mask airway: case report [^1155aZPu]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Laryngeal mask airways are easy to use and are established safe tools to support the airway. This is the first case report with a penicillin and metronidazole resistant Prevotella denticola as the documented bacterial cause of a deep neck abscess after LMA and the first case report of such an abscess in the visceral space.

In this case a small wound in the lateral pharyngeal wall potentially created an access from the pharyngeal cavity into the otherwise sterile visceral space causing infection with Prevotella denticola. The infection spread rapidly because of resistance to penicillin and metronidazole and caused respiratory problems necessitating admittance to ICU for respiratory failure. Early recognition and treatment of LMA induced abscess is necessary to prevent evolution to airway obstruction. If the patient complains of a sore throat and bloodstained sputum after evidence of blood on removal of the LMA, antibiotics should be considered and close monitoring of the patient's ongoing condition should be mandatory.

Furthermore, we advise the routine use of a manometer when using LMA's to obtain a cuff pressure of less then 44 mmHg to prevent soft tissue necrosis.

A randomised controlled trial to compare the incidence of infection and sore throat after findings of blood stains after LMA removal could be beneficial. Also because the LMA is usually inserted blindly, its exact position cannot be assured. Therefore, to place the device into the correct position, we need to understand the possible types of misplacement and have indirect detection methods of misplacement, and to master techniques to place the device correctly.

Prevotella are commonly associated with RA pathogenesis. In humans, these commensal microbes colonise the skin, vagina, oral cavity, respiratory tract and intestine, and have important roles in metabolism and health. Here we add further evidence in support of gut Prevotella spp. involvement in RA prognosis, by contrasting MCII+ and MCII-. After six weeks of DMARD treatment, 18 microbes significantly differed in patients' gut microbiome showing clinical response to therapy, of those 13 decreased including seven Prevotella spp. (see Table 4). Furthermore, 15 Prevotella spp. were identified to decline within long-term DMARD-treated NOAR participants, when compared with early-onset DMARD-naive patients. In total, 15 different Prevotella spp. were negatively associated with clinical improvement to therapy, including P. denalis, P. denticola, P. histicola, P. intermedia, P. melaninogenica, P. nigrescens, P. oris and P. ruminicola. These species have been linked to respiratory disease, multiple sclerosis, brain abscess, blood and cardiac infection, musculoskeletal infection, and most commonly periodontal disease. Previously, we reported Prevotella spp. play a role in RA development, and microbial abundance increased in those with the genotype predisposing risk for RA even in the absence of disease. Interestingly, we did not detect significant associations between P. copri, DMARD treatment and patient clinical response. It is well established that P. copri is involved in early RA, with increased abundance thought to stimulate expression of anti-citrullinated proteins and serum antibodies. Genetic factors predispose to RA, with additive influence of acquired environmental risk. Host genetic factors mediate the microbiome and are thought to lead to a pro-inflammatory, hyper-active immune type. The presence of anti-CCP antibodies at baseline may be considered to represent the shared epitope risk, in line with our previous study demonstrating increased Prevotella spp. in those positive for the shared epitope. Regression models for stool including anti-CCP antibody status as covariate showed no influence on alpha-diversity in our sample. We identified seven Prevotella spp. to be significantly elevated in those having anti-CCP antibodies compared with those without, and several other species including P. copri showed a similar trend (Supplementary Table 12, available at Rheumatology online).

The infection

The patient was otherwise healthy and immunocompetent.

Retropharyngeal abscesses in adults are rare. Tennebaum reported 51 cases in 1996 in his review. Forty one percent of these cases involved patients with a recent history of pharyngeal tear by a preceding procedure or impacted foreign body. Harkani reported 5 case reports in a review in 2011 which occurred mostly due to local trauma due to foreign body ingestion or in immunocompromised patients.

Parapharyngeal abscesses in adults are even more uncommon. Sethi found only 9 patients in his review. All the patients in this study presented with fever and swelling of the upper neck and all needed exploration, incision and drainage. Infection in the parapharyngeal space can spread to the retropharyngeal space and the mediastinum, requiring urgent diagnosis and treatment. Immunocompromised patients and diabetics are also more prone for this kind of infections. However, our patient had an abscess in the visceral space. How could this deep abscess originate from the insertion of a LMA? As discussed earlier, the otolaryngologist found a small wound in the lateral wall on the right side. The spread to the visceral space can be explained by the anatomical boundaries of the visceral space. The visceral space has a controversial terminology with the main difference being the superior limit. Some authors consider the entire pharyngeal mucosal space, including nasopharynx and oropharynx, as a subcomponent of the visceral space extending the superior border to the skull base, while others restrict the visceral space to the infra-hyoid neck, with the superior border at the level of the hyoid bone. Our case report would support the first hypothesis. The pharyngeal mucosal space must be part of the visceral space, otherwise this type of abscess could not have occurred. Apart from this discussion, there is consensus that the visceral space extends to the superior mediastinum: this consensus is supported by our case report, as the superior mediastinum represented the inferior border of the abscess.

The strength of this case presentation is the combination of the chronology of events, the diagnosis on CECT of the visceral abscess and the positive microbiology. Limitations are the paucity of data to be found in the literature about the anatomical extension of the visceral space.

Discussion and conclusion

This is a case of an abscess in the visceral space following LMA insertion for elective surgery, evolving into respiratory distress despite antibiotic therapy, with the need for admission to the ICU and incision and drainage of the abscess.

The wound

Necrotic mucosal tissue and defects in the posterior wall after use of LMA have already been reported. Soft tissue necrosis could have different causes such as: over-inflation, bad positioning, incorrect sizing of the LMA, prolonged direct pressure effects due to long procedural duration and direct trauma. Direct trauma had even been reported to cause bleeding, uvular damage, tearing of the lingual frenulum and ulceration of the soft palate. Even with apparent easy insertion of an LMA such complications can occur. However they may be more likely if repeated attempts at insertion are needed or excessive force is used. Table 3 shows the possible sites, types and mechanisms of traumatic injuries caused by LMA.

The treatment

In the day care centre only analgesics were prescribed. The general practitioner added amoxicillin 24 h later following national guidelines for the treatment of laryngitis. Unfortunately, the Prevotella spp. which caused the infection was resistant to amoxicillin. This made it possible for the infection to spread further causing pain, dysphagia and respiratory problems. Fortunately, the patient recovered well on therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanate and vancomycin. Respiratory distress improved over the following 24 h and the swelling diminished. Subsequently, the abscess was incised 5 days later under general anaesthesia. The treatment given, of antibiotics and surgical treatment for deep neck abscess was in accordance with international guidelines.

Prevotella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria. They are non-motile, singular cells that thrive in anaerobic growth conditions. They thrive on tissues with decreased oxidation-reduction potentials, such as those with limited blood supply or tissue necrosis. Prevotella spp. are found in the oral cavity, the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. They can act as an opportunistic pathogen, often penetrating tissues and establishing an infection at mucosal surfaces causing periodontal and tooth problems such as gingivitis and periodontitis. They predominate in periodontal disease and periodontal abscesses. Some Prevotella spp. are resistant to Beta-lactam antibiotics. Effective antibiotic treatments are metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ureidopenicilins, carbapenems, cephalosporins, clindamycin and chloramphenicol. This patient had extensive spread of the infection due to a late diagnosis of an abscess in the visceral space with a penicillin resistant Prevotella treated with amoxicillin.

Patient perspective on the received treatment

"I recovered from anesthesia of the first operation and was very pleased with the results of the operation. However, I had a sore throat when leaving the day care centre. One day later I was in so much pain that I had to call the general practitioner. I was thankful for the painkillers and I was well informed why antibiotics were prescribed. 24 hours later the pain and swelling was getting worse and I started to panic because I thought I would die. The treatment with oxygen and antibiotics started on intensive care and I was overwhelmed by all the actions the caregivers had to do to stabilise my situation. I am so glad I didn't have to get a tracheotomy. Luckily, I have fully recovered and I am very thankful for the good treatment I have been given".

Severe respiratory complications due to retropharyngeal abscesses following injuries caused by LMA are rare. The extension of the abscess into the parapharyngeal space is even more rare. Only two of these cases have been reported. We report the first patient with an abscess in the visceral space following the use of an LMA. This case is unique because of the localisation of the infection, supporting a hypothesis that the pharyngeal mucosal space must be part of the visceral space. Secondly, the infection became life-threatening despite timely treatment with antibiotics due to an infection with a penicillin and metronidazole resistant Prevotella denticola.

Therapeutic interventions

The patient was referred to the ICU with dyspnoea. Oxygen therapy was started and the patient was initially treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate (1000 mg 4x/day) and vancomycin (1000 mg 4x/day) followed by surgical drainage under general anaesthesia 5 days later. After thorough examination by an otolaryngologist during surgery, a minor wound was found on the lateral pharyngeal wall. Microbiology showed 3 positive cultures of the anaerobe Prevotella denticola, resistant for penicillin and metronidazole, but sensitive for amoxicillin/clavulanate. After surgery, the patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged a few days later. The patient fully recovered following discharge. The time-line regarding the evolution of this case is found in Table 2.

### Rare case oflung abscess [^116wXpqw]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Prevotella genus comprises of obligate anaerobic, gram-negative bacteria that are commensal organisms of oral cavity, gut and vaginal mucosa. Although many Prevotella species have well-established pathogenicity with respect to pulmonary infections, rarely has Prevotella pleuritidis been isolated as a cause of lung abscess. We present a rare case of left lower lobe lung abscess due to P. pleuritidis identified using next-generation sequencing of microbial cell-free DNA testing. A brief review of the literature regarding Prevotella species pulmonary infections, use of next-generation cell-free DNA testing early in the evaluation, antibiotic susceptibility and resistance is also a part of this report.

### Airway Prevotella promote TLR2-dependent neutrophil activation and rapid clearance of Streptococcus pneumoniae from the lung [^112pryiE]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In healthy adults, the enrichment of Prevotella rRNA gene concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) is associated with sub-clinical inflammation, including increased numbers of activated neutrophils. However, Prevotella -induced inflammation is subdued compared to that induced by opportunistic bacterial pathogens. For example, lung transplant recipients with Prevotella -dominant BAL microbiome profiles had lower innate immune activation profiles than those with Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas -dominant microbiomes. In mice, lung exposure to Prevotella melaninogenica induced less toll-like receptor(TLR)2-dependent inflammation than the pathogen Haemophilus influenzae. Similarly, another Prevotella species induced TLR2 signaling but fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines than a cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogen in human CF bronchial epithelial cells. In the context of CF, both positive and negative roles have been attributed to anaerobic bacteria including P. melaninogenica, though Prevotella abundance correlates with milder CF in some cases. Prevotella species are not universally beneficial or benign members of the airway microbiome. Unlike P. melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia is frequently isolated from periodontal abscesses, expresses virulence factors including a type 6 secretion system (T6SS), and enhances susceptibility to S. pneumoniae by upregulating a critical host adherence receptor. P. melaninogenica has been identified in polymicrobial lung abscesses, though it is unclear which species drive abscess formation, and causes increased tissue damage in the context of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. These studies suggest that the overall beneficial versus detrimental effects of Prevotella on airway health depend on the amplitude and context of Prevotella -induced immune responses.

For this study, we developed an animal model to determine how airway Prevotell a modulate innate immune-mediated protection against S. pneumoniae. Using this model, we identify an innate immune response induced by several Prevotella species including P. melaninogenica associated with rapid clearance of S. pneumoniae from the lung, highlighting airway Prevotella as an important immune regulatory signature that contributes to respiratory tract health.

### Life threatening abscess in the visceral space with penicillin and metronidazole resistant Prevotella denticola following use of a laryngeal mask airway: case report [^112TrobD]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis

In our case the patient had a sore throat postoperatively. However, this is not uncommon after airway manipulation. A sore throat occurs in 12% after airway manipulation with 45% due to endotracheal intubation and only 18% attributed to LMA. The cuff pressure has also an effect on the degree of pain. Therefore, measurement of cuff pressure should be the standard of care in LMA use.

The evidence of some blood on the LMA at the time of removal could have alerted medical staff to the possibility of trauma caused by the LMA. Evidence exists that patients with a postoperative sore throat and bloodstained sputum should undergo more thorough clinical investigations. In this patient, because only a small amount of bloodstained sputum was observed, no further investigation was initiated.

The patient presented to her general practitioner the following day with fever, dysphagia and throat pain. A common diagnosis of laryngitis was made and she was treated accordingly. After three days, the fever and pain persisted and the skin was swollen, red and warm from the sternum bilaterally to both ears. The patient was admitted to the emergency room where an abscess in the visceral space was confirmed after CECT scan before she was transferred to the ICU.

The CECT scan of the neck and upper chest was performed 5 days after insertion of the LMA. The initial CECT scan shows a large collection of fluid and air bubbles (which proved to be an abscess) in a rather unusual location, called the visceral space. The collection pushes the right thyroid lobe and the right internal jugular vein posteriorly. The collection is therefore draped over the thyroid gland and contained by the overlying sternocleidomastoid muscle (Fig. 1, red arrow). Part of the abscess is located adjacent to the trachea on the right side, deep from the right thyroid gland lobe (Fig. 1, green arrow).

### Life threatening abscess in the visceral space with penicillin and metronidazole resistant Prevotella denticola following use of a laryngeal mask airway: case report [^115kEQLF]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Laryngeal mask airways (LMA) are commonly used for airway management. Complications with this device are rare. However, when they do occur, there is a high risk for respiratory problems, necessitating early diagnosis and treatment. We present the first case of a life-threatening abscess spreading in the visceral space caused by a penicillin and metronidazole resistant Prevotella Denticola after the use of an LMA.

Case presentation

A female patient was admitted to our day care centre for bunion surgery. A single use LMA size 3 (Solus®, intersurgical, Wokingham, Berkshire, United Kingdom) was successfully inserted. After surgery, the patient complained of a sore throat and amoxicillin was prescribed by the general practitioner. Three days after surgery the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for obstructive breathing, due to an abscess in the visceral space. Retropharyngeal and certainly parapharyngeal abscesses in adults are already rare. This case however, is unique because it is the first case of abscess spreading into the visceral space after the use of an LMA. Amoxicillin/clavulanate and vancomycin were started. The abscess was incised 5 days later and microbiology showed 3 positive cultures of the anaerobe Prevotella denticola, resistant for penicillin and metronidazole, but sensitive for amoxicillin/clavulanate. The patient fully recovered.

Conclusion

LMA's are easy to use and are established, safe tools to support ventilation of the airway. In this case, the authors hypothesise a small wound in the lateral pharyngeal wall probably created an opening into the visceral space causing infection with Prevotella denticola, supporting the idea that the pharyngeal mucosal space must be part of the visceral space. Additionally, early recognition and treatment of an LMA induced abscess is necessary to prevent evolution of complications leading to airway obstruction.

There is inferior extension of the abscess into the border of the upper mediastinum, posterior from the manubrium of the sternum. The platysma is slightly thickened at the right side. Several bilateral jugulodigastric lymph nodes are reactively enlarged. Although some inflammation around the right external jugular vein is noted, this does not result in a frank thrombophlebitis. Tracheal deviation to the left can be seen on the coronal reconstructions due to mass effect of the abscess (Fig. 2).

### Infections as ecosystems: community metabolic interactions in microbial pathogenesis [^116QqnoY]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

Cooperation

Cooperation can be defined as beneficial interactions of and between microbes, such as exchanging byproducts or sharing metabolic tasks, that lead to mutual persistence. These interactions allow microbes to live in a community together and perform biochemical processes that would be impossible or inefficient in isolation. Additionally, cooperative metabolic interactions synchronize resource use and enhance the survival of the community members. However, this dependence on metabolic cooperation can also make the community more susceptible to invasion by highly fit competing microbes, which can disrupt the community structure and allow the invading microbe to dominate. In terms of host-associated polymicrobial infections, metabolic cooperation contributes to pathogenesis and disease progression. For example, the development of dental diseases, such as periodontitis, is associated with a pathogenic bacterial consortia known as the 'red complex' (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia). Genomic analysis of the 'red complex' showed that cooperative biosynthesis and production of fatty acids, particularly butyric acid, are an essential metabolic pathway for these species to persist and cause inflammation. Cooperative mechanisms that lead to mutual persistence within a microbial community include inter- and intra-species interactions, such as cross-feeding, division of labor, and detoxification (Fig. 2A through C). Here, we describe these strategies in more depth and discuss the role of cooperation in polymicrobial infections.

### Clinical features and gut microbiome of asymptomatic entamoeba histolytica infection [^111jS1Mg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of invasive amebiasis, is the second most common parasitic cause of mortality worldwide. Over the past 2 decades, it was reported that invasive amebiasis is prevalent not only in developing countries where food and water are frequently contaminated by feces, but also in some developed countries in Asia and Europe. In these areas, the pathogen spreads as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), especially among men who have sex with men (MSM) and people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Furthermore, recent data indicate that this pathogen is spreading among HIV-uninfected men and women in Japan.

The severity of E. histolytica infection varies. Only 10% of individuals who are exposed to the pathogen develop "symptomatic" invasive amebiasis; the majority of cases are asymptomatic or display self-limiting mild diarrhea at an early phase. Therefore, E. histolytica infection is often overlooked in clinical settings. Furthermore, it is known that some infections persist asymptomatically. The half-life of asymptomatic infection is reported to be about 1 year, which can result in a transmissible pathogen reservoir among the community, and E. histolytica infection has been unexpectedly diagnosed by endoscopy in developed countries. Data from the National Surveillance of Japan indicated an increase in the number of asymptomatic infections from 39 patients in 2010 to 170 patients in 2013. However, these numbers only accounted for around 10%–20% of all reported cases, indicating that asymptomatic cases of E. histolytica infection are currently underestimated in Japan. For future disease control of E. histolytica infection, it is important to understand the pathogenesis of this microorganism, which involves identifying the determinant factors of disease severity. Previously reported human cohort data indicated that the gut microbiome plays an important role. Cross-sectional studies from India reported that the burden of some bacterial species in the gut microbiota was altered by the presence of E. histolytica, and differences in the gut microbiota between asymptomatic colonization and liver abscess during E. histolytica infection have also been reported. The presence of Prevotella copri in the gut flora was shown to be associated with susceptibility to E. histolytica –induced diarrheal disease in 2 geographically distinct areas. It is of interest to better understand the impact of the gut microbiome on the severity of E. histolytica infection.

Herein, we compared the clinical features of asymptomatic E. histolytica infection with those of invasive diseases in our cohort and sought to identify the features of the gut microbiota during asymptomatic infection.

### New insights into the emerging role of oral spirochaetes in periodontal disease [^112wjaBx]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Spirochaetes are prominent in the polymicrobial infections that cause periodontal diseases. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the periodontium, characterized by proinflammatory soft tissue damage and alveolar bone loss. Treponema denticola is the most well-understood oral spirochaete, expressing a wealth of virulence factors that mediate tissue penetration and destruction as well as evasion of host immune responses. This review focuses on emerging knowledge of virulence mechanisms of Treponema denticola as well as mechanisms of other less-studied oral treponemes.

### Periodontal bacteria in rabbit mandibular and maxillary abscesses [^1137THXb]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

Despite the high incidence of odontogenic abscesses in pet rabbits, published data on the bacteriology of these infections are lacking, and clinical cultures are often ambiguous, making antibiotic choices difficult. In order to define the bacteriology of these infections, 12 rabbit mandibular and maxillary abscesses were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. All specimens yielded pathogenic bacteria, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella heparinolytica, Prevotella spp. Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus milleri group, Actinomyces israelii, and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. These organisms are consistent with the characterized bacteriology of periodontal disease in human and other mammalian studies. The isolates were tested against 10 antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat rabbits; 100% of the strains tested were susceptible to clindamycin, 96% were susceptible to penicillin and ceftriaxone, 54% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, and only 7% were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

### Case of a cerebral abscess caused byin a subject with periodontitis [^116JCoKQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Learning points

Porphyromonas gingivalis is a rare but potentially life-threatening anaerobe that can cause intracerebral abscesses.
CT imaging cannot always diagnose a cerebral abscess; thus, MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging should be added to the diagnostic workup.
Quick initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, preferably after taking cultures, is paramount.
Neurosurgical intervention and timing depends on clinical, laboratory and radiological findings but can be useful diagnostically to elucidate the causative pathogen.
The source of infection should be investigated and treated accordingly.

### Herpesviral-bacterial synergy in the pathogenesis of human periodontitis [^114oXChr]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Periodontitis is an infectious disease, but the specific mechanisms by which tooth-supportive tissues are lost remain obscure. This article proposes an infectious disease model for periodontitis in which herpesviral-bacterial interactions assume a major etiopathogenic role.

Recent Findings

Epstein-Barr virus type 1, cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses occur at a high frequency in aggressive periodontitis lesions. Also, herpesvirus-infected periodontitis lesions tend to harbor elevated levels of classic periodontopathic bacteria, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Dialister pneumosintes, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Treponema denticola and Actinobacillus (Aggregatibacter) actinomycetemcomitans.

Summary

Conceivably, a herpesvirus active infection in the periodontium impairs local defenses, thereby permitting overgrowth and increased aggressiveness of periodontopathic bacteria. In turn, periodontal pathogenic bacteria may augment the virulence of periodontal herpesviruses. It is suggested that interactions among herpesviruses and specific bacterial species constitute an important pathogenetic feature of periodontitis and maybe also of various non-oral infections.

### Periodontitis: a polymicrobial disruption of host homeostasis [^116GycT8]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Periodontitis, or gum disease, affects millions of people each year. Although it is associated with a defined microbial composition found on the surface of the tooth and tooth root, the contribution of bacteria to disease progression is poorly understood. Commensal bacteria probably induce a protective response that prevents the host from developing disease. However, several bacterial species found in plaque (the 'red-complex' bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola) use various mechanisms to interfere with host defence mechanisms. Furthermore, disease may result from 'community-based' attack on the host. Here, I describe the interaction of the host immune system with the oral bacteria in healthy states and in diseased states.

### The Treponema denticola fhbB protein is a dominant early antigen that elicits fhbB variant-specific antibodies that block factor H binding and cleavage by dentilisin [^112R1yD1]. Infection and Immunity (2016). Low credibility.

The Treponema denticola FhbB protein contributes to immune evasion by binding factor H (FH). Cleavage of FH by the T. denticola protease, dentilisin, may contribute to the local immune dysregulation that is characteristic of periodontal disease (PD). Although three FhbB phyletic types have been defined (FhbB1, FhbB2, and FhbB3), the in vivo expression patterns and antigenic heterogeneity of FhbB have not been assessed. Here, we demonstrate that FhbB is a dominant early antigen that elicits FhbB type-specific antibody (Ab) responses. Using the murine skin abscess model, we demonstrate that the presence or absence of FhbB or dentilisin significantly influences Ab responses to infection and skin abscess formation. Competitive binding analyses revealed that α-FhbB Ab can compete with FH for binding to T. denticola and block dentilisin-mediated FH cleavage. Lastly, we demonstrate that dentilisin cleavage sites reside within critical functional domains of FH, including the complement regulatory domain formed by CCPs 1 to 4. Analysis of the FH cleavage products revealed that they lack cofactor activity. The data presented here provide insight into the in vivo significance of dentilisin, FhbB and its antigenic diversity, and the potential impact of FH cleavage on the regulation of complement activation.

Discussion

It is well documented that NSTIs, besides being monomicrobial in nature and caused by professional pathogens, can also be caused by polymicrobial bacterial communities. However, despite the fact that these polymicrobial infections often outnumber those of monomicrobial etiology, there is a lack of information regarding their bacterial composition and activities. Culture-dependent analysis of polymicrobial NSTIs remains generally restricted to the most abundant or easily culturable bacteria. Amazingly, to date, only a single study has attempted to analyze the microbial composition in NSTIs using a 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach. This study, performed in a limited cohort of 10 volunteers, showed that standard cultivation methods underestimate the diversity of the complex bacterial communities in polymicrobial NSTIs. In the study presented here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the bacterial communities associated with NSTIs in a cohort of 148 patients and could demonstrate that polymicrobial communities in NSTIs are not randomly associated, but typically comprised of co-occurring bacteria forming a highly interconnected network. The bacterial genera dominating in polymicrobial NSTIs, which include Porphyromonas spp. Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella spp. (Fig. 1a, b, Supplementary Figure 8a) have been shown to synergistically interact in an in vitro model of chronic periodontitisas well as in suppurative apical periodontitis in a murine infection model. Hence, their co-occurrence during NSTIs might suggest that similar interactions facilitate tissue colonization and drive disease progression. Overall, these analyses refute the statement of Rudkjøbing et al. that there are no specific combinations of species in polymicrobial NSTIs. Although several of the species that we identified in polymicrobial NSTIs, such as Prevotella intermedia or Parvimonas micra, have previously been recovered from other bacterial infections, they are also common members of the healthy human microbiota. This observation indicates that the contribution of these microorganisms to the overall NSTIs burden is most probably still underestimated in the clinical setting as culture-based methods frequently fail in their detection. Furthermore, the changing microbial epidemiology of NSTIs observed over the last decadesis also apparent in our study. Clostridium sensu stricto were only observed in rare instances, a trend that has been linked to improvements in hygiene and sanitation conditions.

### Analysis of the composition and functions of the microbiome in diabetic foot osteomyelitis based on 16S rRNA and metagenome sequencing technology [^111FcHcF]. Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Metagenome sequencing has not been used in infected bone specimens. This prospective observational study explored the microbiome and its function in patients with diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) and posttraumatic foot osteomyelitis (PFO) based on 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenome sequencing technologies. Spearman analysis was used to explore the correlation between dominant species and clinical indicators of patients with DFO. High-throughput sequencing showed that all the specimens were polymicrobial. The microbial diversity was significantly higher in the DFO group than in the PFO group. Firmicutes, Prevotellaceae, and Prevotella were the most abundant microbes in the DFO group. The most abundant microbes in the PFO group were Proteobacteria, Halomonadaceae, and Halomonas Prevotella denticola, Prevotella jejuni, and Prevotella fusca had positive correlation with the duration of diabetic foot infection (DFI_d). Proteus vulgaris was positively correlated with the infection index, while Bacteroides fragilis was negatively correlated. The microbial functional genes were more abundant in the DFO group than in the PFO group. Metagenome sequencing is feasible for the analysis of the microbiome in infected bone specimens. Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes are dominant in DFO.

### Infection of a total hip arthroplasty with Prevotella loeschii [^1175CzYc]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Infection is a serious complication of total hip replacement. It has been proposed that 6% of all infections after total hip arthroplasty may be of dental origin through hematogenous spread. However, no conclusive evidence that the mouth is a definitive source for infection of a total hip replacement has been reported. In the current case, Prevotella loeschii, a pigmented bacteroides species was identified in a total hip replacement. Prevotella loeschii is an organism which exclusively inhabits the dental region. Hematogenous spread of Prevotella loeschii may occur after penetration of the mucosal barrier in cases of endodontic or periodontic lesions, pericoronitis, or complications of tooth extraction. The involvement of Prevotella loescheii in an infection in a patient who had a total hip arthroplasty is strong evidence for the mechanism of a hematogenous infection from a dental source.

### Efficacy of needle aspiration in patients with oral-maxillofacial abscesses: a retrospective study of 15 consecutive patients [^114devWt]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the adequacy and safety of needle aspiration (NA) as an alternative to open surgical drainage for oral-maxillofacial abscesses. Fifteen consecutive patients who were diagnosed with oral-maxillofacial abscesses via contrast-enhanced CT from January 2020 to December 2020 were included. All patients were on antibiotics and treated with NA under local anaesthesia using a 20 mL syringe. Data collection included patient characteristics, signs and symptoms, physical examinations, laboratory tests, imaging findings, and outcomes. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify the infectious microorganisms from the abscess samples. The study included 15 patients with oral-maxillofacial abscesses. None of our 15 patients required surgical incision and drainage, although repeat aspiration was required. However, after the first NA, the pain was reportedly extremely relieved for all patients. The average duration of antibiotic treatment was 9.20 ± 5.15 days (range 4–23 days). The abscess-affected spaces mainly included the masseter space and submandibular space. Odontogenic infection was the most common aetiology in 15 patients (10/15). The average volume of the abscesses on CT was 5866.26 ± 3627.18 mm³. The main pathogens identified in this study were Prevotella oris (5/15), Peptostreptococcus stomatis (4/15) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (2/15). According to the results of our study, the data support the use of NA as an effective, minimally invasive treatment modality for oral-maxillofacial abscesses. Surgeons should familiarise themselves with this technique, as it can easily be performed in the clinic using local anaesthesia, culture samples may be obtained, and airway obstruction and pain may be relieved.

### Interleukin-6 deficiency increases inflammatory bone destruction [^114ZvXDL]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Periapical bone destruction occurs as a consequence of pulpal infection. In previous studies, we showed that interleukin-1 (IL-1) is the primary stimulator of bone destruction in this model. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is induced in these infections and has both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. In the present study, we determined the role of IL-6 in regulating IL-1 expression and bone resorption. The first molars of IL-6 knockouts (IL-6(-/-)) and wild-type mice were subjected to surgical pulp exposure and infection with a mixture of four common pulpal pathogens, including Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Streptococcus intermedius. Mice were killed after 21 days, and bone destruction and cytokine expression were determined. Surprisingly, bone destruction was significantly increased in IL-6(-/-) mice versus that in wild-type mice (by 30%; P < 0.001). In a second experiment, the effects of chronic (IL-6(-/-)) IL-6 deficiency and short-term IL-6 deficiency induced by in vivo antibody neutralization were determined. Both IL-6(-/-) (30%; P < 0.001) and anti-IL-6 antibody-treated mice (40%; P < 0.05) exhibited increased periapical bone resorption, compared to wild-type controls. The increased bone resorption in IL-6-deficient animals correlated with increases in osteoclast numbers, as well as with elevated expression of bone-resorptive cytokines IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, in periapical lesions and with decreased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These data demonstrate that endogenous IL-6 expression has significant anti-inflammatory effects in modulating infection-stimulated bone destruction in vivo.

### Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from a glossal abscess in an adolescent [^112U6QUJ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2002). Low credibility.

Glossal abscess is infrequent in children. Anaerobic bacteria are rarely recovered from this infection and never have been reported in children or adolescents. A 15-year-old patient presented with a tongue abscess following trauma. Aspirate of the abscess yielded polymicrobial anaerobic flora: Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus micros. The patient recovered following incision and drainage and 14 days of antimicrobial therapy with clindamycin. This report illustrates the recovery of anaerobic bacteria from glossal abscess in an adolescent.

### Microbial flora and antibiotic resistance in odontogenic abscesses in upstate New York [^116XiokG]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Abscesses in the head and neck frequently have odontogenic sources. As bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance patterns may change over time and based on location, we describe the current common bacteria found in odontogenic abscesses, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance, and differences in each between pediatric and adult patients in Upstate New York. This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent drainage of odontogenic abscesses (n = 131) from 2002 to 2012 at an academic institution. The medical records were reviewed for results of abscess cultures, comorbidities, and drainage procedures. Polymicrobial sources were identified in 60.3% and monomicrobial in 33.6%. Overall, the most common bacteria were alpha hemolytic Streptococci (33.6%), Streptococcus milleri (32.1%), Prevotella (16.8%), and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (14.5%). Candida and Morganella spp were more common in children than in adults. Overall, antibiotic resistance was observed in seven different pathogens. The most common antibiotic resistances were to clindamycin and erythromycin, which should be considered when deciding initial antibiotic therapy, especially in adult patients, who trended in this study toward having pathogens with higher rates of resistance.

### Pleural empyema caused by Streptococcus intermedius and Fusobacterium nucleatum: a distinct entity of pleural infections [^113fqYHb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Oral-Type Pleural Infections and Lung Abscess

Lung abscess and pleural empyema are generally considered separate conditions. However, most lung abscesses contain the same oral pathogens found in OPIs and poor dental health is recognized as a major risk factor. Concurrent lung abscess and pleural empyema has been described in a small proportion of patients in studies of lung abscesses and pleural empyemas.

In the present study, 24 (38%) patients with OPI had radiologic signs of a lung abscess. A likely pathogenesis for the pleural infection in these patients is leakage of bacteria from a ruptured abscess into the pleural cavity. Notably, there were no significant differences between the microbiota of abscess-related empyemas and that of empyemas without radiological evidence of an abscess (Supplementary Figure 2, Supplementary Table 4 B).

We suggest that OPI and lung abscess caused by oral bacteria might represent different, sometimes overlapping, presentations of the same disease. Following hematogenous seeding to a predilection site in the lung, these bacteria establish a purulent infection leading to a consolidation/abscess that can, depending on factors like the proximity to the pleura and the immune status of the patient, erode into the pleural cavity. If bacteria spread directly to a predilection site in the pleura, it might result in an infection without involvement of the lung. This could explain why a significant group of pleural infections have no evidence of concurrent parenchymal infection.

### Molecular profiling of tissue biopsies reveals unique signatures associated with streptococcal necrotizing soft tissue infections [^117TMcH6]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The results of the community profiling support the previously reported prominent role of S. pyogenes in the microbiology of NSTIsas well as the high frequency of streptococcal NSTIs reported in Scandinavia. The pathophysiology of S. pyogenes NSTIs has been extensively explored and many of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms previously described, are supported by our results. Thus, robust expression of adhesion factors such as fibronectin-binding proteins, of factors that enable the bacterium to circumvent the host immune response such as streptococcal inhibitor of complement (Sic), streptococcal C5a peptidase (ScpA), and streptolysin O, as well as of important extracellular proteases such as SpeBwere observed. Adjunct treatment strategies to neutralize some of these factors such as IVIG therapy, which consist of pooled immunoglobulins from human donors have been suggested to limit destructive hyperinflammatory responses in NSTIs. Although IVIG may be beneficial for treatment of S. pyogenes NSTIs, there is no evidence that it can provide therapeutic benefit for polymicrobial NSTIs. Hence, there is a need for new therapeutic approaches that can be given as adjunct therapy for the treatment of polymicrobial NSTIs. In this study, we performed dual RNASeq analysis of human tissue biopsies to gain a more in-depth understanding of the microbial and molecular pathogenesis of NSTIs and to uncover targets for novel treatment strategies. While characterization of the metabolic activity and virulence of S. pyogenes in NSTIs was facilitated by the substantial existing knowledge about its pathogenicity mechanisms, the lack of a reference database of pathogenic factors for several bacteria identified in polymicrobial infections presented a significant limitation for this analysis. To overcome this limitation, we characterized the bacterial gene expression profile using conserved protein domains. We observed that, in contrast to Streptococcus spp. which rely on non-glucose carbohydrates metabolism as previously reported, the expression of genes encoding factors that contribute to amino acid transport and metabolism, as well as peptidolysis were strongly expressed by the polymicrobial communities. This suggests that nutrient acquisition by these bacteria might heavily rely on proteolytic degradation of host proteins as shown for some of the most abundant bacterial genera in polymicrobial NSTIs, Fusobacterium spp. Prevotella spp. and Porphyromonas spp. during periodontitis in the oral cavity. Interestingly, we observed that Porphyromonas spp. contributed disproportionately to the proteolytic potential of the microbial community. This observation supports the theory that synergistic complementation of specialized bacteria might be critical for establishment and progression of polymicrobial NSTIs. Additionally, a robust expression of genes coding for factors that contribute to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis was observed in polymicrobial NSTIs biopsies. This integral component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is a powerful activator of inflammation in the human skin and the underlying tissuesand neutralization of LPS may provide an adjunct therapeutic strategy to decrease inflammation-induced pathology in polymicrobial NSTIs.

### Clindamycin versus unasyn in the treatment of facial cellulitis of odontogenic origin in children [^113rMa82]. Clinical Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

The study was undertaken to characterize the microbiology of dental abscesses in children and to compare clindamycin and ampicillin/sulbactam in the treatment of facial cellulitis of odontogenic origin. Sixty children with acute facial cellulitis of dental origin underwent surgery (extraction or root canal procedure) within 24 hours of presentation. Pus samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam or clindamycin for 48 hours followed by oral amoxicillin/clavulanate or clindamycin for 7 days. A total of 211 bacterial isolates were recovered from 54 samples. The most common aerobic and facultative organisms were viridans streptococci, Neisseria, and Eikenella species. Among anaerobes, Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus species were the most frequent. No treatment failure occurred in either group. Dental abscesses in children are polymicrobial aerobic/anaerobic infections. Treatment of complicated dental infections with ampicillin plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor or clindamycin in combination with surgical drainage is very effective.

### Archaea in the human microbiome and potential effects on human infectious disease [^113aiGv8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Periodontitis

Periodontitis is one of the most common bacterial infections in humans and the 6th most common disease worldwide. It is a complex dysbiotic disease that develops over a longer timeframe and is the consequence of destructive host immune response to pathogenic, biofilm-forming microorganisms. It is characterized by the gradual loss of bone, the development of periodontal pockets, and the progressive decline in tooth function. Untreated periodontitis is recognized as a risk factor for life-threatening systemic diseases, such as endocarditis, atherosclerosis, and stroke. In addition, it is considered a co-factor for preterm birth.

Various microorganisms have been implicated in the onset of periodontitis, including different bacteria (e.g. Tannerella, Treponema, Prevotella, Fusobacterium), and potentially methanogenic archaea. In particular, M. oralis, M. smithii, and M. massiliense were identified in periodontitis patients within subgingival plaques and deep periodontal pockets. It has been shown that M. oralis is more prevalent and abundant in severe periodontitis but was not detected in healthy sites close-by and was not found after healing. Methanogenic archaea can comprise up to 18% of all community members in severe periodontitis.

Archaea have a completely different biology from bacteria. Most of the methods used in microbiology and microbiome research have been developed to optimally study and analyze bacteria, which means archaeal signatures are overlooked in most studies, so knowledge about the involvement of archaea is very limited. To date, the microbiology of periodontitis has been poorly studied and often remains descriptive. The reasons for the development of the various complex stages and disorders, and the influence of therapy and treatment, remain largely unexplored.

### Microbiology and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses [^112E9xSX]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses in children. Predominant anaerobic organisms isolated in peritonsillar, lateral pharyngeal, and retropharyngeal abscesses are Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus spp.; aerobic organisms are group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. Anaerobic bacteria can be isolated from most abscesses whenever appropriate techniques for their cultivation have been used, while S. pyogenes is isolated in only about one third of cases. More than two thirds of deep neck abscesses contain beta-lactamase producing organisms. Management of tonsillar, peritonsillar, and retropharyngeal abscesses is similar. Systemic antimicrobial therapy should be given in large doses whenever the diagnosis is made. However, when pus is formed, antimicrobial therapy is effective only in conjunction with adequate surgical drainage. Untreated abscesses can rupture spontaneously into the pharynx, causing catastrophic aspiration. Other complications are extension of infection laterally to the side of the neck or dissection into the posterior mediastinum through facial planes and the prevertebral space. Death can occur from aspiration, airway obstruction, erosion into major blood vessels, or extension to the mediastinum.

Associations between oral and systemic health are ancient. Oral opportunistic bacteria, particularly, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, have recently been deviated from their traditional roles as periodontal pathogens and arguably ascended to central players based on their participations in complex co-dependent mechanisms of diverse systemic chronic diseases risk and pathogenesis, including cancers, rheumatoid-arthritis, and diabetes.

### Case of a cerebral abscess caused byin a subject with periodontitis [^113xqoXf]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Brain abscesses of odontogenic origin are rarely seen and account for only a small fraction of all reported cerebral abscesses. The incidence of cerebral abscesses ranges from 0.4 to 0.9 cases per 100 000 people and is more frequent in immunocompromised patients. Oral pathogens cause 3–10% of abscesses, while other causative pathogens are non-oral bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi or parasites. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. Contiguous spread of a pathogen is the most frequent route of infection. Haematogenous or lymphatic dissemination is seen in a limited number of cases. The initial presentation, symptoms and results from clinical and radiological investigations vary widely and are non-specific for the causative pathogen. Morbidity and mortality have improved in recent years due to better imaging techniques and therapeutic options. Mortality ranges from 0 to 24% for odontogenic brain abscesses. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative oral pathogen, has rarely been reported in subjects with cerebral abscess formation, but has been widely associated with periodontitis. Its pathogenesis is still being investigated, but includes a wide variety of immunological escape mechanisms.

We searched databases (Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane library) and manually searched reference lists for relevant articles and related cases. Well-accepted reviews served as the foundation for this article. Additional original articles were selected by reading the abstract and obtaining the full text when needed. Search terms included: brain abscess, cerebral abscess, P. gingivalis, odontogenic, periodontitis, parodontitis, tooth infection and oral pathogen. Five articles were selected that discussed intracranial abscess formation by P. gingivalis.

### Optimal specimen type for accurate diagnosis of infectious peripheral pulmonary lesions by mNGS [^112U6XKc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

mNGS was especially useful for detecting fungi in our study: fungal pneumonia was identified in only 1/21 samples by the culture method but in 19/21 samples by mNGS. The 2 patients missed by mNGS included one with cryptococcal pneumonia and one with aspergillus pneumonia; in the latter, the culture and GM test yielded positive results. These results suggest that although the culture-positive rate is low, it is important to combine culture, GM test, and mNGS for the diagnosis of fungal pneumonia to avoid missing a positive sample. Moreover, it should be noted that mNGS is not infallible; for example, it has no advantage for the diagnosis of cryptococcal pneumonia. As demonstrated in the present study, all 4 cases of cryptococcal pneumonia were positive for capsular polysaccharide antigen, but 1 case was missed by mNGS. ROSE also played an important role in the diagnosis of cryptococcal pneumonia: granulomas were found in TBLB specimens from all 4 patients and Cryptococcus was detected in TBLB specimens from 3 of the 4 patients. Therefore, our recommendation for the diagnosis of cryptococcal pneumonia is to test for capsular polysaccharide antigen, while mNGS is unnecessary if cryptococcal pneumonia is highly suspected based on the patient's exposure history, clinical manifestations, imaging findings, and ROSE results.

In terms of detecting bacteria, mNGS still has advantages over culture, although this advantage is not as prominent in fungal detection. P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli were readily detected by culture.; however, some pathogenic bacterial pathogens detected by mNGS, including Nocardia, M. tuberculosis, P. jirovecii, H. parainfluenzae, P. piscolens, and Prevotellacan't be easily detected by culture, which are either fastidious microbes (eg, anaerobes) or require long incubation times (eg, M. tuberculosis). In patient 4, 2 obligate anaerobic bacteria (P. piscolens and Prevotella) were identified and in patient 25, P. piscolens was detected. P. piscolens and Prevotella are usually isolated from the oral cavity of patients with dental pulp disease, periodontal infection, or alveolar abscess as well as from healthy individuals, and are potential causative pathogens of pulp and periodontal diseases; for instance, Prevotella was shown to induce severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia in mice.

### Liver abscess and bacteremia caused by lactobacillus: role of probiotics? Case report and review of the literature [^115bM2CX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lactobacilli are facultative anaerobic, non-spore forming, lactic acid producing, and Gram positive bacilli. They are found in the normal microbiota of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and female genitourinary tract. Although lactobacilli are generally considered non-pathogenic microbes and some of their strains are utilized as probiotics to prevent and treat some infections, they have been implicated in some serious clinical infections including bacteremia, infective endocarditis, intra-abdominal abscess including liver abscess, pancreatic necrosis infection, pulmonary infections, pyelonephritis, meningitis, postpartum endometritis, and chorioamnionitis.

The most common risk factors for lactobacilli infections that have been reported in the literature are diabetes mellitus, pre-existing structural heart disease (in infective endocarditis cases), cancer (especially leukemia), total parenteral nutrition use, broad spectrum antibiotic use, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, chemotherapy, neutropenia, organ transplantation (especially liver transplantation), HIV infection and steroids use. The most common predisposing events are dental manipulation, poor dental hygiene, intravenous drug abuse, abdominal surgery, colonoscopy, probiotics use, and heavy dairy product consumption.

The antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli is variable. The most common regimens that have been used to treat lactobacilli are high dose penicillin and ampicillin with or without aminoglycosides. In a retrospective study of 45 cases of lactobacilli bacteremia, the bacteria were susceptible to ampicillin (100%), penicillin (96%), clindamycin (100%), erythromycin (100%), and gentamycin (67%), with high resistance rate to vancomycin (73% were resistant). Due to rarity of the infections with this microbe, clinical experience and studies are lacking regarding the best antibiotic regimens.

The incidence of serious infections caused by lactobacilli is generally uncommon and rare with liver abscess with only 7 reported cases in the literature. A previous case of liver abscess caused by a lactobacillus strain (indistinguishable from the strain used in food preparation) has been reported. In that case, there was a four month history of excessive dairy products consumption before the development of liver abscess with no use of probiotics. The association between liver abscess and use of probiotics containing lactobacilli has not been reported previously.

In this paper, we describe a case of liver abscess due to lactobacillus strain in an elderly diabetic woman with end stage renal disease after using probiotics containing lactobacilli in a course of treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis and review the literature. We followed CARE reporting guidelines in publishing our case report.

### Pathogenic bacterial species associated with endodontic infection evade innate immune control by disabling neutrophils [^114xwJEP]. Infection and Immunity (2014). Low credibility.

Endodontic infections, in which oral bacteria access the tooth pulp chamber, are common and do not resolve once established. To investigate the effects of these infections on the innate immune response, we established a mouse subcutaneous chamber model, where a mixture of four oral pathogens commonly associated with these infections (endodontic pathogens [EP]), i.e. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus intermedius, Parvimonas micra, and Prevotella intermedia, was inoculated into subcutaneously implanted titanium chambers. Cells that infiltrated the chamber after these infections were primarily neutrophils; however, these neutrophils were unable to control the infection. Infection with a nonpathogenic oral bacterial species, Streptococcus mitis, resulted in well-controlled infection, with bacterial numbers reduced by 4 to 5 log units after 7 days. Propidium iodide (PI) staining of the chamber neutrophils identified three distinct populations: neutrophils from EP-infected chambers were intermediate in PI staining, while cells in chambers from mice infected with S. mitis were PI positive (apoptotic) or negative (live). Strikingly, neutrophils from EP-infected chambers were severely impaired in their ability to phagocytose and to generate reactive oxygen species in vitro after removal from the chamber compared to cells from S. mitis-infected chambers. The mechanism of neutrophil impairment was necrotic cell death as determined by morphological analyses. P. intermedia alone could induce a similar neutrophil phenotype. We conclude that the endodontic pathogens, particularly P. intermedia, can efficiently disable and kill infiltrating neutrophils, allowing these infections to become established. These results can help explain the persistence of endodontic infections and demonstrate a new virulence mechanism associated with P. intermedia.

### The butterfly effect: collateral damage and impacts of antimicrobial strategies on the oral microbiome [^113LnumY]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

(Anti- and Pro-) Biotic Interventions

Antibiotics are chemical agents produced by fungal or bacterial species designed to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. Scientific evidence implies that antibiotics have been unwittingly used for thousands of years, since the time of the ancient Egyptians. Traces of tetracyclines (a form of antibiotics) have been identified in the bones extracted from these ancient populations. In the modern day, following the inception of the first identified antibiotic, Penicillin in 1918 by Sir Alexander Fleming, these antimicrobial agents are pivotal in managing bacterial infections across medical disciplines, including dentistry. In oral healthcare, antibiotics are often used for therapeutic interventions, particularly in severe infections such as periodontal abscesses. For many years, prophylactic antibiotics were also administered during dental therapy for preventing systemic complications such as IE in susceptible patients; however, in the UK such usage is seldom recommended in a routine manner anymore.

Of the antibiotics used in oral care, many are broad-spectrum, with amoxicillin being the most common prescribed by dentists, often to target mixed-species or undiagnosed infections due to its indiscriminatory antimicrobial activity. Some narrow-spectrum antibiotics, reserved for known pathogens, offer a focused approach that minimizes impact on non-target commensal bacteria. These provide important interventions for dental abscesses and severe cases of periodontitis, through targeting gram-negative anaerobic bacteria associated with such diseases. Nevertheless, metronidazole is the most common antibiotic prescribed in primary care suggestive that it is the often the go-to prescription for general dentists, regardless of disease severity. Metronidazole is a prodrug, meaning it requires activation by bacterial species in anaerobic microenvironments. The activation occurs via reduction of the -NO 2 group on the metronidazole molecule by microbial enzymes such as pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase to exert its antimicrobial effects. This tends to only arise in oxygen deplete environments such as those deep within the periodontal pockets. Generation of nitrogen radicals produced during the reduction process leads to cytotoxicity exerted on targeted cells, including DNA damage through interference with the helical structure of the nucleic material. Such reductase enzymatic systems are found in oral bacterial pathogens such as P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, and T. forsythia, but absent from aerobic commensal species, thus providing an ideal drug candidate for targeted therapy. Further to its antimicrobial activity, metronidazole can also potentiate immune responses during anaerobic bacterial infections.

### Odontogenic orofacial infections [^113bNp7S]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Acute dental abscess is a frequent and sometimes underestimated disease of the oral cavity. The acute dental abscess usually occurs secondary to caries, trauma, or failed endodontic treatment. After the intact pulp chamber is opened, colonization of the root canals takes place with a variable set of anaerobic bacteria, which colonize the walls of the necrotic root canals forming a specialized mixed anaerobic biofilm. Asymptomatic necrosis is common. However, abscess formation occurs when these bacteria and their toxic products breach into the periapical tissues through the apical foramen and induce acute inflammation and pus formation. The main signs and symptoms of the acute dental abscess (often referred to as a periapical abscess or infection) are pain, swelling, erythema, and suppuration usually localized to the affected tooth, even if the abscess can eventually spread causing a severe odontogenic infection which is characterized by local and systemic involvement culminating in sepsis syndrome. The vast majority of dental abscesses respond to antibiotic treatment, however, in some patients surgical management of the infection may be indicated. In the present work, a retrospective analysis of the patients with dental orofacial infections referred to the Unit of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery of the University of Verona from 1991 to 2011 has been performed.

### Diagnostic performance of the metagenomic next-generation sequencing in lung biopsy tissues in patients suspected of having a local pulmonary infection [^111XPeqB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In our study, the positive mNGS detection rate was higher than the traditional detection methods (67.7% vs 29.0%, p < 0.05) in lung abscess. Anaerobic coinfection with Streptococcus constellatus and monomicrobial with Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most commonly detected pathogens. The most commonly detected anaerobes were Porphyromonas endodontalis, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra and Treponema lecithinolyticum. One research reported that in the lung abscess the predominant isolates of anaerobic bacteria were gram-negative Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium capsulatum and necrophorum, gram-positive anaerobic Peptostreptococcus and microearophillic streptococci. We consider that the detected different pathogens may result in different duration of disease, initial empiric antibiotic therapy, etc. A similar result is found in mixed infections in lung abscess. Mixed infections have been recognized as being vital in the pathogenesis of lung abscess, and have been reported in 21–50% of cases. In the present study, mNGS detected mixed infections among 10 (10/22) cases. When mNGS and CE were compared, the conventional examination only found a single pathogen in 5 out of 10 of mixed infections.

### Molecular profiling of tissue biopsies reveals unique signatures associated with streptococcal necrotizing soft tissue infections [^116EYBXf]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The composition of bacterial communities in polymicrobial NSTIs was highly variable, but Prevotella spp. Porphyromonas spp. Parvimonas spp. Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroides spp. were most frequently observed in high abundances (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Figures 2–7). Surprisingly, we observed extreme differences in the species level diversity within these highly abundant bacterial genera. Whereas the Bacteroides spp. abundance was dominated by B. fragilis, which was previously characterized as a keystone pathogenand accounted for 78.5% of the total genus abundance, no single key species was observed among the other genera, with seven species accounting for 80% of the Prevotella genus abundance (Supplementary Figure 1).

To characterize microbial interactions within NSTIs, we inferred bacterial co-occurrence patterns of bacterial genera using CoNet, an ensemble method of network analysis. We observed significant negative associations between pathogens causing monomicrobial NSTIs such as Streptococcus spp. and the taxonomically diverse genera detected in polymicrobial NSTIs (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Data 4). Using divisive clustering of co-occurring genera (see Methods), highly interconnected clusters of bacterial genera associated with polymicrobial NSTIs were identified (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Figure 8a), suggesting that these microorganisms may act in concert to establish NSTIs.

Consistent with clinical reports, the diversity and composition of the bacterial communities in the infected tissue were highly dependent on the affected anatomic location (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 1). Thus, the bacterial diversity in NSTIs of the upper and lower extremities was significantly lower than in NSTIs localized at the head/neck or anogenital region indicating a higher frequency of polymicrobial infections in the latter (Fig. 1c). Concomitantly, we observed significantly higher abundances of gastrointestinal Bacteroides spp. in anogenital infections than at the extremities, while the predominately oral genera Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium exhibited significantly increased abundances in infections of the head/neck area (Table 2). These observations highlight a potential connection between bacterial community composition in NSTIs and natural niches-associated commensals.

### Lemierre syndrome: a diagnostic dilemma of critical care in the post-COVID era [^113DNyQk]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Lemierre syndrome (LS) is referred to as the 'forgotten Disease' owing to its rarity in the postantibiotic era with an estimated yearly incidence of 1/million population. The classic triad of LS includes internal jugular vein thrombosis, oropharyngeal infection and metastatic septic emboli. We present a case of typical LS with Fusobacterium and Prevotella infection, presenting with peritonsillar abscess and jugular vein thrombosis complicated by sepsis, acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to multiple pulmonary emboli and severe thrombocytopaenia in the absence of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

### Prevotella intermedia synergistically exacerbates pneumonia induced by oral streptococci [^114sFaH5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The lungs are exposed to numerous microbes through transmissible infections, microaspiration, or direct mucosal translocation of oral bacteria. Aspiration pneumonia is a significant concern in elderly individuals, and the importance of oral care for preventing pneumonia has recently attracted increasing attention. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that poor oral hygiene is associated with respiratory infection. Analysis of the bacterial microbiota in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) has revealed the presence of oral streptococci in patients with aspiration pneumonia. Although sputum culture is considered the gold standard for identifying the causative bacteria of pneumonia, it cannot be applied to detect anaerobes because the sputum is obtained via the oral cavity, which contains numerous anaerobes and may contaminate the specimen. The limitations of this method have obscured the importance of anaerobes in pneumonia. Previous clinical studies with 16S rRNA analysis of BALF suggest that anaerobes play a significant role in pneumonia in patients with mixed infections with oral streptococci.

Prevotella intermedia is an obligate anaerobe present in periodontal pockets that causes periodontal disease. Furthermore, elderly individuals with a higher relative abundance of oral Prevotella spp have an unfavorable prognosis for pneumonia as compared with those with high levels of Fusobacterium spp. NucD and NucA, which are nucleases produced by P intermedia, may break down the DNA matrix that forms neutrophil extracellular traps, one of the bacterial defense mechanisms of neutrophils, potentially allowing the bacteria to evade this immune defense mechanism.

Streptococcus anginosus is a commensal oral streptococcus that is commonly found in the oral cavity and is a facultative pathogen. S anginosus is rarely a cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A previous study showed that P intermedia worsened pneumonia caused by oral streptococci in a mouse model. Specifically, although the bacterial burden of P intermedia in the lungs did not increase in the mixed infection group, the bacterial burden of oral streptococci was significantly higher as compared with mice infected with oral streptococci alone. P intermedia may not be the primary cause of infection but could facilitate infection caused by oral streptococci.

We investigated how P intermedia intensified pneumonia caused by oral streptococci, which are considered commensal bacteria in the oral cavity.

### Antibiotic therapy in necrotizing soft tissue infections: a narrative review of the greater paris SURFAST consortium [^112ACsUT]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Face and neck

Within the spectrum of NSTIs, head and neck involvement is rare. A literature review conducted in 2017 compiled 1,235 case reports. The most common portals of entry are odontogenic (47%), pharyngo-laryngeal (28%), tonsillar/peritonsillar (6%), traumatic/iatrogenic/postoperative (5%), salivary gland (2%), skin (1.7%) or unidentified (9%). In addition to the above risk factors, poor oral and dental hygiene are also frequently reported.

These infections are typically polymicrobial, with frequent involvement of streptococci (55–60%) and staphylococci (15–20%). Anaerobic bacteria are identified in 20–30% of cases, although probably underestimated by their difficult growth, with Prevotella spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. being the most commonly isolated. Enterobacterales are identified in less than 5% of cases.

Initial antibiotic therapy is outlined in Fig. 3. The choice of initial empiric therapy depends on (i) the risk of multidrug resistance (ESBL-E, MRSA), (ii) β-lactam allergy, and (iii) signs of sepsis or septic shock.

### Microflora in maxillofacial infections – a changing scenario? [^114PTEoZ]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. Recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. A prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims.

Patients and Methods

This study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics.

Results

Upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. Streptococcus and Peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. On determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and 18.8% were resistant. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin.

Conclusion

Analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.

### Suppurative thyroiditis: a management paradigm based on microbiology [^1131CQ8X]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine if microbiological cultures can guide management of suppurative thyroiditis.

Design

This study is a retrospective case series set in 2 tertiary care academic hospitals.

Methods

The microbiological cultures from patients with suppurative thyroiditis who underwent incision and drainage from July 2004 to June 2018 were reviewed. Those who had confirmed pyriform sinus tracts and underwent surgical intervention were included in the study.

Results

Fifteen patients satisfied the criteria for inclusion. All had confirmed pyriform sinus tracts and underwent successful intervention. Endoscopic cautery was the most common intervention followed by complete open excision. Five cultures grew alpha Streptococcus, 6 had Eikenella, and 4 Prevotella. Combinations of Eikenella + Prevotella were seen in 3, and 1 sample had all 3 bacteria. Two cultured methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus alone. One culture was sterile.

Conclusions

The presence of oral flora in an intrathyroidal abscess is confirmatory evidence of a pyriform sinus tract. Further investigations are not needed, and early definitive intervention can be planned.

### Oral infections and antibiotic therapy [^112tpWpn]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Oral infections commonly originate from an odontogenic source in adults and from tonsil and lymphatic sources in children. Odontogenic infections arise from advanced dental caries or periodontal disease. Oral trauma, radiation injury, chemotherapy mucositis, salivary gland infection, lymph node abscess, and postoperative infection are potential nonodontogenic sources of infections that could potentially be life threatening. This article reviews the serious nature and potential danger that exists from oral infection and the antibiotics available to treat them are reviewed. Successful treatment requires an understanding of the microflora, the regional anatomy, the disease process, the treatment methods available, and interdisciplinary team collaboration.

### Anaerobic pulmonary infections in children [^1165QHB7]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2004). Low credibility.

Pulmonary infections due to anaerobic bacteria usually occur in children prone to aspiration. The source of the anaerobic bacteria is the oropharyngeal bacterial flora, where these organisms outnumber aerobic and facultative organisms in a 10:1 ratio. The most common lower respiratory tract infections where anaerobic bacteria are recovered mixed with aerobic organisms are aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, and empyema. The predominant isolated anaerobic bacteria are Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, pigmented Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp. and Bacteroides fragilis group. Management of these infections includes the administration of antimicrobials effective against the anaerobic as well as the aerobic pathogens.

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a case of cervical abscess extending to anterior mediastinum, with isolation of… [^112wuPeA]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

We present a case of an odontogenic abscess, first spreading at the lateral cervical level and then in mediastinum. We isolated an anaerobic bacterium, Prevotella corporis, rarely documented in literature. The mortality rates of cervical abscesses secondary to odontogenic infections and complicated by mediastinitis vary from 10% to 40%. Treatment of descending mediastinitis involves multidisciplinary teams such as otorhinolaryngology, thoracic surgeons, infectious disease physicians, anesthetists and intensivists. Due to the combined treatment with surgical drainage within 48 hours of hospitalisation, antibiotics and subsequent hyperbaric oxygen therapy, we have achieved complete recovery of the patient.

### Prevotella intermedia synergistically exacerbates pneumonia induced by oral streptococci [^114c3dVs]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The precise mechanisms of respiratory infection caused by oral anaerobic bacteria remain elusive. Unexpectedly, bacterial microbiota analysis using 16S rRNA revealed "hidden" mixed infections of anaerobic bacteria and commensal oral Streptococcus species in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which Prevotella intermedia exacerbates oral streptococcal pneumonia.

Methods

Oral streptococci were oropharyngeally administered with the culture supernatants of P. intermedia (PiSup) in mice to assess survival, microbial burden, inflammatory responses, and host response using unbiased bulk RNA sequencing. Additionally, genetically engineered strains of P. intermedia were used to identify pathogenic factors.

Results

Seven-week-old female C57BL/6J mice treated with the combination of Streptococcus spp. and PiSup exhibited significantly worse survival and increased microbial burden in the lungs and spleen compared to Streptococcus spp. and control medium. RNA sequencing of whole lung revealed disruption of neutrophilic bactericidal activity due to NADP downregulation, accompanied by reduced myeloperoxidase production in mixed infections, leading to dysfunctional neutrophil accumulation in the lungs. Notably, PiSup from strains bearing mutations in the type IX secretion pathway (ΔporT or ΔporK) failed to worsen the mixed infection.

Conclusions

Prevotella intermedia exacerbates pneumonia caused by commensal oral streptococci by inducing neutrophilic dysfunction in mixed infection. Products of type IX secretion system should be investigated as novel targets independent of reported virulence factors.

Abnormal nitric oxide (NO) synthesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus. In diabetic patients, increased inducible NO synthase in inflamed gingiva correlated with NO in gingival crevicular fluid. Although increased NO reflected more-severe inflammation, it was associated with reductions in CFU of Prevotella intermedia, a major periodontopathogen, highlighting dual roles for NO.

Comparative Analyses of Microbiology Data

To further investigate the potential role of hematogenous seeding of bacteria from a dental focus in the etiology of OPI, we compared microbiological findings from this study with previous results from studies of the microbiology of dental infections, bacteremia following extraction of infected teeth, and the microbiology of brain abscesses. Data on the microbiota of 66 oral-sinus–derived brain abscesses were extracted from the 4 available studies that have used metagenomic approaches in the characterization of such infections (Supplementary Table 1). To define the most common bacteria in periapical tooth abscesses and severe periodontitis, we used data from 1 review and 2 research papers. Data on bacteremia in relation to the treatment of dental infections were gathered from multiple publications.

Statistical Analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using the R programming language version 2022.12.0+353. For qualitative values, baseline characteristics of patients with OPI and non-OPI were compared using a t test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Quantitative values were tested for normality using a Quantile Quantile Plot and the Shapiro-Wilk test and compared using Mann-Whitney U test or unpaired t test, as appropriate. Phylogenetic and diversity analyses were performed using the R-package "phyloseq" version 1.42.0. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was performed using the "adonis2" function in the R-package "vegan" version 2.6–4. The figure comparing phylogenies of OPIs and brain abscesses was produced using the R-package "ggtree" version 3.6.2. For neighbor-joining tree estimations of UniFrac analysis we used the R-package "ape" version 5.7. Visualizations of phylogenetic trees were produced using the online tool "Interactive Tree of Life".

Human bite wound infections — pathogens and diagnostic considerations note that The human oral cavity contains many potential aerobic and anaerobic pathogens and is the primary source of pathogens that cause infections following human bites. Relevant bacteria include Eikenella, S. aureus, group A Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp., in addition to human skin microbiota (staphylococci, streptococci), with other less common pathogens from the HACEK group (Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; Capnocytophaga, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella spp.). Viral pathogens of importance include hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, and HSV. For patients with clinically uninfected bite wounds, cultures are not indicated due to the lack of correlation with subsequent infection, whereas It is important that a Gram stain be performed on the specimen to assess the presence of indicators of inflammation (eg, neutrophils), superficial contamination (squamous epithelial cells).

### Periodontal pathogens produce quorum sensing signal molecules [^111hs4va]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Different species of bacteria important in the composition of dental plaque were tested for production of extracellular autoinducer-like activities that stimulate the expression of the luminescence genes in Vibrio harveyi. Several strains of Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were found to produce such activities. Interestingly, these bacteria belong to the same phylogenetic group, and they are periodontal pathogens important in the development of periodontal disease. They specifically produce extracellular signaling molecule related autoinducer-2 from V. haveyi. Nevertheless, they seem to be unable to produce homologues of acyl-homoserine lactones. Furthermore, Escherichia coli DH5alpha can be complemented by the introduction of a P. gingivalis gene with high homology to the luxS gene, which has been called luxS(P.g.).

Treatment of underlying cause — The management of oral problems should primarily involve treatment of the underlying cause (with appropriate symptom control) (Category of guideline – suggestion; Level of evidence — V). Many oral problems have potentially treatable underlying causes. For example, halitosis may be the result of periodontal disease, and non-specific measures to manage halitosis may not resolve this problem. Additionally, uncontrolled periodontal disease may progress to cause important complications such as local infection (abscess), systemic infection (pneumonia), and/or loss of dentition.

### Selenomonas sputigena acts as a pathobiont mediating spatial structure and biofilm virulence in early childhood caries [^114qCskm]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Overview of methods employed in the study.

Overview of the design of the multi-method, discovery-validation experimental approach employed in the present investigation.

Our data highlight Selenomonas sputigena, Prevotella salivae and Leptotrichia wadei as species with previously unrecognized roles in supragingival biofilms, with functional repertoires and interactions relevant to the pathogenesis of a prevalent childhood dysbiotic disease. We unexpectedly find that the flagellated, gram-negative anaerobic bacterium S. sputigena, found in saliva and commonly reported as member of the periodontal niche microbiome, has a significant role in the supragingival biofilm microbiome and is strongly associated with childhood dental caries. Here, we show that the motile S. sputigena becomes trapped into extracellular glucan-matrix produced by S. mutans, loses its motility, but rapidly proliferates to form a multicellular honeycomb-like scaffold that wraps the streptococcal cell clusters and results in enhanced acid production — a key virulence factor in dental caries. We verify experimentally that, although S. sputigena alone does not cause caries, it significantly increases disease severity when co-infected with S. mutans causing extensive cavitation of tooth enamel in a rodent model. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel pathobiont capable of unique spatial structuring and interspecies cooperation that enhances biofilm virulence — a phenomenon that substantially improves our understanding of childhood dental disease pathogenesis and may have implications for established pathogen and pathobiont interactions in other polymicrobial infections.

Dentoalveolar infections represent a wide spectrum of conditions, from simple localized abscesses to deep neck space infections. The initial assessment of the patient with a dentoalveolar infection requires considerable clinical skill and experience, and determines the need for further airway management or emergent surgical therapy. Knowledge of head and neck fascial space anatomy is essential in diagnosing, understanding spread, and surgically managing these infections. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons must make use of their wide spectrum of clinical skill and knowledge to effectively evaluate and treat patients with dentoalveolar infections.

### Unveiling the intricate link between anaerobe niche and Alzheimer disease pathogenesis [^113ndAhJ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Dysbiosis within microbiomes has been increasingly implicated in many systemic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, respiratory infections, and Alzheimer disease (Ad). The correlation between Ad and microbial dysbiosis has been repeatedly shown, yet the etiologic cause of microbial dysbiosis remains elusive. From a neuropathology perspective, abnormal (often age-related) changes in the brain, associated structures, and bodily lumens tend toward an accumulation of oxygen-depleted pathologic structures, which are anaerobically selective niches. These anaerobic environments may promote progressive change in the microbial community proximal to the brain and thus deserve further investigation. In this review, we identify and explore what is known about the anaerobic niche near or associated with the brain and the anaerobes that it is harbors. We identify the anaerobe stakeholders within microbiome communities and the impacts on the neurodegenerative processes associated with Ad. Chronic oral dysbiosis in anaerobic dental pockets and the composition of the gut microbiota from fecal stool are the 2 largest anaerobic niche sources of bacterial transference to the brain. At the blood-brain barrier, cerebral atherosclerotic plaques are predominated by anaerobic species intimately associated with the brain vasculature. Focal cerebritis/brain abscess and corpora amylacea may also establish chronic anaerobic niches in direct proximity to brain parenchyma. In exploring the anaerobic niche proximal to the brain, we identify research opportunities to explore potential sources of microbial dysbiosis associated with Ad.

### Analysis of host-pathogen gene association networks reveals patient-specific response to streptococcal and polymicrobial necrotising soft tissue infections [^115HXEXs]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Necrotising soft tissue infections (NSTI) are devastating bacterial infections characterised by impairment and injury in any layer of the soft tissue compartment, extending from the epidermis to the deep musculature. These infections are relatively rare (0.2 to 15.5 per 100,000 people/year) but their aggressive nature poses severe threats due to the high risk of mortality and long-term disability which often results from the extensive tissue loss and amputations often prescribed to control the infections due to the fact that progression is rapid, and early diagnosis is vital for improving the prognosis of affected patients.

NSTIs can be caused by either a single bacterial species (monomicrobial NSTI, or Type 2 NSTI) or by multiple species (polymicrobial NSTI, or Type 1 NSTI), and the relative occurrence of the two types of NSTI differs significantly based on the geography and patient characteristics.

Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common pathogen in monomicrobial NSTIs, but other streptococcal species and Staphylococcus aureus are also known to cause monomicrobial NSTIs. In this study, we only focus on type 2 NSTI caused by S. pyogenes, as well as polymicrobial NSTIs that are associated with a mixture of obligate anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria, such as Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides spp. Porphyromonas spp. Prevotella spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and Clostridium spp.

Monomicrobial NSTIs caused by S. pyogenes have been studied extensively and many of the virulence factors and toxins expressed by the bacterium to colonise the host tissue and bypass the host immune defences have been characterised. In contrast, the pathogenic strategies and the complex dynamics of bacterial communities underlying polymicrobial NSTIs are poorly understood. One of the major limitations in our understanding of NSTI at the molecular level (and of bacterial infections in general) is the insufficient information about the web of molecular interaction, also known as interactome, between pathogens and the human host. In contrast with Mendelian diseases, where one or few genes can be directly linked to the disease, bacterial infections arise from the complex interactions between bacteria, the host immune system, predisposition, risk and environmental factors.

### Characterizing dysbiosis of gut microbiome in PD: evidence for overabundance of opportunistic pathogens [^113LHvgU]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Functional characteristics

Analyses so far were all hypothesis-free, data-driven, and blind to the functional relevance of the microorganisms. Having identified the associations and their corresponding clusters, we broke the blind by searching PubMed. PubMed results on functional characteristics converged on clusters defined by agnostic network analysis.

PubMed results suggest genera in cluster 1 are opportunistic pathogens. Porphyromonas and Prevotella are anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria with lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins) in their outer membrane. They are commensal to the human gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. Corynebacterium are aerobic, Gram-positive, and have a higher abundance in the skin microbiota than the gut. Although commensal and often harmless, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Corynebacterium are opportunistic pathogens capable of causing infections in immune-compromised individuals or if they gain access to sterile sites via compromised membranes, post surgery, bites, or wounds –.

### Analysis of the distribution characteristics of infecting microorganisms in the wound tissue of patients with perianal abscess combined with infection and the influencing factors of wound healing [^112V2Ey3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The gut microbiota, as the largest microecological system in the human body, plays an important role in maintaining intestinal health and regulating immune function. Recent studies have shown that intestinal flora imbalance is closely related to the occurrence and development of a variety of infectious diseases, including perianal abscess and other extraintestinal infectious diseases. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota may lead to the overgrowth of certain harmful bacteria, which spread to perianal tissues through blood, lymphatic, and other pathways, causing infection and forming abscesses. Another point to consider, gut microbiota also plays an important role in the wound healing process. A healthy gut microbiota can promote the absorption and utilization of nutrients, providing necessary energy and materials for wound healing. Meanwhile, gut microbiota can also regulate the local immune environment, inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria, reduce the risk of infection, and promote wound healing. Therefore, when exploring the distribution characteristics of infecting microorganisms in wound tissues of patients with perianal abscess complicated with infection and the influencing factors of wound healing, the role of gut microbiota cannot be ignored. For patients with perianal abscess, dysbiosis of gut microbiota may lead to excessive growth of harmful bacteria and spread to perianal tissues through blood, lymphatic and other pathways, causing infection. In addition, changes in the immune microenvironment may also affect the wound healing process. Future research can further explore the mechanisms of gut microbiota and immune microenvironment in perianal abscess and wound healing, as well as how to promote wound healing by regulating gut microbiota and immune microenvironment. This will provide new ideas and methods for clinical treatment, and provide scientific basis for the development of new treatment methods.

Intervention measures: keep the wound clean and dry, change the dressing regularly, and avoid contamination of the wound by feces and other pollutants; ensure that patients consume enough nutrients, especially protein, vitamins and minerals, which can be achieved by adjusting the dietary structure and increasing the nutritional supplements; and control the blood glucose in the normal range by oral hypoglycemic drugs or injecting insulin. Enhancing the patient's immunity through appropriate exercise, rest and maintaining a good state of mind will help fight infection and promote wound healing. Once perianal abscess or constipation/diarrhea occurs, consult a doctor and take medication as prescribed by the doctor to avoid self-abuse of medication or delay in treatment. Active control of infection is the key to wound healing, and appropriate antibiotics should be selected according to the type of infecting microorganisms and the results of drug sensitivity test for treatment.

The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. However, infection of the salivary glands can occur in any of the glands. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial infection are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include: anaerobic Gram negative bacilli (eg, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas); Fusobacterium spp; and Peptostreptococcus spp. In addition, Streptococcus spp (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) and aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have been reported. Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Haemophilus influenzae, Treponema pallidum, Bartonella henselae, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of infection. The choice of antibiotics should be guided by identification of the etiologic agent.

Oral Microbiota

Previously, 2 literature reviews, investigated potential links between oral microbiota and AMD, with a particular focus on periodontal disease. Periodontal disease (and its more serious form called periodontitis) is an inflammatory disease triggered by several bacteria in dental plaque.

Briefly, 6 human studies with variable methodologies, investigated potential associations between various symptoms related to periodontal disease (fewer teeth, alveolar bone loss, presence of periodontal pockets, clinical attachment level, gingival index, periodontitis, etc) and AMD. Although a small case-control study found no associations between these symptoms and AMD,4 cross-sectional studies with larger sample sizes, highlighted a greater frequency of these symptoms among AMD cases compared to controls. Notably, in 2 of these studies, significant associations were restricted to a subgroup of participants < 60 years of age. Moreover, one population-based cohort study based on a Health Insurance databaseshowed an increased risk to develop AMD among subjects with prevalent periodontitis. Karesvuo et alalso investigated the salivary presence of 6 pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Tannerella forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, and Treponema denticola) in 54 self-reported AMD cases and 1697 controls but failed to find any difference in prevalence of bacterial DNA in the saliva between the 2 groups. More recently, a Canadian study(previously described in the paragraph on nasal microbiota) highlighted that 13 oral bacterial communities had an increased relative abundance in neovascular AMD cases (n = 13) compared to controls (n = 5), using 16s ribosomal RNA sequencing. Among these, the authors cited the Rothia genus (13-fold higher; P = 3.63E-18), the Propionibacteriales family (eightfold higher; P = 6.74E-09), the Staphylococcus species (sevenfold higher; P = 6.96E-05), and the Cornyebacteriaceae genus (sevenfold higher; P = 2.33E-05). Only the Fusobacterium genus (10-fold lower; P = 1.00E-10) and the Bacilli class (threefold lower; P = 0.007) had a decreased relative abundance in cases compared to controls.

### A family of anti-bacteroidales peptide toxins wide-spread in the human gut microbiota [^1165Dta1]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Bacteria often produce antimicrobial toxins to compete in microbial communities. Here we identify a family of broad-spectrum peptide toxins, named bacteroidetocins, produced by Bacteroidetes species. We study this toxin family using phenotypic, mutational, bioinformatic, and human metagenomic analyses. Bacteroidetocins are related to class IIa bacteriocins of Gram-positive bacteria and kill members of the Bacteroidetes phylum, including Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Prevotella gut species, as well as pathogenic Prevotella species. The bacteroidetocin biosynthesis genes are found in horizontally acquired mobile elements, which likely allow dissemination within the gut microbiota and may explain their wide distribution in human populations. Bacteroidetocins may have potential applications in microbiome engineering and as therapeutics for polymicrobial diseases such as bacterial vaginosis and periodontal disease.

Lung abscess

31 cases in our study were diagnosed as lung abscess. The average symptom duration before admission was 97.1 days. Male patients accounted for 80.6%. 22 cases had a definitely proven presence of microorganisms, while false-positive was detected in 1 case only. In this false-positive case, mNGS detected Aspergillus fumigatus, while the patient's condition improved gradually without the administration of anti-fungal therapy, so Aspergillus fumigatus was considered as a colonization. The detection rate in identifying the pathogen was 67.7% (21/31) with mNGS compared to 29.0% (9/31) with CE, and this comparison in favour of mNGS had statistical significance (p ˂0.05). Polymicrobial infections were found in 10 cases, the most common pathogens were anaerobic species coexisted with Streptococcus constellatus. The most frequently isolated anaerobes were Porphyromonas endodontalis, followed by Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra and Treponema lecithinolyticum. The most common monomicrobial infection was Klebsiella pneumoniae. Details are showed in Table 4.

### Role of oral pathogens in the pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysm: review of existing evidence and potential mechanisms [^112FnqUE]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Besides the infiltration of inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, activation of the complement system is involved in IA wall degeneration and rupture. It has been shown earlier that periodontal bacteria can dysregulate complement activity in vitro by binding to or degenerating complement factors. Of periodontal pathogens, specific strains of Prevotella intermedia (PI) and P. gingivalis participate in complement activation by binding factor H and C4bp respectively. Treponema denticola (TD) and A. actinomycetemcomitans, common periodontal pathogens, have ability to bind factor H. These bacteria do not only dysregulate complement activity but also evade complement-mediated killing in response of binding factor H. It is noteworthy that DNA of both P. intermedia and T. denticola have been identified in some of ruptured IAs. Interestingly, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and Tannerella forsythia (TF) are capable of evading complement-mediated killing by altering complement activity and degenerating complement factors via their bacterial proteases, while protecting other bystander-bacteria. This ability of periodontal bacteria to activate complement while evading complement-mediated killing may in part explain the complement activation seen in the IA wall in association with IA wall degeneration.

In addition to the mechanisms described above, periodontal bacteria may also trigger IA wall degeneration via endothelial dysfunction, which seems to be one of the key events that triggers the lipid accumulation, luminal thrombosis, and inflammation that associate with the IA wall degeneration. A recent meta-analysis concluded that periodontal bacteria predispose to endothelial dysfunction. Moreover, endothelial dysfunction improves with periodontal treatment. Endothelial dysfunction can be at least in part caused by bacterial burden of periodontitis and furthermore, endothelial dysfunction could explain why periodontal bacteria are often found in the sites of vascular diseases, e.g. IA walls and atheromas. Interestingly, periodontitis patients also have higher concentration of circulating oxidized LDL particles in the blood, another mechanism more through which periodontitis can accelerate local atherosclerotic remodeling in the IA wall.

### HIV-associated changes in the enteric microbial community: potential role in loss of homeostasis and development of systemic inflammation [^1147gAsm]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Taxa in the phylum Bacteroidetes, including the families Prevotellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Rikenellaceae, exhibited a more heterogeneous pattern of changes in HIV-infected individuals. The family Prevotellaceae (most frequently driven by its constituent genus Prevotella) was enriched in HIV-infected individuals in seven of 16 studies and depleted in one study. Taxa within the family Prevotellaceae have been associated with inflammation (particularly in the context of autoinflammatory disease) and activation of gut dendritic cells, but a greater abundance of Prevotellaceae is also characteristic of the baseline enteric microbial community of healthy individuals in developing world countries such as Burkina Faso, Venezuela, Malawi, or Papua New Guinea. Taxa from the family Porphyromonadaceae (most frequently driven by the genera Barnesiella or Odoribacter) were generally depleted in HIV-infected individuals, exhibiting a decrease in nine of 16 studies and an increase in two studies. Independent of HIV, Porphyromonadaceae exhibit a diverse and complex array of functions, with both positive and negative associations with colorectal cancer, and negative associations with C. difficile, Salmonella, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and Citrobacter rodentium infection that imply a putative protective role. The family Bacteroidaceae (mostly driven by the abundance of the genus Bacteroides) is overall depleted in HIV infection, showing a reduced HIV-associated abundance in 10 of 16 studies. This family is generally considered to play an anti-inflammatory role, with the species Bacteroides fragilis promoting regulatory T-cell differentiation and IL-10 production via secreted bacterial products. The family Rikenellaceae (mostly driven by the abundance of the genus Alistipes) is also depleted in HIV infection, with decreased abundance in seven studies and this bile-tolerant family displays protective properties against C. difficile infection and a negative association with obesity as well as positive associations with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Case of a cerebral abscess caused byin a subject with periodontitis [^11246T3A]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

We report the case of a 65-year-old man presenting with generalised seizures after developing a right frontal brain abscess. Stereotactic aspiration and subsequent matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight analyzer (MALDI-TOF) spectrometry revealed Porphyromonas gingivalis as the only causative anaerobe microorganism. Secondary incision and drainage was required due to neurological deterioration with increased dimensions of the abscess, intracranial pressure and formation of a subdural occipitoparietal empyema. Oral imaging was positive for apical periodontitis of multiple elements; therefore, the remaining dentition was removed. Targeted antibiotic treatment included intravenous ceftriaxone and ornidazole. The patient was discharged to our revalidation unit 59days after admission to make a full recovery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the sixth reported case of P. gingivalis causing an intracranial abscess and the third case of a true intracerebral parenchymal abscess caused by this bacterium.

### A single-center, retrospective study of hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infections: clinical assessment of metagenomic next-generation sequencing and identification of risk factors in patients [^111xTNG8]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were the most commonly detected bacteria in the synchronous detection of lung tissue and BALF samples. These three bacteria are components of the oral microbiota and can act as pathogens under specific conditions. MNGS technology, with its unbiased and extensive coverage in pathogen detection, frequently detects these bacteria in respiratory samples. In clinical practice, distinguishing between infection and colonization usually relies on parameters such as the number of sequences, relative abundance, and coverage of the identified microorganisms. However, the presence of oral bacteria introduced during bronchoscopy sampling often complicates the identification of pathogenic upper respiratory tract colonization in BALF. Lung biopsies not only offer deeper insights into pathological and etiological findings but also enhance the distinction between infection and colonization through histological mNGS analysis. Lung abscess can lead to necrosis of lung parenchyma, usually caused by the inhalation of bacteria living in the oral cavity or pharynx. The infection involves polymicrobial organisms in as high as 72.2% of cases, particularly including various anaerobic bacteria, but it can also be caused by a single microorganism. Collecting lung tissue specimens can provide additional insights into the pathological and etiological findings. The clinical implementation of mNGS has led to a growing number of reported cases involving lung abscesses and brain abscesses attributed to Fusobacterium nucleatum. Fusobacterium nucleatum is the predominant anaerobic bacterium among all cases of lung abscesses. Fusobacterium nucleatum is commonly present in the oral cavity and is generally absent or rarely detected in other parts of the body under normal circumstances. This bacterium is linked to various forms of periodontal disease, as well as widespread infections and abscesses across the head, neck, brain, lungs, and abdomen. Previous research suggested that abscesses resulting from the synergistic activity of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus spp. tend to be larger compared to those caused by single-bacterium infections. The primary metabolites of Fusobacterium nucleatum directly enhance the growth of Streptococcus spp. while simultaneously impairing the ability of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to eliminate Streptococcus spp. Hence, mixed infections of Fusobacterium nucleatum in lung abscesses might exhibit heightened invasiveness. Subsequent fundamental experimental studies can explore the interplay between bacteria and their association with the disease. Haemophilus parainfluenzae is a constituent of the normal flora found in the ear and oropharynx. Infrequent instances of pulmonary infection caused by this bacterium arise when Haemophilus parainfluenzae is inhaled from the oropharynx into the lungs, occasionally resulting in empyema. Previously reported patients who suffered from pulmonary abscesses caused by Haemophilus parainfluenzae exhibited immunosuppression, such as diabetes or malignancy. In conclusion, the detection outcomes obtained through mNGS are progressively enhancing our comprehension of the pathogenic nature of commonly colonizing bacteria.

### Childhood osteomyelitis: imaging characteristics [^113UttFu]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Complications and outcome

A complication of osteomyelitis can be the development of an abscess, typically known as Brodie's abscess. Also the development of sequesters, fistulas and sinus tract lesions can be seen. Although CT and MR imaging is useful in delineating the extension of abnormalities, it is difficult to differentiate between an active or an inactive focus of osteomyelitis. In these cases, PET-CT, which has a high sensitivity for disease activity, might play a role. Other reported complications are septic arthritis, slipped epiphysis, damage of the physis causing early closing of the physis and eventually leading to growth retardation, or angulation deformation in the long bones.

Principles of treatment

Ideally treatment is based on the isolation of the pathogen from the focus of infection or blood. If this is not possible, empirical treatment, consisting of intravenous antibiotics in haematogenous osteomyelitis, should be started. Once the pathogen is known, treatment should be changed if needed. This approach has been shown to be effective, resulting in a cure rate of over 95%. In a systematic review, no significant difference was found between a short (less than 7 days) and a long (1 week or longer) course of intravenous antimicrobial therapy when the clinical cure rate at 6 months was the primary outcome variable.

Surgical intervention is used as an adjunct to antibacterial treatment. The aim of surgery should be to drain intra-osseous abscesses, removal of sequestra and debridement of adjoining infectious foci. Interventional radiology plays a role in percutaneous drainage of soft-tissue abscesses. Duration of therapy depends on the effect of therapy and surgical intervention. For the latest standard in osteomyelitis treatment, the reader is referred to Up-to-Date.

Poly-microbacterial infections give rise to more complications. Response to treatment is often monitored by ESR and CRP. Follow-up imaging may be used to evaluate complications.

### Fusobacterium nucleatum: ecology, pathogenesis and clinical implications [^111z2yhS]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Fusobacterium nucleatum, a commensal microorganism and opportunistic pathogen (a pathobiont), has emerged as a key player in both local and systemic diseases. In humans, F. nucleatum is found in the oral microbiota, but under certain conditions, it can spread to other ecological niches within the body, such as the gut microbiota. Importantly, F. nucleatum has a pathogenic role in periodontal disease, inflammatory bowel disease and various cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. F. nucleatum can promote oncogenesis via several mechanisms, including virulence factors, chronic inflammation, immune evasion and direct interactions with tumour cells. The strong link between this pathobiont microorganism and cancer has led to the emergence of several potential diagnostic strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. Given its increasing association with cancer progression and poor clinical outcomes, understanding the role of F. nucleatum in disease treatment offers critical insights for future research and clinical applications. This Review underscores the importance of F. nucleatum in microbiology, oncology and translational medicine.

### Ureaplasma – are you sitting comfortably? [^112SU9Yx]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

The role of Ureaplasma spp. in human disease has been controversial, as these bacteria are commonly isolated as part of the normal genital tract flora. Ureaplasma has been shown to have a causal role in urogenital infections and is associated with significant foetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality when infection occurs during the perinatal period. Although rare, invasive Ureaplasma infection (meningitis, renal abscess, mediastinitis and arthritis) has also been reported in both adults and children. This review outlines the unique microbiological features and various clinical presentations of Ureaplasma infection. It also discusses the treatment options, which in the neonatal period can be particularly challenging.

### The butterfly effect: collateral damage and impacts of antimicrobial strategies on the oral microbiome [^111aXco4]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Some individuals remain prone to oral diseases despite consistent hygiene practices. Importantly, the mechanical removal of plaque is a non-selective process, and thus, whilst it helps reduce harmful taxa, it may also disturb beneficial members of the microbiota. In practice, however, oral health is typically preserved or restored because of the colonisation resistance exerted by commensal species. Still, in cases such as periodontitis, studies have shown that a dysbiotic signature remains within the oral microbiome following routine debridement, even 24 h after therapy. It is well recognised that mechanical disruption of the oral biofilm can result in transient bacteraemia, particularly following invasive procedures such as scaling or root planing –. However, the vast majority of these episodes are short-lived and rapidly resolved by the host immune system. Crucially, the risk of bacteraemia is not exclusive to professional mechanical plaque removal (PMPR). In fact, the accumulation of plaque and associated gingival inflammation increases the risk of spontaneous bacteraemia during routine actions such as chewing, toothbrushing and scaling. Thus, regular plaque removal reduces the overall frequency and severity of bacteraemia in the long term by lowering microbial load and improving mucosal integrity. Nonetheless, in susceptible individuals, such as those with pre-existing heart valve abnormalities or immunosuppression, even transient bacteraemia can pose serious risks. It has been recognised for many years that infective endocarditis (IE) often results from oral microorganisms, and recent guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology strongly recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for high-risk patients prior to invasive dental procedures. Beyond IE, evidence also suggests that this bacteraemia may indirectly contribute to a range of systemic diseases. For example, oral bacteria have been found to colonise atherosclerotic plaques, potentially promoting the progression of atherosclerosis. Possible mechanisms behind this association have been recently described in reference, believed to be driven by local dissemination of pathobionts (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia and Fusobacterium nucleatum) and/or the related release of inflammatory mediators from the oral cavity. These pathobionts are often hallmarks of a dysbiotic microbiome, and their enrichment reflects an imbalance that may favour chronic inflammation and microbial translocation. Interestingly, a "Trojan Horse Approach" has also been proposed, whereby intracellular survival of these organisms may promote additional dissemination to distal sites.

FIGURE 2
Apical periodontitis.

Inflammation near the root may stimulate proliferation of the periapical epithelial cells, resulting in formation of a periapical cyst (Fig. 3). These cysts are lined with stratified squamous epithelium and filled with protein-rich fluid and cellular debris. They slowly enlarge and are often asymptomatic, although symptoms may arise if inflammation increases or if the cyst grows significantly. Treatment of periapical cysts is the same as that for periapical granulomas. Residual periapical cysts (which persist after removal of the affected tooth) should be excised. Periapical abscesses may develop de novo or from chronic periapical granuloma transformation, and are characterized by collection of inflammatory cells and infected tissue at the apex of a non-vital tooth. If the abscess extends into the alveolus, the patient may experience progressive pain, tenderness, sensitivity to percussion, swelling of adjacent tissue, extrusion of the affected tooth, and systemic signs of infection. Radiographs often demonstrate apical periodontal ligament broadening and an ill-defined radiolucency, but no significant bony defects. Sequelae of an inappropriately treated or untreated abscess include intraoral sinus tract formation, head and neck fascial space abscesses or cellulitis, and osteomyelitis. Management of periapical abscess focuses on drainage, possible tooth extraction with curettage of the cavity, or endodontic therapy if the tooth is thought to be salvageable. Antibiotics are usually unnecessary for treatment of localized abscesses unless there are systemic symptoms, involvement of fascial spaces or osteomyelitis. Intraoral sinus tracts often resolve spontaneously after appropriate treatment of the offending tooth, and require no further intervention.

Complications of Pulpal and Periapical Disease

If a periapical abscess is not drained (either surgically or spontaneously), it can perforate through the cortical bone of the maxilla or mandible and extend along soft tissue fascial planes. The head and neck have multiple fascial spaces delineated by different anatomic structures, including muscles, bone, tendons, ligaments, and so on. Odontogenic infections have the potential to spread into these spaces and result in superficial or deep space infection. Depending on their anatomic location and surrounding structures, these infections have varying degrees of severity and propensity to cause systemic harm. The most common complication and most frequent cause of death from odontogenic infections is airway compromise. Additional complications may also include, but are not limited to, visual disturbances/blindness, sinusitis, mediastinitis, septic thrombus formation, and systemic sepsis.

### Human pasteurellosis health risk for elderly persons living with companion animals [^112y49xL]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Polymicrobial Pasteurella sp. Infections

In 79 patients, Pasteurella sp. was the only isolate, whereas polymicrobial infections were detected in 83 patients (51.2%). In these cases, the most frequent anaerobic bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 18), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 11), Prevotella oralis (n = 10), Prevotella melaninogenica (n = 7), Prevotella loescheii (n = 7), and Bacteroides pyogenes (n = 7). Among facultative anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (n = 12) and Escherichia coli (n = 5) were the most common species.

Characteristics of Localized and Invasive Pasteurellosis

Localized infections secondary to bites, scratches, or licking were the most prevalent type during the study period (n = 114, 70.4%). Most patients with localized infections were female (n = 68, 59.6%). For invasive infections (n = 48), however, male predominance (n = 32, 66.7%) was observed, and that difference was statistically significant (χ² = 8.345, df = 1, p = 0.004). The difference in the age distribution among those with localized (median age 53.5 [range 0–97] years) and invasive (median age 63 [range 0–87] years) infection was also statistically significant (Mann-Whitney U = 2142; p = 0.029). In the invasive-infection group, the largest number of patients (n = 12, 25%) had various abscesses (e.g. liver abscess, pulmonary abscess, abscesses after sigmoid resection); 8 (16.7%) patients had pneumonia, and 8 (16.7%) had bacteremia. Respiratory failure was diagnosed in 6 (12.5%) patients, osteomyelitis was in 4 (8.3%) patients, pleurisy in 2 (4.2%) patients, and arthritis in 2 (4.2%) patients. Central nervous system infection, adnexitis associated with pelvic inflammatory disease, peritonitis, pacemaker infection, cirrhosis, and gangrene were also recorded.

### Lingual abscess in the setting of recent periodontal antibiotic injections [^115SjWiE]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lingual abscess is a rare clinical entity, with posterior involvement being much less common than anterior involvement. Typical inciting events include trauma or direct inoculation to the area. The clinical diagnosis can be difficult, and early imaging and specialist consultation should be pursued to make a definitive diagnosis and to prevent patient deterioration.

Case Report

We present a case of posterior lingual abscess in a 62-year-old man after he received antibiotic injections to the lower molars for periodontal disease. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Lingual abscess is a rare condition that is difficult to diagnose clinically. Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to acute airway compromise and increased morbidity.

### Dental caries and periodontitis: contrasting two infections that have medical implications [^114cpiNL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Both dental decay and periodontal disease are diagnosable and treatable bacterial infections. They are distinctly different infections, with dental decay occurring on the supragingival surfaces of the teeth and periodontal infections occurring in the gingival tissue approximating the subgingival plaque. The bacteria involved and the pathophysiology of these infections are distinctly different.

### Paediatric focal intracranial suppurative infection: a UK single-centre retrospective cohort study [^114qmmXK]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

35.6% had focal neurological deficits at presentation and 23.7% seizures at admission. This is similar to other centres, although rates go up to 53% and 48% respectively. In this study the most common symptoms were non-specific. The classic triad was seldom seen. This is in accordance to literature from developed countries, while developing countries see the triad in up to 52%. Children with poorer outcome had shorter symptom duration, and tended to have more severe altered levels of consciousness, which may be attributed to more rapid deterioration. Although otorhinolaryngological infections were prevalent in this cohort, concurrent symptoms were not often reported and may be underreported since patients often had more severe presenting clinical features.

Streptococci were most commonly isolated with Streptococcus milleri group organisms as most common species. The second largest group were Staphylococci, although it is debatable how many coagulase-negative isolates were pathogenic. The predominance of Streptococci has been described previously in the UK, as well as in other countries. 12.9% of isolates were anaerobic which concurs with published literature. Interestingly Prevotella spp. were most common, whereas other centres report Fusobacterium spp. as the most common anaerobic isolate.

This study showed great variability in empirical regimens and in antibiotic treatment duration. This has been noted previously, and demonstrates the lack of uniform guidelines and potentially a change in practice over the 15 years covered by the study. Nonetheless, chosen regimens provided sufficient coverage in the majority of patients. Broad-spectrum antibiotics remain necessary before microbiology results, as gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobe microorganisms were all cultured in this cohort. Combinations including third-generation cephalosporins plus metronidazole were successful in the majority of patients. 90.5% of patients with growth-positive cultures would have been sufficiently covered with a third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, and most patients with negative cultures improved clinically on this regime. Therefore, we recommend this regime as first-choice empirical antibiotic treatment. Despite meropenem plus linezolid covering a greater proportion, this regimen should be reserved for severe or treatment non-responsive cases. Over the 15.5-year period, there have not been any anaerobic pathogens cultured in the < 1 and > 15-years age groups. In infants, the routine use of metronidazole might be reconsidered if anaerobic cultures are negative. The > 15-years age group was too small to make a similar recommendation.

### Common dental infections in the primary care setting [^114RrXib]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Family physicians commonly encounter patients with dental infections, such as dental caries and periodontal disease. Dental caries is caused by bacteria that destroy the enamel and dentin; it can be detected by an oral examination that shows stained pits or fissures on the tooth surface. Use of fluoride is the most effective prevention measure for dental caries. Untreated caries may progress to pulpitis and, eventually, to necrosis of the pulp. In irreversible pulpitis, the tooth dies and the patient may have a localized abscess that can spread to surrounding tissue. Periodontal infections are caused by bacteria in the subgingival dental plaque. In gingivitis, the inflamed gums bleed easily with brushing or flossing; the condition can be controlled with good oral hygiene. Periodontitis is characterized by a loss of supportive bone structure caused by chronic gingivitis; it is also associated with some systemic diseases. Localized periodontitis is treated with mechanical debridement and good oral hygiene, whereas generalized periodontitis requires adjunct antibiotic therapy. Pericoronitis results when food particles become trapped under the gum of an impacted tooth. This condition can be controlled by removal of food debris and good oral hygiene. For patients in whom dental infections are disseminated and have invaded the deeper oral spaces, antibiotic treatment should be initiated at the time of referral.
