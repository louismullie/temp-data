## Question

Can you have hemolytic anemia without increased ldh or decreased haptoglobin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hemolytic anemia can occur without increased LDH or decreased haptoglobin, and under what circumstances that might happen. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic laboratory signature of hemolysis and how sensitive LDH and haptoglobin are. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic basis for why these markers might be normal despite hemolysis. Next, I will examine specific clinical scenarios where this discordance occurs, including extravascular hemolysis, acute-phase haptoglobin elevation, compensated hemolysis, and device-related or drug-induced contexts. Finally, I should synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and conclude with a clear answer anchored to the evidence.

> Let me first confirm the canonical laboratory pattern. Standard teaching and contemporary reviews consistently describe hemolysis as characterized by reticulocytosis, elevated unconjugated bilirubin, elevated LDH, and decreased haptoglobin, with supportive smear findings and, when immune, a positive direct antiglobulin test, so I need to ensure I'm not overstating any single marker's specificity or sensitivity here [^111kLtJd] [^115DmKz2].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic basis for LDH and haptoglobin changes. LDH rises because it is abundant in RBCs and released with cell destruction, while haptoglobin falls because it binds free hemoglobin released during hemolysis and is rapidly cleared; this is why LDH tends to be more sensitive but less specific, whereas low haptoglobin is more specific but can be confounded by inflammation or hepatic synthesis issues, so I should be cautious about interpreting either in isolation [^115GA3cG] [^117JdVWw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider extravascular hemolysis. In extravascular hemolysis, RBCs are removed by macrophages in the spleen and liver with less release of intracellular enzymes into plasma, so LDH may be normal or only mildly elevated, and haptoglobin may be normal because hemoglobin is not freely circulating to overwhelm haptoglobin, which means a normal LDH and/or normal haptoglobin does not exclude hemolysis in this setting [^115qaYJy].

> I need to check for acute-phase confounding of haptoglobin. Haptoglobin is an acute-phase reactant and can be normal or elevated in inflammation, infection, malignancy, or postoperative states despite ongoing hemolysis; this is a classic false-negative scenario, so a normal haptoglobin cannot reliably exclude hemolysis when CRP is high or the clinical context is inflammatory [^117JdVWw] [^1111v1x3] [^111jvGdr].

> Let me consider compensated hemolysis. When the marrow fully compensates for RBC loss, hemoglobin may be normal and LDH/haptoglobin changes can be subtle or transient, leading to so-called subclinical hemolysis. In such cases, reticulocytosis and smear findings may be the most reliable clues, and I should double-check for a reticulocyte production index to confirm an appropriate marrow response before dismissing hemolysis [^113vNEAk] [^111Y5frp].

> Next, I should review device-related hemolysis nuances. In LVAD or Impella patients, baseline low-level hemolysis is expected, and LDH is notoriously nonspecific. Plasma free hemoglobin is more specific but not always rapidly available, so normal LDH or haptoglobin does not exclude clinically significant hemolysis, and serial trends plus device parameters are essential for diagnosis and escalation decisions [^115PThft] [^116q8VgP] [^1167p8Wn].

> I will now examine drug-induced hemolysis patterns. Some agents cause oxidative or immune hemolysis with variable kinetics. Case series and reports show that LDH and haptoglobin can be discordant early or late in the course, and guideline-based workups still require a full hemolysis panel even if a single marker is normal, so I should not anchor on a normal LDH or haptoglobin in suspected drug-induced hemolysis [^1152Z1jb] [^113VmfDK] [^1111v1x3].

> But wait, what if the hemolysis is very mild or intermittent. Mild or episodic hemolysis may not deplete haptoglobin sufficiently or raise LDH beyond the upper limit of normal, especially if sampling is infrequent. In such cases, repeating labs during symptomatic episodes, checking a reticulocyte count, and reviewing the smear for polychromasia or specific morphologies can unmask an otherwise subtle process [^111kLtJd] [^115qaYJy].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. I should confirm anemia and assess the marrow response with reticulocytes, review the smear for spherocytes, schistocytes, or polychromasia, and interpret LDH and haptoglobin alongside inflammatory markers and clinical context. If discordant, I should repeat testing, consider plasma free hemoglobin or endogenous CO markers in specialized settings, and pursue etiologic testing such as DAT, enzyme assays, or TMA workup as indicated, recognizing that no single test is definitive in isolation [^1152Z1jb] [^113UiP7C] [^113GY3Zj].

> In conclusion, yes — hemolytic anemia can present without increased LDH or decreased haptoglobin, particularly in extravascular hemolysis, in inflammatory states where haptoglobin is an acute-phase reactant, in compensated or mild hemolysis, and in device-related contexts where LDH is nonspecific. Therefore, I need to ensure I integrate reticulocytosis, smear findings, and the clinical picture rather than relying on any single marker to rule hemolysis in or out [^115qaYJy] [^117JdVWw] [^113vNEAk] [^115PThft].

---

Yes, hemolytic anemia can occur with **normal LDH and haptoglobin** when hemolysis is mild, extravascular, or when the bone marrow fully compensates [^115qaYJy] [^notfound]. LDH may be normal in **extravascular hemolysis** or when hemolysis is minimal, and haptoglobin can be normal or elevated in **acute-phase responses** or with recent transfusion [^115qaYJy] [^115GA3cG] [^113UiP7C]. Diagnosis should rely on the **overall pattern**: anemia with reticulocytosis, elevated indirect bilirubin, and clinical context; if discordant, repeat testing or use alternative markers (e.g. plasma free hemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin) [^113UiP7C] [^116ZqCVR].

---

## Pathophysiological basis of LDH and haptoglobin in hemolytic anemia

LDH is released from ruptured RBCs during hemolysis, and **elevated LDH** is typical of intravascular hemolysis; however, it is nonspecific and can rise with tissue injury or malignancy [^115GA3cG]. Haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin and is cleared, so **decreased haptoglobin** is expected in hemolysis; however, it is an acute-phase reactant and may be normal or elevated with inflammation, infection, or transfusion [^117JdVWw] [^1145nzNS].

---

## Clinical scenarios with normal LDH and haptoglobin in hemolytic anemia

Several scenarios can yield **normal LDH and haptoglobin** despite hemolysis:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Mechanism** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild or chronic hemolysis | Minimal RBC destruction keeps LDH and haptoglobin within normal limits | - Hereditary spherocytosis <br/> - G6PD deficiency <br/> - Mild autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) [^113VmfDK] |
| Extravascular hemolysis | RBCs are cleared by macrophages with less LDH release and preserved haptoglobin | - Warm AIHA <br/> - Hereditary spherocytosis <br/> - Sickle cell disease (extravascular component) [^115qaYJy] |
| Acute-phase response | Haptoglobin rises as an acute-phase reactant, masking consumption | - Infection <br/> - Inflammation <br/> - Recent transfusion [^117JdVWw] [^113UiP7C] |
| Compensated hemolysis | Bone marrow compensation maintains normal hemoglobin and near-normal LDH/haptoglobin | - Chronic hemolytic disorders <br/> - Early or mild hemolysis [^113vNEAk] |

---

## Alternative laboratory markers and diagnostic approaches

When LDH and haptoglobin are normal, **additional tests** can help confirm hemolysis:

- **Reticulocyte count**: Elevated reticulocytes indicate marrow response to RBC loss [^113vNEAk].
- **Indirect bilirubin**: Elevated unconjugated bilirubin supports hemolysis [^115GA3cG].
- **Peripheral smear**: Schistocytes, spherocytes, or polychromasia suggest hemolysis [^115n61Ce] [^111mucx9].
- **Plasma free hemoglobin**: Detects intravascular hemolysis when LDH/haptoglobin are inconclusive [^116ZqCVR].
- **Carboxyhemoglobin**: Endogenous CO from heme breakdown is a direct hemolysis marker [^113UiP7C] [^114mTdhU].
- **Direct antiglobulin test (DAT)**: Identifies immune-mediated hemolysis [^113GY3Zj].

---

## Clinical implications and diagnostic strategy

Normal LDH and haptoglobin **do not exclude hemolysis**; clinicians should integrate clinical context, reticulocyte count, indirect bilirubin, and smear findings. If suspicion remains, repeat testing or use alternative markers (plasma free hemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin) to confirm hemolysis [^115qaYJy] [^116ZqCVR] [^113UiP7C].

---

Hemolytic anemia can occur with **normal LDH and haptoglobin** in mild, extravascular, or compensated hemolysis, or when acute-phase effects mask haptoglobin consumption. Diagnosis should rely on the **overall pattern** and, when needed, alternative markers or repeat testing.

Gray dots, hemoglobin level for patients with the postartesunate delayed-onset hemolysis (PADH) pattern of anemia; black dots, hemoglobin level for patients with non-PADH pattern of anemia, indeterminate pattern and nonanemic patients. Dotted lines represent hemoglobin level thresholds of 8 or 7 g/dL.

With the exception of hemoglobin level, no parameters were significantly associated with a particular anemia pattern (Table 2; Technical Appendix Table 2); median hemoglobin levels at day 0 were estimated to be 11.3 g/dL (Q1–Q3: 9.6–13.1) and 13.6 g/dL (Q1–Q3: 11.6–15.4), respectively, for patients with non-PADH and PADH anemia (p = 0.002) (Tables 2, 3). The incidence of the PADH anemia did not differ between patients who received artesunate as first-line treatment and those who received quinine before being switched to artesunate (p = 0.38, Fisher exact test). During week 2, the rise in LDH levels and the drop in haptoglobin levels were consistent with hemolytic anemia in the PADH group (Figure 3); these changes lasted ≈1–2 weeks. Median LDH levels remained high at days 21 (724 IU/L [range 344–1,564] and 28 (497 IU/L [range 177–922]). Haptoglobin remained undetectable during weeks 2 and 3 (Table 3; Figure 3). During subsequent weeks, hemoglobin levels rose slowly in the non-PADH group (Table 3). Maximum reticulocyte production occurred during weeks 2 and 3 for the non-PADH and PADH groups, respectively (Figure 3; Table 3). At day 28, patients in both groups had hemoglobin levels > 11 g/dL.

Methods

This study used retrospective data on 101 adult patients identified from consult logs while inpatient for suspected TMA with matching of at least 4 of the following criteria of hemolytic anemia (Hb < 10 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150,000/uL), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH > 280 U/L), decreased haptoglobin (< 30 mg/dL), and signs of acute organ failure, prompting a consult to one or more of the TMA team members at University of California, Irvine from 01/2020 to 07/2024. Of note mild to many schistocytes were helpful in ruling in the presence of hemolytic anemia; however, was not very specific to the diagnosis of TMA as its levels can wax and wane in the acute phase. The multidisciplinary team included providers across the following specialties: nephrology, transfusion medicine, hematology, rheumatology, internal medicine, and pharmacy as shown in Fig. 1. Patient cases were reviewed in person in the inpatient setting, or if off site, through secure emails, calls and integrated electronic medical records messaging service. Patients identified with signs of TMA received standardized lab algorithm as shown in Fig. 1.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: diagnosis and differential diagnosis [^113GY3Zj]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The causes of hemolytic anemia are numerous and a systematic approach is critical for proper identification and classification. The direct antiglobulin test can establish the diagnosis and subclassify the majority of autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Further testing to identify the driver of AIHA can have significant implications in overall management. Advanced testing for rare nonimmune acquired hemolytic anemias or hereditary hemolytic anemias may be necessary if DAT testing is negative.

The triad signs of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia

Haemolysis, one of the major characteristics of the disorder, is due to a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA). Red cell fragmentation caused by high-velocity passage through damaged endothelium appears to represent the extent of small vessel involvement with intima damage, endothelial dysfunction and fibrin deposition. Presence of fragmented (schizocytes) or contracted red cells with spicula (Burr cells) in the peripheral blood smear reflects the haemolytic process and strongly suggests the development of MAHA. Polychromatic red cells are also seen in blood smears, and increased reticulocyte counts reflect the compensatory release of immature red cells into peripheral blood. Destruction of red blood cells by haemolysis causes increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and decreased haemoglobin concentrations. Haemoglobinaemia or haemoglobinuria is macroscopically recognizable in about 10% of the women. Liberated haemoglobin is converted to unconjugated bilirubin in the spleen or may be bound in the plasma by haptoglobin. The haemoglobin-haptoglobin complex is cleared quickly by the liver, leading to low or undetectable haptoglobin levels in the blood, even with moderate haemolysis. Low haptoglobin concentration (< 1 g/L – < 0.4 g/L) can be used to diagnose haemolysis and is the preferred marker of haemolysis. Thus, the diagnosis of haemolysis is supported by high LDH concentration and the presence of unconjugated bilirubin, but the demonstration of low or undetectable haptoglobin concentration is a more specific indicator.

### Diagnostic challenges in DAT-negative autoimmune haemolytic anaemia [^114cmgYS]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) is a rare, heterogeneous condition that poses diagnostic challenges, especially in direct antiglobulin test (DAT)-negative cases, where the absence of detectable autoantibodies complicates diagnosis. We report a case of a male patient in his late 60s diagnosed with a rare subtype of IgA-mediated, DAT-negative AIHA. The patient presented with painless jaundice, pruritus and laboratory evidence of haemolysis, including anaemia, reticulocytosis, elevated unconjugated bilirubin, increased lactate dehydrogenase and decreased haptoglobins. Initial and repeated standard DATs were negative. Subsequent testing ruled out viral, autoimmune and malignancy-related causes. An extended DAT using alternative reagents for IgA and IgM confirmed an IgA-mediated AIHA. Further investigations later confirmed the diagnosis of an indolent lymphoproliferative disorder following detection of a clonal B-cell population in the peripheral blood. This case underscores the diagnostic complexity of AIHA and the value of a comprehensive diagnostic approach to finding cases of rare DAT-negative subtypes.

### Immunotherapy-associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^113b3QWF]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Initial laboratory investigations (Table 1) showed white cell count of 8200/mm 3, hemoglobin of 5.6 gm/dL, platelet count of 122,000/mm 3 and reticulocyte count of 6.5% (absolute reticulocyte count of 0.11 million/mm 3). Further work up revealed lactate dehydrogenase of 1406 IU/L (reference normal value: 240 IU/L), total bilirubin of 1.5 mg/dL, haptoglobin of < 10 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL and positive direct coombs test (Positive for both anti-Ig G and anti-complement 3d). Peripheral smear revealed several spherocytes and multiple polychromatic cells. No schistocytes were present on peripheral smear.

Table 1
Laboratory findings at the time of diagnosis of AIHA

Patient was diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) secondary to immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab. She was given multiple blood transfusions and started on pulse dose steroids using 1000 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone daily for 3 days. She was then transitioned to oral prednisone 1 mg/kg daily and was tapered over a period of several weeks. Her hematological parameters improved gradually over a period of 2 months. Immunotherapy was held during this period. Once her hemoglobin normalized, she was re-challenged with ipilimumab and nivolumab. She developed hemolytic anemia again after administration of immunotherapy. She was re-treated with similar steroid regimen. Due to slow response to steroids and concern for steroid related side effects, rituximab was added at a weekly dose of 375 mg/m 2 for 4 weeks. She responded well to this treatment and at the time of last follow up her hemoglobin normalized. Response to treatment is demonstrated in Fig. 1. Immunotherapy was put on hold again. During this period, imaging studies showed improvement in brain lesions and stable disease elsewhere.

### Hemolytic anemia repressed hepcidin level without hepatocyte iron overload: lesson from Günther disease model [^117PHcgM]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Hemolysis occurring in hematologic diseases is often associated with an iron loading anemia. This iron overload is the result of a massive outflow of hemoglobin into the bloodstream, but the mechanism of hemoglobin handling has not been fully elucidated. Here, in a congenital erythropoietic porphyria mouse model, we evaluate the impact of hemolysis and regenerative anemia on hepcidin synthesis and iron metabolism. Hemolysis was confirmed by a complete drop in haptoglobin, hemopexin and increased plasma lactate dehydrogenase, an increased red blood cell distribution width and osmotic fragility, a reduced half-life of red blood cells, and increased expression of heme oxygenase 1. The erythropoiesis-induced Fam132b was increased, hepcidin mRNA repressed, and transepithelial iron transport in isolated duodenal loops increased. Iron was mostly accumulated in liver and spleen macrophages but transferrin saturation remained within the normal range. The expression levels of hemoglobin-haptoglobin receptor CD163 and hemopexin receptor CD91 were drastically reduced in both liver and spleen, resulting in heme- and hemoglobin-derived iron elimination in urine. In the kidney, the megalin/cubilin endocytic complex, heme oxygenase 1 and the iron exporter ferroportin were induced, which is reminiscent of significant renal handling of hemoglobin-derived iron. Our results highlight ironbound hemoglobin urinary clearance mechanism and strongly suggest that, in addition to the sequestration of iron in macrophages, kidney may play a major role in protecting hepatocytes from iron overload in chronic hemolysis.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^115GA3cG]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

4.1 Laboratory confirmation of hemolysis

Initial testing should include: complete blood count with peripheral blood smear examination, reticulocyte count, LDH, bilirubin, and haptoglobin levels. The normal values, accuracy, and pitfalls of these tests are summarized in Table 1.

(a) Blood smear examination: erythrocyte fragments (eg, Schistocytes) are common in "mechanical" hemolytic anemia. These fragments, however, are not specific to CPHA (Table 1). (b) Reticulocytes: an elevated reticulocyte count is a typical feature of hemolysis. However, reticulocytes can be elevated in other causes of accelerated red cells production (Table 1). In addition, normal or low reticulocyte counts do not preclude hemolysis. A blunted bone marrow response can be seen with myelodysplasia, alcoholism, or iron and folate deficiency. (c) LDH: this enzyme catalyzes the conversion of lactate into pyruvic acid, and its iso‐enzymes LDH‐1 and 2 are therefore increased in hemolysis. Although non‐specific, an elevated LDH > 2.5‐folds strongly suggests hemolysis. Temporal trends in LDH are also useful in assessing treatment success in patients with PVL and LVAD dysfunction. (d) Haptoglobin: this scavenger binds free circulating hemoglobin released with RBC turnover, and it hence becomes diminished or undetectable in significant hemolysis. A haptoglobin level < 25 mg/dL provides an 87% probability of having hemolysis. 65 A combination of haptoglobin < 25 mg/dL and elevated LDH increases the predictive value to > 90%. However, haptoglobin is an acute phase reactant and its level can hence be normal or elevated in systemic inflammation or acute infection. (e) Bilirubin: indirect bilirubin is a product of hemoglobin catabolism, and its levels are thus increased in hemolysis. Although severely elevated unconjugated bilirubin can occur with acute massive hemolysis, levels > 4 mg/dL in non‐acute hemolysis typically indicate a concomitant liver pathology impairing the conjugation of bilirubin or its hepatic uptake.

### Haptoglobin 1 allele predicts higher serum haptoglobin concentration and lower multiorgan failure risk in sickle cell disease [^1132b7pB]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Haptoglobin (HP) is an acute-phase protein and the main scavenger of cell-free hemoglobin. When HP is depleted, as observed in hemolytic conditions such as sickle cell disease (SCD), cell-free hemoglobin can lead to acute organ damage. The impact of the HP 1–1, 2–1, and 2–2 isoforms on HP and cell-free hemoglobin concentrations and SCD-related complications is unclear. In a longitudinal cohort of patients with SCD, the HP 1 allele was associated with higher HP and lower cell-free hemoglobin concentrations at a routine clinic visit as well as during hospitalization for a vaso-occlusive episode or acute chest syndrome. With a median follow-up of 6.8 years, acute chest syndrome occurred in 42% (n = 163) and multiorgan failure in 14% (n = 53) of 391 patients with SCD with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. The HP 1 allele was independently associated with lower risk of developing multiorgan failure during acute chest syndrome (additive model hazard ratio, 0.5; P < .001). Future studies assessing the regulation of HP concentrations and ability to bind cell-free hemoglobin according to the HP genotype may help to identify patients with SCD at high risk for multiorgan failure and to guide interventions, such as rapid initiation of exchange transfusion or HP replacement therapy.

### Diagnosis, controversies, and management of the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count [^113oQpW2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome has been recognized as a complication of preeclampsia-eclampsia for decades. Recognition of this syndrome in women with preeclampsia is increasing because of the frequency of blood test results that reveal unexpected thrombocytopenia or elevated liver enzymes. The diagnosis of HELLP syndrome requires the presence of hemolysis based on examination of the peripheral smear, elevated indirect bilirubin levels, or low serum haptoglobin levels in association with significant elevation in liver enzymes and a platelet count below 100,000/mm(3) after ruling out other causes of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. The presence of this syndrome is associated with increased risk of adverse outcome for both mother and fetus. During the past 15 years, several retrospective and observational studies and a few randomized trials have been published in an attempt to refine the diagnostic criteria, to identify risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome, and to treat women with this syndrome. Despite the voluminous literature, the diagnosis and management of this syndrome remain controversial. Recent studies suggest that some women with partial HELLP syndrome may be treated with expectant management or corticosteroid therapy. This review will emphasize the controversies surrounding the diagnosis and management of this syndrome. Recommendation for diagnosis, management, and counseling of these women is also provided based on results of recent studies and my own clinical experience.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: pathogenesis, diagnosis and potential novel therapeutics [^117DGyZe]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a potentially fatal clinical syndrome, is primarily caused by autoantibodies against the von Willebrand factor (VWF)-cleaving metalloprotease ADAMTS-13. In general, severe deficiency of plasma ADAMTS-13 activity (< 10 IU dL -1) with or without detectable inhibitory autoantibodies against ADAMTS-13 supports the diagnosis of TTP. A patient usually presents with thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (i.e. schistocytes, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, decreased hemoglobin and haptoglobin) without other known etiologies that cause thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Normal to moderately reduced plasma ADAMTS-13 activity (> 10 IU dL -1) in a similar clinical context supports an alternative diagnosis such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) or other types of TMA. Prompt differentiation of TTP from other causes of TMA is crucial for the initiation of an appropriate therapy to reduce morbidity and mortality. Although plasma infusion is often sufficient for prophylaxis or treatment of hereditary TTP due to ADAMTS-13 mutations, daily therapeutic plasma exchange remains the initial treatment of choice for acquired TTP with demonstrable autoantibodies. Immunomodulatory therapies, including corticosteroids, rituximab, vincristine, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide and splenectomy, etc., should be considered to eliminate autoantibodies for a sustained remission. Other emerging therapeutic modalities, including recombinant ADAMTS-13, adeno-associated virus (AAV) 8-mediated gene therapy, platelet-delivered ADAMTS-13, and antagonists targeting the interaction between platelet glycoprotein 1b and VWF are under investigation. This review highlights the recent progress in our understanding of the pathogenesis and diagnosis of, and current and potential novel therapies for, hereditary and acquired TTP.

### Hemolytic anemia after zopiclone overdose [^116VaQrH]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Zopiclone is associated with methemoglobinemia. We report a case of zopiclone overdose manifested with another hematological complication, hemolysis.

Case

A 46-year-old woman overdosed with 50–100 tablets of 7.5 mg zopiclone. Oxidative hemolysis was evident by anemia, bite cells, raised unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, lowered haptoglobin, and reticulocytosis.

Discussion

In zopiclone overdose, there may be oxidative stress rendering the development of not only methemoglobinemia but also hemolysis.

### Recommendations for the use of mechanical circulatory support: ambulatory and community patient care: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115aCqM2]. Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Mechanical circulatory support — hemolysis monitoring: A baseline level of hemolysis occurs in patients with MCS and may be monitored by periodic laboratory studies including urinalysis, plasma free hemoglobin, haptoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase analysis; baseline and serial measurements are helpful when obstruction or thrombosis is considered. Elevation of lactate dehydrogenase above the patient's baseline or 2.5 times the upper level of normal requires evaluation at an MCS center.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^112jmLXv]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 1.5 - Evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in CKD patients. (1A)

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

- **Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration**:

- **Red blood cell indices**:

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]

- mean corpuscular volume [MCV]

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

- white blood cell count and differential count

- platelet count

- Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

- **Test to determine iron status**:

- percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

- reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

- combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

- Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

- Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and serum folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
Hb electrophoresis.
Free light chains and bone marrow examination.

Treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy Anaemia of CKD (guidelines 2.1–2.4)

Guideline 2.1 - treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy – Iron repletion

We recommend that patients should be iron replete to achieve and maintain target Hb whether receiving ESAs or not. (1B)

Iron repletion is usually defined as:
%HRC < 6% / CHr > 29 pg/ferritin and TSAT (> 100 microgram/L and > 20%).
For children, aim for a target ferritin level greater than 100 microgram/L for CKD patients on dialysis as well as CKD patients not on ESA therapy. (ungraded)

Her white blood cell (WBC) count was 93 × 10 9 /L, with a platelet count of 239 × 10 9 /L, and severe anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 6.5 g/dL. Low haptoglobin and elevated LDH levels and total bilirubin were noted, but the DAT result was negative (as it is in 5% of AIHA cases). Interestingly, the patient had a very low reticulocyte count (0.007 × 10 12 /L; normal value, 0.027 to 0.116 × 10 12 /L). A bone marrow examination revealed typical CLL but suppressed erythropoiesis. A diagnosis of anemia related to CLL was made, indicating Binet stage C or CLL with PRCA (based on low reticulocyte counts and diminished erythropoiesis in the bone marrow) with DAT-negative AIHA. The patient was dependent on blood transfusions. CLL-specific treatment with ibrutinib was initiated and resulted in normalization of WBCs, but without hemoglobin response (6 g/dL). We reasoned that the AIC was predominant in this case. Therefore, ibrutinib was discontinued, and the patient was treated with prednisone at 1 mg/kg, followed by 4 weekly doses of rituximab. Hemoglobin increased to normal levels (14.9 mg/dL). Ibrutinib was reinstated, and, at this writing, the patient is still in CR of CLL and PRCA.

This case shows that AICs can dramatically influence the course of disease, with immediate need for treatment. The diagnosis of autoimmune anemia is not always easy to make. In this case, the diagnosis of AIHA could never be clearly established because of the absence of a positive DAT result, whereas the patient had low haptoglobin and elevated LDH and bilirubin. The DAT negativity may have been a consequence of low-affinity autoantibodies or warm IgM or IgA antibodies. The key finding in this case was the suppressed erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, together with the almost absent reticulocyte count. However, PRCA is a finding encountered in lymphoid neoplasms and should be differentiated from, for example, parvovirus infection. In this case, we had no information about parvovirus or T-cell receptor rearrangement. The latter also indicates that PRCA lymphoma is, at least in part, caused by suppression of erythropoiesis by T cells. PRCA in lymphomas may occur alone or in conjunction with AIHA (Figure 1B).

### Hydroxyurea (Droxia) [^116ypddp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myelosuppression

Hydroxyurea causes severe myelosuppression. Treatment with DROXIA should not be initiated if bone marrow function is markedly depressed. Bone marrow suppression may occur, and leukopenia is generally its first and most common manifestation. Thrombocytopenia and anemia occur less often and are seldom seen without a preceding leukopenia.

Some patients, treated at the recommended initial dose of 15 mg/kg/day, have experienced severe or life-threatening myelosuppression.

Evaluate hematologic status prior to and during treatment with DROXIA. Provide supportive care and modify dose or discontinue DROXIA as needed. Recovery from myelosuppression is usually rapid when therapy is interrupted.

5.2 Hemolytic Anemia

Cases of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative diseases have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients who develop acute jaundice or hematuria in the presence of persistent or worsening of anemia should have laboratory tests evaluated for hemolysis (e.g., measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, reticulocyte, unconjugated bilirubin levels, urinalysis, and direct and indirect antiglobulin [Coombs] tests). In the setting of confirmed diagnosis of hemolytic anemia and in the absence of other causes, discontinue DROXIA.

5.3 Malignancies

Hydroxyurea is a human carcinogen. In patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative disorders, secondary leukemia has been reported.

Secondary leukemia has also been reported in patients treated with long-term hydroxyurea for sickle cell disease. Leukemia has also been reported in patients with sickle cell disease and no prior history of treatment with hydroxyurea.

All patients using DROXIA should be followed up on a long-term basis with regular blood counts to detect development of leukemia.

Skin cancer has also been reported in patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea. Advise protection from sun exposure and monitor for the development of secondary malignancies.

Pump thrombosis in ventricular assist device patients — recognition and initial management are summarized as follows: Suspect pump thrombosis with lasting increases in pump power by > 50% accompanied by elevated, inaccurate flow estimates, and hemolysis manifested as an LDH elevation, and note that hemolysis may present as hemoglobinuria with dark, "tea-colored" or frankly bloody urine, and urinalysis may be positive for blood without red blood cells. Hemolysis may be detected by elevations in serum LDH (> 600 mg/dl or 2.5 times baseline depending on the assay used) and elevated free hemoglobin (> 40 mg/dl), with additional markers including increased total and indirect bilirubin or reduced haptoglobin levels, and non-occlusive thrombi can result in significant hemolysis in the absence of hemodynamic instability. When pump thrombosis is suspected or diagnosed, patients should be transported as soon as possible to the nearest VAD center where pump exchange or lysis can be performed if urgently required; proper management begins with hospitalization and systemic anti-coagulation, usually with unfractionated heparin or a direct thrombin inhibitor, and admission to an intensive care unit with inotropic support and diuretic therapy may be appropriate during a period of watchful waiting to determine if the situation reverses.

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: what does the gastroenterologist need to know? [^11728TYV]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome

Although the idea is controversial, some propose that HELLP is a severe form of preeclampsia. Others believe that it is an entity of is own. HELLP syndrome is defined by the presence of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia. It occurs in 0.17–0.85% of all pregnancies, more frequently in older multiparous Caucasian women (> 34 years). Seventy percent of cases are diagnosed antepartum, most frequently between the 27 th and 37 th week of gestation. The other 30% are diagnosed after delivery. Of these, 90% had preeclampsia during pregnancy. Approximately 5–10% of women with severe preeclampsia develop HELLP. The pathogenesis seems to be similar to preeclampsia, with generalized endothelial and microvascular injury resulting in microangiopathic anemia, periportal hepatic necrosis and thrombocytopenia.

Most of the patients complain of headache, nausea and vomiting, visual disorders and epigastric pain, and physical examination reveals pain in the right upper abdominal quadrant, weight gain and generalized edema. Early laboratory findings include hemolysis, characterized by high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (> 600 IU/L) with decreased haptoglobin values, non-conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated aminotransferases and thrombocytopenia.

The Mississippi Classification was developed to categorize the severity of HELLP syndrome (Table 3). If the platelet count is lower than 50,000/mm 3, an association with disseminated intravascular coagulation can occur. The lack of an increase in platelet levels 96 h from delivery indicates a worse prognosis with possible evolution to multiple organ failure. PT and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) are normal in the early stages. As a consequence of secondary fibrinolysis and platelet aggregation, levels of fibrin products, d-dimers and thrombin–antithrombin complexes may be high. Some patients have renal involvement.

Anemia in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease — etiologic workup by mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and reticulocyte count — directs low MCV with low or normal reticulocytes toward iron deficiency anemia (IDA) with low ferritin, low Tsat, high sTfR, normal CRP or functional iron deficiency (FID) with high ferritin, low Tsat, indeterminate sTfR, high CRP; low MCV with high reticulocytes suggests thalassemia requiring hemoglobin electrophoresis; normal MCV with low or normal reticulocytes indicates anemia of chronic disease (ACD) with high ferritin, normal/low Tsat, low sTfR, high CRP or other causes; high MCV with high reticulocytes indicates hemolysis requiring blood smear, LDH, Coomb's test, haptoglobin, and Hgb electrophoresis; high MCV with low or normal reticulocytes suggests B12 or folate deficiency, drug-induced, liver disease, hypothyroidism, or myelodysplasia.

### Carboxyhemoglobin, a reliable diagnosis biomarker for hemolysis in intensive care unit: a retrospective study [^113UiP7C]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In anemic adult patients admitted in ICU, we found that carboxyhemoglobin was a reliable diagnostic biomarker of hemolysis. Diagnostic accuracy of HA was better using carboxyhemoglobin than LDH and unconjugated bilirubin, when an optimal threshold of 2.0% was used. A similar threshold of carboxyhemoglobin at 2.2% has recently been reported in a cohort of term newborns. In critically ill patients with comorbidities and multiple organ failures, classical hemolysis biomarkers as LDH and unconjugated bilirubin may lack specificity. Haptoglobin is another biomarker for hemolysis, but its level may change in several critical conditions including sepsis or red blood cell transfusion. Unfortunately, in our study, haptoglobin was not available in patients with non-HA. We also found a significant relationship between plasma carboxyhemoglobin and hemoglobin levels, meaning that the higher the carboxyhemoglobin, the more severe the hemolytic anemia. Carboxyhemoglobin has to be analyzed after evaluation of confounding factors that potentially increase (heavy smoker, sepsis, carbon monoxide chronic sub-intoxication) or decrease (hyperoxia) its levels.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

### Immunotherapy-associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^113S6Jk8]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Immunotherapy has been widely used in the treatment of several solid and hematologic malignancies. Checkpoint inhibitors have been the forefront of cancer immunotherapy in recent years. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway are the prototypic checkpoint targets for immunotherapy. When combined, CTLA-4 and PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors work synergistically, but with increased probability of toxicity. The following case represents an unusual adverse effect of combined treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab used for treatment of metastatic melanoma.

Case Presentation

A 43-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma presented with severe generalized weakness and fatigue. She has received two cycles of ipilimumab and nivolumab, last administered 3 weeks prior to her presentation. Initial investigations revealed severe anemia with appropriate reticulocytosis, severely elevated lactate dehydrogenase, undetectable haptoglobin level and positive direct coombs test. Patient was diagnosed with severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia secondary to ipilimumab and nivolumab. She was successfully treated with high dose steroids and rituximab.

Conclusions

In our case, we present a rare but serious adverse effect of immunotherapy. We illustrate the clinical presentation and management of immunotherapy associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of many malignant conditions; therefore, it is imperative for health care professionals caring for cancer patient to be familiar with the adverse effects of immunotherapy, which allow for early recognition and management of these potentially lethal side effects.

Table 1
Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients with hemolytic anemia in KD

KD Kawasaki disease, WBC white blood cell count, ANC absolute neutrophil count, CRP C-reactive protein, AST aspartate aminotransferase, ALT alanine aminotransferase, NT pro-BNP nitrogen terminal, pro b-type natriuretic peptide, Hb hemoglobin, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, Indirect bilirubin (mg/dL) *, Indirect bilirubin blood level in follow-up, MP methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day for consecutive three days, PD prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day

All patients received initial treatment for KD with 10% IVIG. They received a second dose of IVIG because their fever persisted for 36 h after completion of the IVIG infusion. Patients 2 and 5 became afebrile after the second dose of IVIG, and the remaining patients required further treatment. Patients 3 and 6 received pulse therapy with methylprednisolone at 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days, patient 1 received methylprednisolone at 15 mg/kg/day for 3 days, and patients 4 and 5 received oral steroids at 2 mg/kg/day for 14 days as an adjunct treatment for KD. The choice of adjunctive therapy was based on the judgment of the clinician. Serum haptoglobin levels in our patients were variable, and haptoglobin is not always decreased in IVIG-related hemolysis; it is an acute phase reactant and may be increased in the presence of inflammatory conditions. When adjusted for hemoglobin levels, patients 2, 6, and 7 appear to have normal/near normal reticulocyte counts. The reason for this is not clear, but it is possible that the compensatory activity of the bone marrow does not reach an adequate level in KD due to immunological reasons.

### Hemolytic anemia [^115DmKz2]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hemolysis presents as acute or chronic anemia, reticulocytosis, or jaundice. The diagnosis is established by reticulocytosis, increased unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and peripheral blood smear findings. Premature destruction of erythrocytes occurs intravascularly or extravascularly. The etiologies of hemolysis often are categorized as acquired or hereditary. Common acquired causes of hemolytic anemia are autoimmunity, microangiopathy, and infection. Immune-mediated hemolysis, caused by antierythrocyte antibodies, can be secondary to malignancies, autoimmune disorders, drugs, and transfusion reactions. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane is damaged in circulation, leading to intravascular hemolysis and the appearance of schistocytes. Infectious agents such as malaria and babesiosis invade red blood cells. Disorders of red blood cell enzymes, membranes, and hemoglobin cause hereditary hemolytic anemias. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency leads to hemolysis in the presence of oxidative stress. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by spherocytes, a family history, and a negative direct antiglobulin test. Sickle cell anemia and thalassemia are hemoglobinopathies characterized by chronic hemolysis.

### Lactate dehydrogenase to carboxyhemoglobin ratio as a biomarker of heme release to heme processing is associated with higher tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity and early death in sickle cell disease [^114BiQzt]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Chronic hemolysis is a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD). Prior estimates of intravascular hemolysis as a proportion of the total hemolytic rate ranged from less than 10% to more than 30%. Chronic intravascular hemolysis is associated with severe vasculopathic complications including pulmonary hypertension and early mortality in SCD. Intravascular hemolysis leads to release of cellular free hemoglobin and heme. Normally, these are scavenged by respectively haptoglobin and hemopexin. However, in SCD patients the availability of scavenging proteins in plasma is typically decreased because of rapid consumption by the prodigious amount of intravascular hemolysis. Both cellular free hemoglobin and heme, devoid of anti‐oxidant buffering mechanisms normally present in red cells, are recognized as erythroid damage‐associated molecular pattern molecules (e‐DAMPs) and contribute to development of chronic vasculopathy, platelet activation and pulmonary hypertension in SCD. Intravascular heme release is associated with elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). All heme metabolized either via extravascular hemolysis or cleared from the plasma via scavenger proteins, will lead to endogenous carbon monoxide (CO) production by heme‐oxygenase 1 (HO‐1). In contrast to heme, CO has many protective effects including inhibition of polymerization of sickle hemoglobin, increased red blood cell hydration, anti‐oxidative and anti‐inflammatory effects. Theoretically, the balance of detrimental intravascular hemolysis to beneficial CO production (total hemolysis) could be a prognostic biomarker in SCD. Because the vast majority of endogenous CO is cleared by exhalation, end‐alveolar CO (EACO) in morning first breath is an accepted biomarker of endogenously produced CO, and thereby an accepted proxy marker of overall hemolysis. Before exhalation, CO is transported primarily as the conjugate carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO).

### Intravascular hemolysis and multitreatment predict thrombosis in patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^112o9XC3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study carries several limitations, including the retrospective nature, the long span of observation, and the lack of systematic evaluation of thrombophilia screening. However, the prospective part of the study strengthened the message to administer primary anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients with AIHA and active hemolysis (LDH ≥ 1.5 × ULN). This should be further advised in severe hospitalized cases requiring transfusions, therapy with rituximab or cyclophosphamide, and in those experiencing infectious complications. The impact of additional non AIHA‐related predisposing conditions should be considered as per recent consensus, and evaluated on a case‐by‐case basis. The duration of anticoagulant prophylaxis is still a matter of debate, and although most episodes happened within the first weeks, our results showed the occurrence of late‐onset thrombotic events, advising to continue heparin until LDH normalization. The results of an ongoing randomized prospective trial evaluating long‐term anticoagulant prophylaxis with apixaban in AIHA patients will possibly clarify this issue (NCT05089227).

Table 1.
Clinical characteristics of cases with alemtuzumab associated AIHA

A 36-year-old male presented to the emergency department with symptoms of malaise, dyspnea, and dark urine for 3 days. His past medical history was significant for RRMS for 6 years. He had previously relapsed on interferon-1B and fingolimod and received alemtuzumab 11 months before admission.

He denied recent infections, new medication, or over the counter products. Physical examination revealed tachycardia, pallor, and jaundice. Laboratory results were significant for anemia (Hb, 5.4 g/dL; baseline, 15 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelets, 60 × 10 3 per μL), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 900 units/liter), and undetectable haptoglobin (< 8 mg/dL). His total bilirubin was 4 mg/dL with direct fraction < 1 mg/dL. Urine analysis revealed hemoglobinuria with no red blood cells. Pretransfusion peripheral blood smear showed significant spherocytosis and thrombocytopenia. Direct antiglobulin test was immunoglobulin G (IgG)-positive. He was immediately given matched blood transfusion with relief of symptoms and was started on high dose intravenous corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin with daily transfusions to keep Hb above 5 to 6 g/dL. However, after 10 days of admission, he continued to have active hemolysis, necessitating second- and subsequently third-line treatment with rituximab and cyclophosphamide. Two weeks after cyclophosphamide treatment, his Hb started to improve and haptoglobin, LDH, and bilirubin normalized. He achieved transfusion-independence by 6 weeks since diagnosis. At his last follow-up, 1 year since discharge, he remained hemolysis-free with normal platelet counts, and his RRMS did not relapse.

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^111kLtJd]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia is defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells, and can be chronic or life-threatening. It should be part of the differential diagnosis for any normocytic or macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis may occur intravascularly, extravascularly in the reticuloendothelial system, or both. Mechanisms include poor deformability leading to trapping and phagocytosis, antibody-mediated destruction through phagocytosis or direct complement activation, fragmentation due to microthrombi or direct mechanical trauma, oxidation, or direct cellular destruction. Patients with hemolysis may present with acute anemia, jaundice, hematuria, dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and possibly hypotension. Laboratory test results that confirm hemolysis include reticulocytosis, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes from nonimmune causes. A peripheral blood smear should be performed when hemolysis is present to identify abnormal red blood cell morphologies. Hemolytic diseases are classified into hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, enzymopathies, immune-mediated anemias, and extrinsic nonimmune causes. Extrinsic nonimmune causes include the thrombotic microangiopathies, direct trauma, infections, systemic diseases, and oxidative insults. Medications can cause hemolytic anemia through several mechanisms. A rapid onset of anemia or significant hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period should prompt consideration of a hemolytic anemia.

Clinical presentation and diagnosis

HSCT-TMA has a reported incidence of 4–68% in adults and 3–39% in children after HSCT. HSCT-TMA is often underdiagnosed, with one study reporting confirmed diagnoses in fewer than half of patients with suspected cases. This is particularly evident in real-world clinical practice, where fewer than 1% of pediatric patients receiving HSCT are diagnosed with HSCT-TMA.

A historic lack of consensus on diagnostic criteria has been a likely contributor to the wide range of incidences reported in clinical research. Several clinical signs have been proposed as supporting a diagnosis of HSCT-TMA, including thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, absence of antibodies, tissue damage, kidney dysfunction, and hypertension (Table 1). Many of these are non-specific clinical signs and symptoms that occur frequently post-transplant and that could be medication-related or due to alternative post-transplant syndromes. Some signs such as proteinuria, hypertension, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are quite common in HSCT-TMA and can occur earlier (a median of 10 to 14 days before the diagnosis of HSCT-TMA), while others such as schistocytes and elevated serum creatinine tend to occur later and less often.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112XLmib]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results whose recognition can aid diagnosis:
Isolated raised bilirubin — most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome (affects 5–8% of the population). Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and a direct and indirect bilirubin; the total bilirubin should rise further, owing to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting reticulocyte count/lactate dehydrogenase/haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L) then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndromeshould be considered and genetic testing undertaken.
Cholestatic — predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood, and thus the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, however, GGT is characteristically low or normal. In these disorders, cholestasis occurs without GGT elevation.
Hepatitic — predominantly raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular liver injury (hepatitis). Common causes include viral hepatitis, NAFLD, ARLD, AIH and drug-induced liver injury. Details of the approach to these liver blood test abnormalities are given in the subsequent section on outcomes and pathways.

### Anemia and transfusion requirements among Ugandan children with severe malaria treated with intravenous artesunate [^115enHUn]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Parenteral artesunate for the treatment of severe malaria in non-immune travelers is associated with late-onset hemolysis. In children in sub-Saharan Africa, the hematologic effects of malaria and artesunate are less well documented. Here we report a prospective case series of 91 children with severe malaria treated with parenteral artesunate, managed at a resource-poor hospital in Africa, with longitudinal data on hemoglobin (Hb), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, and erythrocyte morphology. The median (range) age was 2 (1–8) years and 43 (47%) were female. The median (IQR) admission Hb level was 69 (55–78) g/L and 20 patients (22%) had severe malarial anemia (Hb < 50g/L). During hospitalization, 69 patients (76%) received one or more blood transfusions. Fatal outcome in 8 patients was associated with severe anemia in 6/8 cases. Follow-up Hb measurement was performed on 35 patients (38%) at day 14 after initial hospital admission; the remaining patients had no clinical evidence of anemia at the follow-up visit. The convalescent Hb was median (range) 90 (60–138) g/L, which was significantly higher than the paired admission levels (median increase +28g/L, p < .001). Evidence of hemolysis (elevated LDH and low haptoglobin) was common at admission and improved by day 14. No patient met the standardized definition of post-artemisinin delayed hemolysis (PADH). In this cohort of young children with severe malaria treated with artesunate, anemia was common at admission, required one or more transfusions in a majority of patients, and markers of hemolysis had normalized by day 14.

Materials and methods

Study design and population

We conducted a retrospective descriptive study including all patients admitted to the nephrology-dialysis department of Sahloul university hospital, Sousse, Tunisia between January 2006 and December 2022 for TMA management. Among 47 identified cases, 36 met inclusion criteria after excluding 11 for incomplete data.

Diagnostic criteria

TMA was diagnosed based on the presence of all three of the following criteria:

Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes ≥ 1%, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, LDH > 2×ULN, haptoglobin < 0.1 g/L).
Thrombocytopenia (< 150,000/mm³).
Organ involvement (renal, neurological, or gastrointestinal).

Organ involvement was defined as acute dysfunction of the kidney (AKI stage ≥ 2), central nervous system (seizures, confusion, stroke), or gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain, diarrhea, bleeding).

Although schistocytes and low haptoglobin were considered key diagnostic markers, their absence did not preclude inclusion if other features consistent with TMA were present. Diagnosis was based on a combination of available laboratory and clinical findings, adapted to local resource constraints.

Due to limited access to ADAMTS13 assays, complement testing, and genetic analysis, diagnostic criteria were adapted pragmatically based on available clinical and laboratory data. Diagnosis was supported by surrogate scoring systems (PLASMIC, French score), renal biopsy findings, and disease evolution, in accordance with context-specific practices and published recommendations for resource-limited settings.

Etiological classification followed current guidelines

TMA syndromes were classified as either primary (idiopathic or complement-mediated) or secondary (associated with identifiable clinical triggers such as malignant hypertension, pregnancy, autoimmune disease, or drug exposure), in accordance with the updated framework proposed by Aigner et al. and consistent with international guidelines such as KDIGO and ISTH.

### Hemolysis contributes to anemia during long-duration space flight [^114mTdhU]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Laboratory analyses

Various markers of increased erythrocyte destruction intravascular or extravascular are used clinically, including the presence of schistocytes on a blood smear, free hemoglobin in blood, decreased haptoglobin for its high affinity with free hemoglobin, increased bilirubin (indirect or direct), increased ferritin, increased LDH, d-dimer and hemosideruria. However, for different reasons, these markers are not precise, quantitative or direct markers of hemolysis. Iron and transferrin saturation may rise with many types of anemia, including hypoproliferation/hypoplasia when iron is not cleared from the plasma. Similarly, serum ferritin can increase with any cause of anemia other than iron deficiency and/or bleeding. The iron in circulating RBCs is transferred to reticuloendothelial stores, which release a proportional amount of ferritin. For these reasons, we chose endogenous CO elimination as a precise, direct and quantitative marker of hemolysis as the primary outcome measure of the study. We measured CO elimination following the methods of Shahin et al. Briefly, upon waking up, after a 20-s breath hold, astronauts exhaled through a mouthpiece connected to a one-way valve sequentially discarding 400 mL of air from airways and filling a 750-ml collection bag with alveolar air (Supplementary Video 1). The alveolar air was immediately transferred to a vacuumed 200-ml canister. Concurrently, the astronauts filled a second canister with ambient air. Canisters sampled on the ISS were stowed and boarded the next Earth-bound reentry vehicle. These methods accommodated for changes in pressure, temperature and vibration and maintained stable [CO] for at least 11 months. Both air samples were extracted from the canisters and run through a gas chromatograph with a reduction gas detector. Subtracting the ambient air [CO] from the alveolar air [CO] provided the CO elimination.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to evaluation of anemia, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) if the hemoglobin is below normal. Include the following in a more extensive workup: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, LDH, soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^113vNEAk]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

2 DEFINITION OF HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA

There is no single specific definition of hemolytic anemia. However, the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia is usually established if three major criteria are present: (a) unexplained anemia, and (b) signs of accelerated right blood cells (RBCs) production in the bone marrow (eg, high reticulocyte count), and (c) signs of RBCs destruction (eg, elevated unconjugated bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], low haptoglobin). The term "sub‐clinical hemolysis" is used to describe patients who meet the latter two criteria but do not have anemia. In these patients, the bone marrow adequately compensate for the hemolysis, maintaining normal hemoglobin. Prosthesis‐related hemolytic anemia can then be assumed if new hemolysis is diagnosed in patients with cardiac prostheses, and/or mechanical assist devices in the absence of other causes of hemolysis.

On day 10, the hemoglobin level and platelet count normalized. In addition, the urine volume gradually increased, and hemodialysis was discontinued. The serum creatinine level was 7.2 mg/dL, LDH level decreased, and haptoglobin level normalized.

On day 21, the CRP level was 0.874 mg/dL. Therefore, we discontinued antibiotic administration. The wound was healing (Fig. 1 c), and there was no pain or swelling on the right thigh. Even after discontinuing hemodialysis, the serum creatinine level continued to decrease and serum hemoglobin level remained stable (Fig. 2). Additionally, the serum haptoglobin level, LDH level, platelet count, and schistocyte count on the PB smear were stable (Figs. 3 and 4). We continued wound dressing, blood tests and kept him under close observation. Finally, he was discharged on day 28. Six months after discharge, his serum creatinine level, hemoglobin level, and platelet count were normal.

### Acquired disorders… [^1175Yvtj]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

In a minority of patients, the bone marrow is able to chronically compensate, leading to a normal and stable hemoglobin concentration. The anemia of hemolysis usually is normocytic, although a marked reticulocytosis can lead to an elevated measurement of mean corpuscular volume, because the average mean corpuscular volume of a reticulocyte is 150 fL. CHEMISTRY TESTS The destruction of red blood cells is characterized by increased unconjugated bilirubin, increased lactate dehydrogenase, and decreased haptoglobin levels. Lactate dehy drogenase and hemoglobin are released into the circulation when red blood cells are destroyed. Liberated hemoglobin is converted into unconjugated bilirubin in the spleen or may be bound in the plasma by haptoglobin. The hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex is cleared quickly by the liver, leading to low or undetectable haptoglobin levels.

URINARY TESTS In cases of severe intravascular hemolysis, the binding capacity of haptoglobin is exceeded rapidly, and free hemoglobin is filtered by the glomeruli. The renal tubule cells may absorb the hemoglobin and store the iron as hemosiderin; hemosiderinuria is detected by Prussian blue staining of sloughed tubular cells in the urinary sediment approximately one week after the onset of hemolysis. 4 Hemoglobinuria, which causes red-brown urine, is indicated by a positive urine dipstick reaction for heme in the absence of red blood cells. 16, 17 Red cell lysis also contributes to the anemia and can be dramatic in the case of "blackwater fever, " named for the brisk intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria that accompany overwhelming Plasmodium falciparum infection. The diagnosis is made by the observation of intracellular asexual forms of the parasite on thick and thin blood smears.

Septicemia caused by Clostridium perfringens, which occurs in intra-abdominal infections and septic abortions, causes hemolysis when the bacterium releases alpha toxin, a phospholipase that degrades the red blood cell membrane. 2β 2). The deficiency in one globin chain leads to an overall decrease in hemoglobin and the intracellular precipitation of the excess chain, which damages the membrane and leads to clinically evident hemolysis in the severe forms of alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia.

Management of hemolysis

Management strategies for hemolysis AEs were not included in the PEGASUS study protocol. Based on preliminary clinical experience, dose adjustment of pegcetacoplan, red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to improve anemia-related symptoms, or acute administration of eculizumab to control IVH could be considered.

If a patient did not respond adequately to the twice-weekly dose of pegcetacoplan (LDH levels > 2× upper limit of normal [ULN]), dosing could be increased to 1080 mg up to every 3 days according to the present prescribing information. Benefit of increased dosing was defined as pegcetacoplan concentration change with a minimum of 1 month at increased dosing, demonstration of LDH decrease, resolution of hemolysis (as reported by the investigator), or no new events after dose escalation, and completion of study.

The PEGASUS study was approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at participating trial sites and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Safety

Safety was evaluated through clinical and laboratory assessments. Safety data were collected throughout the study. The AEs that occurred during the infusions at the site (every 8–12 weeks) were recorded by the investigator. All investigators were specifically trained on symptoms of potential AEs. All patients received an eDiary tablet to continuously record home treatments, AEs, and additional information as they occurred. The investigator provided guidance for the patient/caregiver regarding identification and documentation of local and systemic AEs, including signs of hemolysis such as fever, chills, back pain, fatigue, and dark urine. All patients were instructed to inform the investigator/site immediately in case of such an event. In addition, the patient was contacted by the investigator within 3–5 days after each infusion, either at the study site or at their home for follow-up to ensure appropriate documentation of AEs. The investigators reviewed patients' eDiary entries at every site visit. All AEs were assessed by the investigator using comprehensive data collection systems — including the patient's eDiary — for seriousness, severity, temporal association, and possible causal relatedness to the investigational product.

Monitoring for potential cases of hemolysis comprised routine hematology screening and hemolysis screening as recommended by the FDA Guidance for Industry (June 2008). If a decrease of hemoglobin ≥ 2 g/dl was measured during either the hematology or hemolysis screening, the assessments to monitor for potential cases of hemolysis were to be performed within 48–72 h of being informed of the hemoglobin level, unless there was a clear alternative explanation. These assessments included direct antiglobin (Coomb's) test, plasma-free hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum haptoglobin, and urine hemosiderin.

### Hydroxyurea (Hydrea) [^114xUEQU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myelosuppression

Hydroxyurea causes severe myelosuppression. Treatment with HYDREA should not be initiated if bone marrow function is markedly depressed. Bone marrow suppression may occur, and leukopenia is generally its first and most common manifestation. Thrombocytopenia and anemia occur less often and are seldom seen without a preceding leukopenia. Bone marrow depression is more likely in patients who have previously received radiotherapy or cytotoxic cancer chemotherapeutic agents; use HYDREA cautiously in such patients.

Evaluate hematologic status prior to and during treatment with HYDREA. Provide supportive care and modify dose or discontinue HYDREA as needed. Recovery from myelosuppression is usually rapid when therapy is interrupted.

5.2 Hemolytic Anemia

Cases of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with HYDREA for myeloproliferative diseases have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients who develop acute jaundice or hematuria in the presence of persistent or worsening of anemia should have laboratory tests evaluated for hemolysis (e.g., measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, reticulocyte, unconjugated bilirubin levels, urinalysis, and direct and indirect antiglobulin [Coombs] tests). In the setting of confirmed diagnosis of hemolytic anemia and in the absence of other causes, discontinue HYDREA.

5.3 Malignancies

Hydroxyurea is a human carcinogen. In patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative disorders, secondary leukemia has been reported. Skin cancer has also been reported in patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea. Advise protection from sun exposure and monitor for the development of secondary malignancies.

5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, HYDREA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Hydroxyurea was embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 0.8 times and 0.3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with HYDREA for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with HYDREA for at least 1 year after therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

### Piperacillin-tazobactam induced immune hemolytic anemia led to increased renal impairment and eventual death from multiple organ failure in a patient with hypertensive nephropathy: case report and literature review [^116c5FYY]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

We recently reported a case of severe acute intravascular hemolysis in a neonate with ABO-incompatible hemolytic disease of the newborn following administration of cefotaxime-sulbactam. It was confirmed that the NIPA effect of sulbactam promoted the specific binding of maternally derived incompatible ABO blood group antibodies with the neonatal RBC blood group antigen, thereby activating complement. Both tazobactam and sulbactam are β-Lactamase inhibitors with NIPA effect. Whether the NIPA effect can promote the reactivity of drug-induced antibodies is unclear.

As far as we know, this is the first case of DIIHA caused by piperacillin with complete tracking of serological changes and the disease processes, but lack of reticulocyte count and haptoglobin data, and incomplete LDH monitoring. Delays in diagnosis due to insufficient understanding of DIIHA are worth learning a lesson. DIIHA is a side effect of medication that can lead to serious consequences, even fatal. Due to the low incidence of severe DIIHA, it has not yet received the attention of clinicians, clinical pharmacists, and drug manufacturers. In China, DIIHA has not yet been included in the medication risk monitoring system. It is now clear that there are nearly 140 drugs that can cause DIIHA through drug-induced antibodies, but DIIHA has not been included in the list of side effects of these drugs. Due to a lack of vigilance against DIIHA, the vast majority of DIIHA may be missed, misdiagnosed, delayed in diagnosis, or given improper intervention, which increases the risk of patient administration. Incorporating DIIHA into the medication risk monitoring system and improving the awareness and vigilance of DIIHA will help avoid the serious consequences of DIIHA on patients.

What initial laboratory tests may be useful in aiding a diagnosis of haemolytic anaemia and what might you expect from these investigations?

A haemolytic screen should be carried out and its result interpreted collectively: full blood count (FBC) and film, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), split bilirubin (unconjugated and conjugated), reticulocytes, haptoglobin and urinalysis (dipstick and microscopy). Typical findings and limitations in interpretation are noted in figure 7. Laboratory results in extravascular haemolysis are generally less severe, as haemolysis occurs in the reticuloendothelial system, with fewer degradation products released into the circulation.

Figure 7
Comparison between the typical laboratory findings in an extravascular versus an intravascular haemolysis. Note: Haptoglobin is not produced efficiently in children under 2 years or those with liver disease (levels are artificially low) and rises with acute inflammation, so it may be misleadingly normal in infection/inflammation despite haemolysis. LDH is non-specifically elevated in tissue damage and may remain low in extravascular haemolysis as red cells are mopped up by the reticuloendothelial system. Reticulocytes may be depressed initially because infection is often myelosuppressive and then rebound. ↑↑, significantly increased; ↑, increased; ↓, decreased; ↓↓, significantly decreased; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.

Haemolysis causes anaemia if the bone marrow RBC production cannot compensate for increased RBC destruction. Haemoglobinuria should be suspected if the urine dipstick is positive for blood but urine microscopy shows minimal red cells. Haptoglobin, the most sensitive laboratory indicator of haemolysis and last marker to normalise, is significantly decreased due to free haemoglobin (Hb) exceeding the Hb-binding capacity of the circulating haptoglobins. A reticulocytosis is usually seen, although with AIHA reticulocytopenia can commonly occur in the acute phase due to myelosuppression secondary to a recent infection or inadequate compensatory reticulocytosis. The patient's blood results are shown in figure 1.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117SWdKS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Traditionally, the distinction between different causes of anemia is based on a hematological algorithm starting with the interpretation of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Accordingly, micro-, macro- or normocytic erythrocyte conditions may hint at different causes for anemia. Besides MCV, basic laboratory parameters should include reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, red cell distribution width, and serum ferritin, TfS and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. In patients with postoperative CD or severe ileitis, serum levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid should also be evaluated. In patients with signs of hemolysis or significant comorbidities, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte Hb, lactate dehydrogenase, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), creatinine, and urea should be determined accordingly. Some authors have also emphasized a key potential role for early markers of impaired erythropoiesis markers, such as the Hb content in reticulocytes (CHr) or reticulocyte Hb equivalent, measures that are not available as part of conventional laboratory tests and that are further discussed in the outlook section.

### Clinical and biochemical footprints of inherited metabolic disease. XVI. hematological abnormalities [^111Tun1y]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Anemia is very common in people with glycogen storage disease type 1, and is frequently multifactorial with causes including iron deficiency, renal impairment, anemia of chronic disease and hepatic adenomas. Iron deficiency is particularly common, possibly due to the restrictive nature of the diet, along with increased losses due to bleeding diathesis. Some patients with hepatic adenomas were observed to have severe anemia refractory to oral iron therapy. Increased hepcidin expression was demonstrated in hepatic adenoma tissue, and one patient experienced resolution of anemia with resection of the adenoma. It was postulated that aberrant hepcidin expression from the hepatic adenomas was the cause of the anemia.

Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by loss-of-function variants in the TMPRSS6 gene, leading to a deficiency in an enzyme called Matriptase-2. This results in up-regulation of hepcidin which is a key regulator of iron homeostasis, leading to a clinical picture of iron deficiency which responds poorly to oral iron. The condition can be treated with intravenous iron supplementation.

Hemolytic anemia can present with a normocytic or macrocytic anemia. An elevated reticulocyte count or blood film examination showing polychromasia is often the first clue towards a hemolytic anemia. An elevated LDH and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia provide further evidence of hemolysis, as does a low haptoglobin, although it should be noted that haptoglobin is unreliable in the first year of life and in liver disease.

Of the inherited causes of hemolytic anemia, disorders of the red cell membrane and hemoglobinopathies are most commonly implicated. Disorders of red cell enzymes (commonly termed "enzymopathies") are also an important cause of hereditary hemolytic anemia; patients with these IMDs are predominantly looked after by hematologists. Mature red cells contain no mitochondria and are totally dependent on anaerobic glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway for their energy needs. Deficiencies of enzymes within these pathways can cause a hemolytic anemia as a result of deficiency of ATP or reducing equivalents. The diagnosis of these disorders is often suggested by the clinical features and blood film examination; however, exact diagnosis usually requires measuring the enzyme in question, or more commonly now, genetics panels using next generation sequencing (NGS).

Toxicity

Table 2 lists treatment-related adverse events experienced by ≥ 10% of patients according to grade and dose cohort. The principal treatment-related toxicities were anaemia, haemolysis, and hypoxia (representing possible methemoglobinaemia). Supplemental Table 2 lists principal toxicities according to grade, dose level, schedule, and duration. Across all dose levels, anaemia occurred in approximately 80% of patients (14% grade 3) and generally had characteristics consistent with a haemolysis mechanism (increase in reticulocyte count, decrease in haptoglobin level). As anticipated, a less frequent infusion schedule appeared to be better tolerated, with lower rates of fatigue and high-grade anaemia in the 2/3 weeks and QOW groups than the weekly group (Supplemental Table 2), presumably due to more opportunity for recovery from treatment-related anaemia events. Other lineages (white blood cells, platelets) were essentially unaffected, making myelosuppression unlikely. Haemolytic anaemia did not appear to be immune-mediated (Coomb's test negative) and responded to transfusions. In no cases was haemolytic anaemia associated with renal dysfunction, which can arise in severe cases from renal tubular obstruction by free plasma haemoglobin. In general, we also observed improved tolerability with longer infusion time.

Table 2
Treatment-related toxicities occurring in ≥ 10% of patients (N, %)

Although we had hypothesised that the far lower concentration of HPβCD required for ARQ 761 formulation would result in less haemolytic anaemia than was seen with ARQ 501, once dose was escalated to 390 mg/m 2, the prevalence and severity of this toxicity became apparent. To characterise further, we sought to obtain haemolysis parameters at the time of ≥ grade 3 anaemia (Hgb < 8.0 g/dL) (Supplemental Table 3). Unfortunately, many of these cases have missing data because (a) we either had not started collecting the data by that point or (b) the anaemia event occurred in a setting other than our clinical trials unit. For those cases with available data at the time of grade 3 anaemia, we observed a wide range of haemolysis parameters, including bilirubin (0.4–2.0 mg/dL), LDH (165–560 units/L), haptoglobin (155–408 mg/dL), and reticulocytes (2.9–8.6%).

### Why is my patient anemic? [^114FcXEi]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### Ten tips for managing complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathies (formerly atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome): narrative review [^117Bk1nd]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

3. How to suspect CM-TMA?

CM-TMA presents the three classic features of thrombotic microangiopathies: microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and organ damage, with certain specific characteristics. These clinical manifestations typically develop rapidly and may progress to organ failure and death if not adequately treated.

Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia

Non-immune microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is a hallmark of TMA, characterized by erythrocyte destruction in the microcirculation due to endothelial damage. It is identified by the following laboratory findings: elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indirect bilirubin, reticulocyte count, and free hemoglobin; decreased haptoglobin; and the presence of schistocytes on peripheral blood smear. The direct coombs test is negative, except in TMA secondary to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, where up to 90% of cases may present with a positive result, because it detects the binding of anti-T antibodies to recently exposed Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen on the red blood cell membrane. In such cases, if therapeutic plasma exchange is indicated, the exchange should be performed with 5% albumin, because fresh frozen plasma contains pre-formed antibodies anti Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen IgM, that may worsen the disease process.

Thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count below 150,000/mm³ or a 25% decrease from baseline levels. This reduction occurs due to platelet consumption in microthrombi formed within small vessels. Thrombocytopenia severity in CM-TMA is generally less pronounced than in TTP.

Organ damage

Organ damage is multisystemic. Renal involvement, characterized by the formation of microthrombi in glomerular capillaries that impair glomerular filtration, is distinctive of CM-TMA and uncommon in TTP. About 50–60% of patients require renal replacement therapy, and malignant hypertension is frequently observed. Neurologic manifestations include encephalopathy, focal deficits, seizures and coma, but are considerably less frequent than in TTP. Skin, cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems involvement are described in small number of case reports.

Attention should be drawn to the fact that approximately 25% of patients with CM-TMA may present with renal-limited TMA. A kidney biopsy is essential for early detection. Morphological findings alone do not allow for the identification of the underlying etiology; therefore, patients should be screened for complement dysregulation. Renal-limited TMA is associated with less severe renal dysfunction and a lower risk of death compared to cases with hematological involvement. The effect of anti-C5 therapy in renal-limited TMA remains unclear.

### Hemolytic versus malproductive anemia in large granular lymphocytic leukemia [^113W2Xse]. Leukemia (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) can be defined as a chronic clonal proliferation of either cytotoxic T- (CTLs) or natural killer (NK) cells (T- or NK-LGLL). In a typical clinical situation, the disease affects elderly patients, who may present with neutropenia (39–62%) and/or anemia (up to 50%), but also with a variety of autoimmune diseases. Particularly, while commonly anemia in the context of LGLL is malproductive and reticulocytopenic resembling pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), we have also occasionally encountered cases with increased/preserved reticulocyte counts. A clinical workup done on these patients revealed either immune hemolytic anemia (IHA), hypersplenism or both. Thus, the pathophysiologic underpinnings of anemia in LGLL can be diverse. Because clinical distinction has therapeutic consequences and may provide clues to the pathogenesis of LGLL, we sought to investigate the features of hemolytic versus reticulocytopenic anemia by conducting a comprehensive and systematic study of hemolysis occurring in the context of a large cohort of patients affected by this disease.

We analyzed clinical and molecular features of 262 patients diagnosed (median follow up: 84 months) at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) from 1998 to 2022 to identify those experiencing hemolysis. LGLL diagnosis was based on the presence of ≥ 4/6 criteria: i) chronically elevated LGL count (> 0.5 × 10 9 /dL over > 3 months), ii) clonal TCR rearrangement, iii) VB expansion, iv) flow cytometric detection of aberrant CTL or NK-cell proliferation, v) STAT3/5 mutation and vi) LGL infiltration of the marrow. IHA diagnosis was based on the evidence (at any time during clinical course) of signs of hemolysis namely reticulocytosis (> 2% and/or > 60 ×10 3 /uL), elevated LDH levels, and low haptoglobin. Conversely, anemia characterized by a reticulocyte index (RI) of < 2 without evidence of hemolysis was classified as malproductive/hyporegenerative. Hemoglobin (Hb) response criteria including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) were determined using consensus definitions. Transfusion dependence was defined as requirement of ≥ 2 units of red blood cell (RBC) every 2 weeks for at least 3 months due to Hb < 7 or symptomatic anemia. Fisher's exact test was used to determine statistical significance at p < 0.05.

Haptoglobin is primarily produced in the liver and is functionally important for binding free hemoglobin from lysed red cells in vivo, preventing its toxic effects. Because haptoglobin levels become depleted in the presence of large amounts of free hemoglobin, decreased haptoglobin is a marker of hemolysis. Despite its ubiquity and importance, a paucity of literature makes testing difficult to interpret. This review highlights the many physiological roles that have been recently elucidated in the literature. Different methodologies have been developed for testing, including spectrophotometry, immunoreactive methods, and gel electrophoresis. These are covered along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. As there is no single gold standard for hemolysis, validation studies must rely on a combination of factors, which are reviewed in this article. Pitfalls and limitations of testing are also addressed. False positives can occur in improper specimen preparations, cirrhosis, elevated estrogen states, and hemodilution. False negatives can occur in hypersplenism and medications such as androgens and corticosteroids. Haptoglobin testing in the setting of inflammation is additionally discussed as interpretation can be difficult in this setting. Given the widespread use of haptoglobin testing, it is vital that clinicians and laboratory staff understand the principles and correct interpretation of this test.

### Evaluation of hemolysis in patients supported with impella 5.5: a single center experience [^1167p8Wn]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemolysis, defined as the lysis of circulating red blood cells (RBCs), is associated with mortality and poor outcomes. A low level of hemolysis exists by default in patients on mechanical circulatory support (MCS) when mechanical injury is incurred to RBCs, with causative factors comprised of shear stress, flow acceleration, and RBC contact with device surfaces. There is no universally accepted algorithm or definition to establish clinically significant hemolysis in the setting of MCS. Furthermore, hemolysis is particularly understudied in percutaneous left ventricular assist devices (LVADs).

Studies and guidelines have previously used various laboratory markers in attempts to define hemolysis, which include plasma free hemoglobin (PfHb), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, bilirubin, and hemoglobinuria. Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) guidelines have suggested that PfHb > 20 and LDH > 2.5 times the normal value are indicative of hemolysis. Other studies have suggested that a slightly higher level of PfHb (> 40), with the addition of either LDH > 2.5 times normal, hemoglobinuria, or clinical signs such as anemia in the absence of active bleeding or renal failure would appropriately define hemolysis on MCS. Of note, LDH, also an inflammatory marker, is known to be nonspecific and has been thought to be an unreliable definer of hemolysis.

In recent years, certain characteristics that could contribute to hemolytic events in percutaneous devices have been recognized, for example pump malfunction or thrombosis, positional problems (triggering "suction alarms"), and insufficient preload. A consensus statement of the MCS academic research consortium published in 2020 categorized hemolytic events into "major" and "minor", using some of these abovementioned mechanical characteristics but still employing the previous INTERMACS reported PfHb level > 20 or LDH > 2.5x normal as a qualifying criteria for an "adverse event".

One study, with hemolysis defined as PfHb > 40, aimed to examine the predictive value of these INTERMACS markers among cardiogenic shock patients receiving an Impella device (a percutaneous LVAD manufactured by Abiomed, Danvers, MA) and found that while an increase in delta PfHb was highly predictive of hemolysis, an increase in delta LDH was not. Of note, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved study protocol definitions of hemolysis for percutaneous MCS devices have specifically required PfHb > 40 to be recorded at two different points in time.

### Severe inflammation and lineage skewing are associated with poor engraftment of engineered hematopoietic stem cells in patients with sickle cell disease [^115HP7dm]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Exploratory outcomes: laboratory markers

Hemolysis markers were evaluated before and after GT. The decrease in hemolysis was evidenced by a lower level of lactate dehydrogenase and a lower reticulocyte count in P1 and P2 and a higher haptoglobin level in P1 (Supplementary Table 3). In P1 and P2, the total bilirubin level (a marker of extravascular hemolysis) fell after GT (Supplementary Fig. 4h and Supplementary Table 3). The intravascular hemolysis was reduced in P1 and (particularly) P2, as shown by a decrease in plasma levels of hemoglobin and heme (both of which were abnormally high before GT) and an increase in plasma hemopexin (Supplementary Fig. 4h). An indirect antiglobulin test revealed no evidence of immune hemolysis.

P1 and P2 had normal white blood cell counts after GT and the level of C-reactive protein (an inflammation marker) normalized in P1 (Supplementary Fig. 4i and Supplementary Table 3).

Even in the absence of RBC transfusions, P1 and P2's serum ferritin levels were still high after GT (Supplementary Table 3); this was probably due to poor compliance with the iron chelation therapy. However, liver iron overload (as assessed by T2✱ MRI) decreased in P1 and P2 after GT (Supplementary Fig. 4j). In both patients, heart iron levels were in the normal range before and after GT (Supplementary Fig. 4k).

Exploratory outcomes: transcriptomic analysis of the SCD HSPCs revealed enrichment in inflammatory and committed progenitor signatures

To evaluate the effects of the SCD pathology on HSPCs, we compared the transcriptomic profiles of plerixafor-mobilized HSPCs from patients with SCD and from HDs at the time of collection (i.e. before transduction). In SCD HSPCs, a bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed the upregulation of genes involved in inflammatory responses (as observed previously) and in cell cycle-related processes (Fig. 3a). Accordingly, gene signatures specific for committed progenitors (i.e. earliest thymic progenitors, monocytes, pre-B cells, and cell cycle-G2M) were enriched in the patients' samples. We also observed, in SCD samples, an enrichment in genes typically overexpressed in active HSC (and downregulated in dormant HSC); hence, SCD samples might contain fewer dormant HSCs and more progenitors (Fig. 3b).

### Effect of a red blood cell transfusion on biological markers used to determine the cause of anemia: a prospective study [^1145nzNS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Blood test results required for the evaluation of anemia are considered difficult to interpret after red blood cell transfusion. However, this hypothesis is neither supported by a strong physiological rationale nor is it evidence based.

Methods

We conducted a prospective multicenter study to compare the values of key assays prior to and after a course of red blood cell transfusion in the emergency or internal medicine units in 4 university hospitals. The following parameters were measured prior to and within 48 to 72 hours after transfusion: complete blood count with reticulocyte count, direct Coombs' test, ferritin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, serum and erythrocyte folate, cobalamin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, haptoglobin, and C-reactive protein. We investigated the impact of transfusion on these parameters and assessed whether abnormal values prior to the transfusion became normal after transfusion (or conversely).

Results

There were 77 patients included in the study. Changes in mean values of mean corpuscular volume, soluble transferrin receptor, erythrocyte folate, cobalamin, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and direct Coombs' test were not statistically significant. Changes in reticulocyte count, ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum folate, and total bilirubin concentrations were statistically significant, but they remained in the same diagnostic category (normal or abnormal) in 79% to 98% of the cases; 97% of patients with iron deficiency still had low ferritin or transferrin saturation after a transfusion.

Conclusion

Blood tests performed after a one-time red blood cell transfusion can be used to establish the cause of anemia when they have not been performed before.

### Revolution of AAV in drug discovery: from delivery system to clinical application [^112qBFkx]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

9.2 Off‐Target Effects

Off‐target effects refer to unintended gene modifications or interactions occurring outside the intended target site, posing significant challenges in AAV‐based gene therapy. These effects include oncogenesis, inflammation, immune‐mediated tissue damage, toxicity or dysfunction in non‐target tissues, silencing or activation of non‐target genes, and loss of therapeutic efficacy. Self‐complementary AAV (scAAV) can achieve faster transgene expression, potentially reducing the required dose and minimizing off‐target effects. Optimizing AAV delivery methods, such as intravenous, intramuscular, intraocular, intrathecal, intranasal, and local administration, can enhance tissue targeting and reduce off‐target expression. AI/ML computational tools can predict potential off‐target sites and refine vector design, which can then be validated in cell cultures and animal models. Developing biomarkers can aid in early detection of off‐target activity, allowing for timely adjustments to treatment strategies. For AAV‐delivered CRISPR/Cas9 components, the risk of off‐target DNA cleavage can be reduced by using high‐fidelity Cas variants, base editing, and prime editing. Long‐term patient monitoring, follow‐up, and risk‐benefit analysis are essential to ensure the safety and efficacy of AAV‐based gene therapies.

9.3 Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA)

TMA is a rare but severe complication associated with AAV‐based gene therapies, characterized by thrombocytopenia, microvascular thrombosis, hemolytic anemia, and end‐organ damage, particularly affecting the brain and kidneys. TMA following AAV gene therapy is linked to immune activation, complement dysregulation, and endothelial injury triggered by the vector or transgene product. This can lead to a range of clinical and laboratory presentations, including hemolytic anemia (decreased hemoglobin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and increased bilirubin), thrombocytopenia (reduced platelet count), renal dysfunction (elevated serum creatinine, proteinuria, and hematuria), acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine, proteinuria, hematuria), and neurological symptoms (confusion, headaches, seizures, and focal neurological deficits). Early recognition and intervention are crucial for improving patient outcomes, with monitoring of platelet counts, lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, and renal function being essential. Preventive measures to reduce the risk of TMA in patients receiving AAV gene therapy include assessing pre‐existing immunity, optimizing vector doses, providing supportive care, inhibiting complement activation, performing plasma exchange, administering immunosuppressive therapy, and conducting post‐treatment monitoring.

### The acute hemolytic anemias: the importance of emergency diagnosis and management [^113edu4K]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hemolytic anemias are defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells. These anemias have many causes that are mostly due to chronic diseases, but, occasionally, cases of acute life-threatening hemolysis can occur.

Objective

The objectives of this article were to review the pathophysiology of hemolytic anemias, to discuss the general emergency department (ED) evaluation, and to discuss the assessment and treatment of important and "cannot miss" hemolytic diseases.

Discussion

Because hemolytic anemias are rarely seen, the emergency physician may consider a patient's anemia as due to blood loss rather than hemolysis, and the workup and treatment may not be appropriate. The primary goal for the emergency provider is to resuscitate, but he or she also must recognize that a hemolytic process is present. Appropriate laboratory work and specialist consultation should be obtained. While focused treatment is rarely necessary in the ED, the avoidance of certain treatments, such as early platelet transfusion in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, may be necessary.

Conclusions

Hemolytic anemias are rare, but should still be considered in the ED differential diagnosis of low hemoglobin. Emergency physicians should first resuscitate, but should also be able to identify the presence of hemolysis and obtain the appropriate laboratory tests. Occasionally, specific treatments are needed but should be discussed in conjunction with a specialist.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^111Y5frp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Late effects of blood and marrow transplantation [^1155ea2U]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Kidney diseases

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as an elevated serum creatinine level, or a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for three months or longer.CKD occurs in approximately 20% of HCT recipients. – There are three major etiologies of CKD after HCT: thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), nephrotic syndrome and idiopathic CKD. Other etiologies include persistent acute kidney injury and BK virus nephropathy. Whenever possible, renal biopsy should be considered to accurately diagnose the etiology of CKD and to provide appropriate management.

Thrombotic microangiopathy occurs in 2%–21% of patients after HCT, and is characterized by renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, neurological dysfunction, hemolytic anemia with schistocytes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and decreased haptoglobin. Risk factors of TMA include TBI, calcineurin inhibitors, and acute and chronic GvHD. – TMA-related kidney injury often improves with tapering or stopping calcineurin inhibitors, but full renal function is rarely restored. In some cases TMA did not improve until GvHD was treated. Efficacy of plasma exchange is limited.

Nephrotic syndrome occurs in 6%–8% of patients after allogeneic HCT. Membranous nephropathy comprised 61% of cases, and minimal change disease comprised 22% of cases, with a median onset of 14 months and eight months after HCT, respectively. Mechanisms of membranous nephropathy are thought to be formation of immune complexes through allo- or auto-antibodies recognizing antigens expressed by the podocyte, while T cells are implicated with minimal change disease. Nephrotic syndrome after HCT is often associated with chronic GvHD and tapering of immunosuppressive medications. Initial treatment is prednisone 1 mg/kg/day in addition to calcineurin inhibitors. Complete response was observed in 90% of patients with minimal change in disease, but only in 27% of patients with membranous nephropathy. Refractory cases may be treated with rituximab or mycophenolate mofetil.

Idiopathic CKD comprises most cases of CKD. Risk factors include acute GvHD, chronic GvHD, acute kidney injury, long-term use of calcineurin inhibitors and previous autologous HCT, suggesting that GvHD, accompanying treatment and inflammatory conditions may have pathogenic roles in this entity. Associations of TBI with risk of CKD have been controversial. ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been used to treat CKD and hypertension associated with CKD.

### Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia: a systematic review of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, therapies, and outcomes [^115QJQKD]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.6 Clinical Diagnostic Criteria

A diagnosis (possible/probable or definite) of mixed AIHA requires demonstration of AIHA [anemia (hemoglobin and/or hematocrit below the established reference range) secondary to an immune‐mediated cause involving both warm and cold autoantibodies].

All cases (probable/possible and definite) required the hemolytic component to comprise at least two of: elevated indirect bilirubin; elevated lactate dehydrogenase; decreased haptoglobin; elevated urobilinogen; hemoglobinuria; and increased spherocytes on peripheral blood smear.

The immune component must have comprised a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) with both IgG and complement bound to the red cell surface via any standard method (standard tube methods, column agglutination, solid phase red cell adherence). To be classified as a "definite" case of mixed‐type AIHA required demonstration of IgG bound to the RBC surface in the DAT and a positive elution study (i.e. either a pan‐reactive eluate or an eluate with an antibody with apparent specificity for an antigen expressed by the patient, e.g. auto‐anti‐e) with a concomitant pathologic cold agglutin. If the elution was not reported, the case could still be considered "definite" if RBC transfusion had not occurred in the prior 3 months, the patient had no known alloantibodies, and the indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) was pan‐reactive or demonstrated an autoreactive pattern with anti‐human globulin (AHG). If elution and IAT results were not reported, the case could be considered "possible or probable" if RBC transfusion had not occurred in the prior 3 months. If RBC transfusion had occurred in the previous 3 months but the IAT was pan‐reactive, the case was considered "possible or probable".

### Hydroxyurea [^114hkt7v]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myelosuppression

Hydroxyurea causes severe myelosuppression. Treatment with hydroxyurea should not be initiated if bone marrow function is markedly depressed. Bone marrow suppression may occur, and leukopenia is generally its first and most common manifestation. Thrombocytopenia and anemia occur less often and are seldom seen without a preceding leukopenia. Bone marrow depression is more likely in patients who have previously received radiotherapy or cytotoxic cancer chemotherapeutic agents; use hydroxyurea cautiously in such patients.

Evaluate hematologic status prior to and during treatment with hydroxyurea capsules. Provide supportive care and modify dose or discontinue hydroxyurea as needed. Recovery from myelosuppression is usually rapid when therapy is interrupted.

5.2 Hemolytic Anemia

Cases of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative diseases have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients who develop acute jaundice or hematuria in the presence of persistent or worsening of anemia should have laboratory tests evaluated for hemolysis (e.g., measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, reticulocyte, unconjugated bilirubin levels, urinalysis, and direct and indirect antiglobulin [Coombs] tests). In the setting of confirmed diagnosis of hemolytic anemia and in the absence of other causes, discontinue hydroxyurea.

5.3 Malignancies

Hydroxyurea is a human carcinogen. In patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative disorders, secondary leukemia has been reported. Skin cancer has also been reported in patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea. Advise protection from sun exposure and monitor for the development of secondary malignancies.

5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, hydroxyurea can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Hydroxyurea was embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 0.8 times and 0.3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with hydroxyurea capsules for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with hydroxyurea capsules for at least 1 year after therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

### Lactate dehydrogenase as a biomarker of hemolysis-associated nitric oxide resistance, priapism, leg ulceration, pulmonary hypertension, and death in patients with sickle cell disease [^114Bw26b]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is prevalent in adult patients with sickle cell disease and is strongly associated with early mortality and markers of hemolysis, in particular, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Intravascular hemolysis leads to impaired bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), mediated by NO scavenging by plasma oxyhemoglobin and by arginine degradation by plasma arginase. We hypothesized that serum LDH may represent a convenient biomarker of intravascular hemolysis and NO bioavailability, characterizing a clinical subphenotype of hemolysis-associated vasculopathy. In a cohort of 213 patients with sickle cell disease, we found statistically significant associations of steady-state LDH with low levels of hemoglobin and haptoglobin and high levels of reticulocytes, bilirubin, plasma hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, arginase, and soluble adhesion molecules. LDH isoenzyme fractionation confirmed predominance of LD1 and LD2, the principal isoforms within erythrocytes. In a subgroup, LDH levels closely correlated with plasma cell-free hemoglobin, accelerated NO consumption by plasma, and impaired vasodilatory responses to an NO donor. Remarkably, this simple biomarker was associated with a clinical subphenotype of pulmonary hypertension, leg ulceration, priapism, and risk of death in patients with sickle cell disease. We propose that LDH elevation identifies patients with a syndrome of hemolysis-associated NO resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and end-organ vasculopathy.

### Daratumumab monotherapy in refractory warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and cold agglutinin disease [^112tfw2w]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

We undertook a multinational retrospective observational study of patients with wAIHA and/or cAIHA treated with daratumumab monotherapy. Inclusion criteria were AIHA with or without immune thrombocytopenia (Evans syndrome), diagnosed as a combination of anemia, hemolysis (defined by increased reticulocytes, lactate dehydrogenase, and bilirubin with a decreased haptoglobin) and a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) for IgG and/or IgA and/or IgM and/or strongly positive for complement deposition. AIHA was classified according to recent international consensus. Patients with AIHA after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were excluded. To ensure the presence of an adequate bone marrow response, patients with reticulocytopenia were excluded. Each investigator was asked to report all consecutive patients with AIHA who received at least 1 dose of daratumumab therapy. Laboratory and clinical data were retrospectively collected regarding underlying disease, bone marrow pathology, hemolytic parameters, and grading of patient-reported acrocyanosis (scored as stable, better, or resolved) at diagnosis, 2 weeks and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and last date of follow-up. Patients were included in 10 different centers in 5 countries (Austria, Italy, France, The Netherlands, and United Kingdom). Hemoglobin (Hb) response was considered none, partial (PR; Hb, 10–12 g/dL or > 2 g/dL increase), or complete (CR; Hb > 12 g/dL), in the absence of recent RBC transfusion. Patients who were not anemic at baseline (Hb > 12 g/dL) were not evaluated for Hb response. Distribution of data regarding continuous variables was described in terms of a median and ranges. The initial overall response (OR) is expressed as the percentage of patients with CR and PR of the total number of patients. All patients were followed until the last available data or loss of response. Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria, version 5.0 (2017). All patients gave informed consent based on local legislation; patients providing material for translational studies signed an additional informed consent. The data of 2 deceased patients were used according to local legislation.

### Fostamatinib for the treatment of warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia: phase 2, multicenter, open-label study [^1132vaKY]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with relapsed warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) have limited treatment options. Fostamatinib is a potent, orally administered spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). This phase 2 study evaluated the response to fostamatinib, administered at 150mg BID orally with or without food in adults with wAIHA and active hemolysis with hemoglobin (Hgb) < 10 g/dL who had failed at least one prior treatment. Hemoglobin levels and safety assessments were performed at visits every 2weeks. The primary endpoint was Hgb > 10 g/dL with an increase of ≥ 2 g/dL from baseline by week 24 without rescue therapy or red blood cell transfusion. Eleven of 24 (46%) patients achieved the primary endpoint. Increases in median Hgb were detected at week 2 and sustained over time. Median lactate dehydrogenase levels and reticulocyte counts generally declined over time with little change in median haptoglobin levels. The most common adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (42%), fatigue (42%), hypertension (27%), dizziness (27%), and insomnia (23%). AEs were manageable and consistent with the fostamatinib safety database of over 3900 patients across multiple diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, B-cell lymphoma, COVID-19, and ITP). No new safety signals were detected. Fostamatinib may be a promising therapeutic option for wAIHA. A randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study is nearing completion.

### Bendamustine-associated hemolytic anemia [^111gHmLU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of probable bendamustine-related hemolytic anemia.

Case Summary

A 64-year-old white female had recently received treatment with bendamustine for stage III follicular lymphoma. After her fourth cycle, she was admitted to an outside facility with severe right upper quadrant pain across her back and findings consistent with obstructive jaundice. She was found to have pancytopenia and elevations in total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and transaminase levels. A bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of lymphoma and presence of megakaryocytes on 2 occasions. Upon transfer to West Virginia University Hospitals, her haptoglobin was found to be undetectable, total bilirubin 10.3 mg/dL (unconjugated bilirubin 4.9 mg/dL), reticulocyte count 21.4% (reticulocyte index ≥ 2%), alkaline phosphatase 1125 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase 421 U/L. The peripheral smear showed evidence of spherocytes and very rare schistocytes. Based on these findings, the woman was diagnosed with hemolytic anemia secondary to bendamustine exposure. She was started on prednisone 1 mg/kg (60 mg) daily and, soon after, her platelets and hemoglobin stabilized.

Discussion

Drug-induced hemolytic anemia is an acquired or extrinsic process that results in antibody-mediated red blood cell destruction. The patient was not taking any medications commonly associated with hemolytic anemia; however, her laboratory test results were consistent with hemolytic anemia. Based on bendamustine's structural similarity to fludarabine and fludarabine's association with causing hemolytic anemia, we considered exposure to bendamustine to be the most likely contributory factor for her diagnosis. According to the Naranjo probability scale, a probable likelihood was reflected in bendamustine causing the hemolytic anemia.

Conclusions

Continued monitoring of postmarketing data is necessary to correlate this occurrence of hemolytic anemia with bendamustine therapy.

### Hemolytic anemia following SAPIEN 3 ultra RESILIA implantation (from the OCEAN-TAVI registry) [^113QPVm5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Decompensated hemolytic anemia after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) requiring specific treatment is rarely encountered in actual clinical practice. Nevertheless, there have been several cases of clinically relevant hemolytic anemia following implantation of the recently launched SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA (S3UR). This study aimed to elucidate the clinical features of hemolytic anemia following S3UR implantation. Patients who underwent TAVI using S3UR from the end of March 2023 to November 2023 were enrolled from the Japanese multicenter OCEAN (Optimized CathEter vAlvular iNtervention)-TAVI registry. Hemolytic anemia was defined as (1) a drop in hemoglobin level by > 2.0 g/dL within 3 months after the index TAVI procedure and (2) the diagnosis of mechanical hemolysis as the cause of anemia made by the attending physician and hematologist based on the presence of any 2 of the following criteria: (1) serum lactate dehydrogenase level > 220 IU/L; (2) haptoglobin level < 0.5 g/L; and (3) reticulocyte count ≥ 2%. Of the 1,070 patients, 18 (1.7%) patients developed hemolytic anemia after TAVI. These patients had a significantly lower prosthesis oversizing relative to native annulus (-3.7% [-5.9% to 0.1%] vs 7.5% [0.6% to 14.0%], p < 0.001) and a higher prevalence of paravalvular leakage (PVL) ≥ mild (mild PVL: 61.1% vs 12.4%; moderate-to-severe PVL: 16.7% vs 0.2%; p < 0.001) than those without hemolytic anemia. PVL ≥ mild was associated with a higher incidence of hemolytic anemia particularly in patients with oversizing of < -5% (33.3% vs 1.3%, p < 0.001) and in those with -5% ≤ oversizing < 10% (8.3% vs 0.7%, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the incidence of decompensated hemolytic anemia after S3UR implantation was not negligible, and the results of the present study support the importance of selecting a prosthesis size with a sufficient oversizing relative to native annulus to minimize residual PVL ≥ mild leading to hemolytic anemia after TAVI.

### Hydroxyurea (Xromi) [^111VjSNP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myelosuppression

Hydroxyurea causes severe myelosuppression. Do not initiate treatment with XROMI in patients if bone marrow function is markedly depressed. Bone marrow suppression may occur, and leukopenia is generally its first and most common manifestation. Thrombocytopenia and anemia occur less often and are seldom seen without a preceding leukopenia.

Some patients, treated at the recommended initial dose of 15 mg/kg/day, have experienced severe or life-threatening myelosuppression.

Evaluate hematologic status (CBC, reticulocyte count) prior to and every 2 weeks during dose-escalation period of XROMI treatment. Once a stable dose of XROMI is achieved, monitor every 4 weeks. Provide supportive care and modify dose or discontinue XROMI as needed. Recovery from myelosuppression is usually rapid when therapy is interrupted [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.2 Hemolytic Anemia

Cases of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative diseases have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
	 Patients who develop acute jaundice or hematuria in the presence of persistent or worsening of anemia should have laboratory tests evaluated for hemolysis (e.g., measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, reticulocyte, unconjugated bilirubin levels, urinalysis, and direct and indirect antiglobulin [Coombs] tests). In the setting of confirmed diagnosis of hemolytic anemia and in the absence of other causes, discontinue XROMI.

5.3 Malignancies

Hydroxyurea is a human carcinogen. In patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative disorders (a condition for which XROMI is not approved), secondary leukemia has been reported.

Secondary leukemia has also been reported in patients treated with long-term hydroxyurea for sickle cell anemia. Leukemia has also been reported in patients with sickle cell anemia and no prior history of treatment with hydroxyurea.

All patients using XROMI should be followed up on a long-term basis with regular blood counts to detect development of leukemia.

Skin cancer has also been reported in patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea. Advise protection from sun exposure and monitor for the development of secondary malignancies.

### Serum haptoglobin in hemolytic disease… [^114BKwtk]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Inadequate construction of study and control groups by Marchand et al inflates the apparent sensitivity and specificity of their serum haptoglobin assay. More important, there is no reason to believe that the test has much practical value. Classification of megaloblastic anemia with hemolytic anemias advances the hypothesis of Marchand and coworkers, but it ignores that this is a problem of decreased RBC production because of ineffective erythropoiesis; the shortened RBC survival contributes little to the anemia. It is then no wonder that Marchand and associates find little correlation between reticulocytosis and hemolysis, as megaloblastic anemia occurs with absolute reticulocytopenia. The control group of nonhemolytic diseases does not include other diseases characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, such as sideroblastic anemia and agnogenic myeloid metaplasia.

In hypersplenism, a disease that is clearly hemolytic, haptoglobin levels are normal, but only two such patients were studied. These factors greatly. Rice L. Serum Haptoglobin in Hemolytic Disease. JAMA. 1980; 244: 2607–2608.

### Delayed-onset hemolytic anemia in patients with travel-associated severe malaria treated with artesunate, France, 2011–2013 [^115EKWzf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Case Definitions

Severe malaria was defined as malaria in persons with blood smears positive for asexual forms of Plasmodium falciparum parasites and at least 1 criterion of severity according to the definition of severe malaria used in France. Patients with mixed-species infections were excluded from analysis.

Anemia was defined as a blood hemoglobin level of < 12 g/dL in female and < 13 g/dL in male patients (reference values 12.0–16.5 and 13.0–17.5 g/dL, respectively). Hemolysis was defined as a plasma haptoglobin level of < 0.1 g/L (reference value 0.55–2.50 g/L), plasma lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level of > 390 IU/L (reference value 190–390 IU/L), or both. We defined 3 patterns of anemia as previously described: PADH, non-PADH, and indeterminate. The PADH pattern was defined by 1) a new drop in the hemoglobin level after day 8 of treatment initiation and the appearance or reappearance of hemolytic markers (> 10% drop in hemoglobin or > 10% rise in LDH levels) occurring any time between day 8 and the end of follow-up and/or 2) by any information in the medical chart referring to acute hemolysis occurring after day 8. The non-PADH pattern was defined by a hemoglobin nadir and a hemolysis peak occurring before day 8, with or without positive markers of hemolysis after day 8 and without a nadir or sudden drop of hemoglobin after day 8 as defined for the PADH pattern. The indeterminate pattern was defined as all other cases of anemia for which information was lacking or with an evolution pattern that did not fit the other patterns.

Sample Collection

Blood samples were routinely collected from the patients on days 0, 2 (± 1), 7 (± 2), 14 (± 3), 21 (± 3), and 28 (± 3) after treatment initiation. Samples were analyzed to determine the levels of hemoglobin, total bilirubin, glucose, plasma bicarbonate, lactate, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, LDH, haptoglobin, and parasitemia and the reticulocyte count.

### Hemolysis after oral artemisinin combination therapy for uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria [^116CtYr9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Episodes of delayed hemolysis 2–6 weeks after treatment of severe malaria with intravenous artesunate have been described. We performed a prospective observational study of patients with uncomplicated malaria to investigate whether posttreatment hemolysis also occurs after oral artemisinin-based combination therapy. Eight of 20 patients with uncomplicated malaria who were given oral artemisinin-based combination therapy met the definition of posttreatment hemolysis (low haptoglobin level and increased lactate dehydrogenase level on day 14). Five patients had hemolysis persisting for 1 month. Patients with posttreatment hemolysis had a median decrease in hemoglobin level of 1.3 g/dL (interquartile range 0.3–2.0 g/dL) in the posttreatment period, and patients without posttreatment hemolysis had a median increase of 0.3 g/dL (IQR -0.1 to 0.7 g/dL; p = 0.002). These findings indicate a need for increased vigilance for hemolytic events in malaria patients, particularly those with predisposing factors for anemia.

### Haematological manifestations of lupus [^115hKoCD]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical findings and establishing diagnosis

AIHA can be diagnosed in a stepwise manner. First, the anaemia must be established as haemolytic, which can be ascertained by serum biochemistry of haemolytic markers (eg, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, indirect bilirubin), presence of reticulocytosis and by examination of the peripheral blood smear. Second, using direct antiglobulin test, the clinician should determine whether autoimmunity against red blood cells is triggering haemolysis. Lastly, identification of the type of antibody responsible for haemolysis has to be defined. Warm-acting-AIHA and cold-acting-AIHA are based on the optimal temperature of antigen–antibody reactivity. This multitiered approach should lead to diagnosis or exclusion of the diagnosis of AIHA in patients with SLE.

Patients with AIHA present with constitutional signs and symptoms of anaemia, including fatigue and dyspnoea on exertion. Patients with SLE with AIHA can have other concomitant autoimmune haematological manifestations. For example, patients with SLE can present with AIHA and thrombocytopenia concomitantly or sequentially, which is known as Evans syndrome. Patients with Evans syndrome may have frequent relapses, once glucocorticoids have been tapered or stopped. Hence, when a diagnosis of AIHA in patients with SLE has been established, monitoring for the development of thrombocytopenia is important.

### Haptoglobin levels are associated with haptoglobin genotype and alpha +-thalassemia in a malaria-endemic area [^111PRt3r]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2006). Low credibility.

Haptoglobin (Hp) is an acute phase protein that removes free hemoglobin (Hb) released during hemolysis. Hp has also been shown to be toxic for malaria parasites. alpha(+)-Thalassemia is a hemoglobinopathy that results in subclinical hemolytic anemia. alpha(+)-Thassemia homozygosity confers protection against severe malarial disease by an as yet unidentified mechanism. Hp levels were measured in a serial cross-sectional survey of children in Madang Province, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Hp levels were related to age, Hp genotype, Hb levels, parasitemia, splenomegaly, and alpha(+)-thalassemia genotype. Surprisingly, children who were homozygous for alpha(+) -thalassemia had significantly higher levels of Hp than did heterozygotes, after controlling for relevant confounders. We suggest that this is the result of either reduced mean cell Hb associated with alpha(+) -thalassemia homozygosity or an elevated IL-6-dependent acute phase response.

### Severe immune hemolytic anemia in disseminated tuberculosis with response to antituberculosis therapy [^111UmD25]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Severe hemolytic anemia in patients with disseminated tuberculosis is exceedingly rare. We report an episode of Coombs'-positive hemolytic anemia in a previously healthy young man with miliary tuberculosis, resulting in a hemoglobin level of 5 g/dL and an undetectable haptoglobin level. The patient responded well to treatment with antituberculosis drugs, and the results of the direct Coombs' test became negative without the need of blood transfusion or steroid therapy.

### Haptoglobin 1 allele predicts higher serum haptoglobin concentration and lower multiorgan failure risk in sickle cell disease [^116dsg8p]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Results and discussion

The median age of the cohort was 32 years (IQR, 24–43 years), 57% were female, 76% were SS/Sβ 0 -thalassemia genotype, and 46% were on hydroxyurea at enrollment. The prevalence of the HP genotypes was HP 1–1, 30% (129 of 431); HP 2–1, 47% (203 of 431); and HP 2–2, 23% (99 of 431). The distribution of these genotypes was similar to what has been reported in the general African population (HP 1–1, 29%; HP 2–1, 40%; and HP 2–2, 22%). There were no statistically significant clinical differences at baseline by the HP genotype (Table 1). The mean time interval between biosample collection and the preceding VOE (HP 1–1, 103 ± 3 days; HP 2–1, 107 ± 2 days; and HP 2–2, 112 ± 3 days) or red blood cell transfusion (HP 1–1, 113 ± 2 days; HP 2–1, 111 ± 2 days; and HP 2–2, 115 ± 2 days) were similar between the HP genotypes (P = 0.3).

Table 1.
Patient characteristics at the time of enrollment

In univariate analysis, steady-state serum HP concentrations trended higher in those with the HP 1 allele (Figure 1 A). Independent variables associated with HP levels at steady state included hemoglobin SS/Sβ 0 -thalassemia genotype (β −1.8 ± 0.4; P < .001), preceding VOE time interval (β −0.012 ± 0.004; p = 0.001), LDH (natural log β −0.84 ± 0.37; p = 0.03), hydroxyurea use (β 0.51 ± 0.26; p = 0.05), and a trend for the HP 1 allele (β 0.25 ± 0.17; p = 0.1), adjusting for age, sex, and preceding red blood cell transfusion time interval. The HP 1 allele was associated with higher serum HP concentrations during a VOE and during an acute chest syndrome episode (Figure 1 A).

5.9 Hemolytic Anemia

Cases of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative diseases have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients who develop acute jaundice or hematuria in the presence of persistent or worsening of anemia should have laboratory tests evaluated for hemolysis (e.g., measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, reticulocyte, unconjugated bilirubin levels, urinalysis, and direct and indirect antiglobulin [Coombs] tests). In the setting of confirmed diagnosis of hemolytic anemia not related to the disease and in the absence of other causes, discontinue SIKLOS.

### Unusual case of pernicious anaemia masquerading as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in the setting of multiple normal vitamin B12 deficiency parameters: preventing anchoring and overdiagnosis [^1178mbEc]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy (pseudo- thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)) is a rare presentation of B12 deficiency. Overlapping features like elevated LDH/total bilirubin with low haemoglobin/haptoglobin/platelets could deceivingly suggest thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) resulting in avoidable procedures/treatments.

Case Presentation

A 36-year-old female with hypothyroidism initially presented to clinic with fatigue, palpitations, lightheadedness, and dyspnoea over a 3-month duration and was found to have a haemoglobin of 5.7 g/dL. She received two packed red blood cell units in the emergency room and subsequently discharged with outpatient follow-up and empiric oral iron. During her follow-up visit, she was found to have easy bruisability, gum bleeding, and generalized weakness from hemolytic anaemia (mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 90 fL, haptoglobin < 8 mg/dL, LDH > 4,000 U/L and schistocytosis on CBC) and thrombocytopenia of 52 K/uL. Due to PLASMIC score of 6 and suspicion for TTP, she was transferred to our facility and tr eated with three cycles of plasma exchange and prednisone but were discontinued when ADAMTS13 levels returned normal. While the patient had normal B12 levels, further testing revealed positive intrinsic factor antibodies (IF-Ab) and an elevated MMA level of 1.56 umol/L. Replacement with cobalamin led to normalization of labs and symptoms.

Conclusions

Timely diagnosis of pseudo-TMA was exceptionally challenging due to several overlapping features with TTP including normal B12 and normal MCV. B12 levels may falsely appear normal in pernicious anemia due to IF-Ab interference with chemiluminescent immunoassay. Schistocytes lower the MCV in automated cell counters. Lower reticulocyte index (< 2%), presence of immature/large platelets and teardrop cells, elevated MMA and a higher LDH (> 2500) are indicative of B12 deficiency.

### Immunotherapy-associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^114sULia]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Melanoma is a highly malignant tumor of skin. It is the fifth most common tumor in men and seventh in women in United States. The prognosis of metastatic melanoma is poor with a 5-year survival of only 15–20%. There is great progress made in recent years in the management of advanced melanoma resulting in approval of several drugs by Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ipilimumab and nivolumab are two of the several drugs recently approved for metastatic melanoma. Ipilimumab is a CTLA-4 inhibitor and nivolumab is a PD-1 inhibitor, both results in enhanced anti-tumor immune response.

Approximately 50% of AIHA cases are idiopathic but in the remaining cases, underlying inciting factor can be found. Common etiology includes underlying malignancy, autoimmune disorders, drugs and infections. Diagnosis of AIHA is relatively easy given the constellation of laboratory findings of normocytic or macrocytic anemia, reticulocytosis, low serum haptoglobin levels, elevated LDH level, increased indirect bilirubin level and a positive direct antiglobulin test. Once the diagnosis is established, it is important to rule out any secondary causes as managing the underlying cause can indirectly improve the AIHA, particularly in drug-induced hemolytic anemia. Initial treatment of AIHA involves high dose steroids with slow taper. Steroids work primarily by inducing immunosuppression resulting in reduction of autoantibodies production. Rituximab is usually reserved for refractory and relapsed cases. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that causes apoptosis of B-lymphocytes by binding to CD20 positive B-lymphocytes. Depletion of B-lymphocytes lead to reduction in autoantibodies, inflammatory cytokines and T-cell activation.

### Haptoglobin and hemolytic disease… [^111jvGdr]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Fehr J. Haptoglobin and Hemolytic Disease. JAMA. 1981; 245:

2028. doi: 10.1001/jama.1981.03310450022012 To the Editor. The article by Marchand et al provides too much hope for a resurrection of haptoglobin determinations as a reliable indicator of hemolytic diseases. First, the introduction of any new or renewed diagnostic measurement should be based on a reliable diagnosis. In the case of hemolysis, the standard reference method to establish the firm diagnosis of a reduction in the RBC survival relies on studies with radiolabeled autologous erythrocytes. Since the reticulocyte count, on which Marchand et al based their diagnosis, is an unreliable method for establishing a hemolytic process, 1 at least in its milder form, their data lack the important prerequisite, and any conclusions derived thereof must remain in doubt.

Second, even using the most sensitive assay for haptoglobin determination, one has to respect the fact that hemolytic diseases are often accompanied by inflammatory processes. Being an acute-phase reactant protein, increased haptoglobin levels are — in our Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### The unique characteristics of COVID-19 coagulopathy [^112kGxY9]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is the clinical entity encompassing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and secondary TMAs. TMA is characterized by thrombus formation in the microvasculature (mainly arterioles) with laboratory findings of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia. The diffuse microvascular thrombi in multiple organs in autopsy cases of COVID-19 are similar to that of TMA, and the changes of hematologic markers resemble those in mild MAHA represented by decreased hemoglobin, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increased bilirubin, decreased haptoglobin, and appearance of schistocytosis.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)

TTP is caused by autoantibody-induced depletion or inhibition of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13), a metalloprotease enzyme that cleaves large multimers of VWF. In TTP, platelet/VWF microthrombi are found along with severe thrombocytopenia and MAHA. Although acquired TTP can be triggered by infection, to date, depletion of ADAMTS13 in COVID-19 has not been reported. Rather, increased VWF levels in COVID-19 have been reported. Helms et al. found markedly elevated levels of VWF activity, VWF antigen, and factor VIII level in COVID-19. Further, nearly 90% of investigated patients were positive for lupus anticoagulant, suggesting that COVID-19 shows features resembling those of TTP and APS. It is hypothesized that increased VWF is the result of vascular injury since VWF and factor VIII are stored in Weibel-Palade body in endothelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection of the endothelial cells may stimulate the release of these components, with levels increasing independently from ADAMTS13 levels. Dengue virus, an RNA virus similar to coronavirus, is known to stimulate endothelial cells to release VWF, and an association between elevated circulating levels of VWF and stroke has been reported in dengue. TTP features of thrombocytopenia, fever, decreased consciousness, and renal impairment, all of which can also be seen in COVID-19, suggest possible overlapping pathophysiology can exist. However, arterial thromboembolism, such as stroke and acute coronary syndrome, and microvascular (arteriolar) thrombosis predominate in TTP, whereas venous thromboembolism predominates, with MAHA not commonly seen in COVID-19.

### Iptacopan monotherapy in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: a 2-cohort open-label proof-of-concept study [^115yEk6F]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Iptacopan (LNP023) is a novel, oral selective inhibitor of complement factor B under clinical development for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). In this ongoing open-label phase 2 study, PNH patients with active hemolysis were randomized to receive single-agent iptacopan twice daily at a dose of either 25 mg for 4 weeks followed by 100 mg for up to 2 years (cohort 1) or 50 mg for 4 weeks followed by 200 mg for up to 2 years (cohort 2). At the time of interim analysis, of 13 PNH patients enrolled, all 12 evaluable for efficacy achieved the primary endpoint of reduction in serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels by ≥ 60% by week 12 compared with baseline; mean LDH levels dropped rapidly and durably, namely by 77% and 85% at week 2 and by 86% and 86% at week 12 in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Most patients achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and all but 1 patient remained transfusion-free up to week 12. Other markers of hemolysis, including bilirubin, reticulocytes, and haptoglobin, showed consistent improvements. No thromboembolic events were reported, and iptacopan was well tolerated, with no severe or serious adverse events reported until the data cutoff. In addition to the previously reported beneficial effect of iptacopan add-on therapy to eculizumab, this study showed that iptacopan monotherapy in treatment-naïve PNH patients resulted in normalization of hemolytic markers and rapid transfusion-free improvement of Hb levels in most patients. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03896152.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemia during pregnancy and puerperium: an international multicenter experience [^113VLreh]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Clinical features of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) develop during pregnancy or postpartum/puerperium in age-matched healthy women

Figure 1.
Patient disposition. ∗Two patients had AIHA relapse during a second pregnancy; 1 patient had a second pregnancy without AIHA relapse; ∗∗2 patients had a relapse in a second pregnancy. P, number of pregnancies; W, number of women.

An additional 9 patients developed de novo AIHA during gestation, and 4 developed AIHA in the puerperium. Two patients had AIHA onset during the puerperium of the first pregnancy and relapse during the second pregnancy (for one of these, data are available only for the second pregnancy).

We observed 24 hemolytic events in 23 women during pregnancy (median gestational week, 20.5; range 5–32) or puerperium (median week from delivery, 6; range, 4–6). Median Hb was 6.4 g/dL (range, 3.1–8.7), LDH 599 IU/L (range, 269–1631), unconjugated bilirubin 2.8 mg/dL (range, 1.8–6), reticulocytes 255 × 10 9 /L (range, 113–780), and all subjects had haptoglobin consumption. Management consisted of blood transfusions (N = 14, 58%) and prompt establishment of steroid therapy (N = 23, 96%). Steroid treatment consisted of methylprednisolone (N = 6) or prednisone/prednisolone (N = 18) at a median dose of 1 mg/kg per day (range, 0.5–1.5 mg/kg per day); only 1 patient received 1 g/day per 3 days. All patients responded (15 CR and 8 PR) with a median time to response of 14 days (range, 7–26) and a median treatment duration of 17 weeks (range, 4–80) (supplemental Tables 2 and 3). IVIG were used in 7 of 24 AIHA flares (6 during pregnancy and 1 during puerperium), all but 1 with Hb < 8 g/dL; doses ranged from 0.4 g/kg for 5 days to 1 g/kg for 2 days, and all patients were receiving concomitant steroids making it difficult to discriminate the contribution to the overall response (supplemental Tables 2 and 3). One patient with de novo AIHA during pregnancy received transfusion support exclusively during gestation, and was treated postpartum. Antithrombotic prophylaxis was administered to 8 patients (4, heparin; 2, aspirin; and 2, both; 33%) because of hemolysis (N = 5, 2 patients previously splenectomized), antiphospholipid antibody positivity and previous miscarriages, gestosis, and COVID-19 infection (N = 1 each) (supplemental Tables 2 and 3). No prophylaxis was administered for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. In 9 of the 18 patients with AIHA relapse during pregnancy, hemolysis persisted after delivery and was managed primarily with steroids with the addition of rituximab (N = 4), recombinant erythropoietin (N = 2), and cyclosporine (N = 1), with no apparent effect on hemolysis duration.

### Evidence that anemia accelerates AS Progression via shear-induced TGF-β 1 Activation: Heyde's syndrome comes full circle [^117Frdbm]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2024). Medium credibility.

We recognize that in addition to gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intravascular hemolysis of RBCs as they traverse a stenotic valve at a very high shear stress may also contribute to anemia. This intravascular hemolysis may also result in the release of iron, which has been found to be deposited on aortic valves in association with calcification. If correcting anemia diminishes wall shear stress, it may have the added advantage of decreasing any ongoing hemolysis. Serum lactate dehydrogenase and plasma haptoglobin levels are valuable biomarkers of AS-associated hemolytic anemia.

Anatomic support for a role for platelets comes from our finding of platelet aggregates in both human AS patient and LA100 mouse valve leaflets by whole mount immunofluorescent and scanning electron microscopy imaging. Our data are also consistent with previous observations that activated platelets are physically associated with valvular cells. In fact, Ozawa et alrecently showed that LDLR −/− (without ApoB100) mice lacking ADAMTS13 have increased aortic endothelial vWF, enhanced platelet adhesion, and evidence for TGF-β1 pathway activation in association with the development of hemodynamically significant AS. In patients with critical aortic stenosis, increased wall shear stress reduces large vWf multimers and leads to the development of acquired von Willebrand syndrome, which is also common in patients with left ventricular assist device implantation. It is postulated that both AS and left ventricular assist device generate high shear force, resulting in vWf unfolding and cleavage by ADAMTS13 or perhaps other mechanisms leading to impaired hemostasis. In fact, our previous study found an inverse correlation with platelet-released TGF-β1 and loss of vWf multimer size in heart failure patients implanted with LVAD.

Study limitations

First, the experimental anemia produced by both an iron-deficient diet and phlebotomy was more severe than the anemia experienced by patients with AS. To address this, we also tested animals subjected to more moderate anemia and found similar findings with regard to the protective effect of targeted loss of platelet TGF-β1. We did not study the potential contribution of other cells, including monocytes/macrophages, which can also secrete TGF-β1. Because both AS and anemia increase with age, other age-related metabolic and inflammatory conditions may also contribute to AS progression, and future studies are needed to address these issues. Our study is also limited by the relatively small AS patient sample size and the retrospective nature of the data collection. Similarly, the under-representation of women (n = 11, 20%) in this study limits its generalizability. We attempted to partially address these limitations by prospectively studying several mouse models in which we included more than 40% female mice in the analysis.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^116ZqCVR]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Additional markers of hemolysis can be used in certain populations. For example, plasma free hemoglobin (pFH) is usually indicative of intra‐vascular hemolysis. This marker is useful in early detection of hemolysis in patients with LVADs. In the Interagency for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support registry, hemolysis is diagnosed when pFH exceeds 40 mg/dL. 46 The utility of pFH in diagnosing and monitoring hemolysis in patients with pLVAD and in those with PVL has also been suggested in several studies. 49, 66 Indeed, pFH was superior to LDH in detecting hemolysis in patients with cardiogenic shock treated with the Impella micro‐axial pump. 49 However, pFH is not widely used in this setting due to the dearth of supportive data and the frequent need to send out to a reference lab. Other tests indirect/less specific markers of hemolysis (mean cell volume, hemosiderinuria, hemoglobin A1C, aspartate aminotransferase, etc.) may aid in establishing or excluding the diagnosis in equivocal cases (Table 2).

### Carboxyhemoglobin, a reliable diagnosis biomarker for hemolysis in intensive care unit: a retrospective study [^115DbPGX]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Hemolytic anemia (HA) is a common condition in intensive care units (ICU) responsible for life-threatening organ failure in severe cases. HA needs urgent treatment initiation, but its diagnosis remains challenging as none of the biological diagnostic parameters, including bilirubin, LDH and haptoglobin, are specific. During hemolysis, free hemoglobin released by red blood cells is catabolized by heme-oxygenase 1, leading to formation of iron, biliverdin and carbon monoxide. Next, carbon monoxide binds to free hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin. Carboxyhemoglobin is routinely measured in ICU and available within a few minutes by CO-oximetry, a point of care testing (GEM® Premier™ 4000, Werfen, Le Pré-Saint-Gervais, France). Our objective was to evaluate carboxyhemoglobin as a diagnostic tool for HA in adult patients admitted in ICU.

### Eculizumab prevents intravascular hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and unmasks low-level extravascular hemolysis occurring through C3 opsonization [^111bZfAt]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired hemolytic anemia characterized by intravascular hemolysis which has been demonstrated to be effectively controlled with eculizumab. However, lactate dehydrogenase levels remain slightly elevated and haptoglobin levels remain low in some patients suggesting residual low-level hemolysis. This may be due to C3-mediated clearance of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria red blood cells through the reticuloendothelial system.

Design and Methods

Thirty-nine samples from patients not treated with eculizumab and 31 samples from patients treated with eculizumab were obtained (for 17 of these 31 samples there were also samples taken prior to eculizumab treatment). Membrane bound complement was assessed by flow cytometry. Direct antiglobulin testing was carried out using two methods. Lactate dehydrogenase was assayed to assess the degree of hemolysis.

Results

Three of 39 patients (8%) with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria not on eculizumab had a positive direct antiglobulin test, while the test was positive in 21 of 31 (68%) during eculizumab treatment. Of these 21 patients who had a positive direct antiglobulin test during eculizumab treatment, 17 had been tested prior to treatment; only one was positive. Flow cytometry using anti-C3 monoclonal antibodies was performed on the 21 direct antiglobulin test-positive, eculizumab-treated patients; the median proportion of C3-positive total red blood cells was 26%. Among the eculizumab-treated patients, 16 of the 21 (76.2%) with a positive direct antiglobulin test received at least one transfusion compared with one of ten (10.0%) of those with a negative test (P < 0.01). Among the eculizumab-treated patients, the mean hemoglobin value for the 21 with a positive direct antiglobulin test was 9.6 ± 0.3 g/dL, whereas that in the ten patients with a negative test was 11.0 ± 0.4 g/dL (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

These data demonstrate a previously masked mechanism of red cell clearance in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and suggests that blockade of complement at C5 allows C3 fragment accumulation on some paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria red cells, explaining the residual low-level hemolysis occurring in some eculizumab-treated patients.

### IgM monoclonal gammopathies of clinical significance: diagnosis and management [^116YaD3N]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical characteristics

Patients with CAD present with chronic anemia and/or cold-induced circulatory symptoms. Of 232 patients in an international retrospective case series, the median IgM was 3.2 g/L and over 90% had hemolytic anemia and circulatory symptoms. Thirty-eight percent required transfusions at or before diagnosis and 47% during follow-up. Around half had acrocyanosis or Raynaud syndrome affecting daily living. Ulcers or gangrene were rare (< 2%). In a third of cases, hemoglobin concentration is below 80g/L. Circulatory symptoms do not correlate with either the degree of anemia or the bone marrow histology. There is an increased risk of thrombosis in CAD, likely related to intravascular hemolysis, which is not correlated with the severity of the anemia.CAD is a chronic disease and affected patients have an estimated 16-year survival. Clonality has been demonstrated in approximately 80% of cases, and the remainder likely require more sensitive methods to detect the pathogenic clone. The CAD clone has a distinct phenotype that differs from that of WM. MYD88 L265P is rarely seen. Recurrent somatic mutations in CXCR4 (20%), KMT2D (69%) and CARD11 (31%) have been described. Recurrent chromosomal abnormalities have been identified. Based on bone marrow biopsies of 54 cases of CAD, the entity "CAD-associated lymphoproliferative disorder" has been defined, with typical morphology including absent plasmacytoid cells, universally restricted IGHV4–34 gene usage and lack of MYD88 L265P. Most patients meet the criteria for MGUS and extramedullary disease is rare.

Diagnostic workup

Laboratory findings are consistent with hemolysis (and may, therefore, include reticulocytosis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and decreased haptoglobin), the monospecific direct antiglobulin test is strongly positive for C3d and there is a cold agglutinin titer of ≥ 1:64 at 4˚C. Blood samples should be handled warm until separation to prevent agglutination.

### Fostamatinib for the treatment of warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia: phase 2, multicenter, open-label study [^117G3NUk]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Patients with relapsed warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) have limited treatment options. Fostamatinib is a potent, orally administered spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). This phase 2 study evaluated the response to fostamatinib, administered at 150 mg BID orally with or without food in adults with wAIHA and active hemolysis with hemoglobin (Hgb) < 10 g/dL who had failed at least one prior treatment. Hemoglobin levels and safety assessments were performed at visits every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was Hgb > 10 g/dL with an increase of ≥ 2 g/dL from baseline by week 24 without rescue therapy or red blood cell transfusion. Eleven of 24 (46%) patients achieved the primary endpoint. Increases in median Hgb were detected at week 2 and sustained over time. Median lactate dehydrogenase levels and reticulocyte counts generally declined over time with little change in median haptoglobin levels. The most common adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (42%), fatigue (42%), hypertension (27%), dizziness (27%), and insomnia (23%). AEs were manageable and consistent with the fostamatinib safety database of over 3900 patients across multiple diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, B‐cell lymphoma, COVID‐19, and ITP). No new safety signals were detected. Fostamatinib may be a promising therapeutic option for wAIHA. A randomized, double‐blind, phase 3 study is nearing completion.

5.3 Lack of Effectiveness

Methemoglobinemia may not resolve or may rebound after response to treatment with methylene blue in patients with methemoglobinemia due to aryl amines such as aniline or sulfa drugs such as dapsone. Monitor response to therapy with methylene blue through resolution of methemoglobinemia. If methemoglobinemia does not respond to 2 doses of methylene blue injection or if methemoglobinemia rebounds after a response, consider additional treatment options [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may not reduce methylene blue to its active form in vivo. Methylene blue may not be effective in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

5.4 Hemolytic Anemia

Hemolysis can occur during treatment of methemoglobinemia with methylene blue. Laboratory testing may show Heinz bodies, elevated indirect bilirubin and low haptoglobin, but the Coombs test is negative. The onset of anemia may be delayed 1 or more days after treatment with methylene blue injection. The anemia may require red blood cell transfusions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Use the lowest effective number of doses of methylene blue injection to treat methemoglobinemia. Discontinue methylene blue and consider alternative treatments of methemoglobinemia if severe hemolysis occurs.

Treatment of patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with methylene blue may result in severe hemolysis and severe anemia. Methylene blue is contraindicated for use in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency [see Contraindications (4)].

5.5 Interference with In Vivo Monitoring Devices

Inaccurate Pulse Oximeter Readings

The presence of methylene blue in the blood may result in an underestimation of the oxygen saturation reading by pulse oximetry. If a measure of oxygen saturation is required during or shortly after infusion of methylene blue, it is advisable to obtain an arterial blood sample for testing by an alternative method.

Bispectral index monitor

A fall in the Bispectral Index (BIS) has been reported following administration of methylene blue class products. If methylene blue is administered during surgery, alternative methods for assessing the depth of anesthesia should be employed.

5.6 Effects on Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery

Treatment with methylene blue may cause confusion, dizziness and disturbances in vision [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Advise patients to refrain from driving or engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery until such adverse reactions to methylene blue have resolved.
