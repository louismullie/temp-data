## Question

Why are the ANCHOR trial results clinically significant for managing anal HSIL in high-risk populations?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the ANCHOR trial results are clinically significant for managing anal HSIL in high-risk populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the study design and whether it answers the right question. Then, I should verify the magnitude and statistical robustness of the effect. Next, I will examine the clinical context and baseline risk to interpret absolute benefit. After that, I need to check safety, tolerability, and quality-of-life tradeoffs. Then, I should review how guidelines and policy have responded. Finally, I will consider implementation gaps and what still needs to be proven, before synthesizing a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the study design and whether it addresses the key uncertainty. The ANCHOR trial was a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial in people living with HIV aged 35 years or older with biopsy-proven anal HSIL, comparing treatment (office-based ablation, excision under anesthesia, or topical fluorouracil or imiquimod) versus active monitoring with HRA every 6 months and biopsy of visible lesions annually, with progression to anal cancer as the primary endpoint, which directly tests whether treating HSIL prevents invasive disease rather than just altering surrogate markers [^60dc64b0] [^ea9da533].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and statistical significance. With a median follow-up of 25.8 months, 9 cancers occurred in the treatment arm versus 21 in the active-monitoring arm, corresponding to 173 per 100,000 person-years versus 402 per 100,000 person-years, a 57% relative reduction in progression to anal cancer with treatment (95% CI 6–80%, P = 0.03 by log-rank test), and the trial was stopped early for efficacy, which strengthens confidence in the effect estimate despite the relatively short follow-up [^60dc64b0] [^ea9da533] [^31070583].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about absolute benefit without context. I should confirm baseline risk in this population. People with HIV have markedly elevated anal cancer incidence, on the order of roughly 45–90 per 100,000 person-years in MSM with HIV, and untreated HSIL in observational cohorts has shown progression rates around 1–2% per year, so a 57% relative reduction translates into a meaningful absolute risk reduction and a number needed to treat that is clinically compelling in this high-risk group [^5d290d3d] [^39a3e759] [^31070583].

> I need to check safety and tolerability next. Serious adverse events did not differ between arms, and most treatment-related events were mild pain or bleeding; importantly, a nested quality-of-life analysis showed transient worsening of physical symptoms and psychological impact immediately after treatment that returned to baseline by 28 days, supporting the acceptability of office-based ablation in routine care when coupled with appropriate counseling and analgesia [^60dc64b0] [^fb54ef0c].

> Next, I should review how guidelines have incorporated these findings. NCCN now cites ANCHOR as evidence that treating anal HSIL reduces progression to cancer and supports ablative therapy, particularly office-based electrocautery, as a reasonable first-line approach, while HIV OI guidelines similarly endorse office-based hyfrecation as a first-line option given low serious adverse event rates and clear benefit, reflecting a shift from weak recommendations to stronger, evidence-based practice statements [^31070583] [^1da42af6] [^edf6e075] [^7818ede9].

> But wait, what about implementation and access. I should double-check the real-world barriers. High-resolution anoscopy capacity remains limited, and loss to follow-up after HRA is substantial in many programs, so while ANCHOR proves efficacy, scaling screening and treatment requires workforce development, retention strategies, and systems to track recurrence, which is crucial because recurrence of HSIL after treatment is common and mandates surveillance intervals tailored to risk [^ceb699ab] [^f5d64663] [^296b82e6].

> I will now examine uncertainties and what still needs to be proven. The trial enrolled only people with HIV aged 35 or older, so generalizability to HIV-negative populations, younger patients, or those with immunosuppression from other causes remains uncertain; longer-term follow-up is needed to confirm durability of cancer risk reduction, and head-to-head trials comparing ablation modalities or integrating biomarkers to personalize treatment and surveillance are ongoing, so clinicians should communicate these limitations during shared decision-making [^60dc64b0] [^1da5e8aa] [^4ed0ffd8].

> Let me synthesize the clinical significance. ANCHOR is the first randomized trial to demonstrate that treating anal HSIL reduces progression to invasive anal cancer by about half in people with HIV, with acceptable short-term quality-of-life impacts and no excess serious adverse events, providing the causal evidence base that was missing for decades and enabling guideline-endorsed, office-based ablation to become standard of care for this population, while highlighting the urgent need to build HRA capacity and retention infrastructure to realize population-level benefits [^60dc64b0] [^31070583] [^edf6e075] [^ceb699ab].

---

The ANCHOR trial is **clinically significant** because it provides the first randomized evidence that treating anal HSIL in people with HIV reduces progression to anal cancer by 57% (173 vs 402 per 100,000 person-years; RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20–0.94) [^60dc64b0] [^31070583]. This establishes a **standard of care** for HIV-positive patients with biopsy-proven HSIL, shifting management from observation to active treatment [^edf6e075]. The trial also shows that office-based ablation is safe and feasible, with low serious adverse event rates, and supports screening and treatment programs in high-risk populations [^edf6e075] [^f24a8bc4].

## Clinical significance of the ANCHOR trial

### Primary outcome: reduction in anal cancer incidence

- **Progression to anal cancer**: The trial found a 57% reduction in progression to anal cancer with treatment compared to active monitoring (173 per 100,000 person-years vs 402 per 100,000 person-years; RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20–0.94) [^60dc64b0] [^31070583].
- **Absolute risk reduction**: The absolute risk reduction was 0.9% over a median follow-up of 25.8 months, with a cumulative incidence of 0.9% in the treatment group versus 1.8% in the active-monitoring group [^60dc64b0] [^5d290d3d].
- **Early termination**: The trial was stopped early due to the significant benefit observed, underscoring the strength of the evidence [^c0d760eb].

---

### Safety and tolerability

- **Serious adverse events**: No significant difference in serious adverse events was observed between the treatment and active-monitoring groups [^60dc64b0].
- **Office-based procedures**: Most participants received office-based ablation (e.g. electrocautery), which was associated with minimal morbidity and high acceptability [^edf6e075] [^7818ede9].
- **Quality of life**: Temporary worsening of physical symptoms and psychological functioning occurred immediately post-treatment but returned to baseline by 28 days, indicating acceptable short-term impacts [^fb54ef0c].

---

### Clinical implications and guidelines

- **Standard of care**: The ANCHOR trial has led to recommendations that treatment of anal HSIL should be the standard of care for people with HIV, replacing passive monitoring [^edf6e075] [^31070583].
- **First-line therapy**: Office-based electrocautery is recommended as a first-line treatment due to its efficacy, safety, and feasibility [^edf6e075] [^7818ede9].
- **Screening programs**: The trial supports the implementation of screening and treatment programs for high-risk populations, including people with HIV and men who have sex with men (MSM) [^c13deed0] [^ab1d81c3].

---

## Limitations and future research

- **Generalizability**: The trial included only people with HIV aged 35 years or older, so results may not generalize to HIV-negative individuals or younger populations [^60dc64b0].
- **Long-term follow-up**: Longer-term data are needed to confirm durability of benefit and assess late adverse effects [^notfound].
- **Optimal treatment modalities**: Further research is needed to determine the most effective treatment modalities and to compare different interventions directly [^4ed0ffd8].

---

The ANCHOR trial is **clinically significant** because it demonstrates that treating anal HSIL in people with HIV significantly reduces progression to anal cancer, establishing a new standard of care and supporting screening and treatment programs in high-risk populations.

### Treatment of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions to prevent anal cancer [^ea9da533]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study ANCHOR was published by Joel M Palefsky and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Anal cancer, Human papilloma virus infection, Anal squamous cell carcinoma and Human immunodeficiency virus infection. In the ANCHOR study, the trial question was: is the treatment of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions superior to active monitoring in patients with increased risk of anal cancer? In the ANCHOR study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ANCHOR study, the population was: 4446 patients (871 female, 3575 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients ≥ 35 years of age living with HIV who had biopsy-proven anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. The key exclusion criteria were history of anal cancer; anal cancer detected at screening; receipt of immunomodulatory investigational agents within 4 weeks of randomization. In the ANCHOR study, the interventions were: n = 2227 treatment (office-based ablative procedures, ablation or excision under anesthesia, or the administration of topical fluorouracil or imiquimod) n = 2219 active-monitoring (examinations for clinical observation every 6 months and biopsy of visible lesions every 12 months). In the ANCHOR study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in progression to anal cancer (173 per 100,000 p-yrs vs. 402 per 100,000 p-yrs; RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.94). In the ANCHOR study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events, serious adverse events. In the ANCHOR study, the conclusion was: in adult patients ≥ 35 years of age living with HIV who had biopsy-proven anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, treatment was superior to active-monitoring with respect to progression to anal cancer.

Purpose

The Anal Cancer/High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions Outcomes Research (ANCHOR) trial demonstrated that treating precancerous anal HSIL reduces the incidence of anal cancer by 57% in people with HIV. It remains unclear how HSIL treatment or monitoring without treatment affects patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We evaluated differences in HRQoL for individuals who were randomly assigned to active monitoring (AM) or treatment for anal HSIL.

Methods

Using an index designed and validated for use in ANCHOR, HRQoL was assessed before random assignment (T1), 2–7 days (+3 days) after random assignment/treatment (T2), and 28 days (± 7 days) after random assignment/treatment (T3).

Results

ANCHOR participants living with HIV (N = 124; mean [standard deviation, SD] age, 52.6 years [10.3]; n = 101 [81.5%] men; n = 65 [52.4%] White; n = 95 [76.6%] non-Hispanic; treatment n = 70 [56.4%]; and AM n = 54 [43.6%]) were included. Treatment arm participants had significant mean worsening from T1-T2 in physical symptoms (mean [SD] difference, 0.31 [0.51]; P = 0.0001) and impact on psychological functioning (mean [SD] difference, 0.25 [0.64]; P = 0.022) that significantly improved to T1 levels from T2-T3 (ie, mean [SD] difference, -0.25 [0.52]; P = 0.003; and mean [SD] difference, -0.07 [0.23]; P = 0.039, respectively). AM arm participants experienced significant mean improvement in impact on psychological functioning from T1-T3 (mean [SD], difference, -0.20 [0.50]; P = 0.017). After adjusting for T1, treatment arm participants had a larger mean improvement than AM arm participants in physical symptoms from T2-T3 (mean [SD] difference, -0.25 [0.52]; P = 0.024); no between-arm differences were observed for impact on physical or psychological functioning.

Conclusion

Treatment arm participants experienced significant worsening in physical symptoms and impact on psychological functioning from T1-T2 but returned to prerandomization levels by T3, indicating that any immediate anal HSIL treatment-related impacts to HRQoL are temporary. Further research is needed to determine long-term impacts of anal HSIL treatment on HRQoL.

### Recent guidelines on anal cancer screening: a systematic review [^c13deed0]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Reports have recently been published on the risk stratification of anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in several populations and the benefits of treating precancerous anal lesions to reduce the risk of progression to anal SCC. These studies have led several societies to publish new recommendations for anal cancer screening. This study systematically reviews anal cancer screening recommendations across different societies and institutes published after the ANCHOR trial.

Methods

The authors systematically reviewed society recommendations for anal cancer screening that have been published since July 2022.

Results

This study included 6 publications: 3 societies made recommendations only for individuals living with HIV, and 3 made recommendations for other high-risk groups, such as women with vulvar cancer/high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) and female transplant recipients. Four societies recommended anal cytology, with or without human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, as the first screening method. One society recommended anal cytology, HPV testing, or cotesting as possible options, while 1 suggested HPV type 16 testing. Only 1 society has made recommendations on screening discontinuation. High-resolution anoscopy was recommended during follow-ups for individuals with abnormal results, although the referral threshold varied between societies according to the screening method results. All societies that mentioned anal HSIL treatment recommended it. Four societies expanded their recommendations beyond screening and treatment to include smoking cessation and/or HPV vaccination.

Conclusions

Currently, there are several recommendations for anal cancer screening that include target groups, screening methods, treatment, follow-up, and other anal SCC prevention methods.

### DNA high-risk HPV, mRNA HPV and P16 tests for diagnosis of anal cancer and precursor lesions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5d290d3d]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2020, there were 50,865 newly diagnosed cases of anal cancer worldwide and this number is predicted to increase to 78,000 in 2040, according to "Cancer Tomorrow" on the Global Cancer Observatory. The most common histological subtype is squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) with an annual incidence of 0.5–2.0 in 100,000. Anal cancer prevention has two critical points: the incidence rate is several fold higher for some groups, such as people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and men who have sex with men (MSM), and there is not a well-defined guideline for its screening. According to a previous meta-analysis, the incidence of anal cancer is 45.9 per 100,000 for MSM living with HIV, and 5.1 per 100,000 for MSM without HIV. Early diagnosis is possible if anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) are identified before the development of anal squamous cell cancer. Screening tests for anal cancer could make this disease one of the most easily preventable malignant tumours. Currently, screening is not well-defined since was not clear how much untreated high-grade lesions could progress to invasive cancer. However, the recent publication of the first ANCHOR study results, performed with 4446 persons living with HIV, showed that among participants with biopsy-proven anal HSIL, the cumulative incidence of progression to anal cancer at 48 months was 0.9% in the treatment group and 1.8% in the active-monitoring groups.

### Imiquimod for anal high grade intraepithelial neoplasia: a systematic review [^7576a238]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Since the publication of the ANCHOR study, it has been established that treating anal HSIL in people living with HIV individuals who are 35 years or older reduces the risk of progression to invasive ASCC. In this trial, 4446 participants with anal HSIL were randomly assigned to either treatment (office-based ablative procedures, ablation or excision under anesthesia, or the administration of topical 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod) or active monitoring group. The rate of progression was 57% lower in the treatment group (173 per 100,000 person-years vs. 402 per 100,000 person-years). However, the study was not designed to compare efficacy between different treatments, and most guidelines do not specify the best treatment for anal HSIL.

In our systematic review we summarized the literature regarding imiquimod use for anal HSIL treatment, both perianal/intra-anal. Imiquimod can be proposed as a safe treatment of anal HSIL, with reported complete response rates ranging between 14.3–78.6%, and 21.4–67% partial response. Perianal HSIL may benefit more from imiquimod treatment, since they show superior response rates compared to intra-anal lesions (perianal HSIL CR ranging from 71.4% to 100%, intra-anal HSIL CR 10.8%− 33.3%).

### Treatment of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions to prevent anal cancer [^60dc64b0]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

The incidence of anal cancer is substantially higher among persons living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) than in the general population. Similar to cervical cancer, anal cancer is preceded by high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). Treatment for cervical HSIL reduces progression to cervical cancer; however, data from prospective studies of treatment for anal HSIL to prevent anal cancer are lacking.

Methods

We conducted a phase 3 trial at 25 U.S. sites. Persons living with HIV who were 35 years of age or older and who had biopsy-proven anal HSIL were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either HSIL treatment or active monitoring without treatment. Treatment included office-based ablative procedures, ablation or excision under anesthesia, or the administration of topical fluorouracil or imiquimod. The primary outcome was progression to anal cancer in a time-to-event analysis. Participants in the treatment group were treated until HSIL was completely resolved. All the participants underwent high-resolution anoscopy at least every 6 months; biopsy was also performed for suspected ongoing HSIL in the treatment group, annually in the active-monitoring group, or any time there was concern for cancer.

Results

Of 4459 participants who underwent randomization, 4446 (99.7%) were included in the analysis of the time to progression to cancer. With a median follow-up of 25.8 months, 9 cases were diagnosed in the treatment group (173 per 100,000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI] 90 to 332) and 21 cases in the active-monitoring group (402 per 100,000 person-years; 95% CI, 262 to 616). The rate of progression to anal cancer was lower in the treatment group than in the active-monitoring group by 57% (95% CI, 6 to 80; P = 0.03 by log-rank test).

Conclusions

Among participants with biopsy-proven anal HSIL, the risk of anal cancer was significantly lower with treatment for anal HSIL than with active monitoring. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02135419.).

### Squamous cell carcinoma of the anus incidence, mortality, and survival among the general population and persons living with HIV in puerto rico, 2000–2016 [^cd8b18ca]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Regarding the 5-year relative survival rate of SCCA, our study showed a 5-year survival of 66.8% for the general population and 56.9% for PLWH. Although caution is recommended with these comparisons, our estimates are consistent with the national estimates of 68.3% among the general population of the United States. It has been shown that SCCA has better survival than other anal cancer histologies, which could affect the comparison between SCCA and anal cancer survival.

Meanwhile, those diagnosed in a regional and distant stage had a higher risk of death than those who were diagnosed in a localized stage. The fact that SCCA survival in this population was influenced by the stage of diagnosis, rather than HIV status, highlights the importance of prevention and early detection since an anal cancer diagnosis is often delayed as a result of confounding symptoms with other rectal conditions, which demonstrates the necessity to prevent this malignancy through screening and HPV vaccination. Nonetheless, this is concerning as currently no national evidence-based screening guidelines are available for anal cancer screening. Some expert groups recommend anal cytology as a primary screening tool for at-risk groups, such as PLWH, in settings where high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) followed by the treatment of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) is available;, however, the harms versus benefits of screening these individuals and optimal screening algorithms still remain unclear. – National studies such as the ANCHOR trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:) are currently evaluating the efficacy of treating anal HSIL for SCCA prevention. One of the biggest obstacles for the implantation of an anal cancer screening program is that the HRA is difficult to perform and involves additional training for the physicians. Currently, the number of clinicians with adequate experience for diagnosing and managing anal precancerous lesions remains inadequate. Educational efforts to train physicians should be a priority for implementing anal cancer screening programs.

Anal cancer screening

The incidence of anal cancer has been increasing for the past decade and disproportionately affects certain at-risk groups, including PWH. The results of the recently completed ANCHOR trial demonstrate a nearly 60% reduction in anal cancer in PWH when their anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) were treated compared with monitoring alone. These results highlight a critical need to identify and treat anal dysplasia to prevent progression to anal cancer.

Currently, there are no evidenced-based recommendations to guide anal cancer screening or surveillance, which can be invasive and potentially distressing to patients. Notwithstanding, many experts recommend routine screening in high-risk populations, such as PWH. Screening measures involve some combination of digital rectal examinations, anal cytology with or without HPV testing, and high-resolution anoscopy. Each of these screening modalities has limitations. Accordingly, further research into clinically useful, objective markers is needed to increase the precision of risk estimates in identifying anal HSIL, as this has the potential to improve screening algorithms by reducing unneeded burdensome examinations.

The CD4 + /CD8 + cell ratio is a promising immunologic marker for stratifying which patients to screen and individualizing surveillance intervals. Lower ratios have been associated with increased rates of anal cancer, which has now been extensively validated in multiple populations. A shared decision-making approach to anal cancer screenings has been advocated based on risk factors. If such an approach is used, certainly one of the most well validated risk factors is the CD4 + /CD8 + cell ratio (both the nadir as well as the nearest ratio value). Many anal cancer screening and surveillance protocols suggest ranges for time intervals between exams/treatments. Consequently, anal screening and surveillance should be at more aggressive intervals in PWH with low ratios as both the current ratio, as well as duration below a threshold, indicates increased risk of anal cancer when compared with those with higher ratios. Notably, while fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy allows ratio normalization in some, it does not do this universally and immune recovery as assessed by normalized CD4 + cell counts alone, is not associated with decreased risk of anal neoplasia.

### Understanding sexual and gender minority populations and organ-based screening recommendations for human papillomavirus-related cancers [^c0d760eb]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Until recently, formal recommendations for screening for anal cancer among high-risk individuals were lacking, because of a dearth of evidence that treating high-grade precancerous lesions (anal HSIL) would ultimately decrease the risk of progression to anal cancer. The Anal Cancer-HSIL Outcomes Research (ANCHOR) trial was a large-scale, multicenter randomized control trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment of anal HSIL among 4,446 individuals 35 years and older LWH. Most ANCHOR participants were members of SGM populations. The results showed a 57% reduction in the rate of progression to cancer in the treatment group versus the group undergoing active monitoring, and the trial was stopped early because of this treatment efficacy, bolstering the argument for screening and the need for clear screening recommendations. At this time, screening recommendations are being formulated for release by the IANS.

Anal HPV in TGW and MSM

Among TGW, anal HPV infection may be nearly ubiquitous, with detection rates for any anal HPV as high as 97%. HIV co-infection seems to accentuate these risks; in a study of 85 TGW and MSM, any anal HPV was detected in 100% of HIV-infected participants, and hrHPV was detected in 94% of participants. In the same study, 70% of participants tested positive for the oncogenic HPV subtype 16 and/or 18. It should, however, be acknowledged that this study, like many in the literature, aggregated TGW and MSM based on shared risk behavior (penile-anal sex) but was underpowered to determine risks unique to TGW. Importantly, while anal HPV is highly prevalent among TGW, Meites et al. demonstrated that only a minority (8%) of sexually active TGW will test positive for all HPV subtypes covered in the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, indicating that HPV vaccination would still provide protection.

### Imiquimod for anal high grade intraepithelial neoplasia: a systematic review [^f867d830]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion is the precursor of anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC). Anal cancer progresses similarly to cervical cancer, with reported incidence rates markedly increasing to 2–3 cases per 100.000 people/year worldwide. HPV infection is the major etiological factor in ASCC development, being detected in more than 90% of specimens, and with HPV 16, 18 and 33 the most frequent genotypes.

Risk factors for AIN development include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, receptive anal intercourse, cigarette smoking, and anal warts. Some specific populations are at higher risk of AIN, notably people living with HIV (PLWH), men who have sex with men (MSM), women with previous diagnosis of vulvar cancer or precancer, and solid organ transplant recipients.

Analogously to cervical oncogenesis, AIN is graded into low-grade (LSIL or AIN 1) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL, encompassing p16 positive AIN 2 and AIN 3).

The primary focus of treatment is addressing potentially precancerous anal HSILs to reduce the risk of progression, which reaches 14.1% in PLWH compared to 3.2% in people without HIV. Anal HSIL treatment is recommended based on the results of the ANCHOR study, which demonstrated that treatment of HSIL reduces the incidence of ASCC in PLWH compared to active monitoring. Several treatment modalities have been described with the choice largely driven by local availability and clinician preference, due to the lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Treatment options include excisional surgery, ablative treatments (e.g. infrared coagulation, cryotherapy, LASER ablation) or topical treatments (e.g. imiquimod, fluorouracil, cidofovir, and trichloroacetic acid).

PREVENTION AND RISK REDUCTION

Behavior Modification

Our literature search found no intervention trials of behavioral modification, including dietary changes, condom use, or tobacco cessation, for lower anogenital tract cancer risk reduction. A prospective trial of 82 newly sexually active women found that the women were 70% less likely to have HPV infection if they reported condom use 100% rather than less than 5% of the time (adjusted hazard ratio 0.3, 95% CI 0.1–0.6). Tobacco cessation is recommended for all adults. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that smoking cessation be encouraged for all people with VIN.

Lower Anogenital Tract Cancer Precursor Lesions

Our review found no studies with vaginal or vulvar cancer outcomes after surveillance for or treatment of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) or VIN. People with a history of cervical cancer or CIN 2–3 are at increased risk of vaginal cancer. ASCCP guidelines recommend surveillance with HPV-based testing for 25 years in patients after hysterectomy who have a diagnosis of CIN 2 or worse. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends treating all vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL).

A 2021 systematic review concludes that, "… there was no clinical evidence within the literature advocating that treating AIN [anal intraepithelial neoplasia] does prevent ASCC [anal squamous cell carcinoma]" in people at average risk. The ANCHOR (Anal Cancer HSIL Outcomes Research) study, a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) of people with HIV published after a systematic review, demonstrated that treatment of anal intraepithelial neoplasia 2–3 in this population was associated with a 57% decrease (95% CI 6–80%) of progression to cancer compared with expectant management. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons recommends ablating anal intraepithelial neoplasia 2–3 for anal cancer prevention (weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence).

Lichen Sclerosis

A prospective study of 507 patients with lichen sclerosis demonstrated a significant decrease in VIN 2 or worse in patients who were compliant (no cases) compared with partially compliant (seven cases, 4.7%) with long-term topical steroid use. The British Association of Dermatologist's guidelines, endorsed by ACOG, recommend initial treatment with clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment for 3 months with topical steroids as needed for recurrent symptoms after that time.

### The value of routine histopathological examination after haemorrhoidectomy in patients at low and high risk of anal squamous intraepithelial lesions and cancer [^d1314c7c]. Colorectal Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The largest group of patients with aSIL in our study were low‐risk patients with LSIL. There is no study in the literature which has reported the benefit of formal surveillance programmes for this cohort, and there is no consensus recommendation available to guide management. With time, the majority of LSIL is thought to completely regress or it may remain quiescent. A smaller portion of patients with LSIL are at risk of developing a subsequent diagnosis of HSIL and therefore risk future clinical progression to aSCC. The risk of progression from low‐grade to high‐grade disease is unclear and the clinical implications of LSIL detected even in high‐risk patients are not well defined. Current international guidelines do not currently recommend formal regimented surveillance and treatment for LSIL above regular medical history and physical examination. Contrary to the conventional practice of reassurance and discharge for patients with LSIL, for the last decade our colorectal department has recommended regular surveillance and treatment for all patients with anal dysplasia, including LSIL, through high‐resolution anoscopy guided biopsy and ablation at regular intervals. We will be reporting the findings of our surveillance programme, in low‐risk and high‐risk patients with anal dysplasia, in a subsequent publication.

The recently published findings of the ANCHOR trial indicate that active treatment in HIV‐positive patients with HSILs reduces the progression to anal cancer by 57% compared to active monitoring without treatment. Without active treatment, previous studies indicate that the malignant progression rate of HSILs to aSCC varies between 8.6% and 19.6% during a follow‐up period of up to 5 years. High‐risk patients are acknowledged to be more susceptible to malignant transformation. This evidence base underscores the critical importance of early detection and management of HSILs, particularly in high‐risk populations. Identification of HSILs offers an opportunity to initiate high‐resolution anoscopy surveillance and management, to enhance clinical outcomes and to mitigate the risk of anal cancer development in this vulnerable group. Consequently, the debate regarding the significance of HSIL detection has been substantially resolved.

### High prevalence of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and prevention through human papillomavirus vaccination, in young men who have sex with men living with human immunodeficiency virus [^1b28801e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Consistent with our previous report showing high rates of anal HPV infection in MSMLWH, here we report that more than 34% of this population had anal HSILs at screening for this qHPV vaccination study. Further, among those without anal HSILs who were enrolled in the study, 74% had LSILs. The significance of having an HSIL at a young age is unknown because the incidence of anal cancer is low in those younger than 26 years and prospective studies of anal HSILs in this group have not been performed. Studies are needed to inform guidelines to recommend screening, such as the Anal Cancer/HSIL Outcomes Research (ANCHOR) Study, which is designed to determine if screening for and treating anal HSILs is effective in reducing the incidence of anal cancer. Similar to other, older populations, anal cytology in young MSMLWH had limited sensitivity for the detection of HSILs (Supplementary Table 1), unless the threshold for screening included Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), and anal cytology underestimated the level of disease detected.

We found that, among participants without anal HSILs detected at screening, a substantial proportion had already been exposed to qHPV vaccine types, particularly HPV6 (78%) and 16 (47%). However, despite the high rate of prior exposure to vaccine HPV types, more than half of young MSMLWH were DNA- and seronegative for HPV16, the type predominantly associated with anal cancer, and therefore could be protected if vaccinated.

Little is known about the performance of the qHPV vaccine in young MSMLWH. Similar to data reported in older women living with HIV, our data demonstrate that there were no cases of incident qHPV vaccine type–associated hLSILs or hHSILs among naive vaccinated individuals during the 2-year duration of the study. There was also a statistically significant reduction in HPV16-associated hHSILs among individuals naive to HPV16 compared with previously exposed individuals, a clinically important finding given the dominant role of HPV16 in the pathogenesis of anal cancer. The significance of the 3 cases of incident-persistent HPV16 infection is not clear at this time. Further follow-up would have been needed to determine if this became associated with an incident lesion.

### International consensus to define outcomes for trials of chemoradiotherapy for anal cancer (CORMAC-2): defining the outcomes from the CORMAC core outcome set [^cd014e45]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The number of participants at the consensus meeting was relatively small compared to the number of participants in the Delphi questionnaire. Consensus meeting participants had to have completed both rounds of the Delphi questionnaire to ensure that all participants were fully informed and engaged with the complex topics to be discussed. The number of consensus meeting participants was carefully considered to balance meaningful engagement and discussion between participants with adequate representation from a spectrum of healthcare professionals. Care was taken not the allow a small number of consensus meeting participants to overturn the results of a larger consensus from the Delphi. Only outcome definitions had not reached consensus through the Delphi or in need of further clarification were discussed and voted on at the consensus meeting.

CORMAC has been cited in updates and studies in the field of ASCC but has yet to be cited in new trial protocols. CORMAC-2 addresses the lack of accompanying definitions and outcome measurement recommendations for disease activity and survival, but recommendations for measurement instruments for toxicity and life-impact outcomes are still pending. This is an area of active research in ASCC. Since the original CORMAC-COS was published, the QLQ-ANL27 health-related quality of life questionnaire for anal cancer has now completed final international validation. The ANCHOR trial, which found that the risk of ASCC was reduced with treatment for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions compared to active monitoring in patients living with HIV, developed a validated health-related symptom index which may have relevance to patients undergoing CRT for ASCC. The next phase of CORMAC will be to complete an evaluation of available instruments and recommend specific measurement instruments.

Utilisation of the CORMAC-COS and CORMAC-2 standardised definitions in future trials could significantly improve the quality and utility of data available to inform clinical care. Incorporating them in PLATO and ECOG-DECREASE clinical trials is planned and will further promote awareness and uptake. Data sharing projects such as atomCAT, which uses distributed learning to compare factors associated with outcomes in anal cancer across international centres, will greatly benefit from standardised outcome definitions.

In conclusion, by agreeing on definitions for outcomes in the domains of disease activity and survival, CORMAC-2 will facilitate greater use of the CORMAC COS, increasing outcome standardisation across trials, increasing the quality of data available for clinical decision-making, and ultimately enhancing patient care.

Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) and anal cancer — the ANCHOR study was not designed to compare different treatment modalities for efficacy, but almost all participants were treated with office-based ablation of HSIL, most often hyfrecation; the rate of treatment-associated serious adverse events was very low, and office-based hyfrecation is therefore a reasonable first-line approach to treatment of anal HSIL (AI). Those with anal cancer should be referred to Oncology for appropriate treatment.

Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) treatment — electrocautery and outcomes: Most participants in the ANCHOR Study were treated with office-based, targeted electrocautery, indicating that this approach could be considered as a first line of therapy. An earlier randomized controlled trial in 246 MSM with HIV found that electrocautery was superior to both topical imiquimod and topical fluorouracil in the treatment of AIN overall; the subgroup with perianal AIN appeared to respond better to imiquimod. Regardless of treatment, recurrence rates were high, and careful follow-up is likely needed.

1 Introduction

Since the 1970s, the incidence of anal cancer has been increasing in the United States and Europe, accounting for 2.7% of all digestive cancers, with an overall incidence rate of 1.7 per 100,000 person‐years. This risk is significantly higher in certain populations, particularly among people living with HIV (PLHIV), where it exceeds 60 per 100,000 person‐years. Within this group, men who have sex with men (MSM) are the most affected, with an anal cancer incidence ranging from 89 to 144 cases per 100,000 individuals.

Anal carcinoma is considered an opportunistic malignancy in PLHIV, primarily associated with persistent infection by high‐risk human papillomavirus (HPV), similarly to what has been observed in cervical cancer. The progression to cancer originates from precursor lesions such as high‐grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN II–III) or high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), which develop at the squamocolumnar junction of the anal canal. Persistent infection with high‐risk HPV (hHPV), particularly HPV‐16, has been identified as a key factor in the development of anal cancer, along with other risk factors such as sexually transmitted infections, a history of cervical cancer in cisgender women, dysplastic lesions, smoking, and older age. Although the progression of anal HSIL to invasive carcinoma is less common than in cervical HSIL, it has been well documented in PLHIV. Screening programs for cervical HSIL have demonstrated efficacy leading to the implementation of anal HSIL screening strategies in PLHIV, though current recommendations remain heterogeneous. The ANCHOR trial provided strong evidence that HSIL treatment in PLHIV significantly reduces the risk of progression to anal cancer, reinforcing the need for structured screening programs.

### Prevention of anal cancer [^5f0d9d3a]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Anal cancer, though rare, is witnessing an annual increase in incidence, predominantly of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Prevention strategies revolve around reducing risk factors such as human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, immunosuppression, smoking, and high-risk sexual practices, while advocating for HPV vaccination. The Anal Cancer-HSIL Outcomes Research trial validates treating anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion to curb SCC development. Screening methods include digital anal rectal examination, anal Papanicolaou smear, HPV testing, and high-resolution anoscopy. However, standardized screening guidelines are lacking, necessitating future efforts to streamline protocols and enhance public awareness of anal cancer.

### Factors affecting clinical outcomes among patients infected with HIV and anal cancer treated with modern definitive chemotherapy and radiation therapy [^6059ab7d]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study has limitations, given its retrospective nature and single-institution cohort. Although our study cohort incorporates one of the larger sample sizes of patients with HIV infection and anal cancer in the modern era, the overall number of patients may be too small to detect relationships between CD4 counts and oncologic outcomes, such as local recurrence or OS. One strength of our study is that our population contains a significant proportion of Black patients. Such a patient distribution in race is important, because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that, in 2018, Black subjects made up 42% of the 37,968 new HIV diagnoses in the United States and dependent areas. More specifically, 26% of the new HIV diagnoses were among Black gay and bisexual men. With the rates of anal cancer incidence and HIV infection continuing to rise, it is likely that we will continue to see an increase in Black PWLHA diagnosed with anal cancer.

Of note, the majority of our patients were treated with IMRT. The one acute grade 5 toxicity was seen in a patient with stage III cancer who was treated with 3-dimensional fields initially. The patient did not complete treatment secondary to septic shock, which was likely related to severe desquamation in the groin from RT and pancytopenia from 5FU/MMC. However, direct comparisons between IMRT versus 3DCRT cannot be made with the limited numbers of patients treated with 3DCRT.

One strategy to improve toxicity and outcomes in PLWHA with anal cancer is focusing on anal cancer prevention. The recent findings of the randomized controlled Anal Cancer/HSIL Outcomes Research (ANCHOR) trial have been encouraging. The study was conducted in PLWHA with precursor lesions and determined that the removal of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions significantly reduced the chances of progression to anal cancer compared with those on active monitoring. Thus, more attention toward early detection and screening in this high-risk population is warranted.

While anal cancer is somewhat rare, it is increasing in incidence despite improving screening and the human papillomavirus vaccine. Given this, there is growing research into the management of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion as well as how to optimize screening approaches. This includes increased study of biomarkers to improve screening sensitivity as well as strategies to improve access and reduce loss to follow-up. Additionally, there is an ongoing research into the role of the microbiome in oncogenesis and research to adapt other treatments to anal cancer.

Vaginal Cancer Screening

We found no studies about screening for vaginal cancer or cancer precursors in populations at high risk. ASCCP recommends that women who have undergone hysterectomy and have a history of CIN 2, CIN 3, or adenocarcinoma in situ have ongoing surveillance at 3-year intervals for a total of 25 years. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states that routine vaginal cancer screening is not recommended for women with HIV after a hysterectomy for benign disease. They recommend annual vaginal cuff Pap tests in patients after hysterectomy for high-grade CIN, adenocarcinoma in situ, or invasive cervical cancer. They recommend continued screening in patients not known to have had a hysterectomy for benign indications. The Infectious Diseases Society of America states, "Following hysterectomy for benign disease, routine screening for vaginal cancer is not recommended for persons with HIV. Those with a history of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), adenocarcinoma in situ, or invasive cervical cancer should be followed with annual vaginal cuff Pap tests". Recommendations for solid-organ transplantations comment on inspection of the vagina at the time of cervical screening.

Anal Cancer Screening

We found two studies pertinent to anal cancer screening in women with HIV. The ANCHOR study was an RCT that included 4,459 people with HIV who were diagnosed with anal HSIL on the basis of high-resolution anoscopy–directed biopsies. Eight hundred sixty participants (19.2%) were women living with HIV. After randomization, 2,237 patients underwent immediate treatment for anal HSIL, either through in-office ablation, ablation, or excision under anesthesia or through topical medical treatment with imiquimod or fluorouracil. They returned for repeat high-resolution anoscopy at least every 6 months after treatment. The active-monitoring group consisted of 2,222 patients who underwent high-resolution anoscopy every 6 months. Nine patients in the treatment group and 21 patients in the active-monitoring group were diagnosed with anal cancer. The observed rate of progression to cancer in the treatment group was 173 per 100,000 person-years, whereas it was 402 per 100,000 person-years in the active-monitoring group. The rate of progression to anal cancer decreased by 57% in patients who underwent treatment (95% CI 6–80%; P = 0.03).

### To improve motivational barriers to retention in high resolution anoscopy, patients and providers recommend social and environmental changes: a sequential explanatory mixed-methods pilot study in a federally qualified health center [^ceb699ab]. AIDS and Behavior (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of anal cancer has increased almost two-fold over the last 50 years, and the disease has attracted more attention as the medical field seeks to understand how to prevent anal cancer among those at most risk. More than 80% of anal cancers are caused by infection with specific genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV), which can progress from anal neoplasia to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), the precursor to squamous cell carcinoma of the anus. This progression is highly pronounced among people with HIV (PWH), who experience elevated risk for the development of anal cancer. For this reason, practice and policy organizations in the US recommend that PWH who are diagnosed with anal neoplasia be additionally screened for HSIL via high resolution anoscopy (HRA). HRA-directed biopsy allows providers to identify, treat and monitor HSIL before it can progress to cancer. The ANCHOR Study (Anal Cancer–HSIL Outcomes Research Study), a multiyear randomized controlled trial, recently proved the efficacy of treatment to prevent anal cancer. Its findings are expected to allow stakeholders to coalesce around national guidelines, recommending HRA as standard of care for anal cancer prevention among PWH.

The prevention of anal cancer among PWH will require their ongoing engagement in HRA, yet HRA programs that operate without the benefit of research infrastructure and incentivization report notably high losses to follow-up after the procedure. In one large health system in California, fifty-percent of patients did not return after their initial HRA visit. Two New York City HRA programs, in distinct medical systems, found that 42% of patients with HSIL did not return for their follow-up HRA visits. In a similar cohort study at Johns Hopkins, only 26% of eligible patients underwent HRA and, in a Boston sample, only 32% of patients returned for follow-up HRA within the clinic's recommended 6-month period. As healthcare systems adopt HRA as standard of care, we will need to better understand the causes of this poor retention as well as identify potential solutions, if HRA is to reach its potential to contribute to the prevention of anal cancer.

### Comparison of anal cancer screening strategies including standard anoscopy, anal cytology, and HPV genotyping in HIV-positive men who have sex with men [^ee608f8c]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Acceptability by the patient and the physician is a major concern for the success of a screening program. We and others have shown that more than 50% of HIV-MSM had never undergone any anal screening test, despite recommendations. Among explanations, lack of information by physicians and lack of time/motivation were highlighted. Therefore, it is likely that a screening strategy allows self-sampling would be more acceptable. Anal Pap self-sampling has been shown to be acceptable and efficient as a screening strategy, whereas HPV genotyping self-sampling is currently being studied.

Finally, the interest of screening HGAIN is still unresolved as it has never been shown that such screening could lead to a decrease in cancer incidence, morbidity, or mortality. The natural history of anal cancer is still an unresolved issue. Progression from HGAIN to cancer is not known, and probably lower than in cervical neoplasia. Based on a meta-analysis, Machalek et al. report a theoretical rate of progression of high grade anal dysplastic lesions (or HSIL) of 1/377 (0.27%) among HIV-MSM and 1/4 196 (0.024%) among HIV-uninfected MSM. Moreover, regression of HGAIN have been described either spontaneously or with immune restoration under ART.

There is a need for prospective longitudinal and intervention studies to assess the interest of treating HGAIN in preventing the occurrence of cancer. Indeed, studies evaluating therapeutic intervention on HGAIN were mostly retrospective, not controlled, or too small. Only one small randomised trial had tested Imiquimod versus placebo in 64 patients. However, the primary outcome in this study was the regression of HGAIN; progression to cancer was not assessed. Nevertheless, as for detection of cervical lesions, screening programs in HIV-MSM have been suggested as being effective to decrease SCCA incidence. The ongoing ANCHOR study (NCT02135419), currently recruiting more than 5000 HIV patients with HGAIN, randomised into two arms: experimental arm (topical or ablative treatment of lesions) or monitoring every 6 months, will provide a better understanding of the natural history of HGAIN and relevance of treatment.

### Screening for anal cancer among men who have sex with men with HIV: benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness analyses [^ab1d81c3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Following the success of the ANCHOR (Anal Cancer-HSIL Outcomes Research) trial, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends anal cancer screening for high-risk persons, particularly men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV.

Objective

To quantify the cost-effectiveness and benefits versus harms of different anal cancer screening strategies.

Design

Microsimulation model.

Data Sources

The ANCHOR trial and published literature.

Target Population

MSM with HIV.

Time Horizon

Lifetime.

Perspective

Health care sector.

Intervention

Cytology alone and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing (high-risk HPV [hrHPV], HPV16/18, and HPV16), co-testing, and triage options; ages at which to begin screening (≥ 35, ≥ 40, or ≥ 45 years); screening interval (annual, biennial, triennial, or quadrennial).

Outcome Measures

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and the tradeoff of harms (high-resolution anoscopies [HRAs]) versus benefits (cancer cases averted and life-years gained).

Results Of Base-Case Analysis

Screening initiation at age 35 years or older using cytology dominated initiation at ages 40 and 45 years or older, with ICERs ranging from $87731 for a quadrennial interval to $350100 for an annual interval. In the comparative analysis, the following unique strategies were on the cost-effectiveness frontier: quadrennial HPV16, quadrennial HPV16/18, triennial HPV16/18, triennial hrHPV, biennial HPV16/18, biennial hrHPV, annual cytology with hrHPV triage, and annual hrHPV; ICERs ranged from $81341 to $2510847. In the harm-to-benefit analysis, triage options offered the most efficient HRA use.

Results Of Sensitivity Analysis

ICERs decreased for newly eligible persons. For 35-year-old newly eligible MSM with HIV, ICERs for cytology ranged from $70750 (quadrennial) to $223895 (annual).

Limitation

Findings are not generalizable to other high-risk populations.

Conclusion

Anal cancer screening among MSM with HIV aged 35 years or older is cost-effective, but value-based prioritization of strategies is needed to optimize screening use.

### The importance of anal cancer screening and high-resolution anoscopy to gastroenterology practice [^f5d64663]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although human papillomavirus (HPV)-related anal squamous cell cancer (ASCC) is rare, its incidence has been rising and in high-risk populations exceeds the incidence of cancers for which screening programs are implemented. Therefore, targeted screening techniques are being evaluated with high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) as the current gold standard because of its ability to detect anal intraepithelial dysplasia (AIN) and premalignant high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). However, a scarcity of trained providers presents a barrier to screening.

Recent Findings

ASCC incidence is rising especially in elderly women and young black men. Premalignant HSIL may not only progress to ASCC but also regress. Biomarkers such as HPV type, p16 immunostaining and DNA methylation markers may emerge as predictors of disease progression.HRA with acetic acid and Lugol's iodine staining can be used to detect HSIL and ASCC. Recent studies suggest that anal cancer screening may have an impact on the stage of ASCC at diagnosis and the incidence of anal cancer. The Anal Cancer HSIL Outcomes Research (ANCHOR) study is underway to determine whether treating HSIL effects ASCC incidence.

Summary

Although there are no consensus screening guidelines for anal cancer, it is reasonable to screen high-risk populations with physical examination, anal cytology and HRA. Gastroenterologists can support anal cancer screening programmes through identifying patients at risk, performing noninvasive screening and considering to incorporate endoscopic techniques to examine the anal canal.

Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

HPV-associated precancer — progression risk and management goals are described: The goal of clinical management is to identify and treat high-grade disease to decrease the risk of developing invasive cancer, but not all precancers will progress to cancer, and currently, we cannot predict which lesion would eventually become malignant if not treated. The 30-year progression risk of invasive cancer is 30% to 50% for untreated high-grade cervical disease, and although data are not as robust, similar progression risk is seen for untreated vulvar precancer. Similar long-term data are lacking for anal cancer precursors and other LAT squamous cancers, and long-term prospective studies of outcomes for patients with untreated high-grade precursors will be difficult to achieve.

### Screening strategies for the detection of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in women living with HIV [^aca8fc1e]. AIDS (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

HIV-infected women (WLHIV) have more than 10-fold higher risk for squamous cell cancer of the anus. Experts suggest cytology-based strategies developed for cervical cancer screening may prevent anal cancer by detecting anal cytologic or histological high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (hHSIL) for treatment. Currently, there is no consensus on anal-hHSIL screening strategies for WLHIV.

Design

Between 2014 and 2016, 276 WLHIV were recruited at 12 US AIDS Malignancy Consortium clinical trials sites to evaluate hHSIL prevalence and (test) screening strategies.

Methods

Participants completed detailed questionnaire, underwent anal assessments including high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing using hrHPV-Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) and hrHPV-APTIMA, anal cytology, and concurrent high-resolution anoscopy. Screening test characteristics for predicting hHSIL validated by central review of histologic diagnosis were estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and false-omission rate. Paired analyses compared sensitivity and specificity for hrHPV single tests to anal cytology alone.

Results

83% (229/276) of enrolled WLHIV had complete anal assessment data and were included in this analysis. Mean age was 50, 62% black and 60 (26%) had hHSIL. Anal cyotology (> atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), hrHPV-HC2, and hrHPV-APTIMA sensitivity estimates were similarly high (83, 77, and 75%, respectively, P values > 0.2). Specificity was higher for both hrHPV-APTIMA and hrHPV-HC2 compared with anal cytology (67 vs. 50%, P < 0.001) and (61 vs. 50%, P = 0.020), respectively.

Conclusion

Anal hrHPV testing demonstrated similar sensitivity for anal cytology (> atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) to predict anal hHSIL. Among tests with similar sensitivity, the specificity was significantly higher for hrHPV-APTIMA and hrHPV-HC2. Thus, anal hrHPV testing may be an important alternative strategy to anal cytology for anal hHSIL screening among WLHIV.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^74eb07a1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Populations at high risk and anal cytology/HRA — data are insufficient to recommend routine anal cancer screening with anal cytology among populations at risk for anal cancer. Certain clinical centers perform anal cytology for high-risk populations followed by high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) for abnormal results; sensitivity and specificity of anal cytology to detect HSIL are limited, with sensitivity 55%–89% and specificity 40%–67%. Health centers that initiate a cytology-based screening program should only do so if referrals to HRA and biopsy are available. HRA can be used for diagnosis of HSIL, to monitor response to therapy, or to conduct surveillance of HSIL for evidence of progression; it is the primary method used for diagnosis of superficially invasive squamous carcinoma, a very early form of anal cancer that is not palpable on DARE. However, data are insufficient to conclude whether use of HRA leads to reductions in anal cancer incidence or improves anal cancer morbidity and mortality; an ongoing clinical trial is investigating whether treatment of HSIL reduces anal cancer incidence among persons with HIV infection (NCT02135419). HPV tests (using high-risk HPV types) are not clinically useful for anal cancer screening.

Anal Squamous Intraepithelial Neoplasia in TGW and MSM

Because of limited sampling, many studies report anal squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (ASIL), which includes both anal low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and HSIL, but in studies with well-developed HRA programs, the rates of HSIL alone are approximately 5% in TGW. The largest studies of anal cytology in TGW suggest that at least 43% of TGW, including those not LWH, will have abnormal anal cytology, and the risks of cytologic anal ASIL are at least as high among TGW as they are among MSM. Among TGW LWH, anal ASIL may be nearly ubiquitous (95%), although most of these cytologic results (84%) may be low-grade abnormalities. Many TGW may have anogenital warts, likely contributing to the high rates of abnormal cytology and further underscoring the importance of screening in this population. In these studies of TGW, HPV-16 and HPV-18 were associated with greater degree of cytologic atypia. Notably, the same study observed that HIV infection was independently associated with higher viral loads of HPV-16 and HPV-18 in TGW, suggesting again that the HIV burden among TGW has widespread ramifications on risks of anal cancer.

Only 2 studies have provided histologic confirmation of anal ASIL in TGW but suggest that rates of histologic ASIL in MSM and TGW LWH may be nearly ubiquitous and are at least as high among TGW (91%) as they are among MSM (84%). Both studies also report similarly high rates of histologic anal HSIL (58%–59%). No studies to date have examined anal histology among TGW not LWH. In the ANCHOR Trial mentioned previously, one transgender individual developed anal cancer in the study (1/153 transgender participants or 0.65%), which was identical to the proportion of cisgender patients who developed anal cancer (30/4416 total participants or 0.65%).

Populations at High Risk and Anal Cytology

Data are insufficient to recommend routine anal cancer screening with anal cytology among populations at risk for anal cancer. Certain clinical centers perform anal cytology to screen for anal cancer among populations at high risk (e.g. persons with HIV infection, MSM, and those having receptive anal intercourse), followed by high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) for those with abnormal cytologic results (e.g. ACS-US, LSIL, or HSIL). Sensitivity and specificity of anal cytology to detect HSIL are limited (sensitivity 55%–89% and specificity 40%–67%). Health centers that initiate a cytology-based screening program should only do so if referrals to HRA and biopsy are available.

HRA can be used for diagnosis of HSIL, to monitor response to therapy, or to conduct surveillance of HSIL for evidence of progression. HRA is the primary method used for diagnosis of superficially invasive squamous carcinoma, a very early form of anal cancer that is not palpable on DARE. However, data are insufficient to conclude whether use of HRA leads to reductions in anal cancer incidence or improves anal cancer morbidity and mortality. An ongoing clinical trial is investigating whether treatment of HSIL is effective in reducing the incidence of anal cancer among persons with HIV infection (NCT02135419).

Human Papillomavirus Testing

HPV tests (using high-risk HPV types) are not clinically useful for anal cancer screening because of a high prevalence of anal HPV infection among populations at high risk, particularly MSM. No standard HPV-based algorithms exist for anal cancer screening, due to the high prevalence of high-risk HPV infection among groups at risk.

Treatment of Anal High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion

Multiple office-based treatments exist for anal HSIL, including ablative methods (e.g. laser, electrocautery, or infrared coagulation) and topical patient-applied therapies (e.g. imiquimod). Recurrence rates with both provider-applied and patient-applied treatments are high, ranging from approximately 50% at 1 year to 77% after 3 years. In addition, evidence exists that HSIL might spontaneously regress without treatment. Shared decision-making about treatment for anal HSIL is recommended because of limited data on the natural history of anal HSIL, including factors related to progression or regression of lesions.

### A randomized clinical trial of infrared coagulation ablation versus active monitoring of intra-anal high-grade dysplasia in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection: an AIDS malignancy consortium trial [^7fe915bc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) ablation may reduce the incidence of invasive cancer, but few data exist on treatment efficacy and natural regression without treatment.

Methods

An open-label, randomized, multisite clinical trial of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults aged ≥ 27 years with 1–3 biopsy-proven anal HSILs (index HSILs) without prior history of HSIL treatment with infrared coagulation (IRC). Participants were randomized 1:1 to HSIL ablation with IRC (treatment) or no treatment (active monitoring [AM]). Participants were followed every 3 months with high-resolution anoscopy. Treatment participants underwent anal biopsies of suspected new or recurrent HSILs. The AM participants underwent biopsies only at month 12. The primary end point was complete clearance of index HSIL at month 12.

Results

We randomized 120 participants. Complete index HSIL clearance occurred more frequently in the treatment group than in the AM (62% vs 30%; risk difference, 32%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 13%-48%; P < .001). Complete or partial clearance (clearance of ≥ 1 index HSIL) occurred more commonly in the treatment group (82% vs 47%; risk difference, 35%; 95% CI, 16%-50%; P < .001). Having a single index lesion, compared with having 2–3 lesions, was significantly associated with complete clearance (relative risk, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.22–3.10). The most common adverse events related to treatment were mild or moderate anal pain and bleeding. No serious adverse events were deemed related to treatment or study participation.

Conclusion

IRC ablation of anal HSILs results in more clearance of HSILs than observation alone.

### High prevalence of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and prevention through human papillomavirus vaccination, in young men who have sex with men living with human immunodeficiency virus [^9eeb2484]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for human papillomavirus (HPV)–related anal cancer. Little is known about the prevalence of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) and the anal cancer precursor, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), among young MSM with HIV (MSMLWH). HPV vaccination is recommended in this group, but its safety, immunogenicity, and protection against vaccine-type HPV infection and associated LSILs/HSILs have not been studied.

Methods

Two hundred and sixty MSMLWH aged 18–26 years were screened at 17 US sites for a clinical trial of the quadrivalent (HPV6,11,16,18) HPV (qHPV) vaccine. Those without HSILs were vaccinated at 0, 2, and 6 months. Cytology, high-resolution anoscopy with biopsies of lesions, serology, and HPV testing of the mouth/penis/scrotum/anus/perianus were performed at screening/month 0 and months 7, 12, and 24.

Results

Among 260 MSMLWH screened, the most common reason for exclusion was detection of HSILs in 88/260 (34%). 144 MSMLWH were enrolled. 47% of enrollees were previously exposed to HPV16. No incident qHPV type–associated anal LSILs/HSILs were detected among men naive to that type, compared with 11.1, 2.2, 4.5, and 2.8 cases/100 person-years for HPV6,11,16,18–associated LSILs/HSILs, respectively, among those previously exposed to that type. qHPV was immunogenic and safe with no vaccine-associated serious adverse events.

Conclusions

18–26-year-old MSMLWH naive to qHPV vaccine types were protected against incident qHPV type–associated LSILs/HSILs. Given their high prevalence of HSILs, there is an urgent need to vaccinate young MSMLWH before exposure to vaccine HPV types, before initiating sexual activity, and to perform catch-up vaccination.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in human immunodeficiency virus-infected adults aged 27 years or older: AIDS clinical trials group protocol A5298 [^14c9c84e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Adults living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at increased risk for anal and oropharyngeal cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). The efficacy of HPV vaccines in this population is unknown.

Methods

In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned HIV-infected adults aged ≥ 27 years to the quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) vaccine or placebo (1:1) stratified by sex and presence of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions on biopsy (bHSIL). The primary endpoint was vaccine efficacy against incident persistent anal infection with quadrivalent vaccine types or single detection at the final visit that were not present at baseline. Secondary endpoints included vaccine efficacy for anal bHSIL after week 52, persistent oral HPV infection.

Results

A total of 575 participants were randomized. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board stopped the study early due to futility. Vaccine efficacy was 22% (95.1% confidence interval [CI] -31%, 53%) for prevention of persistent anal infection or single detection at the final visit, 0% (95% CI -44%, 31%) for improving bHSIL outcomes and 88% (95.1% CI 2%, 98%) for preventing persistent oral HPV infection, but was 32% (95.1% CI -80%, 74%) for 6-month persistent oral HPV infection or single detection at the final visit.

Conclusions

These results do not support HPV vaccination of HIV-infected adults aged ≥ 27 years to prevent new anal HPV infections or to improve anal HSIL outcomes. However, our data suggest a role for prevention of oral HPV infections, but this finding should be confirmed in future studies.

### High prevalence of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and prevention through human papillomavirus vaccination, in young men who have sex with men living with human immunodeficiency virus [^646b40e6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We performed a phase II, open-label, multicenter trial of the quadrivalent HPV (qHPV; (HPV6,11,16,18) vaccine (Merck and Company, Kenilworth, NJ) in 13- to 26-year-old MSMLWH. For ethical reasons, we did not have a placebo control arm in this study. Our primary objectives were as follows (1) to compare incident HPV 6,11,16,18 infection and HPV 6,11,16,18–associated perianal/anal disease among young MSMLWH with or without exposure to these HPV types prior to vaccination and (2) to compare the data among MSMLWH without evidence of prior HPV exposure to similarly aged HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) in the placebo arm of the Merck V503-020 protocol (NCT00090285) without evidence of prior exposure. The study was conducted by the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) in collaboration with the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN). Participants were recruited between 2012 and 2015 from 15 US sites. The institutional review board for each site approved the study. Inclusion criteria included male at birth, documented HIV-1 infection, age 13 to 26 years, and at least 1 male sexual partner. We excluded those with cytologic HSIL (cHSIL), atypical squamous cells–cannot rule out HSIL (ASC-H), or histologic HSIL (hHSIL) on screening biopsy. These individuals were referred for treatment and offered the qHPV vaccine.

### Anal intraepithelial neoplasia: a review of terminology, differential diagnoses, and patient management [^11e39eff]. Human Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite the knowledge of etiological association with high-risk human papilloma viruses and high-risk patient cohorts, the incidence of anal squamous cell carcinoma has continued to rise. The known precursor lesion (in particular, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) makes it amenable to screening and surveillance strategies. However, the diagnosis of anal intraepithelial neoplasia suffers from interpretation challenges leading to high interobserver variability, along with numerous differential diagnoses and lingering terminology issues. Proper treatment of anal lesions requires accurate diagnosis, and while a variety of modalities are available for treatment, the rate of recurrence remains high and each modality has its own set of side effects and complications. The aim of this review article is to outline the diagnostic considerations and provide practical tips for diagnosing anal squamous intraepithelial lesions.

### A prospective, dual-center trial of circumferential radiofrequency ablation of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions demonstrate improved long-term efficacy over historical controls of targeted ablation [^1745797c]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Targeted ablation of anal canal high-grade dysplasia results in high recurrence over time. Circumferential radiofrequency ablation might decrease recurrence.

Objective

This study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of circumferential radiofrequency ablation for anal high-grade dysplasia.

Design

This was a dual-center, prospective trial of circumferential radiofrequency ablation with a 1-year follow-up with longer follow-up data abstracted from medical records of study patients returning after trial for surveillance. Ten participants from the identically conducted pilot circumferential radiofrequency ablation trial were included to improve sample size for longer-term analysis.

Settings

This study included 3 surgeons at 2 sites.

Patients

The study included 51 patients undergoing circumferential radiofrequency ablation for anal canal high-grade dysplasia.

Intervention

Circumferential radiofrequency ablation of anal canal high-grade dysplasia and targeted radiofrequency ablation of recurrence.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measures were circumferential radiofrequency ablation efficacy and associated morbidity.

Results

Fifty-one participants underwent circumferential radiofrequency ablation but 48 participants returned for 1 or more postprocedure high-resolution anoscopy and were evaluable. The mean age of participants was 43 years, most were male (94%), 33% were living with HIV, and 58% had 3 or more high-grade dysplasias treated. Sixty percent had no recurrence, whereas 19% had 1 recurrence, 15% had 2 recurrences, and 6% had 3 recurrences. Most recurrences (66%) developed within the first 6 months. Kaplan-Meier probability of recurrence combining both series was 19% at 3 months, 30% at 6 months, and approximately 40% after 6 months out to 30 months. Most common morbidities were pain (85.4%) lasting for a median of 21 (range, 4–91) days and bleeding (91%) lasting for a median of 21 (range, 5–87) days. Of those with pain and bleeding, 65% and 85%, respectively, described it as mild. No patients developed fistulas, stricture, or incontinence. No serious adverse events related to circumferential radiofrequency ablation occurred. Having a previous recurrence was the only significant predictor of a subsequent recurrence (HR, 28.53) for recurrence at 9 months or before.

Limitations

Enrollment ended prematurely, 10 participants from the pilot study were combined to increase the sample size, and longer-term follow-up was collected retrospectively were the limitations of this study.

Conclusions

Circumferential radiofrequency ablation has improved efficacy over targeted ablation but with increased pain and bleeding. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B973.

### Effect of human papillomavirus vaccine to interrupt recurrence of vulvar and anal neoplasia (VIVA): a trial protocol [^5938473b]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly HPV type 16, causes most anal and vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), which are precursors to cancer. After initial treatment of HSIL, more than 30% of patients will have disease recurrence, with even higher recurrence among HIV-positive individuals and men who have sex with men. Recurrences can be debilitating and lead to significant morbidity and medical expense. Observational studies suggest a possible therapeutic benefit of the licensed HPV vaccines in reducing recurrent lesions in previously infected persons.

Objective

To test whether the licensed prophylactic HPV vaccine (Gardasil-9) can reduce the risk of HSIL recurrence by 50% in previously unvaccinated individuals recently treated for anal or vulvar HSIL.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a trial protocol for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept clinical trial. Eligible participants are aged 27 to 69 at study start and have not received prior HPV vaccination, have had anal or vulvar HSIL diagnosed on or after January 1, 2014, and have no evidence of HSIL recurrence at screening. Persons infected with HIV are eligible for the study provided they are receiving antiretroviral therapy. Target enrollment is 345 individuals. The primary outcome is time to histopathologically confirmed recurrence of HSIL. Differences in the risk for recurrence of HSIL will be evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models. Additional analyses include (1) frequency of HSIL recurrence; (2) role of HPV antibodies in deterring recurrence; (3) role of HPV persistence in recurrence, as measured by HPV genotype or HPV-16 variant lineage determined using swab samples collected at months 0, 18, and 36; and (4) incidence of adverse events. The study will be conducted at the University of Washington Virology Research Clinic from 2017 through 2022. Participants will be followed up for up to 36 months in the clinic, and up to 42 months by telephone.

Discussion

Management of persistent or rapidly recurring anogenital HSIL remains challenging. Results from this study will provide evidence on whether incorporating the nonavalent HPV vaccine into routine care can decrease recurrence of anal and vulvar HSIL.

### High prevalence of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and prevention through human papillomavirus vaccination, in young men who have sex with men living with human immunodeficiency virus [^73afd396]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for human papillomavirus (HPV)-related anal cancer. Little is known about the prevalence of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) and the anal cancer precursor, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), among young MSM with HIV (MSMLWH). HPV vaccination is recommended in this group, but its safety, immunogenicity, and protection against vaccine-type HPV infection and associated LSILs/HSILs have not been studied.

Methods

Two hundred and sixty MSMLWH aged 18–26 years were screened at 17 US sites for a clinical trial of the quadrivalent (HPV6,11,16,18) HPV (qHPV) vaccine. Those without HSILs were vaccinated at 0, 2, and 6 months. Cytology, high-resolution anoscopy with biopsies of lesions, serology, and HPV testing of the mouth/penis/scrotum/anus/perianus were performed at screening/month 0 and months 7, 12, and 24.

Results

Among 260 MSMLWH screened, the most common reason for exclusion was detection of HSILs in 88/260 (34%). 144 MSMLWH were enrolled. 47% of enrollees were previously exposed to HPV16. No incident qHPV type-associated anal LSILs/HSILs were detected among men naive to that type, compared with 11.1, 2.2, 4.5, and 2.8 cases/100 person-years for HPV6,11,16,18-associated LSILs/HSILs, respectively, among those previously exposed to that type. qHPV was immunogenic and safe with no vaccine-associated serious adverse events.

Conclusions

18-26-year-old MSMLWH naive to qHPV vaccine types were protected against incident qHPV type-associated LSILs/HSILs. Given their high prevalence of HSILs, there is an urgent need to vaccinate young MSMLWH before exposure to vaccine HPV types, before initiating sexual activity, and to perform catch-up vaccination.

Key Points

Question

Can the prophylactic human papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil-9) reduce the risk of anal and vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) recurrence after treatment of the prevalent lesion?

Findings

This trial protocol describes a randomized clinical trial targeting enrollment of 345 HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults with history of anal or vulvar HSIL. The trial seeks to evaluate whether the human papillomavirus vaccine can reduce the risk of recurrence by 50% in previously unvaccinated individuals with a prior histologically confirmed anal or vulvar HSIL diagnosis.

Meaning

If successful, the licensed human papillomavirus vaccine could be incorporated with other treatment for patients with anal and vulvar HSIL to reduce the high rate of HSIL recurrence.

Risk-of-bias assessment

Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, version 2.0 for randomized controlled trials and the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies – of Interventions for nonrandomized studies of interventions. Randomized controlled trials were categorized as low, moderate, or high risk of bias. Non-randomized studies of interventions were classified as low, moderate, serious, or critical risk of bias based on Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies – of Interventions criteria. One investigator conducted the initial risk-of-bias assessment, and a second reviewer conducted a subsequent review. Any discrepancies were resolved through team consensus.

Data extraction and management

Data extraction for all studies, independent of risk-of-bias assessment, was performed using a standardized form in Microsoft Excel. Information extracted included author, year of publication, funding source, study setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, characteristics of interventions and controls, sample size, follow-up duration, participant baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, outcomes, and adverse effects. One reviewer conducted an initial data extraction, with a second reviewer verifying the accuracy of the extracted data.

Data synthesis

All included studies were organized based on key question. Within each question, further organization was carried out based on the unique comparison, outcomes analyzed, and its timing. Due to the diversity of interventions across studies and the limited number of studies for each comparison, data pooling was not feasible. Consequently, a qualitative synthesis of the data was performed.

Evaluation of the strength of evidence

The evaluation of the strength of evidence for outcome-intervention pairs was conducted in accordance with AHRQ methods. The overall strength of evidence was assigned a grade of high, moderate, low, or insufficient (Supplementary Table 3, available online). In situations where both randomized controlled trials and post hoc secondary analyses of randomized controlled trials contributed to a particular outcome, primary trials were prioritized over post hoc studies. For bodies of evidence consisting of only a single study, consistency was designated as not applicable. Given the limited amount of high-quality data, especially pertaining to key questions 2 through 6, results from outcome-intervention pairs with insufficient strength of evidence were reported. These results should be interpreted with caution, however, because their inclusion is intended to provide a comprehensive overview for the current state of the literature.

ASCRS screening with anal cytology in high-risk populations: Screening with anal cytology (or anal Papanicolaou (Pap) tests) may be considered in high-risk populations as part of a comprehensive screening program, but the sensitivity and specificity of the test do not support its use for universal screening, with Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B. High-risk groups studied include MSM, HIV-positive persons, and/or women with a history of cervical dysplasia; the sensitivity and specificity are limited because the gold standard is the finding of HSILs in biopsies, the ability of anal cytology to identify patients at risk for dysplasia is described as inconclusive, no association between anal cytology and reduced rates of anal cancer has been demonstrated, and the decision to perform anal Pap tests should be a shared decision with the patient including discussion of how abnormal tests will be evaluated.

At the same time that the clinical action thresholds were being considered, the large remaining task was to estimate the risks themselves, for the cervical screening test combinations that a clinician and patient might encounter together at a management visit after abnormal screening. In the development of the new guidelines, it was the responsibility of NCI HPV epidemiologists and statisticians to estimate the risks of precancer predicted by the large number of combinations of HPV tests and cytology, and past screening test and colposcopic biopsy results, and other possibly important factors. The main source of the risk estimates was the unique clinical database from Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), which instituted HPV/cytology cervical cotesting at 3-year intervals in their very large membership in 2003. The KPNC has uniquely detailed data and follow-up, permitting us to observe the risk of CIN 2, CIN 3, AIS, and cancer after even unusual combinations of screening test results.

The generalizability ("portability") of the estimates from the KPNC to other US populations at known higher risk of cervical cancer than KPNC was addressed by research in 4 diverse screening programs and trials. A systematic review covering items too uncommon or otherwise not addressed adequately by risk estimation was also performed.

Of note, CIN 3+ (including CIN 3 and AIS) was chosen as the working definition of precancer. Rare cancers found within a screening program were included as screening targets, recognizing however that detection of precancers is the dominant goal of screening in the United States. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 was considered too variable to serve as a surrogate end point of cancer risk. The Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology category of histologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion could not be highlighted because of lack of prospective studies using that terminology.

Clinical action thresholds were based on estimated risk of CIN 3+ at the time of the abnormal screening results ("immediate" risk) for treatment and referral to colposcopic biopsies. For surveillance thresholds, risks at 5 years were emphasized.

### Effect of human papillomavirus vaccine to interrupt recurrence of vulvar and anal neoplasia (VIVA): a trial protocol [^c91c72e7]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Persistent infection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) has been linked to 70% of vulvar and 90% of anal cancers, causing more than 45 000 cases worldwide each year. In the United States, more than 10 000 cases are diagnosed annually, and most are HPV-16 related. Incidence rates of anal and vulvar cancer have increased over the past decades in the United States, particularly among high-risk groups. Specifically, among US HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM), the incidence of anal cancer (78 of 100 000) currently exceeds the incidence of cervical cancer in sub-Saharan Africa (55 of 100 000 women). Locally invasive anal and vulvar cancers are associated with 48% and 59% 5-year survival, respectively.

Persistent HPV infection and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) are presumed to lead to HPV-related anal and vulvar cancer, analogous to the natural history of cervical HPV infections leading to cervical cancer. Incidence rates of anal and vulvar carcinoma in situ, which account for most HSIL in the United States, were 1.0 per 100 000 persons and 3.9 per 100 000 women, respectively, in 2015. The annual percentage from 2000 to 2015 increased 7.1% for anal HSIL and 0.4% for vulvar HSIL. Treatment is generally recommended for women with vulvar HSIL. However, no secondary prevention strategies to prevent progression of anal HSIL to invasive cancer have been shown to be effective, although current trials are assessing the potential utility of screening and treatment for anal HSIL (and). Treatment of anal and vulvar HSIL is variable across centers and includes ablation, excision, or topical therapies with immunomodulating agents. Following treatment for HSIL at either site, approximately 50% of lesions will recur within 5 years following treatment. Table 1 shows variation in time to recurrence. In addition, recurrence rates are reported up to 90% among HIV-infected MSM. Recurrent lesions necessitate repeated treatments and may lead to compromised quality of life, functional deficits, and high medical costs.

What does this paper add to the literature?

Progression of high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) to anal cancer is feared. Data on the remission of HSILs are scarce. The absence of human papillomavirus 16 at referral, the absence of endoanal lesions and treatment by excision are associated with remission of HSILs. Excision of the HSIL, when possible, could be a preferred treatment to allow better remission.

HPV immunization — quadrivalent vaccine in MSM and bivalent vaccine in female patients: In MSM, 602 healthy individuals aged 16 to 26 years were randomized to quadrivalent vaccine or placebo; none developed anal cancer during the 3-year follow-up, and there were 5 cases of HSIL (grade 2/3 AIN) in the vaccine arm versus 24 in placebo in the per-protocol population, giving an observed efficacy of 77.5% (95% CI, 39.6–93.3); these results suggest that use of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in MSM may reduce the risk of anal cancer in this population. A bivalent HPV vaccine against HPV-16 and -18 was 83.6% effective against initial anal HPV-16/18 infection (95% CI, 66.7–92.8) in a randomized, double-blind controlled trial of female patients in Costa Rica; the effect on precancerous anal lesions has not yet been reported.

Anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) treatment — Multiple office-based treatments exist, including ablative methods (e.g., laser, electrocautery, or infrared coagulation) and topical patient-applied therapies (e.g., imiquimod). Recurrence rates with both provider-applied and patient-applied treatments are high, ranging from approximately 50% at 1 year to 77% after 3 years, and evidence exists that HSIL might spontaneously regress without treatment. Shared decision-making about treatment for anal HSIL is recommended because of limited data on the natural history of anal HSIL, including factors related to progression or regression of lesions.

### Prevalence of and risk factors for anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in women living with human immunodeficiency virus [^349f55f1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Women living with human immunodeficiency virus (WLHIV) have disproportionately high rates of squamous cell carcinoma of the anus compared with the general population of women. Anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) precede anal cancer, and accurate studies of HSIL prevalence among WLHIV in the United States are lacking.

Methods

The AIDS Malignancy Consortium 084 study was a multicenter national trial to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for anal HSIL in a US cohort. Eligible participants were WLHIV aged ≥ 18 years with no history of anal HSIL. Study participants had an examination including collection of cervical/vaginal and anal specimens, followed by high-resolution anoscopy with biopsy.

Results

We enrolled 256 women with evaluable anal pathology. The mean age was 49.4 years, 64% women were non-Hispanic black, 67% were former or current smokers, and 56% reported ever having anal sex with a man. The median CD4 T-cell count was 664 cells/μL. The prevalence of anal histologic HSIL (hHSIL) was 27% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22%-33%). There was a strong concordance (240/254) between local and consensus pathologists for hHSIL vs less than hHSIL (κ = 0.86 [95% CI, .79-.93]). Current CD4 count of ≤ 200 cells/μL was the strongest predictor of consensus anal hHSIL diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 10.34 [95% CI, 3.47–30.87]). History of anoreceptive intercourse was also associated with hHSIL (aOR, 2.44 [95% CI, 1.22–4.76]).

Conclusions

The prevalence of anal hHSIL in WLHIV in the United States was 27% in this study where all participants received high-resolution anoscopy and biopsy.

### Topical cidofovir to treat high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia in HIV-infected patients: a pilot clinical trial [^c076ffd9]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of 1% topical cidofovir cream for the treatment of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) in HIV-infected individuals.

Design

Single-arm, open-label, pilot clinical trial.

Methods

The study medication was applied intraanally three times per week for 4 weeks. Lesions were assessed with high-resolution anoscopy and biopsy at weeks 12 and 24. The primary endpoint was complete remission (CR) at week 12, defined as clinical and histological remission. We also evaluated partial remission defined as regression to low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.

Results

We included 17 HIV-infected patients with intraanal HSIL. Median (interquartile range) age was 36 years (28–41), median (interquartile range) CD4 cell count was 545cells/μl (358–630), and viral load was less than 50 copies/ml in 93.7%. Two patients were lost to follow-up, one of them did not apply treatment. At 12 weeks, in the intention-to-treat population, 10 out of 16 patients [62.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 38.2–85.7%] had achieved CR. At 24 weeks, seven of the 10 patients (70%; 95% CI, 47–93%) remained in CR, but two out of 10 patients (20%; 95% CI, 0–40%) presented HSIL. One patient did not attend the visit at 24 weeks. Three patients with persistent HSIL at 12 weeks improved at 24 weeks (partial response in one and CR in two). The mean number of human papillomavirus genotypes decreased from 5.2 to 2.7 at 12 weeks (P = 0.002). Local adverse effects were frequent (81%), although there were no discontinuations because of adverse events.

Conclusion

One percent topical cidofovir could be an appropriate alternative therapy in HIV-infected patients with anal HSIL.

### State variation in squamous cell carcinoma of the anus incidence and mortality, and association with HIV / AIDS and smoking in the United States [^d8e9a17f]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Analogous to cervical cancer, screening (using high-resolution anoscopy [HRA]) to detect precancers and treatment to prevent progression to SCCA have been used mainly for persons living with HIV (PLWHIV). Mounting data, including the Anal Cancer/HSIL Outcomes Research (ANCHOR) study, demonstrate that anal precancer treatment reduces SCCA risk among PLWHIV. - Given the implementation of screening and treatment practices for PLWHIV in the most populous urban coastal regions for over 15 years (eg, New York state implemented guidelines in 2007, and HIV care providers in California have been screening for SCCA since the 1990s), - SCCA incidence patterns might have been affected by increased diagnostic scrutiny, particularly among men age < 50 years as HIV greatly contributes to SCCA (nearly 60%) in this age group, but 20% among men age 50–79 years.

Understanding the geographic differences in SCCA incidence and mortality patterns could contribute to etiologic hypotheses and have important implications for guiding cancer prevention interventions and clinical practices. Therefore, we evaluated patterns in SCCA incidence, burden, mortality, and associations with smoking and HIV/AIDS prevalence (overall and among persons age < 50 and ≥ 50 years) in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia (DC), and Puerto Rico (PR). In addition, a comprehensive description of screening providers may help guide future infrastructure development. Thus, we described the current screening locations and their distribution across the United States.

### Interventions for anal canal intraepithelial neoplasia [^4ed0ffd8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) is a dysplasia of the anal transitional epithelium that is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. High-grade lesions have the potential to develop into anal cancer. The incidence and prevalence of AIN and anal cancer has been increasing over the last decades. Certain groups - including people living with HIV, men who have sex with men (MSM), and those with suppressed immune systems - are at high risk of developing AIN. Targeted excisions using ablative treatments such as electrocauterisation, infrared coagulation, or cryotherapy have been used as first-line therapeutic strategies. Other options include topical treatment with immunomodulators such as imiquimod or cytostatics such as fluorouracil. Ideally, treatment of AIN should have a low risk of complications and result in a low risk of recurrence. This is the first update of a review originally published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the effects of any therapeutic intervention for anal intraepithelial neoplasia, regardless of gender, age, and comorbidity.

Search Methods

We used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and five trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify the studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was 16 April 2025.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed any type of intervention for AIN. We excluded cluster-randomised and cross-over trials. We excluded people with a histological diagnosis of anal carcinoma, Paget's disease, or Bowenoid papulosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes of interest were: AIN eradication (defined by the absence of histologic criteria OR the presence of a normal epithelium or scarring OR the complete absence of dysplasia); development of anal cancer; and human papillomavirus (HPV) eradication. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

Five RCTs met our inclusion criteria, randomising a total of 4907 participants. All included participants were adults living with HIV with a CD4 cell count above 300 cells/μL. The median participant age ranged from 45 to 51 years. Most participants were male. Two studies were multicentre, both conducted in the USA. The remaining studies were conducted in outpatient clinics in Spain, the Netherlands, and the UK. We considered the overall risk of bias as high in one study and moderate in four. The main reasons for concerns of bias were open-label design and high dropout rates. All studies had different interventions and outcomes, precluding meta-analysis. The inclusion of two multi-armed studies means that we synthesised evidence for nine separate comparisons. Here, we summarise only the results from the largest study, with 4459 randomised participants, comparing high-resolution anoscopy-guided treatment to active monitoring. We summarise results from the other studies in the main review. The study comparing high-resolution anoscopy (HRA)-guided treatment to active monitoring did not assess four of the review's outcomes of interest: AIN eradication, HPV eradication, histological downgrading of AIN lesions, and recurrence of AIN. Results for the three remaining outcomes - development of anal cancer, quality of life, and adverse events - are as follows. In the HRA-guided treatment group, four per 1000 (0.4%) participants developed anal cancer, while in the active monitoring group, nine per 1000 (0.9%) participants developed anal cancer, with a median follow-up of 25 to 28 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.93; P = 0.03; 1 study, 4446 participants; very low-certainty evidence). In the active monitoring group, there was an increased impact on psychological functions from inclusion to 28 days after inclusion. In the treatment group, there was no difference in physical symptoms, impact on physical functioning, or impact on psychological functioning from inclusion to 28 days after inclusion. Two per cent of participants in the treatment arm and 0.2% in the active monitoring arm reported adverse events. Most adverse events were mild pain (RR 10.7, 95% CI 3.85 to 29.79; P < 0.001; 1 study, 4446 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

All included studies focused on people living with HIV. This may limit the applicability of the results to HIV-negative people. We assessed the certainty of evidence as very low for all outcomes across all nine comparisons, highlighting a lack of high-quality evidence on interventions for AIN. Our findings suggest that HRA-guided treatment may lower anal cancer risk, but the evidence is very uncertain. We evaluated the efficacy of cidofovir, sinecatechins, infrared coagulation, HRA-guided electrocautery, imiquimod, and fluorouracil in eradicating AIN. With eradication rates between 14% and 62% and follow-up periods ranging from four weeks to 33 months, the evidence on the effectiveness of these treatments is very uncertain. Further studies on interventions for AIN with sufficient power and duration are required to determine the efficacy of interventions. Studies addressing treatments in HIV-negative cohorts are also needed.

Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) are precancerous lesions and are sequela of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. AIN is classified as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Screening with anal cytology and anoscopy should be considered for high-risk populations. Diagnosis is made through high resolution anaoscopy and biopsy. Options for treatment include ablation and several topical therapies; however, recurrence rates are high for all treatment options, and an ongoing surveillance is necessary to prevent progression to anal squamous cell carcinoma. HPV vaccination is recommended to prevent disease.

Background

Doubts remain about the best treatment for managing premalignant lesions (HSIL) associated with anal cancer.

Methods

The TREATAIN trial was an open-label, randomized study conducted at Hospital Vall d'Hebron (Spain). Persons with HIV and anal HSIL were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive treatment with electrocautery, topical cidofovir 1% ointment, or topical sinecatechins 10%. The primary outcome was histological resolution of HSIL. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, participant satisfaction, HPV clearance, and HSIL recurrence. EudraCT: 2018-001730-18. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04055142.

Results

Between October 2020 and November 2022, 100 participants were enrolled (36 in the electrocautery arm, 28 in cidofovir arm, and 36 in the sinecatechins arm). Modified intention-to-treat analysis showed a response rate of 69.4% [95% CI; 54.4–84.5] of patients in the electrocautery group, 82.1% [95% CI; 67.9–96.3] in the cidofovir group, and 61.1% [95% CI; 45.2–77] in the sinecatechins group (p = 0.189). During the 48-weeks follow-up period, recurrence was observed in 7 participants (28%) in the electrocautery group, 7 (30.4%) in the cidofovir group, and 8 (36.4%) in the sinecatechins group (Log-rank test p = 0.811). Side effects were reported by 97.2% of patients in the electrocautery group, 85.7% in the cidofovir group, and 33% in the sinecatechins group (p < 0.001). Patients were more satisfied with the sinecatechins treatment (5.6 ± 0.4), followed by electrocautery (5.1 ± 0.8), while lower satisfaction was reported with cidofovir treatment (4.77 ± 0.96), p < 0.001.

Conclusion

No statistically significant difference was observed in efficacy between treatments; in contrast, sinecatechins was the most accepted and well-tolerated treatment.

### The utility of digital anal rectal examinations in a public health screening program for anal cancer [^f5f862c3]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Anal cancer incidence is stable or increasing in the general population, and highest in men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV; however, no uniform screening recommendations for anal cancer exist for this population or others with increased anal cancer incidenceincluding other persons with HIV, other immunosuppressed persons, HIV-negative MSM, and women with a history of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated anogenital dysplasia.

Although HPV vaccines are highly efficacious, their full impact on anal cancer incidence will take decades to be realized; thus, secondary prevention using screening methods have been suggested in several regional and national guidelines for persons living with HIV (PHIV).

One method cited by these recommendations for PHIV is the Digital Anal Rectal Examination (DARE)whose goal is to detect early stage (preferably stage 1) anal cancer. Currently, anal canal tumors have an average of greater than 3.0 cm in diameter at first presentation. These larger tumors result in poorer 5-year survival and higher morbidity. Given that DARE can detect abnormalities smaller than 1.0 cm, and new medical practice guidelines are now available for DARE, it may be helpful to evaluate DARE as a public health screening tool for anal cancer.

The current article assesses the evidence for use of DARE according to the application of established World Health Organization criteria for public health screening. Much of this evidence focuses on HIV-positive MSM; however, we will also address data from other populations with elevated risk, when available.

Of note, other proposed screening algorithms target putative precancerous lesions, rather than invasive cancer, and rely on high-resolution anoscopy (HRA)-directed biopsy to detect anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). Although utility of HRA has been suggestedand is being used to assess anal precancer therapeutics in a current trial (NCT02135419), currently, there is limited capacity for HRA even in high-resource settings and several challenges in scaling up HRA, including cost, specialized technical training required, and participant discomfort. Digital Anal Rectal Examination may be an option for health programs in areas without access to HRA if the benefits of screening with DARE outweigh the harms.

### Interventions for anal canal intraepithelial neoplasia [^2a50660b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anal canal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) is a pre-malignant condition of the anal canal transitional epithelium that is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The incidence and prevalence of AIN and anal cancer are increasing rapidly in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Other groups like HIV-negative MSM, immunosuppressed patients and people affected by other HPV diseases like genital warts and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) may also develop AIN. The condition is complicated by its multicentric and multifocal nature and high rates of relapse and morbidity. Targeted excisions using ablative treatments such as cautery, infrared coagulation (IRC) and cryotherapy have been used as first-line therapeutic strategies, and there are many other options. There is no consensus about the optimal management of AIN.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of therapeutic interventions for anal canal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE and EMBASE (to October 2011). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies, and contacted experts in the field and manufacturers of any AIN and HPV-specific treatments.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed any type of intervention for AIN.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. If it was possible, the data were synthesised in a meta-analysis.

Main Results

We found only one RCT, which included 53 patients, that met our inclusion criteria. This trial reported data on imiquimod versus placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of disease cure but there was a trend for imiquimod to downgrade the AIN to a low-risk stage. The lack of statistical power of the trial may be due to the small number of patients in each group. The risk of bias was estimated as moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

The included trial failed to demonstrate any statistically significant efficacy of imiquimod in the management of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). The absence of reliable evidence for any of the interventions used in AIN precludes any definitive guidance or recommendations for clinical practice. Prospective cohort studies and retrospective studies have not been included in this review as they are considered to provide lower quality evidence. Well designed RCTs are needed.

### Randomized clinical trials in localized anal cancer [^dca9469c]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Management of anal carcinoma began as abdominoperineal resection and has evolved to combined chemotherapy and radiation. Early randomized trials demonstrated superior clinical outcomes of combined modality therapy over radiotherapy alone. Subsequent trials investigated alterations in the standard backbone of radiotherapy concurrent with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C with intent to maintain clinical outcomes while reducing treatment-related morbidity. The addition of intensity-modulated radiotherapy to radiation planning and delivery has subsequently reduced acute toxicity and detrimental treatment breaks. Ongoing and future trials are aimed at reducing therapy in favorable patient populations to decrease morbidity while intensifying treatment in patients with negative prognostic factors.

### Future directions for research on anal precancerous lesion treatment [^1da5e8aa]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The benefit of treating anal precancerous lesions to reduce anal cancer progression was recently shown in people living with HIV. This will certainly impact the future development of recommendations on anal cancer prevention by including anal precancerous lesions screening and treatment for people living with HIV. However, by bringing this topic to the spotlight, it has also uncovered data that are still missing in this field and that need to be addressed by research. This article will discuss the many unanswered questions about treatment of anal precancerous lesions and future directions for research.

### Prevention strategies against human papillomavirus in males [^7799af9c]. Gynecologic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is very common in men and women. Oncogenic HPV is strongly associated with cancers and high-grade dysplasias of the anogenital tract, including the anus, penis, and also a proportion of oropharyngeal cancers. In reducing male disease burden, some consider screening and treatment for high-grade anal dysplasia (AIN) to prevent anal cancer in high-risk populations. Such strategies have wide implications for the workforce, and require more evidence for the optimal management of AIN. Male sexual behavior, with consequent HPV infection and disease contribute to considerable disease burden in females. Hence, inclusion of males in prophylactic HPV vaccination programs should prevent HPV-related disease in males as well as substantially reducing disease burden in females. Clinical trial data in males 16–26 years for the quadrivalent vaccine show it is well tolerated, induces a strong type-specific immunological response comparable to that of females, and reduced vaccine HPV-type-related genital infection, as well as disease. Cost-benefit analyses and mathematical modeling show that the most cost-effective strategy involves routine administration of this vaccine to 12-year-old females, with catch-up vaccination of 12- to 24-year-olds, with the most effective strategy in disease reduction including men and/or boys in the program. Such a vaccination strategy including 12-year-old boys is projected by 2050 to reduce HPV 16 infection by 88–94% in females and 68–82% in males, plus the aforementioned male HPV- related cancers by 22–27%. Therefore, inclusion of males in an HPV vaccination program is likely to have significant health and economic benefits over and above those observed from current female-only programs. However, comprehensive cost-benefit analyses are needed to determine the efficacy of these programs in the overall population. Such analyses will be crucial for the design, acceptance, and implementation of these vaccination programs into clinical practice globally.

### Effect of human papillomavirus vaccine to interrupt recurrence of vulvar and anal neoplasia (VIVA): a trial protocol [^0cfdce61]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

The VIVA trial will address the proof-of-concept question for the therapeutic use of the 9vHPV vaccine among persons with HPV-associated anal or vulvar HSIL. If successful, this trial could lead to changes in the management of HSIL. The administration of the licensed HPV vaccine would be a low-cost adjunctive treatment for anal and vulvar HSIL that may reduce the frequency of surveillance and retreatment. Trial results may also clarify the role of natural antibodies in patients with recurrent HSIL.

Observational studies suggest that the HPV vaccine may provide a partial therapeutic effect in already infected patients. For example, in a pooled analysisof findings from the 4vHPV vaccine licensure trials, 587 4vHPV vaccine and 763 placebo recipients who underwent surgical treatment of squamous intraepithelial neoplasia of the cervix had 50% reduction (incidence of 6.6 and 12.2 in vaccine and placebo groups, respectively) in recurrence of cervical disease among vaccinated women. In a retrospective studyof 88 men with anal HSIL, those who received the 4vHPV vaccine after treatment had a 50% reduction of HSIL recurrence compared with unvaccinated men. Another retrospective studyof 65 women with VIN3 examined the recurrence of vulvar HSIL and found that women who mounted natural antibodies to HPV-16 had a 30% decreased risk of recurrent lesions. These nonrandomized studies suggest that the immune response after natural infection and 4vHPV vaccination reduce the risk of HSIL recurrence. In contrast, a randomized trialconducted to assess whether 4vHPV vaccine prevents new HPV infections or decreases anal HSIL recurrence that enrolled 472 HIV-infected men and 103 HIV-infected women in the United States was stopped early for futility. After a median follow-up of 3.4 years, vaccine efficacy was 22% (95% CI, −31% to 53%) for prevention of persistent infection. That study also failed to find evidence supporting an adjunctive role for HPV vaccination to improve outcomes following treatment of anal HSIL. Early study termination and lower than expected anal HPV infection affected the study's ability to show efficacy.

Concluding remarks

AIN is a premalignant lesion for anal cancer. It is more commonly found in high-risk patients (e.g. HPV/HIV infections, post-organ transplantation patients and MSM) and the development of AIN is driven by HPV infection. There still remains significant controversy regarding screening, surveillance and treatment for AIN, but emerging data suggest that close patient follow up with a combination of ablative and topical treatments may offer the greatest benefit.

### Anal carcinoma, version 2.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^616a96d4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

HPV vaccination and anal cancer prevention — A 9-valent HPV vaccine protects against HPV-6, -11, -16, -18, -31, -33, -45, -52, and -58, and targeting these additional strains over the quadrivalent vaccine is predicted to prevent an additional 464 cases of anal cancer annually. In an international, randomized phase IIIb–III study that included more than 14,000 female patients, the 9-valent vaccine was noninferior for antibody response to HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18 and prevented infection and disease related to the other viral strains; the calculated efficacy was 96.7% (95% CI, 80.9–99.8) for prevention of high-grade cervical, vulvar, or vaginal disease. A follow-up phase III study showed sustained efficacy and immunogenicity and aided in prevention of HPV incidence after 10 years post-vaccination. For implementation, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine use of the 9-valent vaccine in children aged 11 and 12 years, as well as catch-up vaccination for individuals through 26 years of age who have not been previously vaccinated; in 2018 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded use to individuals aged 27 through 45 years, and in 2019 the ACIP voted to recommend vaccination, based on shared clinical decision-making, for individuals in this age range who are not adequately vaccinated.

### A double-blind, randomized controlled trial of the use of imiquimod cream for the treatment of anal canal high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia in HIV-positive MSM on HAART, with long-term follow-up data including the use of open-label imiquimod [^bac5d9b4]. AIDS (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether imiquimod was more effective than placebo for the treatment of high-grade anal canal intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-ACIN).

Design

Double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Methods

Sixty-four HIV-positive patients were randomized to self-application of imiquimod cream or matched placebo into the anal canal three times a week for 4 months. Response was assessed by cytology, high-resolution anoscopy and biopsy 2 months after therapy. All patients who failed to resolve were offered treatment with open-label imiquimod for a further 4 months.

Results

Fifty-three patients completed the study, of which 28 patients were on active drug and 25 patients on placebo. In the imiquimod group, four patients resolved and eight patients downgraded to low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) with a median follow-up of 33 months. In the placebo group, one patient resolved. Imiquimod was significantly associated with a positive outcome (P = 0.003). Only one patient discontinued owing to side effects. Twenty-one patients entered a second open-label phase of treatment. Five of these patients cleared their anal canal intraepithelial neoplasia (ACIN) and four patients downgraded to LSIL. The overall mean duration of follow-up was 36 months. During this extended follow-up period, 61% have exhibited sustained absence of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).

Conclusion

This study demonstrates the effectiveness of imiquimod for the treatment of ACIN, and the benefit of prolonged or repeated treatments. This form of therapy is likely to be especially valuable for patients with widespread multifocal ACIN who are otherwise difficult to treat, and should be considered as an adjunct to ablative therapy.

### High-resolution anoscopy surveillance after anal squamous cell carcinoma: high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion detection and treatment may influence local recurrence [^79999c5f]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). Medium credibility.

United Kingdom guidanceon follow-up after ASCC treatment does not recommend high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) as part of follow-up. However, London regional guidelines recommend HRA in addition to clinical surveillance to detect LR (Table 1). A recent UK articlesuggested that HRA to detect and treat HSIL might reduce the LR rate after ASCC.

TABLE 1.
London regional guidelines for HRA-led surveillance after anal squamous cell cancer

High-resolution anoscopy involves using a colposcope to magnify (up to ×30) and inspect the perianal and intraanal epithelium, with the application of 5% acetic acid, and Lugol iodine if required, to identify HSIL and confirm with biopsy under local anesthetic. It is the standard for the detection of AC/perianal HSIL. Units worldwide treat HSIL with topical or ablative surgical interventions to prevent the progression to ASCC.– A randomized controlled trial of anal HSIL treatment is in progress. The pathophysiology of HSIL in LR after ASCC is not currently well understood, and the role of HRA in reducing LR after ASCC treatment is not yet established.

The objectives of this study are to examine the HSIL detection and LR rates in a post-ASCC surveillance program at a national HRA referral center for the detection and treatment of HSIL.

### Expectant management of high-grade anal dysplasia in people with HIV: long-term data [^39a3e759]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Both ablation and expectant management of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions have been proposed. Expectant management would be reasonable if 1) the rate of high-grade squamous epithelial lesion progression to anal squamous cell carcinoma were low, and 2) anal squamous cell carcinoma arising under surveillance had a better prognosis than anal squamous cell carcinoma presenting without an identified precursor.

Objective

This study aims to quantify aspects of high-grade squamous epithelial lesion/anal squamous cell carcinoma clinical evolution in a surgical practice.

Design

This is a retrospective cohort study.

Settings

This study was performed in 1 colorectal surgeon's practice over a 20-year period.

Patients

Consecutive patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and anal squamous cell carcinoma were included.

Main Outcome Measures

We looked at the rate and timing of progression to anal squamous cell carcinoma, and the stage, treatment, and outcome of anal squamous cell carcinoma. We reviewed a comparison group of HIV-positive patients presenting de novo with anal squamous cell carcinoma (no prior history of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion).

Results

With consideration of only HIV-positive patients, 341 patients had a mean 5.6 years follow-up from high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion diagnosis to the most recent documented anal examination. Twenty-four of these surveillance patients developed anal squamous cell carcinoma, yielding a progression rate of 1.3% per patient-year. Mean follow-up was 7.3 years from the initial cancer diagnosis to the most recent contact. Forty-seven patients who presented de novo with anal squamous cell carcinoma developed 74 lesions, with a mean follow-up of 5.7 years after initial diagnosis. This de novo group had higher anal squamous cell carcinoma-specific mortality (3% per patient-year vs 0.05%). Our study did not show a significantly higher rate of high stage (stage III or IV) at anal squamous cell carcinoma diagnosis in the de novo group in comparison with the surveillance group (25.5% vs 8.3% (p = 0.09)).

Limitations

This study was retrospective in nature and had a predominately male population.

Conclusions

The progression of untreated high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion to anal squamous cell carcinoma approximates 1% per patient-year. Anal squamous cell carcinoma developing under surveillance tends to be of an earlier stage and to require fewer major interventions than anal squamous cell carcinoma presenting de novo. Cancer-specific mortality was lower for malignancies that developed under surveillance. We suggest that expectant management of patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion is a rational strategy for preventing anal cancer morbidity.

### Screening women for anal cancers: guidance for health care professionals [^b25ab27d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Anal cancer is rare in the general population but is steadily increasing in incidence over the past decade especially in women. Identification and screening of women with high risk facilitates detection of anal precancer and early-stage cancer, improves survival, and potentially uses less invasive therapies compared with the conventional chemoradiation treatments used for advanced cancers. No recently published guidelines currently describe details about screening women for anal squamous cell cancer (ASCC). The available evidence supports the existence of groups of women with higher prevalence of ASCC (e.g., women with human immunodeficiency virus, immune suppression, or previous lower-genital high-grade lesion or cancer) who would likely benefit from screening with some combination of anal cytology and human papillomavirus testing. Additional research is needed to establish the cost-effectiveness and the influence of screening on ASCC mortality rates.

### Anal intraepithelial neoplasia: diagnosis, screening, and treatment [^b65f6b15]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

HPV vaccination

HPV vaccination may prove to be a prevention tool for AIN. The quadrivalent vaccine is effective for high-risk HPV strains 6, 11, 16, and 18 and has been previously proven safe and effective in the prevention of cervical cancer. Emerging studies indicate that vaccination may be the most realistic long-term approach to prevention and possible treatment of AIN. The benefit of the vaccine will depend on the timing of vaccination and exposure to HPV.

Administration of the vaccine after the diagnosis of AIN in order to assist with prevention in the future has been studied. Retrospective data from a large Swedish trial showed that, in MSM with recurrent AIN, those who received the vaccination had significantly lower rates of high-grade AIN moving forward. To further study the therapeutic benefit, a study from 2011 randomized MSM to receive the HPV vaccine vs. placebo. They found the rates of AIN were lower in the vaccine group (13 vs. 17.5 per 100 person years), while they also had a significantly lower risk for persistent HPV infection following vaccination. The benefits of these results seen in MSM can also be applied to heterosexual men and women, given the biological similarity between anal cancer in men and women and the same pathogenesis due to HPV infection. The administration of the vaccine to young people prior to sexual activity appears to provide the greatest benefit for prevention of AIN and anal cancer.

Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) clinical efficacy — people with HIV: A randomized, double-blind trial in people with HIV who were older than 27 years did not show efficacy for prevention of new anal HPV infections or improvement in anal HSIL outcomes. Another RCT of 4vHPV involved 129 men who have sex with men on ART with a mean age of 38.8 years and history of AIDS; the vaccine and placebo arms did not differ by HSIL or genital wart incidence, but vaccine HPV types were less common in the vaccine arm, and secondary analyses found those with the longest time since immunization had significantly reduced risk of HSIL. A one-arm study of 260 MSM with HIV, aged 18 to 26 years, followed at 7, 12, and 24 months found that no participants naive at baseline for one or more 4vHPV types developed LSIL or HSIL related to those HPV. A Phase 3 4vHPV RCT in older males and females with HIV (aged ≥ 27 years) ended early due to an insufficient vaccine effect to meet stopping rules, but oral HPV infection decreased from 88% to 32% after 6 months. In a prospective observational cohort of female youth who received 4vHPV, abnormal cervical cytology occurred in 33 of 56 with perinatally acquired HIV and 1 of 7 exposed but uninfected, with incidence rates of 15 (10.9–29.6) and 2.9 (0.44–22.3), respectively.
