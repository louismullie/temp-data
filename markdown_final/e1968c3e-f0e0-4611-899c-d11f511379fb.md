## Question

What is the typical natural history of a tic disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical natural history of a primary tic disorder and how it evolves from onset through adolescence into adulthood, distinguishing it from functional tic-like behaviors when relevant. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the scope to ensure we are describing primary tic disorders rather than functional presentations. Then, I should verify the age and sex patterns at onset. Next, I will characterize the initial symptom profile and temporal evolution. After that, I need to outline the waxing–waning course and identify the peak severity window. I will then quantify the adolescent decline and adult persistence rates, review comorbidity trajectories and prognostic factors, and finally contrast typical features with atypical functional tic–like behaviors to avoid misattribution, while anchoring these points in high-quality cohort data and guidelines for patient education and counseling [^117Xx1Wi].

> Let me first confirm the scope. When clinicians describe the "typical" course, we mean primary tic disorders, namely Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorder, whose natural history has been delineated in longitudinal cohorts and clinical guidance; this excludes the COVID‑era surge of functional tic‑like behaviors, which follow a different, non‑neurologic pathophysiology and time course, so I need to be careful not to conflate them [^1159eenb] [^113hfCzX].

> I need to verify the age and sex distribution at onset. Typical primary tics begin in early childhood, most often between ages 4–7 years, with a clear male predominance of over 3:1; hold on, let me double‑check that window — yes, multiple sources converge on onset around 5–7 years with male skew, which is consistent across population and clinic cohorts [^1159eenb] [^111aojUo] [^1151weMV]. By contrast, functional tic‑like behaviors have a later onset in adolescence or young adulthood and a female predominance, which should raise diagnostic caution if seen at first presentation [^113hfCzX].

> Next, I should review the initial symptom profile. Motor tics typically start simply — eye blinking, facial grimacing, nose wrinkling — followed after months to years by the emergence of vocal tics; wait, I almost said "always", but to be precise there are rare exceptions, so I will correct that to "typically", with complex tics accruing gradually rather than debuting at onset, which helps clinically separate primary tics from functional presentations where complex movements and vocalizations often appear abruptly from the start [^1159eenb] [^113hfCzX].

> I will now examine the core temporal pattern. The hallmark course is waxing and waning with high intraindividual variability, often occurring in bouts with relatively regular inter‑tic intervals and susceptibility to triggers such as somatosensory irritation or stress; I should confirm that objective longitudinal data captured this fluctuation, and indeed monthly prospective ratings demonstrate substantial within‑subject variability requiring formal thresholds to define exacerbations [^113RVfKA] [^1151weMV] [^1159eenb].

> Let me think about the timing of peak severity. Tic severity usually intensifies into preadolescence, peaking around 8–12 years before the typical decline phase; hold on, I should verify the exact range — yes, preadolescence is consistently identified as the peak window across cohorts and summaries, which aligns with clinical experience [^1134FDAZ] [^111aojUo] [^1151weMV].

> Next, I should quantify the adolescent decline trajectory. In a large prospective clinic cohort, severity declined by roughly 0.8 YGTSS points per year through adolescence, and by age 16 and older, about 18% had no tics, ~60% had minimal or mild tics, and ~23% remained moderate to severe; I need to ensure these figures are accurately stated — they are, and they provide a useful benchmark for counseling families about expected improvement [^1134FDAZ].

> I should double‑check adult persistence rates. Population data indicate that approximately 20% of individuals diagnosed in childhood retain a chronic tic diagnosis into adulthood, whereas most become virtually tic‑free or have only mild residual tics by the end of the second decade; let me verify concordance between population‑level and clinical reports — yes, the Swedish registry confirms ~20% diagnostic persistence, and narrative summaries note that fewer than 20% have clinically significant tics beyond late adolescence [^113GXe7n] [^1151weMV] [^1159eenb].

> Now, I need to review comorbidity patterns and their course. ADHD and OCD are common in Tourette syndrome and frequently outlast tic improvement, with longitudinal data showing that psychiatric comorbidities persist in a majority at follow‑up; I should confirm prognostic value — childhood psychiatric comorbidity and family history of tics or anxiety robustly predict tic persistence into adulthood, emphasizing the need to assess and manage these conditions proactively [^1134FDAZ] [^111ogcYD] [^113GXe7n].

> Hold on, I should verify non‑predictive factors to avoid overinterpretation. Large cohort analyses do not support associations between tic persistence and socioeconomic variables, perinatal complications, autoimmune comorbidity, or family history of autoimmune disease, which helps refine risk counseling and prevents unnecessary etiologic workups [^113GXe7n].

> Next, I should contrast with atypical functional tic‑like presentations to validate "typical" features. Functional cases usually have rapid or explosive onset over hours to days, later age at onset, female predominance, immediate complex movements and phrases (often copro‑phenomena), and a course characterized by prominent suggestibility and less efficient suppressibility rather than a classic waxing–waning trajectory; this pattern should prompt screening for functional neurological disorder and targeted psychoeducation and behavioral approaches rather than antitic pharmacotherapy [^113hfCzX] [^114HwMNZ] [^113VtArH].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are explicit. Education should emphasize that tics wax and wane, typically peak before puberty, and often decline in adolescence, with watchful waiting appropriate when functional impairment is low, while comorbid ADHD, OCD, anxiety, and mood symptoms warrant systematic screening and treatment because they drive impairment and predict persistence; I should confirm guidelines align with this counseling approach — the AAN recommends educating families about natural history, considering watchful waiting when impairment is limited, and routinely screening and managing co‑occurring psychiatric conditions [^117Xx1Wi] [^115XuVZs] [^111CwQFv] [^111upEQG] [^114wCJhs].

The natural course of tic disorders **follows a waxing and waning pattern** [^113RVfKA], with onset typically between ages 4–7 [^111aojUo], peaking around 10–12 [^1151weMV], and improving or remitting in late adolescence or early adulthood [^1159eenb]. About 20% **persist into adulthood** [^113GXe7n], often with reduced severity, and persistence is strongly linked to childhood comorbidities such as ADHD and OCD. Functional tic-like behaviors surged during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114wBhRH], and are distinguished by rapid onset [^113hfCzX], complex tics, and female predominance [^113VtArH]; they often improve with behavioral interventions [^112YDZva] and comorbidity management [^114HwMNZ]. Overall, **most tic disorders improve over time** [^1134FDAZ], but comorbidities frequently persist and drive long-term impairment [^1159eenb].

---

## Typical onset and early course

- **Age of onset**: Tics usually begin between ages 4 and 7 [^111aojUo], with a male predominance (approximately 3:1) [^113hfCzX].

- **Initial presentation**: Early tics are typically simple motor tics (e.g. eye blinking, facial grimacing) [^113hfCzX] and may be accompanied by simple vocal tics (e.g. throat clearing, sniffing) [^1159eenb].

- **Early course**: Tics follow a waxing and waning pattern [^113RVfKA], fluctuating in frequency and severity over weeks to months.

---

## Peak severity and adolescent course

Peak severity typically occurs **between ages 10 and 12** [^111aojUo], often coinciding with increased social and academic demands. Adolescent course is marked by general improvement [^1134FDAZ] after this peak, with many individuals experiencing **significant reduction or remission** by late adolescence or early adulthood [^111aojUo].

---

## Long-term outcomes and remission rates

- **Remission rates**: Approximately 20% of individuals with tic disorders experience complete remission by adulthood [^1134FDAZ], while the majority experience significant improvement in tic severity [^1159eenb].

- **Persistence**: About 20% of individuals continue to experience clinically significant tics into adulthood [^113GXe7n], often associated with persistent comorbidities such as ADHD and OCD [^1134FDAZ].

- **Adult course**: In adulthood [^111CnufB], tics often become less severe, with facial, neck, and trunk tics predominating, while complex motor and vocal tics tend to diminish.

---

## Factors influencing tic persistence or remission

Several factors influence the likelihood of **tic persistence or remission**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on course** |
|-|-|
| Childhood tic severity | Higher severity predicts persistence |
| Comorbid ADHD | Strongly associated with persistence [^113GXe7n] |
| Comorbid OCD | Strongly associated with persistence [^113GXe7n] |
| Family history of tics or anxiety disorders | Increases risk of persistence [^113GXe7n] |
| Female sex | Associated with delayed diagnosis and worse adult outcomes [^113C32Rd] [^111psXMK] |

---

## Impact of comorbid conditions

ADHD commonly co-occurs with tic disorders [^1159eenb] and **significantly impairs academic performance, social functioning, and overall quality of life** [^1134FDAZ]. OCD is also frequent [^1159eenb] and contributes to increased impairment and reduced quality of life [^1134FDAZ]. Anxiety and mood disorders are common and exacerbate functional impairment [^1134FDAZ] while reducing quality of life.

---

## Functional tic-like behaviors (FTLBs)

During the COVID-19 pandemic, **rapid-onset functional tic-like behaviors increased markedly** [^114wBhRH], particularly among adolescent females. These presentations feature sudden onset [^113hfCzX], complex motor and vocal tics, and high rates of comorbid anxiety and depression [^114HwMNZ]. The course is often favorable, with significant improvement within 6–12 months — especially with behavioral interventions [^112YDZva] and comorbidity management [^114ruNgy].

---

## Mortality and long-term health outcomes

Mortality is increased among individuals with tic disorders [^114n4Hci], particularly due to **unnatural causes such as suicide and accidents** [^115RvPmp]. Long-term health outcomes are often **adversely affected** because persistent tics and comorbidities can significantly impair quality of life, social functioning, and academic performance [^1134FDAZ] [^1159eenb].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Watchful waiting**: Appropriate for individuals with mild tics and no functional impairment [^115XuVZs].

- **Behavioral interventions**: Comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) is recommended as a first-line treatment for moderate to severe tics [^114xv58J] [^114zT276].

- **Pharmacological treatment**: Medications such as antipsychotics and alpha-adrenergic agonists may be considered for severe tics, with careful monitoring for adverse effects [^111HwK4o] [^115DoUR4].

- **Management of comorbidities**: Essential to address ADHD [^111upEQG], OCD [^114wCJhs], anxiety, and mood disorders to improve overall functioning and quality of life [^111CwQFv].

---

The natural course of tic disorders typically involves early childhood onset, peak severity in early adolescence, and **improvement or remission by adulthood** [^1159eenb]. Persistence into adulthood is strongly associated with childhood comorbidities, particularly ADHD and OCD [^113GXe7n]. Functional tic-like behaviors emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113hfCzX], often improving with behavioral interventions [^112YDZva].

### Early-life and family risk factors for tic disorder persistence into adulthood [^113GXe7n]. Movement Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Many children with tic disorders outgrow their tics, but little is known about the proportion of individuals who will continue to require specialist services in adulthood and which variables are associated with tic persistence.

- **Objectives**: The aims were to estimate the proportion of individuals first diagnosed with tic disorders in childhood who continued to receive tic disorder diagnoses after age 18 years and to identify risk factors for persistence.

- **Methods**: In this Swedish nationwide cohort study, including 3,761 individuals diagnosed with tic disorders in childhood, we calculated the proportion of individuals whose diagnoses persisted into adulthood. Minimally adjusted logistic regression models examined the associations between sociodemographic, clinical, and family variables and tic disorder persistence. A multivariable model was then fitted, including only variables that were statistically significant in the minimally adjusted models.

- **Results**: Seven hundred and fifty-four (20%) children with tic disorders received a diagnosis of a chronic tic disorder in adulthood. Psychiatric comorbidity in childhood (particularly attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, pervasive developmental disorders, and anxiety disorders) and psychiatric disorders in first-degree relatives (particularly tic and anxiety disorders) were the strongest risk factors for persistence. We did not observe statistically significant associations with socioeconomic variables, perinatal complications, comorbid autoimmune diseases, or family history of autoimmune disorders.

### Course of Tourette syndrome and comorbidities in a large prospective clinical study [^1134FDAZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2017). High credibility.

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by tics and frequent comorbidities. Although tics often improve during adolescence, recent studies suggest that comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) tend to persist. This large prospective follow-up study describes the clinical course of tics and comorbidities during adolescence and the prevalence of coexisting psychopathologies.

- **Method**: The clinical cohort was recruited at the Danish National Tourette Clinic, and data were collected at baseline (n = 314, age range 5–19 years) and at follow-up 6 years later (n = 227) to establish the persistence and severity of tics and comorbidities. During follow-up, the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) was used to diagnose coexisting psychopathologies. Repeated measures of severity scores were modeled using mixed effects models.

- **Results**: Tic severity declined yearly (0.8 points, CI: 0.58–1.01, on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale [YGTSS]) during adolescence; 17.7% of participants above age 16 years had no tics, whereas 59.5% had minimal or mild tics, and 22.8% had moderate or severe tics. Similarly, significant yearly declines in severity of both OCD (0.24, CI: 0.09–0.39, on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for Adults [Y-BOCS] and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for Children [CY-BOCS]) and ADHD (0.42, CI: 0.32–0.52, DSM-IV) were recorded. At follow-up, 63.0% of participants had comorbidities or coexistent psychopathologies, whereas 37.0% had pure TS.

### Rapid onset functional tic-like behaviors in young females during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113hfCzX]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

The phenomenology of these rapid onset cases represents a noticeable departure from the usual demographic and natural history of TS. Tic onset in TS typically occurs between ages 4 and 7 years. Boys are disproportionately affected, by a ratio of over three to one. Tics typically begin insidiously, with young children usually having a few different tics at a time that wax and wane and evolve in character. In early years, tics are mostly simple, for example, eye blinking, nose wrinkling, facial grimacing, sniffing, throat clearing, or coughing. Complex tics may emerge later, over a period of months to years, but typically after simple tics have been present for some time. Tics often worsen in preadolescence (ages 10–12 years) and improve in late adolescence.

Other typical characteristics of tic disorders, such as the report of premonitory sensations or urges to perform tics, subsequent relief of urges after the tic, suggestibility, and distractibility, can be present in association with both tics (more so in adolescents than in children) and FTLBs and may therefore be less useful in differentiating between these two groups of patients. By contrast, an ability to suppress or postpone tics at least briefly is usually demonstrated in older children with "typical" tics, whereas suppressibility of FTLBs appears to be less efficient. The associated psychiatric comorbidity pattern in these rapid onset cases also diverges.

### Prevalence of Tourette syndrome and chronic tics in the population-based Avon longitudinal study of parents and children cohort [^111aojUo]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic, childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by waxing and waning motor and vocal tics that persist for more than one year. Tics usually begin between 5 and 7 years of age, are most severe in early adolescence, and then gradually decrease in early adulthood. Chronic tic disorder (CT), defined by the presence of either motor or vocal tics (but not both), is similar in clinical phenomenology and disease course to TS, but is less frequently associated with co-occurring neuropsychiatric conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). TS and CT cause significant physical and psychosocial morbidity, and in severe cases can produce lifelong disability.

TS was initially considered to be rare, with early estimates of approximately 5 per 10,000 school-age children (0.05%). However, these studies included only clinically ascertained cases, an approach that greatly underestimates the true prevalence of the disorder by excluding individuals who do not seek treatment. In contrast, several population-based studies conducted over the past two decades suggest that TS is much more common, with most prevalence estimates converging around a rate of 0.3% to 0.8% of the school-age population. Fewer studies have examined the prevalence of CT, with estimates ranging from 1.3% to 3.7% of children. Determination of accurate TS/CT prevalence estimates is important for assessing the overall burden of disease, allocating treatment resources, and estimating the familial risk.

### Prospective follow-up study of youth and adults with onset of functional tic-like behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112YDZva]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Very little is known about the long-term prognosis of patients with functional tic-like behaviours (FTLBs). We sought to characterize the trajectory of symptom severity over a 12-month period.

- **Purpose**: Patients with FTLBs were included in our prospective longitudinal child and adult clinical tic disorder registries at the University of Calgary. Patients were prospectively evaluated at 6 and 12 months after their first clinical visit. Tic inventories and severity were measured with the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).

- **Methods**: Eighty-three youths and adults with FTLBs were evaluated prospectively until April 2023. Mean YGTSS total tic severity scores were high at baseline, with a mean score of 29.8 points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27.6–32.1). Fifty-eight participants were reevaluated at 6 months, and 32 participants were reevaluated at 12 months. The YGTSS total tic severity score decreased significantly from the first clinical visit to 6 months (raw mean difference = 8.9 points, 95% CI = 5.1–12.7, p < 0.0001), and from 6 to 12 months (raw mean difference = 6.4 points, 95% CI = 0.8–12.0, p = 0.01).

- **Results**: Multivariable linear regression demonstrated that tic severity at initial presentation and the presence of other functional neurological symptoms were associated with higher YGTSS total tic scores at 6 months, whereas younger age at baseline, receiving cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety and/or depression, and prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with lower YGTSS total tic scores at 6 months.

### Is persistent motor or vocal tic disorder a milder form of Tourette syndrome [^112dwLoG]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Persistent motor or vocal tic disorder (PMVT) has been hypothesized to be a forme fruste of Tourette syndrome (TS). Although the primary diagnostic criterion for PMVT (presence of motor or vocal tics, but not both) is clear, less is known about its clinical presentation.

- **Objective**: The goals of this study were to compare the prevalence and number of comorbid psychiatric disorders, tic severity, age at tic onset, and family history for TS and PMVT.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from two independent cohorts using generalized linear equations and confirmed our findings using meta-analyses, incorporating data from previously published literature.

- **Results**: Rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were lower in PMVT than in TS in all analyses. Other psychiatric comorbidities occurred with similar frequencies in PMVT and TS in both cohorts, although meta-analyses suggested lower rates of most psychiatric disorders in PMVT compared with TS. ADHD and OCD increased the odds of comorbid mood, anxiety, substance use, and disruptive behaviors and accounted for observed differences between PMVT and TS. Age of tic onset was approximately 2 years later, and tic severity was lower in PMVT than in TS. First-degree relatives had elevated rates of TS, PMVT, OCD, and ADHD compared with population prevalences, with rates of TS equal to or greater than PMVT rates.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings support the hypothesis that PMVT and TS occur along a clinical spectrum in which TS is a more severe and PMVT a less severe manifestation of a spectrum.

### All-cause and cause-specific mortality in Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorder [^113iT4YN]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

This study investigated all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality in over 10,000 individuals with TS/CTD, of whom 382 had died during the decade-long follow-up, and their matched individuals without TS/CTD. During the follow-up period, individuals with TS/CTD exhibited a significantly higher mortality rate and an 86% increased relative risk of all-cause mortality, compared to the matched unaffected individuals, which could be attributed to both natural and unnatural causes of death. These mortality results are similar to those reported in the Danish population in the only previous report exploring mortality in tic disorders. Additionally, our sibling comparison showed that the observed increased risk of mortality in TS/CTD is unlikely due to familial confounding, albeit a slight attenuation of the estimates was observed.

Our study was the first to explore the specific natural causes leading to deaths in this patient group. Individuals with TS/CTD exhibited a 2.7-fold increased risk of death due to diseases of the nervous system, a 2.1-fold increased risk due to diseases of the digestive system, and a 1.7-fold increased risk due to diseases of the respiratory system. These results are in line with the increased risk of morbidity due to neurological conditions, conditions derived from the use of substances, and allergies and respiratory diseases previously described in TS/CTD. Interestingly, individuals with TS/CTD did not show an increased risk of mortality due to metabolic or circulatory system diseases, despite previous studies in this group.

### Advances in understanding and treatment of Tourette syndrome [^117VXQ2M]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome is a hereditary, childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder first clearly described in France in 1885. This disorder is characterized by sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic movements (motor tics) or sounds (vocal or phonic tics), often preceded by premonitory sensations or urges. Some individuals also have psychiatric comorbidities, notably attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Tourette syndrome occurs worldwide, in all races and ethnicities, in both sexes and in children as well as in adults.

Estimates of its prevalence in children vary, with rates of up to 1% being reported, but rates of 0.3–0.8% are thought to accurately reflect the occurrence of the disorder. Research has led to progress in many aspects of Tourette syndrome, although many questions and unmet needs remain. For example, except for rare cases, the genetic basis remains elusive. The anatomical and neuronal changes in the brain that underlie Tourette syndrome are also unclear, although the evidence increasingly implicates alterations in basal ganglia function.

Treatment is often unnecessary for individuals with mild tics, but for those with moderate to severe forms of the syndrome, some drugs are available, albeit frequently ineffective. Behavioral and surgical therapies, in particular deep brain stimulation, are currently undergoing development and show promising results.

This review examines the history of Tourette syndrome and describes its clinical presentation. The article also provides an overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology.

### Distinguishing and managing acute-onset complex tic-like behaviors in adolescence [^1133XkVM]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Consistent with international reports, this group of Tourette syndrome (TS) experts has noticed a recent increase in adolescents presenting with tic-like symptoms that show a markedly atypical onset and course. These sudden-onset motor movements and vocalizations are often associated with significant impairment and disability, resulting in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for some affected youths.

### Practice guideline recommendations summary: Treatment of tics in people with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^114zT276]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for Tourette's syndrome, specifically with respect to comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics, the AAN 2019 guidelines recommend offering comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics as an initial treatment option. This is preferred relative to other psychosocial or behavioral interventions for patients with tics who have access to comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics.

### Rapid onset of functional tic-like behaviours in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114HwMNZ]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Differentiating between tics and functional tic-like movements is important as the approach to treatment is distinct, with prioritization of functional behavioural interventions in the latter. As we believe that individuals with rapid onset functional tic-like behaviours have a functional neurological disorder, we do not expect the pharmacological treatments used for individuals with primary tic disorders to be effective for these cases. Our treatment approach for these patients has included psychoeducation with patients and families to improve acceptance and understanding of the diagnosis, appropriate treatment of anxiety and/or depression if present, and behavioural therapy for tic-like behaviours. We have favored the use of the Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics, with greater emphasis on the functional behavioural assessment and intervention than on habit reversal therapy. The functional behavioural assessment focuses on identifying and addressing the internal and external antecedents and consequences of functional tic-like behaviours. We have had preliminary success with many patients using this approach and are currently collecting data as part of our prospective cohort study on short-term and long-term outcomes.

In conclusion, we propose that rapid onset tic-like behaviours are a distinct subtype of functional neurological disorder. The incidence of this functional neurological disorder phenotype has increased in young people since 2020, possibly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and appears to be strongly socially influenced.

### Functional tics: Expanding the phenotypes of functional movement disorders [^116WmFLw]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Until the outbreak reported during the COVID-19 pandemic, functional tics were considered to be a relatively rare clinical phenotype, as opposed to other functional movement disorders such as functional tremor and dystonia. To better characterize this phenotype, we compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who developed functional tics during the pandemic and those of patients with other functional movement disorders.

- **Methods**: Data from 110 patients were collected at the same neuropsychiatry centre: 66 consecutive patients who developed functional tics without other functional motor symptoms or neurodevelopmental tics, and 44 patients with a mix of functional dystonia, tremor, gait, and myoclonus.

- **Results**: Both groups were characterized by female sex preponderance (70%-80%) and (sub)acute onset of functional symptoms (~80%). However, patients with functional tics had a significantly earlier age at onset of functional symptoms (21 vs. 39 years). Exposure to relevant social media content was reported by almost half of the patients with functional tics, but by none of the patients with other functional movement disorders. Comorbidity profiles were similar, with relatively high rates of anxiety/affective symptoms and other functional neurological symptoms (non-epileptic attacks).

- **Conclusions**: Patients who developed functional tics during the pandemic represent a phenotypic variant of the wider group of patients with functional movement disorders, associated with a younger age at onset and influenced by pandemic-related factors.

### Clinical features of Tourette syndrome [^111ogcYD]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome is a multifaceted disorder characterized by multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic that start in childhood, persist for at least one year, and cannot be attributed to another medical condition or exposure to medications or drugs. Clinical diagnostic criteria are available, and identification of tics is typically straightforward based on characteristic appearance and features. Diagnostic uncertainty can rarely arise in cases of mild tics, atypical features, certain psychiatric comorbidities, and other non-tic movement disorders.

- **Comorbid psychopathology**: This includes attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive behaviors/obsessive-compulsive disorder, which affect the majority of patients and are correlated with disease severity and the presence of additional psychiatric behaviors. The severity of tics often improves after adolescence, whereas psychiatric symptoms typically persist.

The subset of patients in whom tics persist into adulthood experience higher rates of anxiety, and lower self-esteem, socioeconomic status, and quality of life; the relative contribution of motor tics and psychopathology is not fully understood. This article summarizes the clinical features of Tourette syndrome, including major diagnostic criteria, unique features of tics, and key aspects that differentiate tics from common mimics and chameleons. Comorbid psychiatric conditions and their impact on phenotype and quality of life are described. Finally, understanding of the natural history is summarized, including limited research in adults with Tourette syndrome.

### Assessment of symptom exacerbations in a longitudinal study of children with Tourette's syndrome or obsessive-compulsive disorder [^113RVfKA]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The severity of tic and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms varies over time. Consequently, how do we, as clinicians, know when a change in symptom severity occurs that falls outside of the normal range of fluctuation? The goal of this study was to describe the level of symptom severity fluctuation over time and to establish an objective, prospective, and quantitative method for identifying symptom exacerbations in children with Tourette's syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or both. A second major aim was to assess whether fluctuations in tic and OC symptom severity covaried with one another.

- **Method**: Monthly consecutive Yale Global Tic Severity Scale and Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores were prospectively obtained in 64 children diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome and/or OCD for periods ranging from 3 to 39 months. Exacerbation thresholds were estimated using state-of-the-art bootstrap methods. These thresholds were then independently evaluated by asking two expert clinicians to identify, retrospectively, clinically significant exacerbations based on a review of all available clinical and research records.

- **Results**: The severity of tic and OC symptoms displayed a high degree of intrasubject variability. Exacerbation thresholds, which incorporated the change score from the previous month and the symptom score, provided the best agreement with those of expert clinicians. When both tic and OC symptoms were present, they showed a significant degree of covariation.

- **Conclusions**: Evidence-based treatments are coming of age.

### All-cause and cause-specific mortality in Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorder [^115RvPmp]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome (TS) and chronic tic disorder (CTD) may be associated with an increased risk of mortality, but specific causes of death are poorly understood.

- **Objectives**: In this matched cohort and sibling cohort study, we estimated the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in individuals with TS/CTD, compared with unaffected matched individuals and unaffected full siblings.

- **Methods**: We identified all individuals diagnosed with TS/CTD in the Swedish National Patient Register who were living in the country between 1973 and 2020 and matched them (1:10) to individuals without TS/CTD from the general population. We also identified their siblings without TS/CTD. All-cause and cause-specific mortality outcomes, based on the International Classification of Diseases codes, were extracted from the Cause of Death Register. Covariates included sociodemographic variables and psychiatric disorders. Risks of mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.

- **Results**: We included 10,280 individuals with TS/CTD and 102,800 matched individuals without TS/CTD. In adjusted models, individuals with TS/CTD had an 86% increased hazard of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 1.86, 95% confidence interval: 1.65–2.11). The increased risk was observed for both natural (particularly nervous, digestive, and respiratory system diseases) and unnatural causes of death (including suicides and accidents). The sibling comparison showed similar results, indicating that the associations were unlikely to be explained by familial confounding.

### Tic-related versus tic-free obsessive-compulsive disorder: Clinical picture and 2-year natural course [^115aTiwb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The tic-related subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has a distinct clinical profile. Previous studies on the course of tic-related OCD in treatment contexts have yielded inconclusive results. This study aimed to compare clinical profiles between tic-related and tic-free OCD patients and to establish the influence of tics on the 2-year natural course in adult OCD patients.

Within the Netherlands OCD Association cohort, 377 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD were divided into a tic-related group (28%) and a tic-free group. The groups were compared on clinical variables using t-tests or χ² tests. Linear mixed-model analyses were employed to compare the 2-year course between the groups, with the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) as the primary outcome measure. Data were collected from 2005 to 2007 and from 2007 to 2009.

Patients with tic-related OCD reported an earlier disease onset (P = 0.009) and more symmetry/ordering symptoms (P = 0.002) compared to those with tic-free OCD. Overall symptom severity was similar in both groups. Those with tic-related OCD reported increased traits of attention-deficit hyperactivity (P < .001) and autism (P = 0.005) compared to the tic-free OCD group. Clinical improvement at the 2-year follow-up (mean = 5.3-point decrease on the Y-BOCS, P < .001, 95% CI = 4.3 to 6.3) was not significantly moderated by tic status (P = 0.24). This remained unchanged after correcting for baseline differences.

Tics do not critically affect the 2-year course of adult OCD; however, tic-related OCD shows differences in clinical presentation.

### Tourette syndrome: The self under siege [^1151weMV]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics — rapid, repetitive, stereotyped movements or vocalizations. Tourette syndrome typically has a prepubertal onset, and boys are more commonly affected than girls. Symptoms usually begin with transient bouts of simple motor tics. By age 10 years, most children are aware of nearly irresistible somatosensory urges that precede the tics. These urges likely reflect a defect in sensorimotor gating because they intrude into the child's conscious awareness and become a source of distraction and distress. A momentary sense of relief typically follows the completion of a tic.

Tics occur in bouts with a regular intertic interval over the course of hours. They increase during periods of emotional excitement and fatigue and can become "complex" in nature, appearing purposeful. Tics can be willfully suppressed for brief intervals and can be evoked by the mere mention of them. Tics typically diminish during periods of goal-directed behavior, especially those involving heightened attention and fine motor or vocal control, such as in musical and athletic performances.

Over months, tics wax and wane. New tics often appear in response to new sources of somatosensory irritation, such as the appearance of a persistent vocal tic (e.g. a cough) following a cold. Over years, tic severity typically peaks between 8 and 12 years of age. By the end of the second decade of life, many individuals are virtually tic-free. Less than 20% of cases continue to experience clinically meaningful tics.

### Prospective follow-up study of youth and adults with onset of functional tic-like behaviours during the Covid-19 pandemic [^1126bRmC]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with functional tic-like behaviours (FTLBs) were included in our prospective longitudinal child and adult clinical tic disorder registries at the University of Calgary. Patients were clinically diagnosed with FTLBs by a movement disorder specialist (T.P. or D.M.) between 1 October 2020 and 31 December 2022 and were prospectively evaluated 6 and 12 months after their first clinical visit. We assessed demographic features of sample participants, including age, sex, gender, and comorbid conditions present at baseline evaluation, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and autism.

Patients were screened using age-appropriate questionnaires for ADHD, OCD, GAD, and MDD and were clinically diagnosed based on confirmatory psychiatric interviews using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition criteria. Diagnosis of autism was based on historical reports. We recorded psychiatric medication use at each clinical visit. The use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety and/or depressive symptoms and the Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) as a treatment for FTLBs were recorded at 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. Tic inventories and severity were measured with the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).

Sample characteristics and tic inventories were summarized using proportions. We performed t-tests to compare the number of individual tics present at each time point, and the subscales of the YGTSS (total motor, total vocal, total tic, impairment, and global scores). We performed univariate linear regression models to evaluate.

### Emerging treatments for Tourette's disorder [^117WntXD]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Tourette's disorder is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics. Many children with Tourette's disorder improve throughout adolescence; however, some adults continue to experience severe symptoms and significant disability. This article examines the evidence base for treatments for Tourette's disorder. Emerging treatments, such as deep brain stimulation, habit reversal therapy, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, are also discussed.

### Sex differences in natural history and health outcomes among individuals with tic disorders [^111psXMK]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

To analyze sex differences in outcomes in Tourette syndrome (TS) and Persistent Motor or Vocal Tic Disorders (PMVT) in the Tourette Association of America International Consortium for Genetics (TAAICG) dataset, the relationship between sex and clinical measures was explored in 2,403 participants (N = 2,109 with TS; N = 294 with PMVT) from the TAAICG dataset using generalized estimating equation regression models, and adjusted for age and family relationships.

- **Results**: Female (vs male) participants with TS (25.5% of the sample) had 0.46 times lower odds of being formally diagnosed clinically with TS before the research study (p < 0.00001), later age at symptom onset (6.5 ± 2.8 vs 6.0 ± 2.7; p = 0.001), later age at diagnosis (13.3 ± 11.2 vs 10.7 ± 8.1; p = 0.0001), a longer time-to-diagnosis (3 [1, 7] vs 2 [1, 5], p = 0.01), and lower tic severity (28.4 ± 9.1 vs 30.7 ± 8.7; p < 0.0001). Female (vs male) participants with PMVT (42.9% of the sample) had an earlier age at symptom onset (7.9 ± 3.3 vs 8.9 ± 3.7; p = 0.05).

- **Discussion**: Female (vs male) participants with TS are less likely to be formally diagnosed, have later age at symptom onset, later age at diagnosis, and longer time-to-diagnosis. Female (vs male) participants with PMVT have an earlier age at symptom onset. Future research is needed to understand differences longitudinally in TS and PMVT.

### Prospective follow-up study of youth and adults with onset of functional tic-like behaviours during the Covid-19 pandemic [^113K2Pdi]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Importantly, one-third of the cohort with available data either had functional neurological symptoms at their initial presentation or developed them during the follow-up period. This was significantly associated with a worse YGTSS total tic severity score at 6 months. Furthermore, we know that functional tic-like behaviours (FTLBs) are frequently comorbid with disorders associated with increased somatization of distress, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) or borderline personality disorder. We hypothesize that a higher number of comorbid functional disorders might be associated with greater severity of distress and a reduced chance of rapid resolution of symptoms. Behavioral and multidisciplinary interventions in these patients are probably most warranted.

An important pitfall of our work was the large number of participants who did not return for follow-up, despite our efforts to contact them. Levels of nonresponse in participants with FTLBs were higher compared to our registry participants with Tourette syndrome. We suspect this phenomenon could be due to the improvement of FTLBs, as patients with more severe symptoms would be more likely to seek continued medical assistance. It is equally possible that participants who disagreed with our diagnosis of FTLBs, or our proposed treatment approach, chose not to follow up and sought care elsewhere. Although the total number of registry participants is large, not all patients with FTLBs chose to participate in our registries. This again could lead to bias in our results. Strengths of our study include the large number of participants and the comprehensive assessment of tics.

### Sex differences in natural history and health outcomes among individuals with tic disorders [^117GDBHB]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

For both sexes, the age at symptom onset for participants with TS was nearly 2 years earlier than for participants with PMVT, and both motor and vocal tic severity were higher, providing support for the suggestion that PMVT may be a milder manifestation of TS. Although OCD was slightly more prevalent in female participants with TS, the proportions were similar by sex. ADHD proportions were lower in female participants with TS. For female participants with PMVT, the rates of OCD were almost 2 times higher, and the ADHD rates were similar.

In conclusion, we demonstrated sex disparities in the diagnosis of TS and sex differences in individuals with TS/PMVT. Because results may not be generalizable across all patients (including lack of diversity), future research efforts are focused on examining sex and gender, as well as racial and ethnic differences, in larger administrative datasets for TS/PMVT.

### Tic disorders: From pathophysiology to treatment [^1121hA21]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Tic disorders are stereotypic behaviors, more frequent than once believed, and therefore likely to be encountered by primary care physicians. Tics usually begin in childhood and are the clinical hallmark of Tourette Syndrome (TS), the most common cause of tics. TS is a relatively common neurobehavioral disorder with a spectrum of manifestations that wax and wane during its natural course.

The pathophysiology of tics at the molecular and cellular level is still unknown, whereas structural and functional neuroimaging studies have shown the involvement of the basal ganglia and related cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits and the dopaminergic neuronal system. Moreover, TS has a strong genetic background.

The management of TS is often complicated by the presence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other behavior disorders. The correct diagnosis is a fundamental step for proper management of these disorders, and a multimodal treatment is usually indicated. This approach includes educational and supportive interventions, as well as pharmacological treatments when tics are at their worst.

### Rapid onset functional tic-like behaviors in young females during the COVID-19 pandemic [^11766GJL]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

We wish to bring neurologists' attention to this emerging disorder and highlight the important phenotypic differences these cases have from typical cases of TS. A prompt diagnosis and expert review to clarify the phenomenology when necessary is recommended. We also acknowledge that diagnostic labeling may be difficult when childhood onset simple tics and the more complex types of rapid onset FTLBs coexist in the same patient. Our initial, anecdotal experience is that these patients do not respond typically to conventional pharmacotherapies for tics, either showing dramatic improvement within hours or days of starting an α‐agonist (suggestive of a placebo response) or having no response whatsoever to antipsychotic medications with demonstrated high efficacy for tics.

- **Behavioral treatment approaches**: Including personalized psychoeducation, seem more appropriate to initiate a therapeutic process. Intuitively, function‐based therapeutic strategies, including mitigating potential triggering exposures, particularly social media content associated with tics, initiating stress management interventions related to other identifiable psychosocial stressors, reducing social reactions to symptom expression, and addressing comorbid anxiety and depression, could be confirmed as high‐yield strategies by future observations. Our prediction is that cognitive behavioral therapies, particularly when including components of the Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics, might have a considerable chance of success to treat this type of repetitive behavior.

### Tourette's syndrome in adults [^111CnufB]. Movement Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Tourette's syndrome (TS) is defined as motor and phonic tics starting before the age of 18 years. Therefore, most studies have focused on childhood TS, whereas the disorder in adults has not been well characterized. We reviewed medical records of all new TS patients, referred to our Movement Disorders Clinic over the past 5 years, who were 19 years or older on initial evaluation and compared them with 100 TS patients who were 18 years or younger.

The mean age at the initial visit of 43 adult TS patients was 58.8 ± 6.7 years, whereas the mean age at the initial visit of children with TS was 12.9 ± 2.0 years. Of the adult TS patients, 35 (81.4%) had a history of tics with onset before the age of 18 years (mean age at onset: 8.5 ± 3.4 years), with 8 (18.6%) reporting the first occurrence of tics after the age of 18 years (mean age at onset: 37.8 ± 13.2 years). Only two (4.7%) patients reported tic onset after the age of 50 years.

Adult patients with TS had significantly more facial and truncal tics, and a greater prevalence of substance abuse and mood disorders, but fewer phonic tics and lower rates of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and oppositional behavior than children with TS. Adult TS largely represents a reemergence or exacerbation of childhood-onset TS. During the course of TS, phonic and complex motor tics, self-injurious behaviors, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder tend to improve. However, facial, neck, and trunk tics dominate the adult TS phenotype. In addition, adults with TS are more likely to exhibit substance abuse and mood disorders compared with children with TS.

### Rapid onset of functional tic-like behaviours in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic [^117TRGwJ]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Since the second wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic, clinicians worldwide have reported an influx of young people, predominantly female teenagers, presenting with the rapid first onset of complex motor and vocal tic‐like behaviours. These tic‐like behaviours develop and peak in severity within hours to days, cause significant functional impairment, and display phenomenological similarities to popular TikTok video content of individuals with tics or tic‐like behaviours.

In January 2021, we launched our Adult Tic Disorders Clinical Registry, a prospective cohort study enrolling all adults seen in our program with tics. The goal of the registry is to document clinical characteristics of adults with tic disorders, their comorbidity and impairment profiles, and the evolution of tic symptoms over a 12‐month period. The rise in tic‐like behaviours during this period allowed us to enrol into the registry several young people presenting for the first time with these symptoms.

In this short communication, we contrast clinical features present at the registration visit in adults with rapid onset tic‐like behaviours to those seen in adults with Tourette syndrome (TS), persistent motor tic disorder (PMTD), or persistent vocal tic disorder (PVTD), with the goal of identifying clinical features to help clinicians differentiate between these disorders.

### Distinguishing functional from primary tics: A study of expert video assessments [^115vEadP]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Low credibility.

Diagnostic disagreement between expert clinicians may have resulted from differing criteria used to establish a functional tic diagnosis and differences in practical experience with functional tic patients based on referral biases and practice volumes. At the time of this analysis, diagnostic clues for functional tic disorder had been discussed in several publications, but specific criteria were not formally established, leaving the clinicians involved in this project to mainly rely on their own clinical intuition to make this diagnosis. Furthermore, clinical volumes with patients experiencing functional tics varied between expert clinicians, likely influencing individual expertise and confidence in making a functional tic diagnosis.

Our study could not assess the accuracy of our experts' final diagnostic judgment due to the lack of diagnostic standards or biomarkers. Very recently, after our data collection was complete, a single-centre study developed a set of diagnostic criteria that yielded encouraging discriminatory capacity to differentiate between the diagnoses of "functional tic disorder" and "primary tic disorder". Although differentiation by these criteria required the presence of at least two of seven different phenomenological characteristics potentially detectable through direct observation alone, it also required additional clinical information, including type of onset, comorbidity, and even sex at birth and family history. Even more recently, consensus-based diagnostic criteria for the clinical diagnosis of functional tic-like behavior have been discussed.

### Design of a multisite study assessing the impact of tic disorders on individuals, families, and communities [^116oQxzQ]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, are complex, multisymptom diseases, yet the impact of these disorders on affected children, families, and communities is not well understood.

- **Methods**: To improve the understanding of the impacts of Tourette syndrome, two research groups conducted independent cross-sectional studies using qualitative and quantitative measures. They focused on similar themes but distinct scientific objectives, and the sites collaborated to align methods of independent research proposals with the aim of increasing the analyzable sample size.

- **Results**: Site 1 (University of Rochester) was a pediatric neurology referral center. Site 2 (University of South Florida) was a child psychiatry referral center. A total of 205 children with tic disorders were enrolled from both studies. The University of Rochester also enrolled 100 control children to clearly isolate impacts of Tourette syndrome distinct from those occurring in the general population. The majority of children with tic disorders (n = 191, 93.1%) had Tourette syndrome, the primary population targeted for these studies. Children with Tourette syndrome were similar across sites in terms of tic severity and the occurrence of comorbid conditions. The occurrence of psychiatric comorbidities in the control group was comparable with that in the general pediatric population of the United States, making this a well-justified comparison group.

- **Conclusions**: Through collaboration, two sites conducting independent research developed convergent research methods to enable pooling of data.

### Mind the difference between primary tics and functional tic-like behaviors [^114TdJYy]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Beginning in spring 2019, movement disorder specialists around the world who focus on diagnosing and treating people with tic disorders observed the emergence of a new phenomenon. This involved acute-onset tic-like behaviors in young people. Initially, it was speculated that symptoms might represent "tic attacks" in patients with tic disorders or a rare variant of Tourette syndrome with acute onset. However, it soon became clear that these acute-onset tic-like symptoms are functional in nature.

The emergence of this new and previously unknown presentation of a functional neurological disorder (FND) has been linked to social media use. Influencers on platforms like YouTube and TikTok who display tic-like behavior may have contributed to this phenomenon. Additionally, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its consequences appear to be factors.

Over the past two years, the world has experienced an incredible period of change. Normal activities and behaviors, such as going to school or work, traveling, meeting others face-to-face, and even hugging our loved ones, have been stopped or significantly curtailed. These restrictions have occurred in a climate of fear and uncertainty: fear and uncertainty regarding personal and family health, economic survival, and the future of society as we once knew it. The impacts of death, illness, and the sudden restriction of freedoms continue to reverberate throughout local, national, and international communities.

### Rapid onset functional tic-like behaviors in young females during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114wBhRH]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Since the beginning of the COVID‐19 pandemic, our colleagues working at eight different Tourette Syndrome (TS) clinics globally have witnessed a parallel pandemic of young people aged 12 to 25 years (almost exclusively girls and women) presenting with the rapid onset of complex motor and vocal tic‐like behaviors. In most cases, these behavioral patterns are consistent with a functional neurological disorder. There have been striking commonalities in the phenomenology of these tic‐like behaviors observed across our centers in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia. The aim of this viewpoint is to help clinicians recognize patients with this disorder and distinguish them from patients with TS. We begin by describing the clinical phenomenology and demographic characteristics of youth with rapid onset functional tic‐like behaviors (FTLBs) using illustrative data from the Tic Disorders Clinical Registry at the Calgary Tourette and Pediatric Movement Disorders Clinic. We then discuss our shared experiences across our eight centers and provide preliminary viewpoints on the pathophysiology and treatment of this complex disorder.

### The management of tics [^115ojWxu]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

A tic is a stereotyped, repetitive, involuntary movement or sound, frequently preceded by premonitory sensations or urges. Most tic disorders are genetic or idiopathic in nature, possibly due to a developmental failure of inhibitory function within frontal-subcortical circuits modulating volitional movements.

Currently available oral medications can reduce the severity of tics, but rarely eliminate them. Botulinum toxin injections can be effective if there are a few particularly disabling motor tics. Deep brain stimulation has been reported to be an effective treatment for the most severe cases but remains unproven. A comprehensive evaluation accounting for secondary causes, psychosocial factors, and comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions is essential to the successful treatment of tic disorders.

### Mind the difference between primary tics and functional tic-like behaviors [^113UgTYY]. Movement disorders (2021). Low credibility.

What do these two cohorts tell us when added together with previously published work on the sudden onset of tic‐like behaviors, and previous work on functional tic‐like symptoms more generally?

First, they clearly document an explosive presentation of a functional neurological disorder (FND) with "Tourette‐like" symptoms. Although at first glance, some similarities with the clinical presentation of Tourette syndrome can be found, a closer look reveals several obvious differences, including age of onset, course of symptoms, and number and kind of movement and vocalization. Most of these patients had been misdiagnosed with Tourette syndrome before being seen at the specialist center. It is of utmost importance not to automatically diagnose Tourette syndrome in all those patients with otherwise unexplained jerks, vocalizations, and copro‐phenomena, but also to consider the diagnosis of a functional disorder. The typical onset of tics is discrete with simple motor tics, such as eye blinking, between the ages of 5 and 7 years, with a typical waxing and waning course thereafter. In other words, rapid onset of tic‐like symptoms with complex movements and swear words well after the age of 10 years with constant symptom progression excludes the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome.

Second, although patients with functional tic‐like behaviors were generally experiencing symptoms of a higher severity than patients with Tourette syndrome, in many cases an incongruity between reported severity and function is obvious. For example, patients and their families often report that because of the symptoms, unwanted interruptions occur in daily life activities…

### Distinct cerebellar networks underpin clinical improvement in adolescent Tourette disorder [^116wiaRp]. Brain (2025). Low credibility.

Adolescence is frequently called the second brain maturation period. In Tourette disorder (TD), the clinical trajectory of tics and associated psychiatric comorbidities varies significantly across individuals during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. In this study, we aimed to identify patterns of resting-state functional connectivity that differentiate adolescents with TD from their neurotypical peers and to monitor symptom-specific functional changes over time. We employed multivariate analysis based on support vector machine (SVM) to predict patterns of resting-state functional connectivity in 64 adolescents with TD and 61 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Fifty-seven TD patients participated twice, at a time interval of 15 months. Based on the results of the multivariate analysis, we implemented a general linear model testing within-group differences in resting-state functional connectivity over time, as well as their correlation with changes in the severity of tics, depressive, obsessive-compulsive (OCD), and attention deficit and hyperactivity (ADHD) symptoms. The SVM significantly discriminated TD from HC with above-chance accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. The most discriminative connections were prefrontal, striatal, and cerebellar networks. Between the visits, adolescents with TD showed decreased functional connectivity between the vermis 3 and the bilateral supplementary motor area, and between the vermis 4, 5 and the occipital cortex. The correlation analysis evidenced that improvement between the visits in the severity of tics was associated with in…

### Rapid onset of functional tic-like behaviours in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113VtArH]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Between 5 January and 5 June, 33 adults were enrolled in the Adult Tic Disorders Registry, including 24 with Tourette Syndrome/Persistent Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder (TS/PMTD) and nine with rapid onset tic-like behaviours. All 24 adults with TS/PMTD had an onset of tics in childhood. Among the nine adults with rapid onset functional tic-like behaviours, seven presented with their first-ever tic-like movements during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two had a history of mild simple motor or vocal tics in childhood, experiencing a sudden and dramatic onset of complex tic-like behaviours during the pandemic. In all nine patients, symptoms began between May 2020 and April 2021.

All participants with rapid onset tic-like behaviours reported symptom onset over hours to days, many providing a precise date. They all endorsed the presence of premonitory urges prior to tics and showed suggestibility and distractibility, with suppressibility in six out of nine cases. These participants were significantly younger but with a later age of onset and were more likely to be female. They were also more likely to be diagnosed with depression, have complex arm/hand and vocal tics, coprolalia, and scored significantly higher on the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (OCI), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome Quality of Life Scale (GTSQOL), and Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). Several patients with rapid onset complex tic-like behaviours exhibited a similar repertoire of complex motor tics, including tapping, clapping, and thumping.

### Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of children with tic disorders and behavioral problems: A real-world study and development of a prediction model [^112eaTL4]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Tic disorders (TD) are complex neuropsychiatric disorders with onset before the age of 18 years, characterized by the presence of repetitive, involuntary, nonrhythmic, sudden movements or vocalizations that can involve discrete muscle groups. According to the DSM-5, TD encompass provisional tic disorder (PTD), chronic motor or vocal tic disorder (CTD), and Tourette syndrome (TS). PTD is considered when individuals have at least one motor tic and/or vocal tic with a disease duration of less than one year. CTD is diagnosed when individuals have single or multiple motor or vocal tics, but not both at the same time, with a duration of longer than one year. TS is diagnosed when individuals have multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics, which may not appear at the same time, with a disease duration of more than one year.

Tics tend to follow an unpredictable waxing and waning pattern over time and could persist into adulthood. Although the typical natural history is of improvement or remission over time, TD are frequently associated with a variety of comorbid problems whose negative effects may exceed those of the tics themselves. About 85–88% of individuals with TS have been reported with at least one comorbid disorder, the most common being attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Other disorders such as anxiety/depression disorders, learning disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, externalizing disorders, and autism spectrum disorders are also prevalent among those with TS.

### Prospective follow-up study of youth and adults with onset of functional tic-like behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic [^116ofPxG]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The suggested etiologic factors and pathophysiological mechanisms for the increase in incidence of FTLBs during the pandemic include predisposing psychiatric comorbidities, maladaptive responses to stressors, increased exposure to stressors related to the pandemic period (e.g. lockdown and social isolation), and a phenomenon of mass sociogenic illness promoted by specific tic-related exposures on social media.

Although a substantial number of studies have reported on the presentation of FTLBs at first onset and/or cross-sectionally, the long-term prognosis in these patients is still not clear. So far, only two studies have addressed this aspect. In a prospective six-month follow-up conducted at our center, we reported on the course and treatment in an earlier case series of 20 adolescents and nine adults with FTLBs. Different parameters of symptom severity, corresponding to severity of movements, vocalizations, impairment, and global scores on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), significantly improved at six months in adolescent patients. In adults, only impairment and global scores significantly improved in the long-term follow-up. Two interventions that seem to have the best effect on symptoms prognosis were pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety and depression.

In another study from Italy, the authors evaluated prognosis in 11 patients with FTLB. At the 12-month follow-up, the authors observed a decrease in the severity of tics and anxiety, but no improvement of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or depression.

### Tourette syndrome: Clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment [^1159eenb]. The Lancet Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Tourette syndrome is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by motor and phonic tics that can substantially diminish the quality of life for affected individuals. Evaluating and treating Tourette syndrome is complex, in part due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and comorbidities between individuals. The underlying pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome is not fully understood, but recent research in the past five years has brought new insights into the genetic variations and the alterations in neurophysiology and brain networks contributing to its pathogenesis.

Treatment options for Tourette syndrome are expanding with novel pharmacological therapies and increased use of deep brain stimulation for patients with symptoms that are refractory to pharmacological or behavioral treatments. Potential predictors of patient responses to therapies for Tourette syndrome, such as specific networks modulated during deep brain stimulation, can guide clinical decisions. Multicenter data sharing initiatives have enabled several advances in our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome and will be crucial for future large-scale research and in refining effective treatments.

### Tourette syndrome and tic disorders: A decade of progress [^11363CJM]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

This review examines the progress made in understanding Tourette syndrome (TS) over the past decade, including models of pathogenesis, state-of-the-art assessment techniques, and treatment strategies.

- **Method**: Computerized literature searches were conducted using the key words "Tourette syndrome", "Tourette disorder", and "tics". Only references from 1996–2006 were included.

- **Results**: Studies have documented the natural history of TS and found that tics usually improve by the end of the second decade of life. It has become clear that TS frequently co-occurs with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and a range of other mood and anxiety disorders. These comorbid conditions are often the major source of impairment for the affected child. Advances have also been made in understanding the underlying neurobiology of TS using in vivo neuroimaging and neurophysiology techniques. However, progress on the genetic front has been less rapid. Proper diagnosis and education, involving the affected child, their parents, teachers, and peers, are essential prerequisites to successfully managing children with TS. When necessary, modestly effective antitic medications are available, though treating the comorbid ADHD and/or OCD is usually the priority.

- **Conclusions**: Prospective longitudinal studies and randomized clinical trials have refined several models of pathogenesis and advanced our evidence base for treatment options. However, further research is necessary to continue these advancements.

### Behavior therapy for children with Tourette disorder: A randomized controlled trial [^114xv58J]. JAMA (2010). High credibility.

Tourette disorder is a chronic, typically impairing childhood-onset neurologic condition. Antipsychotic medications, the first-line treatments for moderate to severe tics, are often associated with adverse effects. Behavioral interventions, while promising, have not been evaluated in large-scale controlled trials.

- **Objective**: To determine the efficacy of a comprehensive behavioral intervention for reducing tic severity in children and adolescents.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This study was a randomized, observer-blind, controlled trial involving 126 children aged 9 to 17 years. These participants, diagnosed with impairing Tourette or chronic tic disorder, were recruited from December 2004 through May 2007. They were randomly assigned to either 8 sessions of behavior therapy over 10 weeks (n = 61) or a control treatment consisting of supportive therapy and education (n = 65). Responders received three monthly booster treatment sessions and were reassessed at 3 and 6 months following treatment.

- **Intervention**: Comprehensive behavioral intervention.

- **Main outcome measures**: The study used the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (range 0–50; score > 15 indicates clinically significant tics) and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale (range 1 [very much improved] to 8 [very much worse]) as its primary measures.

- **Results**: The behavioral intervention resulted in a significantly greater decrease in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale score (from 24.7 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 23.1–26.3] to 17.1 [95% CI, 15.1–19.1]) from baseline to endpoint compared with the control treatment (from 24.6 [95% CI, 23.2–26.0] to 21.1 [95% CI, 19.2–23.0]) with P < .001.

### Prospective follow-up study of youth and adults with onset of functional tic-like behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114ruNgy]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Very little is known about the long-term prognosis of patients with functional tic-like behaviours (FTLBs). We sought to characterize the trajectory of symptom severity over a 12-month period.

Patients with FTLBs were included in our prospective longitudinal child and adult clinical tic disorder registries at the University of Calgary. Patients were prospectively evaluated 6 and 12 months after their first clinical visit. Tic inventories and severity were measured with the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).

Eighty-three youths and adults with FTLBs were evaluated prospectively until April 2023. Mean YGTSS total tic severity scores were high at baseline, with a mean score of 29.8 points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27.6–32.1). Fifty-eight participants were reevaluated at 6 months, and 32 participants were reevaluated at 12 months. The YGTSS total tic severity score decreased significantly from the first clinical visit to 6 months (raw mean difference = 8.9 points, 95% CI = 5.1–12.7, p < 0.0001), and from 6 to 12 months (raw mean difference = 6.4 points, 95% CI = 0.8–12.0, p = 0.01). Multivariable linear regression demonstrated that tic severity at initial presentation and the presence of other functional neurological symptoms were associated with higher YGTSS total tic scores at 6 months, whereas younger age at baseline, receiving cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety and/or depression, and prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with lower YGTSS total tic scores at 6 months.

### Deep brain stimulation for Tourette syndrome: Potential role in the pediatric population [^111HMxKQ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder. Despite an expected natural history of improvement with age, many individuals continue to have severe tics and remain refractory to the best pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a potential treatment option. This article reviews the published reports on the use of deep brain stimulation in Tourette syndrome, revealing that two anatomical targets have been most commonly used: the centromedian thalamus and the globus pallidus internus.

The evidence supports significant clinical improvement of tics with deep brain stimulation, though the data are limited by the small number of patients and variable methodology employed. To bridge these limitations, the International Tourette Syndrome Deep Brain Stimulation Database and Registry have been created, fostering collaboration among multiple centers from ten countries. By standardizing data collection, the database and registry are providing valuable insights into deep brain stimulation for Tourette syndrome. In conclusion, deep brain stimulation offers significant promise for the management of tics.

### We've all been wrong about provisional tic disorder [^116UTgyg]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Provisional Tic Disorder (PTD) is common in childhood. The received wisdom among clinicians is that PTD is short-lived and mild, typically involving at most a few tics, and rarely includes complex tics, premonitory phenomena, or comorbid illnesses. However, these conclusions stem from clinical experience with biased ascertainment and limited follow-up.

- **Methods**: A prospective study of 89 children with tics starting 0–9 months ago (median 4 months), with fewer than half from clinical sources. Follow-up occurred at 12 (± 24, 36, 48) months after the first tic.

- **Results**: At study entry, many children presented with ADHD (39), an anxiety disorder (27), OCD (9), or enuresis (17). All had at least two tics, with a mean total since onset of 6.9 motor and 2.0 phonic tics. Forty-one children experienced a complex tic, and 69 could suppress some tics. The tics were clinically meaningful: 64 had tics severe enough for a clinical trial, and 76 families sought medical attention for the tics. At 12 months, 79 participants returned, with 78 still having tics. Of these, 29 manifested no tics during history and extended examination, but only via audio-visual monitoring when the child was seated alone. Only 12 out of 70 now had plans to see a doctor for tics. Most who returned at 2–4 years still had tics known to the child and family, but the medical impact was low.

- **Conclusions**: Our results do not contradict previous data but overturn clinical lore. The data strongly argue against the longstanding but arbitrary tradition of separating tic disorders into recent-onset versus chronic.

### Placebo and nocebo responses in pharmacological trials of tic disorders: A meta-analysis [^116Nm5oB]. Movement Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Clinical trials of new drugs for tic disorders (TD) often fail to yield positive results. Placebo and nocebo responses play a vital role in interpreting the outcomes of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), yet these responses in RCTs of TD remain unexplored.

- **Objective**: The aim was to assess the magnitude of placebo and nocebo responses in RCTs of pharmacological interventions for TD and identify influencing factors.

- **Methods**: A systematic search of the Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO databases was conducted. Eligible studies were RCTs that compared active pharmacological agents with placebos. Placebo response was defined as the change from baseline in TD symptom severity in the placebo group, and nocebo response as the proportion experiencing adverse events (AEs) in this group. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to explore modifying factors.

- **Results**: Twenty-four trials involving 2222 participants were included in this study. A substantial placebo response in TD symptom severity was identified with a pooled effect size of -0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.99 to -0.59; I² = 67%). Forty-four percent (95% CI, 27% to 63%; I² = 92%) of patients experienced AEs while taking inert pills. Sample size, study design, and randomization ratio were correlated with changes in placebo and nocebo responses.

- **Conclusion**: There were considerable placebo and nocebo responses in TD clinical trials. These results are of great relevance for the design of future trials and for clinical practice in TD.

### All-cause and cause-specific mortality in Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorder [^116YfjiA]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Unlike previous efforts, we had sufficient power to investigate specific natural causes of death in TS/CTD. The ICD codes used for TS/CTD in the Swedish NPR have shown excellent reliability and good validity. The Swedish Cause of Death Register has an outstanding nationwide coverage. We were also able to systematically adjust for relevant socioeconomic factors and lifetime psychiatric comorbidities, and rule out unmeasured familial confounding.

This study also has some limitations. First, our cohorts may have been too young to present with some of the outcomes of interest; therefore, longer follow-up periods may result in different estimates, particularly for causes of death likely to appear at older ages, which is particularly notable in the sibling cohort. To identify siblings, we need data on the shared parents, available only from 1932 when the Multi-Generation Register started. Consequently, the sibling cohort is substantially younger than the general population cohort, having had less time to present with the outcome. For that reason, the general population and sibling cohorts are not directly comparable. The latter cohort was employed only to rule out the effect of shared familial confounding. Second, the NPR includes only diagnoses made in specialist care, with information from outpatient care available only from 2001 onward, which may have resulted in the inclusion of individuals with TS/CTD on the more severe end of the spectrum. Third, the frequency of some of the causes of death was relatively low.

### Sex differences in natural history and health outcomes among individuals with tic disorders [^113C32Rd]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Few studies have examined sex differences in the natural history and health outcomes in Tourette syndrome (TS) and persistent motor or vocal tic disorder (PMVT) [TS/PMVT]. Some studies suggest that female individuals with TS experience delayed diagnosis, worse tic severity in adulthood, and have varying responses to medications. Female individuals with TS have higher rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) than male individuals with TS, who, in contrast, have higher rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Female sex is an independent predictor of worse scores on measures of tic-specific impairment. Less is known about sex differences in tic-related outcomes in PMVT.

We retrospectively examined sex differences and outcomes in TS/PMVT using the Tourette Association of America International Consortium for Genetics (TAAICG) dataset. We hypothesized that female (vs. male) participants with TS/PMVT would have worse outcomes.
