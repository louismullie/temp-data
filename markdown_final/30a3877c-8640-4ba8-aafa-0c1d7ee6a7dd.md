## Question

what is natural course of tic disorder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the natural course of tic disorders across the diagnostic spectrum and over time. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic definitions because course differs by category. Then, I should verify the typical age and phenomenology of onset. Next, I will examine the childhood trajectory, including waxing and waning and the preadolescent peak. After that, I need to review longitudinal outcomes through adolescence into adulthood, including remission versus persistence and phenotype shifts. I should also assess predictors of persistence and the role of comorbidities. Then, I will distinguish primary tics from functional tic‑like behaviors and compare their courses. Finally, I will consider how treatment interacts with the natural history and outline counseling points consistent with guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework, because the interpretation of course depends on definitional boundaries. Under DSM‑5, provisional tic disorder is defined by motor and/or vocal tics present for less than 1 year, chronic motor or vocal tic disorder by a single modality persisting more than a year, and Tourette syndrome by multiple motor plus at least one vocal tic persisting more than a year, with onset in childhood; I should double‑check that these align with contemporary summaries, and yes, multiple pediatric and neurology sources reiterate these categories consistently, so I can proceed anchored to them.

> Next, I should review age at onset and early phenomenology to set expectations. Typical onset is in early school years, around ages 4–7, with first manifestations usually being simple motor tics such as eye blinking or facial movements, often later accompanied by simple vocalizations like sniffing or throat clearing; the onset is generally insidious, with suppressibility increasing with age and symptoms waxing and waning over weeks to months, and I need to ensure this is not conflated with the more abrupt functional presentations described during the pandemic, which indeed differ markedly in tempo and age distribution [^113hfCzX] [^1151weMV] [^11363CJM] [^113hfCzX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the severity trajectory without checking longitudinal patterns. Across sources, tics typically escalate in frequency and complexity toward a preadolescent peak before declining; while I initially thought the peak was strictly at 10–12, let me reconsider the range, as several reviews describe a broader peak across roughly ages 8–12 with individual variability and ongoing waxing and waning of specific tics over time, which fits clinical experience [^113hfCzX] [^1151weMV] [^11363CJM] [^1121hA21].

> I will now examine quantitative longitudinal data to avoid anecdotal bias. A large prospective clinic cohort demonstrated a mean annual decline of about 0.8 points per year on the YGTSS through adolescence, with only about one fifth retaining moderate to severe tic severity after age 16; this provides objective support for the heuristic of preadolescent peak followed by gradual improvement, although individual courses vary and comorbidity remains common, so I should be careful not to overgeneralize [^1134FDAZ].

> But wait, what about adult outcomes and potential phenotype shifts. By the end of the second decade many individuals are essentially tic‑free or have minimal tics, with one pediatric series suggesting more than 80% improve substantially by adulthood, whereas a blinded videotape follow‑up showed that some adults who self‑report being tic‑free still exhibit subtle tics on examination; moreover, adult TS phenotypes often show fewer phonic and complex tics but relatively more facial, neck, and trunk motor tics, indicating a shift rather than inexorable progression, and I should double‑check that these patterns are consistent across cohorts, which they are though with variability [^1136ocS4] [^114wYriz] [^111CnufB].

> Let me consider persistence into adulthood and its predictors. A Swedish nationwide cohort found about 20% of those diagnosed in childhood retained a chronic tic diagnosis after 18, with childhood psychiatric comorbidity, particularly ADHD and OCD, and family history of tic and anxiety disorders associating with persistence; I should confirm that socioeconomic and perinatal factors were not strong predictors in that model, and indeed they were not, although the observational design cautions against causal inference [^113GXe7n].

> Next, I should review the role of comorbid psychopathology in shaping functional outcomes, because impairment often tracks with ADHD and OCD more than tics per se. Across longitudinal and review data, ADHD and OCD are highly prevalent and can persist, with modest annual declines in severity yet ongoing clinical significance for a sizeable subset, and prospective epidemiology suggests bidirectional links over time between ADHD and OCD symptoms; this means counseling must emphasize monitoring and treating comorbidities alongside tics [^11363CJM] [^1134FDAZ] [^112q37gx].

> I need to ensure I distinguish primary tics from functional tic‑like behaviors, especially given the pandemic‑era surge. Functional tic‑like behaviors typically present abruptly in adolescent or young adult females, with complex vocalizations and movements, poorer suppressibility, and social media exposure, differing from classic childhood‑onset TS; consensus diagnostic criteria now exist to support clinical differentiation, and prognostically, FTLBs tend to show substantial improvement over 6–12 months, particularly when anxiety and depression are treated with CBT and SSRIs, though the evidence base is still maturing and follow‑up attrition may bias estimates [^113hfCzX] [^114Bsat6] [^1126bRmC] [^116ofPxG].

> Let me verify how treatment intersects with natural history, because improvement during adolescence could be spontaneous or treatment‑assisted. Behavior therapy, particularly CBIT, shows durable benefits and is guideline‑recommended as first‑line when available, while watchful waiting is acceptable for those without functional impairment and education about natural history is explicitly advised; thus, when counseling families about expected improvement by late adolescence, I should also note that targeted behavioral therapy can augment outcomes and that measurement with valid scales helps track trajectory and treatment response [^1119rf2k] [^114zT276] [^115U6chR] [^115XuVZs] [^117Xx1Wi] [^113YoBXo].

> I should double‑check for early prognostic markers beyond comorbidity. Experimental paradigms suggest that better capacity for voluntary tic suppression within months of onset predicts milder tic severity at one‑year follow‑up, implying that early inhibitory control may index a more favorable short‑term trajectory, although this needs replication and should not be overinterpreted at the individual level [^113mqGZs].

> Hmm, wait a minute, are there any long‑term adverse outcome signals that temper the generally reassuring natural course narrative. Large register studies suggest increased all‑cause mortality in TS/CTD relative to matched comparators and siblings, partly driven by potentially preventable unnatural causes, which underscores the importance of screening for psychiatric comorbidity and suicidality and addressing risk behaviors across the lifespan; while this does not negate the typical improvement of tics, it highlights the broader health context that clinicians must manage [^114n4Hci] [^1136A8a5].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my counseling reflects both the natural history and individual modifiers. Typical primary tics begin in early childhood with waxing and waning, rise toward a preadolescent peak, and most decline to minimal impact by late adolescence or early adulthood, with about one in five persisting at more impairing levels; persistence is more likely with higher baseline severity and comorbid ADHD or OCD, while functional tic‑like behaviors represent a distinct, often abruptly presenting phenotype with a generally favorable short‑term trajectory under targeted psychosocial care; throughout, education, comorbidity assessment, and individualized use of CBIT or watchful waiting align with best practices and help families navigate expectations and outcomes [^113hfCzX] [^1134FDAZ] [^113GXe7n] [^114Bsat6] [^1119rf2k] [^117Xx1Wi].

The natural course of tic disorders **follows a waxing and waning pattern** [^111aojUo], with onset typically between ages 4–7 [^111aojUo], peaking around 10–12 [^1159eenb], and improving or remitting in late adolescence or early adulthood [^11363CJM]. About **20% persist into adulthood** [^113GXe7n], often with reduced severity, and persistence is strongly linked to childhood comorbidities such as ADHD and OCD. Functional tic-like behaviors surged during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114wBhRH] [^113hfCzX] and are distinguished by rapid onset, complex tics, and female predominance [^114Bsat6]; they often improve with behavioral interventions and comorbidity management [^114HwMNZ] [^116ofPxG] [^1126bRmC]. Overall, **most tic disorders improve over time** [^1159eenb], but comorbidities frequently persist and drive long-term impairment [^1134FDAZ].

---

## Typical onset and early course

- **Age of onset**: Tics usually begin between ages 4 and 7, with a male predominance (approximately 3:1) [^111aojUo] [^1159eenb].

- **Initial presentation**: Early tics are typically simple motor tics (e.g. eye blinking, facial grimacing) and may be accompanied by simple vocal tics (e.g. throat clearing, sniffing) [^111ogcYD].

- **Early course**: Tics follow a waxing and waning pattern, fluctuating in frequency and severity over weeks to months.

---

## Peak severity and adolescent course

Peak severity typically occurs between **ages 10 and 12**, often coinciding with increased social and academic demands. Adolescent course is marked by general improvement after this peak [^11363CJM], with many individuals experiencing **significant reduction or remission** [^111aojUo] by late adolescence or early adulthood [^114wYriz].

---

## Long-term outcomes and remission rates

- **Remission rates**: Approximately 20% of individuals with tic disorders experience complete remission by adulthood, while the majority experience significant improvement in tic severity.

- **Persistence**: About 20% of individuals continue to experience clinically significant tics into adulthood, often associated with persistent comorbidities such as ADHD and OCD [^113GXe7n] [^1134FDAZ].

- **Adult course**: In adulthood, tics often become less severe [^111CnufB], with facial, neck, and trunk tics predominating, while complex motor and vocal tics tend to diminish [^1159eenb].

---

## Factors influencing tic persistence or remission

Several factors influence the likelihood of **tic persistence or remission**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on course** |
|-|-|
| Childhood tic severity | Higher severity predicts persistence [^113GXe7n] |
| Comorbid ADHD | Strongly associated with persistence [^113GXe7n] |
| Comorbid OCD | Strongly associated with persistence [^113GXe7n] |
| Family history of tics or anxiety disorders | Increases risk of persistence [^113GXe7n] |
| Female sex | Associated with delayed diagnosis and worse adult outcomes [^113C32Rd] [^116NKFhR] |

---

## Impact of comorbid conditions

**ADHD** commonly co-occurs with tic disorders [^111ogcYD] and significantly impairs academic performance, social functioning, and overall quality of life. OCD is also frequent [^11363CJM] and contributes to increased impairment and reduced quality of life [^1134FDAZ]. Anxiety and mood disorders are common and exacerbate functional impairment while reducing quality of life [^1134FDAZ].

---

## Functional tic-like behaviors (FTLBs)

During the COVID-19 pandemic, **rapid-onset functional tic-like behaviors increased markedly**, particularly among adolescent females [^114wBhRH] [^113hfCzX]. These presentations feature sudden onset, complex motor and vocal tics [^113VtArH], and high rates of comorbid anxiety and depression [^116WmFLw]. The course is often favorable [^116ofPxG], with significant improvement within 6–12 months — especially with behavioral interventions and comorbidity management [^112YDZva] [^114HwMNZ].

---

## Mortality and long-term health outcomes

**Mortality** is increased among individuals with tic disorders [^114n4Hci], particularly due to unnatural causes such as suicide and accidents [^115RvPmp]. **Long-term health outcomes** are often adversely affected because persistent tics and comorbidities can significantly impair quality of life, social functioning, and academic performance [^1159eenb] [^1134FDAZ].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Watchful waiting**: Appropriate for individuals with mild tics and no functional impairment [^115XuVZs] [^117Xx1Wi].

- **Behavioral interventions**: Comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) is recommended as a first-line treatment for moderate to severe tics [^114zT276] [^115U6chR] [^1119rf2k].

- **Pharmacological treatment**: Medications such as antipsychotics [^115DoUR4] and alpha-adrenergic agonists [^111HwK4o] may be considered for severe tics, with careful monitoring for adverse effects [^113ieV5u].

- **Management of comorbidities**: Essential to address ADHD, OCD [^111upEQG], anxiety, and mood disorders [^114wCJhs] to improve overall functioning and quality of life [^113FRFrK] [^1136A8a5].

---

The natural course of tic disorders typically involves early childhood onset [^111aojUo], peak severity in early adolescence, and **improvement or remission by adulthood** [^11363CJM]. Persistence into adulthood is strongly associated with childhood comorbidities, particularly ADHD and OCD [^113GXe7n] [^1134FDAZ]. Functional tic-like behaviors emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, often improving with behavioral interventions [^114wBhRH] [^114HwMNZ] [^116ofPxG].

### Prospective follow-up study of youth and adults with onset of functional tic-like behaviours during the Covid-19 pandemic [^112YDZva]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Very little is known about the long-term prognosis of patients with functional tic-like behaviours (FTLBs). We sought to characterize the trajectory of symptom severity over a 12-month period.

- **Methods**: Patients with FTLBs were included in our prospective longitudinal child and adult clinical tic disorder registries at the University of Calgary. Patients were prospectively evaluated 6 and 12 months after their first clinical visit. Tic inventories and severity were measured with the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).

- **Results**: Eighty-three youths and adults with FTLBs were evaluated prospectively until April 2023. Mean YGTSS total tic severity scores were high at baseline, with a mean score of 29.8 points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27.6–32.1). Fifty-eight participants were reevaluated at 6 months, and 32 participants were reevaluated at 12 months. The YGTSS total tic severity score decreased significantly from the first clinical visit to 6 months (raw mean difference = 8.9 points, 95% CI = 5.1–12.7, p < 0.0001), and from 6 to 12 months (raw mean difference = 6.4 points, 95% CI = 0.8–12.0, p = 0.01). Multivariable linear regression demonstrated that tic severity at initial presentation and the presence of other functional neurological symptoms were associated with higher YGTSS total tic scores at 6 months, whereas younger age at baseline, receiving cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety and/or depression, and prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with lower YGTSS total tic scores at 6 months.

### Early-life and family risk factors for tic disorder persistence into adulthood [^113GXe7n]. Movement Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Many children with tic disorders outgrow their tics, but little is known about the proportion of individuals who will continue to require specialist services in adulthood and which variables are associated with tic persistence.

- **Objectives**: The aims were to estimate the proportion of individuals first diagnosed with tic disorders in childhood who continued to receive tic disorder diagnoses after age 18 years and to identify risk factors for persistence.

- **Methods**: In this Swedish nationwide cohort study including 3,761 individuals diagnosed with tic disorders in childhood, we calculated the proportion of individuals whose diagnoses persisted into adulthood. Minimally adjusted logistic regression models examined the associations between sociodemographic, clinical, and family variables and tic disorder persistence. A multivariable model was then fitted, including only variables that were statistically significant in the minimally adjusted models.

- **Results**: Seven hundred and fifty-four (20%) children with tic disorders received a diagnosis of a chronic tic disorder in adulthood. Psychiatric comorbidity in childhood — particularly attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, pervasive developmental disorders, and anxiety disorders — and psychiatric disorders in first-degree relatives, particularly tic and anxiety disorders, were the strongest risk factors for persistence. We did not observe statistically significant associations with socioeconomic variables, perinatal complications, comorbid autoimmune diseases, or family history of autoimmune disorders.

### Prevalence of Tourette syndrome and chronic tics in the population-based Avon longitudinal study of parents and children cohort [^111aojUo]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic, childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by waxing and waning motor and vocal tics that persist for more than one year. Tics usually begin between 5 and 7 years of age, are most severe in early adolescence, and then gradually decrease in early adulthood. Chronic tic disorder (CT), defined by the presence of either motor or vocal tics (but not both), is similar in clinical phenomenology and disease course to TS but is less frequently associated with co-occurring neuropsychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). TS and CT cause significant physical and psychosocial morbidity, and in severe cases can produce lifelong disability.

TS was initially considered to be rare, with early estimates of approximately 5 per 10,000 school-age children (0.05%). However, these studies included only clinically ascertained cases, an approach that greatly underestimates the true prevalence of the disorder by excluding individuals who do not seek treatment. In contrast, a number of population-based studies conducted over the past two decades suggest that TS is much more common, with most prevalence estimates converging around a rate of 0.3% to 0.8% of the school-age population. Fewer studies have examined the prevalence of CT, with estimates ranging from 1.3% to 3.7% of children. Determination of accurate TS/CT prevalence estimates is important for assessing the overall burden of disease, allocating treatment resources, and estimating familial risk.

### Rapid onset functional tic-like behaviors in young females during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113hfCzX]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

The phenomenology of these rapid onset cases represents a noticeable departure from the usual demographic and natural history of TS. Tic onset in TS typically occurs between ages 4 and 7 years, and boys are disproportionately affected, with a ratio of over three to one. Tics typically begin insidiously, with young children usually exhibiting a few different tics at a time that wax and wane and evolve in character. In early years, tics are mostly simple, such as eye blinking, nose wrinkling, facial grimacing, sniffing, throat clearing, or coughing. Complex tics may emerge later, over a period of months to years, usually after simple tics have been present for some time.

Tics often worsen in preadolescence (ages 10–12 years) and improve in late adolescence. Other typical characteristics of tic disorders, such as premonitory sensations, urges to perform tics, subsequent relief of urges after the tic, suggestibility, and distractibility, can be present in association with both tics (more so in adolescents than in children) and FTLBs. These characteristics may therefore be less useful in differentiating between these two groups of patients.

In contrast, an ability to suppress or postpone tics, at least briefly, is usually demonstrated in older children with "typical" tics, whereas the suppressibility of FTLBs appears to be less efficient. The associated psychiatric comorbidity pattern in these rapid onset cases also differs from other tic disorders.

### Course of Tourette syndrome and comorbidities in a large prospective clinical study [^1134FDAZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by tics and frequent comorbidities. Although tics often improve during adolescence, recent studies suggest that comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) tend to persist. This large prospective follow-up study describes the clinical course of tics and comorbidities during adolescence and the prevalence of coexisting psychopathologies.

- **Method**: The clinical cohort was recruited at the Danish National Tourette Clinic, and data were collected at baseline (n = 314, age range 5–19 years) and at follow-up 6 years later (n = 227) to establish the persistence and severity of tics and comorbidities. During follow-up, the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) was used to diagnose coexisting psychopathologies. Repeated measures of severity scores were modeled using mixed effects models.

- **Results**: Tic severity declined yearly (0.8 points, CI: 0.58–1.01, on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale [YGTSS]) during adolescence; 17.7% of participants above age 16 years had no tics, whereas 59.5% had minimal or mild tics, and 22.8% had moderate or severe tics. Similarly, significant yearly declines in severity of both OCD (0.24, CI: 0.09–0.39, on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for Adults [Y-BOCS] and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for Children [CY-BOCS]) and ADHD (0.42, CI: 0.32–0.52, DSM-IV) were recorded. At follow-up, 63.0% of participants had comorbidities or coexistent psychopathologies, whereas 37.0% had pure TS.

Regarding medical management for Tourette's syndrome, more specifically with respect to antipsychotics, AAN 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining an ECG and measuring the QTc interval before and after starting pimozide or ziprasidone, or if antipsychotics are coadministered with other drugs that can prolong the QT interval.

### Tourette syndrome: A general pediatrician's 35-year experience at a single center with follow-up in adulthood [^1136ocS4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a complex neuropsychiatric condition encompassing patients with multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic. Onset is before 18 years, with at least one year of persistent symptoms. Beyond this core definition, the clinical burden is often highly influenced by the accompanying comorbid conditions, which may change over time. More than 80% of patients have significant improvement in tics by adulthood, but many continue with significant suffering from comorbid conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), learning disabilities, mood disorder, and others. A significant minority continue with lifelong tics that typically do not progressively worsen. The etiology appears to have both genetic and environmental influences, and males are much more frequently affected. Treatment with a variety of pharmacologic agents may lessen tic severity, and some nonpharmacologic treatments have also been shown to be helpful. Educational and social supports are pillars of treatment.

Symptoms in this disorder often evolve over time, and few studies follow patients from childhood to adult outcome. As public awareness has changed, patients present to a variety of medical providers for evaluation. This study retrospectively examines the 35-year practice of a general academic pediatrician with a special interest in tic disorders, including TS. The retrospective portion of the study details the presentation and course of 482 patients followed at a single center from 1972.

### Prospective, longitudinal study of tic, obsessive-compulsive, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders in an epidemiological sample [^112q37gx]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Understanding the interrelatedness of tics, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been complicated by studying only cross-sectional samples of clinically referred subjects. The authors report the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of these disorders in an epidemiological sample of children followed prospectively into early adulthood.

- **Method**: Structured diagnostic interview information was acquired on 976 children, aged 1 to 10 years, who were randomly selected from families living in upstate New York in 1975. Reassessments were acquired in 776 of these subjects 8, 10, and 15 years later. Diagnostic prevalences were estimated at each time point. The associations among tics, OCD, and ADHD were assessed within and across time points, as were their associations with comorbid illnesses and demographic risk factors.

- **Results**: In temporal cross-section, tics and ADHD symptoms were associated with OCD symptoms in late adolescence and early adulthood after demographic features and comorbid psychiatric symptoms were controlled. In prospective analyses, tics in childhood and early adolescence predicted an increase in OCD symptoms in late adolescence and early adulthood. ADHD symptoms in adolescence predicted more OCD symptoms in early adulthood, and OCD in adolescence predicted more ADHD symptoms in adulthood. The associations of tics with ADHD were unimpressive in temporal cross-section and were not significant in prospective analyses. Tics, OCD, and ADHD shared numerous complex associations with demographic factors.

### Prospective follow-up study of youth and adults with onset of functional tic-like behaviours during the Covid-19 pandemic [^113K2Pdi]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Importantly, one-third of the cohort with available data either had continued functional neurological symptoms from their initial presentation or developed them during the follow-up period. This was significantly associated with a worse YGTSS total tic severity score at six months. Furthermore, we know that functional tic-like behaviours (FTLBs) are frequently comorbid with disorders associated with increased somatization of distress, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) or borderline personality disorder. We hypothesize that a higher number of comorbid functional disorders might be associated with greater severity of distress and a reduced chance of rapid resolution of symptoms. Behavioral and multidisciplinary interventions in these patients are probably most warranted.

An important pitfall of our work was the large number of participants who did not return for follow-up, despite our efforts to contact them. Levels of nonresponse in participants with FTLBs were higher compared to our registry participants with Tourette syndrome. We suspect this phenomenon could be due to improvement of FTLBs, as patients with more severe symptoms would be more likely to seek continued medical assistance. It is equally possible that participants who disagreed with our diagnosis of FTLBs, or our proposed treatment approach, chose not to follow up and sought care elsewhere. Although the total number of registry participants is large, not all patients with FTLBs chose to participate in our registries. This again could lead to bias in our results. Strengths of our study include the large number of participants and the comprehensive assessment of tics.

### Distinguishing functional from primary tics: A study of expert video assessments [^115vEadP]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Low credibility.

Diagnostic disagreement between expert clinicians may have arisen from differing criteria used to establish a functional tic diagnosis, as well as differences in practical experience with functional tic patients based on referral biases and practice volumes. At the time of performing this analysis, diagnostic clues for the diagnosis of functional tic disorder had been discussed in several publications, but specific criteria were not formally established. This left the clinicians involved in this project to mainly rely on their own clinical intuition to make this diagnosis. Furthermore, clinical volumes with patients with functional tics varied between expert clinicians, which likely influenced individual expertise and confidence in making a functional tic diagnosis.

Our study could not assess the accuracy of our experts' final diagnostic judgment due to the lack of diagnostic standards or biomarkers. Very recently, after our data collection was complete, a single-center study developed a set of diagnostic criteria that yielded encouraging discriminatory capacity to differentiate between the diagnoses of 'functional tic disorder' and 'primary tic disorder'. Although differentiation by these criteria required the presence of at least 2 of 7 different phenomenological characteristics potentially detectable through direct observation alone, it also required additional clinical information, including type of onset, comorbidity, and even sex at birth and family history.

### Design of a multisite study assessing the impact of tic disorders on individuals, families, and communities [^116oQxzQ]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, are complex, multisymptom diseases, yet the impact of these disorders on affected children, families, and communities is not well understood.

- **Methods**: To improve the understanding of the impacts of Tourette syndrome, two research groups conducted independent cross-sectional studies using qualitative and quantitative measures. They focused on similar themes but had distinct scientific objectives. The sites collaborated to align methods of independent research proposals with the aim of increasing the analyzable sample size.

- **Results**: Site 1 (University of Rochester) was a Pediatric Neurology referral center. Site 2 (University of South Florida) was a Child Psychiatry referral center. A total of 205 children with tic disorders were enrolled from both studies. The University of Rochester also enrolled 100 control children to clearly isolate impacts of Tourette syndrome distinct from those occurring in the general population. The majority of children with tic disorders (n = 191, 93.1%) had Tourette syndrome, the primary population targeted for these studies. Children with Tourette syndrome were similar across sites in terms of tic severity and the occurrence of comorbid conditions. The occurrence of psychiatric comorbidities in the control group was comparable with that in the general pediatric population of the United States, making this a well-justified comparison group.

- **Conclusions**: Through collaboration, two sites conducting independent research developed convergent research methods to enable pooling of data.

### Prospective follow-up study of youth and adults with onset of functional tic-like behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1126bRmC]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Patients with functional tic-like behaviors (FTLBs) were included in our prospective longitudinal child and adult clinical tic disorder registries at the University of Calgary. Patients were clinically diagnosed with FTLBs by a movement disorder specialist (T.P. or D.M.) between October 1, 2020, and December 31, 2022, and were prospectively evaluated 6 and 12 months after their first clinical visit.

We assessed demographic features of sample participants, including age, sex, gender, and comorbid conditions present at baseline evaluation, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and autism. Patients were screened using age-appropriate questionnaires for ADHD, OCD, GAD, and MDD, and were clinically diagnosed based on confirmatory psychiatric interviews using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition criteria. The diagnosis of autism was based on historical reports.

We recorded psychiatric medication use at each clinical visit. The use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety and/or depressive symptoms, and the Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) as a treatment for FTLBs were recorded at the 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. Tic inventories and severity were measured with the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).

Sample characteristics and tic inventories were summarized using proportions. We performed t-tests to compare the number of individual tics present at each time point and the subscales of the YGTSS (total motor, total vocal, total tic, impairment, and global scores). We performed univariate linear regression models to evaluate.

### All-cause and cause-specific mortality in Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorder [^114BoB43]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

In the sibling cohort, we compared individuals with TS/CTD to their unaffected full siblings at risk for all-cause mortality, natural causes of death, and unnatural causes of death. Using time-varying exposures, which allowed for siblings to change exposure status, each sibling was followed from birth, January 1, 1973, or the date of immigration until the date of death (outcome), emigration from Sweden, or the end of the study period, whichever occurred first. Stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models, stratified on each sibling cluster, using attained age as the underlying timescale, were adjusted for sex and birth year for each sibling and sibling order (model 1) and then, additionally, for sociodemographic variables (model 2).

Data management and analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and Stata 18.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX). All tests employed two-tailed significance set at P < 0.05.

### Functional tics: Expanding the phenotypes of functional movement disorders [^116WmFLw]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Until the outbreak reported during the COVID-19 pandemic, functional tics were considered to be a relatively rare clinical phenotype, as opposed to other functional movement disorders such as functional tremor and dystonia. To better characterize this phenotype, we compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who developed functional tics during the pandemic and those of patients with other functional movement disorders.

- **Methods**: Data from 110 patients were collected at the same neuropsychiatry centre: 66 consecutive patients who developed functional tics without other functional motor symptoms or neurodevelopmental tics and 44 patients with a mix of functional dystonia, tremor, gait, and myoclonus.

- **Results**: Both groups were characterized by a female sex preponderance (70%-80%) and (sub)acute onset of functional symptoms (~80%). However, patients with functional tics had a significantly earlier age at onset of functional symptoms (21 vs. 39 years). Exposure to relevant social media content was reported by almost half of the patients with functional tics, but by none of the patients with other functional movement disorders. Comorbidity profiles were similar, with relatively high rates of anxiety/affective symptoms and other functional neurological symptoms (nonepileptic attacks).

- **Conclusions**: Patients who developed functional tics during the pandemic represent a phenotypic variant of the wider group of patients with functional movement disorders, associated with younger age at onset and influenced by pandemic-related factors.

### Long-term outcomes of behavior therapy for youth with Tourette disorder [^1119rf2k]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the long-term durability of behavior therapy for tics among youth with Tourette disorder and persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorders.

Of the 126 youth who participated in a randomized controlled trial of behavior therapy 11 years prior, 80 were recruited for this longitudinal follow-up. Consenting participants were interviewed in person or remotely (web-based video) by trained evaluators to determine the course of tics, tic severity, and tic-related impairment. Recruitment and data collection occurred between 2014 and 2019, with an average follow-up duration of 11.2 years.

Results indicated that treatment responders to both conditions in the original trial achieved partial, but not full, tic remission. Tic severity decreased significantly across the sample, with 40% reporting partial remission. Behavior therapy responders (n = 21) in the original trial were more likely (67%) to achieve remission at follow-up (Total Tic Score = 12.52, SD = 10.75) compared to psychoeducation/supportive therapy responders (n = 6, 0%) at follow-up (Total Tic Score = 20.67, SD = 6.92) on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale. Tic-related impairment decreased across the sample, with no significant differences between treatment groups or responders.

In conclusion, despite limitations of unmeasured variables and the veracity of self-report at follow-up, this study supports guidelines recommending behavior therapy as the first-line intervention for tics. Further investigation of behavior therapy as an early preventive intervention also merits attention.

### Tic suppression in children with recent-onset tics predicts 1-year tic outcome [^113mqGZs]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Successful voluntary tic suppression is a key component of the behavioral interventions that are used to treat tic disorders. This study aimed to examine tic suppression in children with recent-onset tics and determine whether the capacity to suppress tics predicts future tic severity. We tested 45 children (30 male, mean age 7.74 years) with recent-onset tics (mean 3.47 months prior to the first study visit; baseline) and re-examined each child at the 12-month anniversary of the first recognized tic (follow-up).

At the baseline visit, children performed a tic suppression task with several conditions: tic freely, inhibit tics given a verbal request, and inhibit tics in the presence of a reward. At the baseline visit, children with tics for only a few months could suppress their tics, and tic suppression was especially successful when they received an immediate and contingent reward. Additionally, the ability to suppress tics in the presence of a reward predicted tic severity at follow-up. These findings suggest that better inhibitory control of tics within months of tic onset may be an important predictor of future tic symptom outcome.

### Tics and problem behaviors in schoolchildren: Prevalence, characterization, and associations [^115pkYYx]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Tic disorders are the most common movement disorder diagnosed in children, with symptoms fluctuating in frequency and intensity over time. We conducted an 8-month longitudinal observational study to determine the variations in frequency of motor tics and associated problem behaviors.

- **Methods**: A total of 553 children, from kindergarten through sixth grade, were observed monthly from November 1999 to June 2000 by three raters. Motor tics were recorded by location and rated for severity as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). Problem behaviors were rated as absent (0), subclinical (1), or clinical (2) in six categories: disruptive, hyperactive, impulsive, aggressive, anxious, and distracted.

- **Results**: The monthly point prevalence of motor tics ranged from 3.2% to 9.6%, with an overall frequency of 24.4%. The monthly point prevalence of problem behaviors ranged from 2.6% to 11.0%, with an overall frequency of 25.7%. The incidence of motor tics and problem behaviors was significantly higher during the winter months of November through February compared with the spring months of March through June (motor tics: z = 4.97; problem behaviors: z = 3.79). Motor tics were observed in two distinct patterns (isolated and persistent), which varied by the number of months present, gender ratio of affected children, severity of tic symptoms, and association with problem behaviors.

- **Conclusions**: Motor tics and problem behaviors are frequent occurrences among schoolchildren and seem to occur more frequently during the winter months. For most children, the tics were mild to moderate in severity.

### Deep brain stimulation for Tourette syndrome: Potential role in the pediatric population [^111HMxKQ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder. Despite an expected natural history of improvement with age, many individuals continue to have severe tics and remain refractory to the best pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a potential treatment option. This article reviews the published reports on the use of deep brain stimulation in Tourette syndrome, revealing that two anatomical targets have been most commonly used: the centromedian thalamus and the globus pallidus internus.

The evidence supports significant clinical improvement of tics with deep brain stimulation, though the data are limited by the small number of patients and variable methodology employed. To bridge these limitations, the international Tourette syndrome deep brain stimulation database and registry have been created, fostering collaboration among multiple centers from ten countries. By standardizing data collection, the database and registry are providing valuable insights into deep brain stimulation for Tourette syndrome. In conclusion, deep brain stimulation offers significant promise for the management of tics.

### Tourette's syndrome in adults [^111CnufB]. Movement Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Tourette's syndrome (TS) is defined as motor and phonic tics starting before the age of 18 years, and therefore most studies have focused on childhood TS, while the disorder in adults has not been well characterized. We reviewed medical records of all new TS patients referred to our Movement Disorders Clinic over the past five years, who were 19 years or older at initial evaluation, and compared them with 100 TS patients 18 years or younger.

The mean age at initial visit of 43 adult TS patients was 58.8 ± 6.7 years, whereas the mean age at initial visit of children with TS was 12.9 ± 2.0 years. Of the adult TS patients, 35 (81.4%) had a history of tics with onset before the age of 18 years (mean age at onset: 8.5 ± 3.4 years), while 8 (18.6%) reported the first occurrence of tics after the age of 18 years (mean age at onset: 37.8 ± 13.2 years). Only two (4.7%) patients reported tic onset after the age of 50 years.

Adult patients with TS had significantly more facial and truncal tics, a greater prevalence of substance abuse, and mood disorders, but fewer phonic tics, and lower rates of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and oppositional behavior than children with TS. Adult TS largely represents the reemergence or exacerbation of childhood-onset TS. During the course of TS, phonic and complex motor tics, self-injurious behaviors, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder tend to improve, but facial, neck, and trunk tics dominate the adult TS phenotype. Additionally, adults with TS are more likely to exhibit substance abuse and mood disorders compared with children with TS.

### All-cause and cause-specific mortality in Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorder [^115RvPmp]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome (TS) and chronic tic disorder (CTD) may be associated with an increased risk of mortality, but specific causes of death are poorly understood.

- **Objectives**: In this matched cohort and sibling cohort study, we estimated the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in individuals with TS/CTD, compared with unaffected matched individuals and unaffected full siblings.

- **Methods**: We identified all individuals diagnosed with TS/CTD in the Swedish National Patient Register who were living in the country between 1973 and 2020 and matched them (1:10) to individuals without TS/CTD from the general population. We also identified their siblings without TS/CTD. All-cause and cause-specific mortality outcomes, based on the International Classification of Diseases codes, were extracted from the Cause of Death Register. Covariates included sociodemographic variables and psychiatric disorders. Risks of mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.

- **Results**: We included 10,280 individuals with TS/CTD and 102,800 matched individuals without TS/CTD. In adjusted models, individuals with TS/CTD had an 86% increased hazard of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 1.86, 95% confidence interval: 1.65–2.11). The increased risk was observed for both natural (particularly nervous, digestive, and respiratory system diseases) and unnatural causes of death (including suicides and accidents). The sibling comparison showed similar results, indicating that the associations were unlikely to be explained by familial confounding.

- **Conclusions**: The study underscores the significantly elevated mortality risk in individuals with TS/CTD, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions and improved understanding of the specific causes contributing to this risk.

### All-cause and cause-specific mortality in Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorder [^112wsVTk]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Kaplan–Meier survival curves, including 95% confidence intervals, illustrate the survival rates in individuals with Tourette syndrome (TS) or chronic tic disorder (CTD) and matched unexposed individuals.

Sex-stratified analyses showed that men and women with TS/CTD exhibited similar relative risks of all-cause mortality and unnatural causes of death compared to their unexposed counterparts. However, the relative risk of natural causes of death was higher in men than in women with TS/CTD. Notably, women with TS/CTD did not show a significantly increased risk of death due to natural causes when compared to unexposed women (Table S 3).

Analyses adjusted for psychiatric comorbidities showed a slight attenuation in the risk of all-cause mortality. The hazard ratio (HR) estimates ranged from 1.54 (95% CI: 1.36–1.75) when adjusting for substance use disorders (SUDs) to 1.81 (95% CI: 1.60–2.06) when adjusting for pervasive developmental disorders. When examining specific causes of death, the overall estimates for natural causes of death remained mostly unchanged, with some exceptions. Adjusting for SUDs resulted in no longer significant increased risks of death from diseases of the respiratory and digestive systems, accidents, and suicides. Similarly, adjusting for ADHD reduced the risk of deaths due to accidents to the null.

### Prospective follow-up study of youth and adults with onset of functional tic-like behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic [^116ofPxG]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Suggested etiologic factors and pathophysiological mechanisms for the increase in incidence of FTLBs during the pandemic include predisposing psychiatric comorbidities, maladaptive response to stressors, and increased exposure to stressors related to the pandemic period, such as lockdown and social isolation. Additionally, a phenomenon of mass sociogenic illness promoted by specific tic-related exposures on social media has been suggested.

Although a substantial number of studies have reported on the presentation of FTLBs at first onset and/or cross-sectionally, the long-term prognosis in these patients is still not clear. So far, only two studies have addressed this aspect. In a prospective 6-month follow-up conducted at our centre, we reported on course and treatment in an earlier case series of 20 adolescents and nine adults with FTLBs. Different parameters of symptom severity, corresponding to severity of movements, vocalizations, impairment, and global scores on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), significantly improved at 6 months in adolescent patients. In adults, only impairment and global scores showed significant improvement in the long-term follow-up.

Two interventions that seem to have the best effect on symptoms prognosis were pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for anxiety and depression. In another study from Italy, the authors evaluated prognosis in 11 patients with FTLB. At a 12-month follow-up, the authors observed a decrease in the severity of tics and anxiety, but no improvement of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or depression.

### Sex differences in natural history and health outcomes among individuals with tic disorders [^116NKFhR]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to analyze sex differences in outcomes in Tourette syndrome (TS) and Persistent Motor or Vocal Tic Disorders (PMVT) using data from the Tourette Association of America International Consortium for Genetics (TAAICG).

- **Methods**: The relationship between sex and clinical measures was explored in 2,403 participants (N = 2,109 with TS; N = 294 with PMVT) from the TAAICG dataset using generalized estimating equation regression models, adjusting for age and family relationships.

- **Results**: Female (vs. male) participants with TS (25.5% of the sample) had 0.46 times lower odds of being formally diagnosed clinically with TS before the research study (p < 0.00001), later age at symptom onset (6.5 ± 2.8 vs. 6.0 ± 2.7; p = 0.001), later age at diagnosis (13.3 ± 11.2 vs. 10.7 ± 8.1; p = 0.0001), a longer time-to-diagnosis (3 [1, 7] vs. 2 [1, 5], p = 0.01), and lower tic severity (28.4 ± 9.1 vs. 30.7 ± 8.7; p < 0.0001). Female (vs. male) participants with PMVT (42.9% of the sample) had an earlier age at symptom onset (7.9 ± 3.3 vs. 8.9 ± 3.7; p = 0.05).

- **Discussion**: Female (vs. male) participants with TS are less likely to be formally diagnosed, have a later age at symptom onset, a later age at diagnosis, and a longer time-to-diagnosis. Female (vs. male) participants with PMVT have an earlier age at symptom onset. Future research is needed to understand differences longitudinally in TS and PMVT.

### European Society for the Study of Tourette syndrome 2022 criteria for clinical diagnosis of functional tic-like behaviours: International consensus from experts in tic disorders [^114Bsat6]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

In 2020, health professionals witnessed a dramatic increase in referrals of young people with the rapid onset of severe tic-like behaviours. We assembled a working group to develop criteria for the clinical diagnosis of functional tic-like behaviours (FTLBs) to help neurologists, pediatricians, psychiatrists, and psychologists recognize and diagnose this condition.

- **Methods**: We used a formal consensus development process, employing a multiround, web-based Delphi survey. The survey was based on an in-person discussion at the European Society for the Study of Tourette Syndrome (ESSTS) meeting in Lausanne in June 2022. Members of an invited group with extensive clinical experience working with patients with Tourette syndrome and FTLBs discussed potential clinical criteria for the diagnosis of FTLBs. An initial set of criteria was developed based on common clinical experiences and a review of the literature on FTLBs and revised through iterative discussions, resulting in the survey items for voting.

- **Results**: In total, 24 members of the working group were invited to participate in the Delphi process. We propose that there are three major criteria and two minor criteria to support the clinical diagnosis of FTLBs. A clinically definite diagnosis of FTLBs can be confirmed by the presence of all three major criteria. A clinically probable diagnosis of FTLBs can be confirmed by the presence of two major criteria and one minor criterion.

- **Conclusions**: Distinguishing FTLBs from primary tics is important due to the distinct treatment paths required for these two conditions.

### Prospective follow-up study of youth and adults with onset of functional tic-like behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114ruNgy]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Very little is known about the long-term prognosis of patients with functional tic-like behaviours (FTLBs). This study sought to characterize the trajectory of symptom severity over a 12-month period.

Patients with FTLBs were included in our prospective longitudinal child and adult clinical tic disorder registries at the University of Calgary. They were prospectively evaluated at 6 and 12 months after their first clinical visit, and tic inventories and severity were measured with the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).

Eighty-three youths and adults with FTLBs were evaluated prospectively until April 2023. The mean YGTSS total tic severity scores were high at baseline, with a mean score of 29.8 points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27.6–32.1). Fifty-eight participants were reevaluated at 6 months, and 32 participants were reevaluated at 12 months. The YGTSS total tic severity score decreased significantly from the first clinical visit to 6 months (raw mean difference = 8.9 points, 95% CI = 5.1–12.7, p < 0.0001), and from 6 to 12 months (raw mean difference = 6.4 points, 95% CI = 0.8–12.0, p = 0.01).

Multivariable linear regression demonstrated that tic severity at initial presentation and the presence of other functional neurological symptoms were associated with higher YGTSS total tic scores at 6 months, whereas younger age at baseline, receiving cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety and/or depression, and prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with lower YGTSS total tic scores at 6 months.

### Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of children with tic disorders and behavioral problems: A real-world study and development of a prediction model [^112eaTL4]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Tic disorders (TD) are complex neuropsychiatric disorders with onset before the age of 18 years, characterized by the presence of repetitive, involuntary, nonrhythmic, sudden movements, or vocalizations that can involve discrete muscle groups. According to the DSM-5, TD encompass provisional tic disorder (PTD), chronic motor or vocal tic disorder (CTD), and Tourette syndrome (TS). PTD is considered when individuals have at least one motor tic and/or vocal tic, with a disease duration of less than one year. CTD is diagnosed when individuals have single or multiple motor or vocal tics, but not both appear at the same time during the course of the disease, with a duration of longer than one year. TS is diagnosed when individuals have multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics, which may not appear at the same time, with a disease duration of more than one year.

Tics tend to follow an unpredictable waxing and waning pattern over time and could persist into adulthood. Although the typical natural history is of improvement or remission over time, TD are frequently associated with a variety of comorbid problems whose negative effects may exceed those of the tics themselves. About 85–88% of individuals with TS have been reported to have at least one comorbid disorder, with the most common being attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Other disorders such as anxiety/depression disorders, learning disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, externalizing disorders, and autism spectrum disorders are also prevalent.

### Placebo and nocebo responses in pharmacological trials of tic disorders: A meta-analysis [^116Nm5oB]. Movement Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Clinical trials of new drugs for tic disorders (TD) often fail to yield positive results. Placebo and nocebo responses play a vital role in interpreting the outcomes of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), yet these responses in RCTs of TD remain unexplored. The aim was to assess the magnitude of placebo and nocebo responses in RCTs of pharmacological interventions for TD and identify influencing factors.

A systematic search of the Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO databases was conducted. Eligible studies were RCTs that compared active pharmacological agents with placebos. The placebo response was defined as the change from baseline in TD symptom severity in the placebo group, and nocebo response as the proportion experiencing adverse events (AEs) in this group. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to explore modifying factors.

Twenty-four trials involving 2,222 participants were included in this study. A substantial placebo response in TD symptom severity was identified, with a pooled effect size of -0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.99 to -0.59; I2 = 67%). Forty-four percent (95% CI 27% to 63%; I2 = 92%) of patients experienced AEs while taking inert pills. Sample size, study design, and randomization ratio were correlated with changes in placebo and nocebo responses.

There were considerable placebo and nocebo responses in TD clinical trials. These results are of great relevance for the design of future trials and for clinical practice in TD.

### Tourette syndrome: The self under siege [^1151weMV]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics — rapid, repetitive, stereotyped movements or vocalizations. Tourette syndrome typically has a prepubertal onset, and boys are more commonly affected than girls. Symptoms usually begin with transient bouts of simple motor tics. By age 10 years, most children are aware of nearly irresistible somatosensory urges that precede the tics. These urges likely reflect a defect in sensorimotor gating because they intrude into the child's conscious awareness and become a source of distraction and distress. A momentary sense of relief typically follows the completion of a tic.

Over the course of hours, tics occur in bouts, with a regular intertic interval. Tics increase during periods of emotional excitement and fatigue. They can become "complex" in nature and appear to be purposeful. Tics can be willfully suppressed for brief intervals and can be evoked by the mere mention of them. Tics typically diminish during periods of goal-directed behavior, especially those that involve both heightened attention and fine motor or vocal control, as occur in musical and athletic performances.

Over months, tics wax and wane. New tics appear, often in response to new sources of somatosensory irritation, such as the appearance of a persistent vocal tic (a cough) following a cold. Over the course of years, tic severity typically peaks between ages 8 and 12. By the end of the second decade of life, many individuals are virtually tic-free. Less than 20% of cases continue to experience clinically significant symptoms.

### Is persistent motor or vocal tic disorder a milder form of Tourette syndrome [^112dwLoG]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Persistent motor or vocal tic disorder (PMVT) has been hypothesized to be a forme fruste of Tourette syndrome (TS). Although the primary diagnostic criterion for PMVT — the presence of motor or vocal tics, but not both — is clear, less is known about its clinical presentation.

- **Objective**: The goals of this study were to compare the prevalence and number of comorbid psychiatric disorders, tic severity, age at tic onset, and family history for TS and PMVT.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from two independent cohorts using generalized linear equations and confirmed our findings using meta-analyses, incorporating data from previously published literature.

- **Results**: Rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were lower in PMVT than in TS in all analyses. Other psychiatric comorbidities occurred with similar frequencies in PMVT and TS in both cohorts, although meta-analyses suggested lower rates of most psychiatric disorders in PMVT compared with TS. ADHD and OCD increased the odds of comorbid mood, anxiety, substance use, and disruptive behaviors and accounted for observed differences between PMVT and TS. The age of tic onset was approximately 2 years later, and tic severity was lower in PMVT than in TS. First-degree relatives had elevated rates of TS, PMVT, OCD, and ADHD compared with population prevalences, with rates of TS equal to or greater than PMVT rates.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings support the hypothesis that PMVT and TS occur along a clinical spectrum, in which TS is a more severe and PMVT a less severe manifestation.

### Advances in understanding and treatment of Tourette syndrome [^117VXQ2M]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome is a hereditary, childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder that was first clearly described in France in 1885. This disorder is characterized by sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic movements (motor tics) or sounds (vocal or phonic tics), often preceded by premonitory sensations or urges. Some individuals also have psychiatric comorbidities, notably attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Tourette syndrome occurs worldwide, in all races and ethnicities, in both sexes, and in children as well as adults. Estimates of its prevalence in children vary, with rates of up to 1% being reported, but rates of 0.3–0.8% are thought to accurately reflect the occurrence of the disorder.

Research has led to progress in many aspects of Tourette syndrome, although many questions and unmet needs remain. For example, except for rare cases, the genetic basis remains elusive. The anatomical and neuronal changes in the brain that underlie Tourette syndrome are also unclear, although evidence increasingly implicates alterations in basal ganglia function.

- **Treatment**: Treatment is often unnecessary for individuals with mild tics, but for those with moderate to severe forms of the syndrome, some drugs are available, albeit frequently ineffective. Behavioral and surgical therapies, in particular deep brain stimulation, are currently undergoing development and show promising results.

This review examines the history of Tourette syndrome and describes its clinical presentation. The article also provides an overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology.

### Rapid onset functional tic-like behaviors in young females during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114wBhRH]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our colleagues working at eight different Tourette syndrome (TS) clinics globally have witnessed a parallel pandemic of young people aged 12 to 25 years (almost exclusively girls and women) presenting with the rapid onset of complex motor and vocal tic-like behaviors. In most cases, these behavioral patterns are consistent with a functional neurological disorder. There have been striking commonalities in the phenomenology of these tic-like behaviors observed across our centers in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia. The aim of this viewpoint is to help clinicians recognize patients with this disorder and distinguish them from patients with TS.

We begin by describing the clinical phenomenology and demographic characteristics of youth with rapid onset functional tic-like behaviors (FTLBs) using illustrative data from the Tic Disorders Clinical Registry at the Calgary Tourette and Pediatric Movement Disorders Clinic. We then discuss our shared experiences across our eight centers and provide preliminary viewpoints on the pathophysiology and treatment of this complex disorder.

### Tourette syndrome and tic disorders: A decade of progress [^11363CJM]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

This review evaluates the progress made in understanding Tourette syndrome (TS) over the past decade, focusing on models of pathogenesis, state-of-the-art assessment techniques, and treatment methods.

- **Method**: Computerized literature searches were conducted using the keywords "Tourette syndrome", "Tourette disorder", and "tics". References were limited to publications from 1996 to 2006.

- **Results**: Studies have documented the natural history of TS, noting that tics usually improve by the end of the second decade of life. It is now clear that TS frequently co-occurs with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and a range of other mood and anxiety disorders. These comorbid conditions often represent the primary source of impairment for affected children. Advances have been made in understanding TS's underlying neurobiology through in vivo neuroimaging and neurophysiology techniques, although progress on the genetic front has been less rapid. Proper diagnosis and education — targeting the affected child, parents, teachers, and peers — are essential for successfully managing TS. When necessary, modestly effective antitic medications are available; however, interventions to treat comorbid ADHD and/or OCD are typically prioritized.

- **Conclusions**: Prospective longitudinal studies and randomized clinical trials have refined several models of pathogenesis and enhanced the evidence base regarding treatment options.

### Practice guideline recommendations summary: Treatment of tics in people with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^1166WKrz]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for Tourette's syndrome, specifically concerning comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics, the AAN 2019 guidelines recommend considering comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics as an initial treatment option. This is particularly relevant for patients with tics who do not experience functional impairment, provided they are motivated to attempt treatment, in comparison to watchful waiting.

### Tourette syndrome: Clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment [^1159eenb]. The Lancet Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Tourette syndrome is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by motor and phonic tics that can substantially diminish the quality of life of affected individuals. Evaluating and treating Tourette syndrome is complex, in part due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and comorbidities between individuals. The underlying pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome is not fully understood, but recent research in the past five years has brought new insights into the genetic variations and the alterations in neurophysiology and brain networks contributing to its pathogenesis.

Treatment options for Tourette syndrome are expanding with novel pharmacological therapies and increased use of deep brain stimulation for patients with symptoms that are refractory to pharmacological or behavioral treatments. Potential predictors of patient responses to therapies for Tourette syndrome, such as specific networks modulated during deep brain stimulation, can guide clinical decisions. Multicenter data-sharing initiatives have enabled several advances in our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome and will be crucial for future large-scale research and in refining effective treatments.

### All-cause and cause-specific mortality in Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorder [^113iT4YN]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

This study investigated all‐cause mortality and cause‐specific mortality in over 10,000 individuals with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorder (TS/CTD), of whom 382 had died during the decade‐long follow‐up, and their matched individuals without TS/CTD. During the follow‐up period, individuals with TS/CTD exhibited a significantly higher mortality rate and an 86% increased relative risk of all‐cause mortality compared to the matched unaffected individuals. This could be attributed to both natural and unnatural causes of death. These mortality results are similar to those reported in the Danish population in the only previous report exploring mortality in tic disorders. Additionally, our sibling comparison showed that the observed increased risk of mortality in TS/CTD is unlikely due to familial confounding, although a slight attenuation of the estimates was observed.

Our study was the first to explore the specific natural causes leading to deaths in this patient group. Individuals with TS/CTD exhibited a 2.7-fold increased risk of death due to diseases of the nervous system, a 2.1-fold increased risk due to diseases of the digestive system, and a 1.7-fold increased risk due to diseases of the respiratory system. These results align with the increased risk of morbidity due to neurological conditions, conditions derived from the use of substances, and allergies and respiratory diseases previously described in TS/CTD. Interestingly, individuals with TS/CTD did not show an increased risk of mortality due to metabolic or circulatory system diseases, despite previous studies in this group indicating such risks.

### Sex differences in natural history and health outcomes among individuals with tic disorders [^117GDBHB]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

For both sexes, the age at symptom onset for participants with TS was nearly 2 years earlier than for participants with PMVT, and both motor and vocal tic severity were higher. This provides support for the suggestion that PMVT may be a milder manifestation of TS. Although OCD was slightly more prevalent in female participants with TS, the proportions were similar by sex. ADHD proportions were lower in female participants with TS. For female participants with PMVT, the rates of OCD were almost 2 times higher, and the ADHD rates were similar.

In conclusion, we demonstrated sex disparities in the diagnosis of TS and sex differences in individuals with TS/PMVT. Because results may not be generalizable across all patients, including a lack of diversity, future research efforts are focused on examining sex and gender, as well as racial and ethnic differences in larger administrative datasets for TS/PMVT.

### Clinical features of Tourette syndrome [^111ogcYD]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome is a multifaceted disorder characterized by multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic that start in childhood, persist for at least one year, and cannot be attributed to another medical condition or exposure to medications or drugs. Clinical diagnostic criteria are available, and identification of tics is typically straightforward based on characteristic appearance and features. Diagnostic uncertainty can rarely arise in cases of mild tics, atypical features, certain psychiatric comorbidities, and other non-tic movement disorders.

Comorbid psychopathology, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive behaviors or obsessive-compulsive disorder, affects the majority of patients and is correlated with disease severity and the presence of additional psychiatric behaviors. The severity of tics often improves after adolescence, whereas psychiatric symptoms typically persist. The subset of patients in whom tics persist into adulthood experience higher rates of anxiety, and lower self-esteem, socioeconomic status, and quality of life. The relative contribution of motor tics and psychopathology is not fully understood.

This article summarizes the clinical features of Tourette syndrome, including major diagnostic criteria, unique features of tics, and key aspects that differentiate tics from common mimics and chameleons. Comorbid psychiatric conditions and their impact on phenotype and quality of life are described. Finally, understanding of the natural history is summarized, including limited research in adults with Tourette syndrome.

### Rapid onset of functional tic-like behaviours in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113VtArH]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Between January 5 and June 5, 33 adults were enrolled in the Adult Tic Disorders Registry. Of these, 24 had TS/PMTD and nine exhibited rapid onset tic-like behaviors. All adults with TS/PMTD had their tic onset during childhood. Among the nine adults with rapid onset functional tic-like behaviors, seven experienced their first tic-like movements during the COVID-19 pandemic, while two had a history of mild simple motor or vocal tics in childhood, followed by a sudden and dramatic onset of complex tic-like behaviors during the pandemic. In all nine patients, symptom onset occurred between May 2020 and April 2021.

All participants with rapid onset tic-like behaviors reported symptom onset over a period of hours to days, with many able to pinpoint the exact date of onset. They endorsed the presence of premonitory urges before tics, suggestibility, and distractibility, with suppressibility present in six of the nine cases. Those with rapid onset tic-like behaviors were significantly younger but with a later age of tic onset, more likely to be female, diagnosed with depression, and more likely to have complex arm/hand tics, complex vocal tics, and coprolalia. They also had significantly higher scores on the ASRS, OCI, GAD7, PHQ9, GTSQOL, and YGTSS. Several patients with rapid onset complex tic-like behaviors displayed the same repertoire of complex motor tics, including tapping, clapping, and thumping.

### Objective assessments of longitudinal outcome in Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome [^114wYriz]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

To define the long-term outcome in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS), objective rating measures were used.

Previous historical studies have suggested that tic symptoms improve spontaneously after adolescence; however, objective longitudinal data are limited.

The authors reviewed all videotapes in their database (1978 through 1991) of children with GTS (ages 8 to 14) seen in their tertiary care movement disorder center, who underwent a standardized 5-minute filming protocol (n = 56). Through multiple contact methods, 36 of these patients, now adults (age > 20 years), were successfully located, and 31 (28 men and 3 women) volunteered for a second videotape and in-person assessment. A blinded rater evaluated the 62 tapes and rated five tic domains: body areas involved, motor and phonic tic frequency, and motor and phonic tic severity. Using standardized GTS videotape rating scale and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the authors compared the two videotapes for each tic domain as well as the composite tic disability score.

Ninety percent of adult patients continued to exhibit tics. Adult patients who considered themselves tic-free were often inaccurate in their self-assessment, with 50% showing objective evidence of tics. Mean objective tic disability diminished in comparison to childhood (mean composite tic disability score childhood 9.58 vs adulthood 7.52, p = 0.014). All domains improved by adulthood, with significant improvements occurring in motor tic severity (p = 0.008). Improvements in tic severity were noted.

### Mind the difference between primary tics and functional tic-like behaviors [^113UgTYY]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

What do these two cohorts tell us when added together with previously published work on the sudden onset of tic-like behaviors and previous work on functional tic-like symptoms more generally?

First, they clearly document an explosive presentation of a functional neurological disorder (FND) with "Tourette-like" symptoms. Although at first glance, some similarities with the clinical presentation of Tourette syndrome can be found, a closer look reveals several obvious differences, including age of onset, course of symptoms, and number and kind of movement and vocalization. Most of these patients had been misdiagnosed with Tourette syndrome before being seen at the specialist center. It is of utmost importance not to automatically diagnose Tourette syndrome in all those patients with otherwise unexplained jerks, vocalizations, and copro-phenomena. Consideration should be given to the diagnosis of a functional disorder. The typical onset of tics is discrete, with simple motor tics such as eye blinking occurring between the ages of 5 and 7 years, with a typical waxing and waning course thereafter. In other words, rapid onset of tic-like symptoms with complex movements and swear words well after the age of 10 years, along with constant symptom progression, excludes the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome.

Second, although patients with functional tic-like behaviors were generally experiencing symptoms of higher severity than patients with Tourette syndrome, in many cases, an incongruity between reported severity and function is obvious. For example, patients and their families often report that because of the symptoms, unwanted…

### Tic disorders: from pathophysiology to treatment [^1121hA21]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Tic disorders are stereotypic behaviors, more frequent than once believed, and are therefore likely to be encountered by primary care physicians. Tics usually begin in childhood and are the clinical hallmark of Tourette Syndrome (TS), the most common cause of tics. TS is a relatively common neurobehavioral disorder with a spectrum of manifestations that wax and wane during its natural course. Although the pathophysiology of tics at the molecular and cellular level is still unknown, structural and functional neuroimaging studies have shown the involvement of the basal ganglia and related cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, as well as the dopaminergic neuronal system. Moreover, TS has a strong genetic background.

The management of TS is often complicated by the presence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other behavioral disorders. Correct diagnosis is a fundamental step for proper management of these disorders, and a multimodal treatment is usually indicated. This approach includes educational and supportive interventions, as well as pharmacological treatments when tics are at their worst.

### Practice guideline recommendations summary: Treatment of tics in people with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^1136A8a5]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

For specific circumstances concerning Tourette's syndrome, particularly in assessing and managing co-occurring mental health conditions, the AAN 2019 guidelines recommend inquiring about suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts in patients with Tourette's syndrome. If such thoughts or attempts are present, patients should be referred to appropriate resources.

### Rapid onset of functional tic-like behaviours in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114HwMNZ]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Differentiating between tics and functional tic-like movements is important as the approach to treatment is distinct, with prioritization of functional behavioural interventions in the latter. As individuals with rapid onset functional tic-like behaviours are believed to have a functional neurological disorder, pharmacological treatments used for primary tic disorders are not expected to be effective in these cases. Our treatment approach for these patients includes psychoeducation with both patients and families to improve acceptance and understanding of the diagnosis, appropriate treatment of anxiety and/or depression if present, and behavioural therapy for tic-like behaviours.

- **Comprehensive behavioural intervention for tics**: This method is used with greater emphasis on functional behavioural assessment and intervention than on habit reversal therapy. Functional behavioural assessment focuses on identifying and addressing the internal and external antecedents and consequences of functional tic-like behaviours. We have experienced preliminary success with many patients using this approach and are currently collecting data as part of our prospective cohort study on short-term and long-term outcomes.

In conclusion, we propose that rapid onset tic-like behaviours are a distinct subtype of functional neurological disorder. The incidence of this functional neurological disorder phenotype has increased in young people since 2020, possibly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and appears to be strongly socially influenced.

### Tic-related versus tic-free obsessive-compulsive disorder: Clinical picture and 2-year natural course [^115aTiwb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The tic-related subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has a distinct clinical profile. The course of tic-related OCD has previously been investigated in treatment studies, with inconclusive results. This study aimed to compare clinical profiles between tic-related and tic-free OCD patients and to establish the influence of tics on the 2-year natural course in adult OCD patients.

- **Methods**: Within the Netherlands OCD Association cohort, 377 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD were divided into a tic-related group (28%) and a tic-free group. These groups were compared on clinical variables using t-tests or χ² tests. Linear mixed-model analyses were used to compare the 2-year course between the groups, with the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) as the primary outcome measure. Data were collected from 2005 to 2007 and from 2007 to 2009.

- **Results**: Compared to patients with tic-free OCD, those with tic-related OCD reported earlier disease onset (P = 0.009) and more symmetry/ordering symptoms (P = 0.002). Overall symptom severity was similar in both groups. Patients with tic-related OCD reported increased traits of attention-deficit hyperactivity (P < .001) and autism (P = 0.005) compared to the tic-free OCD group. Clinical improvement at the 2-year follow-up (mean = 5.3-point decrease on the Y-BOCS, P < .001, 95% CI = 4.3 to 6.3) was not significantly moderated by tic status (P = 0.24). This remained unchanged after correcting for baseline differences.

- **Conclusions**: Tics do not critically affect the 2-year course of adult OCD, but tic-related OCD shows differences.

### Is persistent motor or vocal tic disorder a milder form of Tourette syndrome [^114airST]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Persistent motor or vocal tic disorder (PMVT) has been hypothesized to be a forme fruste of Tourette syndrome (TS). Although the primary diagnostic criterion for PMVT (presence of motor or vocal tics, but not both) is clear, less is known about its clinical presentation.

- **Objective**: The goals of this study were to compare the prevalence and number of comorbid psychiatric disorders, tic severity, age at tic onset, and family history for TS and PMVT.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from two independent cohorts using generalized linear equations and confirmed our findings using meta-analyses, incorporating data from previously published literature.

- **Results**: Rates of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were lower in PMVT than in TS in all analyses. Other psychiatric comorbidities occurred with similar frequencies in PMVT and TS in both cohorts, although meta-analyses suggested lower rates of most psychiatric disorders in PMVT compared with TS. ADHD and OCD increased the odds of comorbid mood, anxiety, substance use, and disruptive behaviors and accounted for observed differences between PMVT and TS. Age of tic onset was approximately 2 years later, and tic severity was lower in PMVT than in TS. First-degree relatives had elevated rates of TS, PMVT, OCD, and ADHD compared with population prevalences, with rates of TS equal to or greater than PMVT rates.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings support the hypothesis that PMVT and TS occur along a clinical spectrum in which TS is a more severe and PMVT a less severe manifestation.

### Tourette syndrome and learning disabilities [^112ehMAU]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a complex developmental disorder characterized by the childhood onset of motor and vocal tics, typically showing gradual improvement over time in most subjects. The disorder is associated with increased prevalence rates of comorbid conditions, most commonly attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and learning disabilities (LD). Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or obsessive and compulsive behaviors (OCB) are also frequently observed.

Previous work has demonstrated that comorbidity significantly influences both the severity of symptoms and the level of impairment caused by the disorder. Although several conditions, such as OCD and ADHD, are recognized as manifestations of the broad TS phenotype, the inclusion of other conditions within this phenotype remains a topic of debate. Previous research has indicated a higher prevalence of LD among individuals with TS, yet the role of LD as a component of the TS phenotype is still unresolved.

Research on TS and comorbid LD has often been based on relatively small sample sizes from one or two clinic sites. These limitations raise concerns about the generalizability of the findings. To address these issues, a large international population study was conducted to examine the differences between subjects with TS, with and without comorbid learning disability.

### Tic-related activity restriction as a predictor of emotional functioning and quality of life [^1167Rvvu]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a chronic neuropsychiatric condition that frequently persists into adulthood. Existing research has identified demographic and symptom-level variables associated with psychopathology and poor quality of life in TS. However, behavior patterns associated with enhanced or adaptive psychological and global functioning among adults with TS have yet to be empirically identified. The study examined whether tic-specific activity restriction is related to emotional functioning and quality of life in adults with TS.

- **Methods**: Participants were 509 adults from the Tourette Syndrome Impact Survey who completed self-report measures of demographics, tic severity, emotional functioning, quality of life, and tic-related general and social activity restriction.

- **Results**: Partial correlations controlling for tic severity indicated that tic-related general and social activity restrictions were significantly correlated with lower quality of life and poorer emotional functioning. Hierarchical linear regression models indicated that activity restriction significantly predicted lower quality of life and poorer emotional functioning when controlling for tic severity and demographic variables.

- **Conclusions**: Adults who restrict fewer activities due to tics, regardless of tic severity, experience greater quality of life and better emotional functioning. Clinically, adults with chronic tics may benefit from interventions focused on enhancing engagement in valued life activities.

### Sex differences in natural history and health outcomes among individuals with tic disorders [^113C32Rd]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Few studies have examined sex differences in the natural history and health outcomes in Tourette syndrome (TS) and persistent motor or vocal tic disorder (PMVT) [TS/PMVT]. Some studies suggest that female individuals with TS experience delayed diagnosis, worse tic severity in adulthood, and have varying responses to medications. Female individuals with TS have higher rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) than male individuals with TS, who, in contrast, have higher rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Female sex is an independent predictor of worse scores on measures of tic-specific impairment. Less is known about sex differences in tic-related outcomes in PMVT.

We retrospectively examined sex differences and outcomes in TS/PMVT using the Tourette Association of America International Consortium for Genetics (TAAICG) dataset. We hypothesized that female (vs male) participants with TS/PMVT would have worse outcomes.

### Practice guideline recommendations summary: Treatment of tics in people with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^115DoUR4]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Tourette's syndrome, particularly with the use of antipsychotics, the AAN 2019 guidelines recommend monitoring for drug-induced movement disorders, as well as metabolic and hormonal adverse effects, using evidence-based monitoring protocols when prescribing antipsychotics for patients with tics.
