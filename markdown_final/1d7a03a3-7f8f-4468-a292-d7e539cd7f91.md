## Question

Htlv antibody positive patient implications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the implications of an HTLV antibody positive result — specifically, how to interpret, confirm, and manage this finding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the serologic result and differentiating HTLV-1 from HTLV-2. Then, I should assess the individual's baseline disease risk, especially ATL and HAM/TSP, and what modifies that risk. Next, I will review immediate clinical actions, counseling, and public health implications, including sexual, transfusion, and vertical transmission. After that, I need to outline disease-specific screening and follow-up. Finally, I will consider special populations, including immunocompromised patients, and close with counseling, prognosis, and the need for coordinated care, ensuring I verify each step against current guidelines and high-quality data.

> Let me first confirm the test and its limitations before jumping to conclusions. HTLV antibody screening assays are sensitive but not perfectly specific; false positives occur, and indeterminate or low signal/cutoff results are not uncommon, so a positive screen requires supplemental testing to confirm true infection and to type HTLV-1 versus HTLV-2 using a second immunoassay plus Western blot or line immunoassay and, when needed, PCR for proviral DNA to resolve indeterminate serology and distinguish HTLV-1 from HTLV-2 or dual infection, because RNA in plasma is not a useful marker for progression or management decisions [^1129Y8sr] [^116tXFEu] [^113wuzW3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about disease just because the antibody is positive. Most HTLV-1 carriers remain asymptomatic, but lifetime risks are meaningful: approximately 2–5% for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and about 0.3–4% for HTLV-1–associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, with risk variation by geography, age at infection, and host genetics; HTLV-2 is less clearly pathogenic, with sporadic neurologic reports and possible increased bacterial infections, so counseling should reflect that HTLV-2 disease risk appears substantially lower than HTLV-1 [^116rRFB8] [^111fWrk3].

> I need to check the main risk modifiers for disease progression because they guide follow-up intensity. Higher proviral load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is the strongest predictor of both ATL and HAM/TSP, with commonly cited thresholds such as > 4–5% of PBMCs marking elevated risk, although there is no universal consensus cutoff for management decisions; age at infection, with perinatal or early-life acquisition increasing risk, and clonal expansion metrics like the oligoclonality index can further refine risk stratification in high PVL carriers, so I should consider obtaining a proviral load and, where available, clonality assessment in appropriate patients [^114mG33x] [^111diSoT] [^114GoAJw].

> Next, I should review immediate counseling and transmission prevention, because prevention is central. I need to ensure the patient understands that HTLV is lifelong and transmissible via sexual contact, blood exposure, and from mother to child primarily through breastfeeding; thus, safer sex practices, avoidance of shared needles or sharp instruments, and deferral from blood and organ donation are essential, and in women of childbearing potential, discussion of elective cesarean delivery and formula feeding to prevent vertical transmission is critical, ideally with preconception or prenatal identification to act before breastfeeding begins [^115sNb7C] [^115tPgw3] [^117UZSFo].

> Let me consider blood safety and organ transplantation issues carefully. In low-prevalence settings, screening strategies have evolved from universal to selective testing of first-time donors or components that cannot be leukoreduced, and although pooled testing can reduce false reactivity, it may miss low-level infections, so individual testing improves sensitivity. Organ transplant programs generally screen donors for HTLV-1/2 and counsel recipients about risks, as transmission has been documented and HTLV-1–associated disease has occurred post-transplant, albeit with uncertain incidence and variable policies across centers [^116tXFEu] [^111VAp9C] [^116Rpdzs].

> I will now examine screening for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, and I should double-check guideline-directed steps. For carriers, especially those with high proviral load or older age, periodic CBC with differential and peripheral smear for atypical lymphocytes ("flower cells"), lymph node exam, and symptom review for B symptoms, skin lesions, hypercalcemia, and lytic bone lesions are warranted; if lymphoma is suspected, confirmatory HTLV-1 serology and molecular testing help distinguish ATL from PTCL-NOS, and staging with PET-CT, bone marrow evaluation, and cross-sectional imaging guide therapy, which ranges from watchful waiting in smoldering disease to combination chemotherapy and consideration of allogeneic transplant in aggressive subtypes [^113aRjC4] [^116cFtzj] [^111EZWiN].

> For HTLV-1–associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, I should confirm the diagnosis thoughtfully. WHO criteria require compatible spastic paraparesis with urinary dysfunction, exclusion of alternative etiologies, and HTLV-1 antibody positivity in both serum and CSF. MRI may show cord atrophy or lesions, and CSF analysis supports the diagnosis, though PCR for provirus in CSF is insensitive and not required for diagnosis. Management is symptomatic with spasticity control, bladder management, and physical therapy, and emerging data suggest mogamulizumab may benefit selected HAM/TSP patients, though this remains investigational in many settings [^1129Y8sr] [^1152v8KS] [^114LjrKk].

> But wait, what about other inflammatory and infectious complications. I should screen for Strongyloides stercoralis in those with exposure risk because HTLV-1 coinfection predisposes to hyperinfection syndrome, and I should maintain vigilance for uveitis, infective dermatitis, arthritis, and thyroiditis. In immunocompromised hosts, including transplant candidates and recipients, I need to ensure HTLV-1/2 testing is included in pre-transplant infectious screening and counsel on potential reactivation or progression risks under immunosuppression [^115iWYBE] [^116qqVTu] [^1132oTp9].

> Let me verify special populations and contexts where screening changes outcomes. In pregnancy and reproductive medicine, preconception or antenatal identification enables counseling to avoid breastfeeding and consider cesarean delivery, and in assisted reproduction, directed semen donors should be screened and sperm-washing protocols analogous to HIV considered to reduce transmission risk. In endemic regions or high-risk groups, pooled or targeted antenatal screening strategies can be cost-effective, though sensitivity–specificity trade-offs and confirmatory pathways must be planned [^117UZSFo] [^1178vZDE] [^113JU97R].

> I should confirm the role of proviral load and clonality in longitudinal risk assessment. Annual proviral load monitoring is reasonable in high-risk carriers, and where available, flow cytometry–based oligoclonality scoring can identify individuals at disproportionate risk of imminent ATL transformation, supporting closer surveillance or consideration of clinical trials; however, I need to emphasize that no antiretroviral regimen reliably reduces HTLV-1 proviral load in vivo, so prevention and early detection remain the cornerstones of care [^114GoAJw] [^116uVBYf] [^111FiV47].

> Hold on, I should verify the counseling message about prognosis and uncertainty. Most carriers remain asymptomatic lifelong, but a minority develop severe disease after decades, and individual risk prediction remains imperfect; therefore, patients should be linked to knowledgeable clinicians, provided with written resources, and engaged in shared decision-making about family planning, screening intervals, and symptom surveillance, with clear return precautions for neurologic, hematologic, or infectious red flags [^115sNb7C] [^116rRFB8].

> In summary, an HTLV antibody positive result requires confirmatory testing to establish true infection and type, followed by risk stratification using proviral load and clinical context, intensive counseling to prevent transmission, and tailored screening for ATL and HAM/TSP with attention to special populations such as pregnant women, transplant candidates, and those with immunosuppression. I need to ensure coordinated follow-up with hematology, neurology, infectious diseases, and obstetrics as appropriate, and to communicate that while no curative therapy exists for HTLV itself, early recognition of complications can improve outcomes and prevent transmission to others [^1129Y8sr] [^113aRjC4].

HTLV antibody positivity indicates **lifelong infection** with HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 [^111FiV47], most often asymptomatic but with a **risk of serious disease** [^116rRFB8]. HTLV-1 is linked to adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) [^113EhjBB] and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) [^114mG33x], and HTLV-2 is less pathogenic but associated with neurologic and hematologic disease [^111fWrk3]. Confirmatory testing (Western blot, PCR) [^1129Y8sr] is required to distinguish HTLV-1 from HTLV-2 and to guide counseling [^notfound]. Management is supportive; **no cure exists**, and antiretrovirals are ineffective [^111FiV47]. Prevention focuses on avoiding breastfeeding, safe sex, and screening of blood, organ, and stem cell donors [^1163nTXX] [^116Rpdzs] [^115tPgw3].

## Clinical implications of HTLV antibody positivity

### HTLV-1 associated diseases

- **Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL)**: An aggressive CD4+ T-cell malignancy [^115mRnaq] with a lifetime risk of ~2–5% in carriers [^116rRFB8], higher with high proviral load [^114mG33x] and early-life infection [^1129FU3L].

- **HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP)**: A chronic progressive myelopathy [^117VGLS7] with spastic paraparesis, sensory loss, and bladder dysfunction; lifetime risk ~0.3–4% [^116rRFB8], strongly linked to high proviral load [^114mG33x].

- **Other inflammatory conditions**: Uveitis, infective dermatitis, arthritis, thyroiditis, and pulmonary disease [^notfound].

---

### HTLV-2 associated diseases

HTLV-2 is less pathogenic than HTLV-1 but is associated with **neurologic disease** — including myelopathy and neuropathy — and with **hematologic abnormalities** such as lymphocytosis and thrombocytosis [^111fWrk3].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and differentiation

Initial screening with EIA or chemiluminescent assays must be confirmed [^1129Y8sr] to distinguish HTLV-1 from HTLV-2 and to resolve indeterminate results:

| **Test** | **Purpose** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Western blot | Confirmatory; differentiate HTLV-1/2 | Indeterminate results common [^1152v8KS] |
| Line immunoassay (LIA) | Improved discrimination; fewer indeterminates | Limited availability [^notfound] |
| PCR | Detect proviral DNA; confirm active infection | Not standardized; research use [^1129Y8sr] |

---

## Clinical management and follow-up

There is **no cure or definitive antiviral therapy** [^111FiV47]; management is supportive and symptom-directed:

- **ATL management**: Chemotherapy, antiretrovirals (zidovudine/interferon-α) for indolent disease, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation for aggressive subtypes [^112VeQjZ].

- **HAM/TSP management**: Immunomodulatory therapy (corticosteroids, interferon-β), antiretrovirals (limited benefit), and symptomatic care [^114LjrKk].

- **Regular monitoring**: Annual clinical review, CBC, and neurologic assessment; consider proviral load measurement where available [^114mG33x].

---

## Public health implications and prevention strategies

- **Mother-to-child transmission**: Avoid breastfeeding; formula feeding reduces transmission by ~50% [^115MV5gG].

- **Sexual transmission**: Consistent condom use reduces risk [^notfound].

- **Blood and organ donation**: Universal screening of blood, organ, and stem cell donors prevents transfusion/transplant transmission [^111VAp9C] [^116Rpdzs].

- **Education**: Counseling on transmission routes and prevention is essential [^111fWrk3].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Prognosis varies by disease: ATL has a **poor prognosis** with median survival ~8–12 months in aggressive forms [^116gaH5U], whereas HAM/TSP causes chronic disability with substantial quality-of-life impairment [^113anevq]. Most carriers remain asymptomatic but require lifelong monitoring [^115sNb7C].

---

HTLV antibody positivity signals lifelong infection with risks of ATL and HAM/TSP; **confirmatory testing is essential**, management is supportive, and prevention relies on breastfeeding avoidance, safe sex, and donor screening.

Rationale — current guidelines from both the American Cancer Society and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force allow for use of HPV co-testing with cytology and a negative HPV test predicts prolonged low risk of cancer; cytology/HPV co-testing can allow for a prolonged cervical cancer screening interval in women with HIV infection who are older than 29 years and have normal cervical cytology with concurrent negative HPV testing; for women older than 65 years, it is recommended to continue cervical cancer screening, while clinicians should consider the life expectancy of the patient and the risk for developing cervical cancer at this age.

### Detection of early phase human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 and 2 infection with an improved confirmatory test [^1115ZYau]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a blood-borne virus, and mandatory testing of donated blood for HTLV-1 antibodies has been adopted by Japanese Red Cross blood centers since 1986. A confirmatory line immunoassay was initiated in 2019 for individuals who were seroreactive in the screening test. This decreased the incidence of indeterminate individuals, however, donors with indeterminate results are not informed of their HTLV-1 seroreactivity and they can continue to donate blood.

Objectives

To clarify the characteristics of indeterminate line immunoassay results among Japanese blood donors.

Study Design

Of 759,259 blood donors in the Kyushu district of Japan, an area endemic for HTLV-1, 101 cases were classified as indeterminate by line immunoassay testing. We examined these cases using alternative secondary antibodies, anti-human-Ig (IgG/IgM/IgA) and -IgM antibodies, to detect the early phase of HTLV infection.

Results

Using anti-human-Ig and -IgM antibodies, HTLV infection status was confirmed in 37 individuals (HTLV-1-positive, 2; HTLV-positive, 27; HTLV-negative, 8). Among the remaining 64 indeterminate individuals, we identified one HTLV-2-infected 18-year-old female. A previous blood donation from this individual showed a negative anti-HTLV screening test result (signal-to-cutoff ratio = 0.1). Therefore, this case was considered to be an HTLV-2 seroconversion case.

Conclusions

These results indicate that the procedure for diagnosing HTLV infection should be reconsidered and that an accurate detection system for the early phase of HTLV infection is urgently needed for public health in Japan. Moreover, the issue of HTLV-2 infection needs a higher profile in Japan.

### Impact of human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 and 2 infection on survival following stem cell transplantation [^114odHVv]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Human T cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/2) are delta retroviruses. HTLV-1 may lead to complications, including adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy. Immunosuppression may result in progression from an asymptomatic carrier state to ATLL. Data on the safety of stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with HTLV-1/2 infection are lacking. The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database was queried for patients who tested positive for HTLV infection in the pretransplantation workup and underwent either autologous SCT (autoSCT) or allogeneic SCT (alloSCT). Patients were excluded if they underwent SCT for ATLL. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) at 3 years and 4 years post-SCT. In those who underwent autoSCT, 54 patients were HTLV-positive and 9836 were HTLV-negative. In those who underwent alloSCT, 105 patients were HTLV-positive and 18,077 were HTLV-negative. No difference in OS was noted between the HTLV-positive and HTLV-negative patients at 3 years post-autoSCT (76% versus 77%; p = 0.916). Inferior OS (32% versus 46%; p = 0.017) and nonrelapse mortality (35% versus 27%; p = 0.030) were observed in HTLV-positive patients at 4 years post-alloSCT. Future work should examine the mechanism by which HTLV-1/2 impact survival in alloSCT recipients.

### Quantification of T cell clonality in human T cell leukaemia virus type-1 carriers can detect the development of adult T cell leukaemia early [^1129FU3L]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is an urgent clinical need for new approaches to improve the dismal prognosis of adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL). The development of novel, well-tolerated therapeutics which can target both pre-malignant and malignant cells has raised the possibility of preventing ATL by treating those who are most at risk of transformation in the premalignant stage. These individuals can be identified through serological testing for human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), who have a 5% lifetime risk of developing ATL. ATL occurs almost exclusively in carriers who have a high PVL, and thus have a ~20% lifetime risk of ATL. Transformation generally occurs after many years of chronic infection, at a median age of ~50 in African-Caribbean and African–American patients. Perinatal exposure to HTLV-1, family history of ATL, smoking, and high proviral load (PVL, ≥ 4 copies of HTLV-1 per 100 PBMCs) are well-established risk factors for transformation. We hypothesised that a novel diagnostic tool that identifies the premalignant stage of ATL in high PVL carriers could further risk stratify this group, by detecting the presence of premalignant cells prior to the onset of symptoms, thus enabling prediction of transformation and justifying therapeutic intervention to prevent disease development.

### Self-flagellation as possible route of human T-Cell lymphotropic virus type-1 transmission [^1168FNPN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Four men were given diagnoses of infection with HTLV-1 as a result of Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority licensing regulations on the basis of a 2015 European Union directive. The directive requires facilities storing and processing human reproductive tissue to test for HTLV-1 in persons from areas of high prevalence, or with partners or parents from areas of high prevalence; that is, where infection is present in > 1% of the general population or > 1 case/10,000 persons for first-time blood donors.

Of the 7 couples for whom each partner's diagnosis was known, 4 couples were serodiscordant, despite unprotected sex over many years. Sexual transmission has been associated with proviral load and duration of the relationship. One study reported an ≈1% per year risk for infection among serodiscordant couples, although further data are needed to quantify sexual transmission risk in new relationships. During the 4 years since the first of these 10 cases was diagnosed, there has been 1 case of sexual transmission (case-patient G) (Table), and the affected woman is in her first pregnancy. She had negative results for HTLV-1 on 2 previous occasions.

All 10 men had asymptomatic HTLV-1 infections, but 2 men had a high proviral load (> 1%), which places them at risk for HTLV-associated disease. In all but 1 case-patient, HTLV-1 was the only bloodborne virus detected. Within heterosexual populations, transmission of HCV is commonly associated with using contaminated injection equipment. HTLV-1 predominance in our cohort suggests the presence of a pool of monoinfected persons and spread within this international community.

All patients have been advised by medical practitioners not to share implements during self-flagellation and to encourage fellow practitioners of flagellation to be tested for bloodborne viruses. Our visits to communities in which these practices occur to discuss risk elimination, raise awareness, and promote testing facilities have been favorably received, and risk reduction has been implemented.

### Self-flagellation as possible route of human T-Cell lymphotropic virus type-1 transmission [^115HadSb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We describe 10 cases of HTLV-1 infection in men in whom the practice of self-flagellation was the only identifiable risk factor. In 1 patient, co-infection with HCV was also found. Mother-to-child transmission is difficult to exclude without testing all mothers of the case-patient, not all of whom are in the United Kingdom. However, the 1 screened mother was seronegative for HTLV-1, and case-patient A was uninfected when he donated blood 9 years earlier, which excludes maternal transmission. It is likely that either sharing blood-stained blades, reusing personal equipment after inadequate cleaning with a shared disinfectant, contact of infected blood with open wounds, or contact with infected medical equipment resulted in HTLV-1 transmission.

Self-flagellation has also been noted to result in pneumothorax. In addition, Ashura, the period during which it is practiced, has been associated with increased medically reported injuries.

The contribution of self-flagellation to the transmission of bloodborne viruses is unknown. In the United Kingdom, clinics that screen for these viruses (antenatal and sexual health settings) do not ask about the practice and do not screen for HTLV. We propose that self-flagellation be added to the list of risk factors that result in testing for bloodborne viruses, including HTLV-1. Blood transfusion services might screen for this practice when assessing potential blood donors; for 6 men in this study, blood donation was the route of diagnosis. However, screening blood donors for HTLV-1 infection is not universal. Absence of screening, particularly in regions where self-flagellation is practiced, could accelerate dissemination of this infection. The seroprevalence of HTLV in Pakistan is unknown, but a recent study reported a prevalence of 0.19% among low-risk blood donors.

### The host genomic environment of the provirus determines the abundance of HTLV-1-infected T-cell clones [^113163gz]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

There has been a longstanding debate on the question of whether HTLV-1 is latent or persistently expressed in vivo. Persistent expression is strongly suggested by the extensive evidence that the strong, chronically activated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to HTLV-1 limits the proviral load and reduces the risk of HAM/TSP. Furthermore, there is both experimental evidenceand theoretical justificationfor selective proliferation of HTLV-1–expressing T cells in vivo. However, with currently available methods, it is usually impossible to detect either HTLV-1 mRNA proteins or virions in fresh uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

Within a given HTLV-1–infected person, 2 features differentiate the clones of infected cells: (1) the antigenic specificity of the T-cell clones (ie, the T-cell receptor); and (2) the proviral insertion site in the host genome. Proviral integration in the genome is not random, and each retrovirus has distinct target site preferences. These different targeting preferences are determined by several factors, notably the properties of the viral integrase, cellular protein partners, and the chromatin structure at the point of integration. HTLV-1 integration was found to favor genes, transcriptional start sites, and CpG islands both in vitro and in vivo.–

### Seroprevalence of human T-Cell lymphotropic virus-1 in a Jamaican antenatal population and assessment of pooled testing as a cost reduction strategy for implementation of routine antenatal screening [^117WGtPJ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study design.

Residual serum samples from antenatal patients attending the University Hospital of the West Indies antenatal clinic in 2019 were used for this study. A total of 926 unique antenatal patient serum samples were submitted for routine antenatal virology screening in 2019. To obtain a 95% CI with a 4% margin of error, 370 samples (40% of the total) were selected for HTLV-1/2 antibody testing. Forty percent of antenatal samples for each month of 2019 were selected randomly to ensure representative sampling between months. Sample testing was performed in 2020.

Laboratory tests.

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus–1/2 antibody testing was performed using the Abbott ARCHITECT r HTLV-I/II assay (Abbott GmbH & Co. Wiesbaden, Germany), which qualitatively detects antibodies to HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 in human serum or plasma by the chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) method. Samples were tested according to the manufacturer's instructions with a signal/cutoff (S/CO) value of ≥ 1 considered HTLV-1/2 reactive. Reactive serum samples were retested, and residual serum from the source tube clot was also tested to confirm reactivity; repeatedly reactive samples were tested by Western blot (MP Diagnostics HTLV Blot 2.4, Solon, Ohio) to confirm CMIA results and differentiate between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. Western blot interpretation was according to the manufacturer's instructions. The managing physician was informed of patients with confirmed HTLV infections. Women were notified of the result, with some opting to return to the clinic to have their child tested for HTLV using the same testing strategy described above. The children were > 1 year old, and therefore no maternal antibodies would be expected to be present. Clinical data for HTLV-positive antenatal mothers were collected from the patient's medical docket.

### Recommendations for practices using gestational carriers: a committee opinion [^112Ru1gT]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). High credibility.

Laboratory testing and medical evaluation — although FDA does not require screening or testing of GCs for possible transmissible infectious diseases to the fetus, the ASRM recommends the testing of all GCs and their partners before embryo transfer to protect the health and interests of all parties involved. Recommended tests include HIV-1 antibody, HIV-2 antibody, HIV group O antibody, HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 (male partner of GC only), hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody (IgG and IgM), HIV, HBV, and HCV nucleic acid test, serologic test for syphilis, CMV (IgG and IgM) (Male partner of GC only), and N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis testing using the nucleic acid test on urine or a cervical or urethral swab using an FDA-licensed, -approved, or -cleared test labeled for detection in an asymptomatic, low-prevalence population. Before acceptance, the potential GC should undergo a complete medical evaluation by a qualified medical professional, including preconception counseling and evaluation, and a uterine cavity evaluation by saline-infusion sonogram or another modality is highly recommended.

### Human immunodeficiency virus infection: a recommendation from the Women's Preventive Services Initiative [^113KyqD3]. WPSI (2022). High credibility.

Evidence note — missed cases and rationale for frequent screening: Approximately 20–26% of infected patients are not identified by risk-based screening, and early detection and treatment improve outcomes for patients and reduce transmission; therefore, based on clinical best practice, screening annually or more frequently may be reasonable.

### Seroprevalence of human T-Cell lymphotropic virus-1 in a Jamaican antenatal population and assessment of pooled testing as a cost reduction strategy for implementation of routine antenatal screening [^113JU97R]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

One approach to limiting testing due to economic constraints is identification of risk factors associated with HTLV-1 infection for targeted testing. However, in the population examined, we did not identify any demographic factors associated with testing HTLV-1 positive, indicating the need for HTLV testing of all women indiscriminately. Although this can potentially be cost-prohibitive in a low- and middle-income setting, we describe a quarterly pooled testing approach by CMIA that substantially reduces costs compared with individual testing. Pooling of sera has been used from 2002 to 2013 in the United Kingdom for blood bank screening, which reduced testing costs, and a study done in Brazil showed that pooling five samples/pool would result in a cost reduction of 60.7–73.6%. In a lower prevalence setting, costs could be further decreased with larger pools that could also negate the need for Western blot testing of CMIA low positive samples, in which most or all are false-positives, and would be expected to test CMIA negative with pools of 16 samples or greater; however, further studies in a low prevalence setting would be required to confirm this. Another approach that could be considered to further reduce the cost of HTLV screening in this population is increasing the cutoff value for HTLV reactive samples. As highlighted in this study and others, – raising the cutoff value to ≥ 4 S/CO would result in a reduction in de-pooling tests (from the reduced number of pools testing positive) and confirmatory testing of these samples. Our data showed a false-positive sample with an S/CO of 6.93, so increasing the cutoff to ≥ 7 S/CO would have an even greater impact on cost reduction. Raising the test cutoff value is expected to result in some loss of sensitivity, which may result in a small number of persons testing false-negative. We are not aware of a previous study raising the test cutoff value for pooled testing. To ensure test performance is not negatively impacted, raising the test cutoff value for pooled testing should be validated. Finally, cost and sensitivity of a pooled testing strategy should be carefully considered and taken into the context of the setting.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111MFVzy]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) — workup and transplant planning states that multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram is recommended under certain circumstances, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation and serology testing for HIV and human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) may be useful in selected cases, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is recommended for all patients eligible for transplant, and early referral to transplant is advisable for planning purposes.

### HTLV-1 associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM / TSP): case based discussion of risk factors, clinical, and therapeutic considerations [^113anevq]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

HTLV-1 is a retrovirus virus that infects CD4+ T cells. Most people with HTLV-1 infection remain asymptomatic but some may develop conditions such as HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) or adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. HAM/TSP is characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower extremities, as well as loss of bladder control and sensory disturbances. The risk of developing HAM/TSP is associated with the duration of infection and the proviral load. There is currently no cure for the disease but medications can help manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. This is the case of a 66-year-old female who presented with nonspecific symptoms of weakness and spasticity in a hospital in Connecticut and was subsequently diagnosed with HAM/TSP. The patient's diagnosis highlights the importance of considering diseases previously confined to specific endemic regions in a globalized world where increased emigration and population mixing can occur. Early identification and management of such cases is essential for optimizing patient outcomes and quality of life.

### HTLV-1 infection: role of CTL efficiency [^115sK7Jh]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Phenotypic examination by Sabouri and colleagues of CD8 + T cells in HTLV-1–infected people supports genetic and immunologic evidence that an inefficient CTL response to HTLV-1 results in a high proviral load and the inflammatory disease HAM/TSP.

### Epidemiological features and outcomes of HTLV-1 carriers diagnosed with cancer: a retrospective cohort study in an endemic country [^114zxGPX]. JCO Global Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, HTLV-1 carriers with a cancer diagnosis were generally middle age, had poor outcomes, and were from resource-constrained settings, highlighting an undetected transmission among vulnerable populations. Survival rates for patients with non-ATL neoplasms were lower compared with those in the regional cancer population. The poor outcomes among patients with non-ATL neoplasms might be associated with health care disparities and barriers to accessing prompt treatment in the HTLV-1–infected population. Patients with ATL had the worst survival; however, controversy remains if a synergic role between oncogenic viruses, such as HPV, affects treatment outcomes in patients with non-ATL cancer. Our findings describe the burden of HTLV-1 in a diverse cancer population and support the development of public health efforts to control this virus. Future studies should evaluate the population-based serology distribution of HTLV-1 among cancer populations to measure the effect of HTLV-1 infection on patient outcomes and to provide robust evidence on the feasibility of HTLV-1 screening in the outpatient cancer setting in endemic regions.

### An unusual case: adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma in pediatric patient with human T-lymphotropic virus 1 infection. clinical implications and therapeutic challenges [^112VeQjZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

HTLV-1 is endemic in regions such as Japan, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. In Colombia, the estimated prevalence based on blood donor seroprevalence studies ranges from 0.1% to 2.6%. Transmission occurs primarily through sexual, parenteral, and vertical routes.HTLV-1 is mainly associated with ATLL and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1–associated myelopathy, in addition to other conditions such as arthropathies, uveitis, and dermatological disorders, including infective dermatitis and folliculitis decalvans.

The risk of progression to ATLL in infected patients ranges between 2% and 4%. The disease typically develops after a long latency period, with an average presentation age of approximately 60 years, making pediatric cases exceptionally rare.

ATLL is classified in 4 variants: acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and indolent. In children, the acute variant is the most common and usually manifests with skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly.

Histopathologically, perivascular, nodular, and diffuse infiltration patterns can be observed, along with epidermotropism and Pautrier microabscesses. Although these findings are helpful, they lack diagnostic specificity, requiring high clinical suspicion. Thus, the diagnosis of ATLL is confirmed by HTLV-1 infection in a patient with mature T-cell neoplasia proven by histology and/or cytology, as in this case.

The prognosis of ATLL is poor, with high relapse rates and limited survival. Treatment is not standardized and includes options such as interferon-alpha, zidovudine, combined chemotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and new therapeutic agents. In this case, the patient did not respond to initial treatment, and other rescue options are currently under evaluation.

### Recommendations for reducing the risk of viral transmission during fertility treatment with the use of autologous gametes: a committee opinion [^1178vZDE]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) types 1 and 2 in ART — HTLV-1 infects CD4 T cells and causes adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV-1–associated myelopathy, while HTLV-2 infects CD8 T cells; only 1%–4% of infected individuals develop these HTLV-1–related diseases. Semen donors are screened for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 because of potential transmission through assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures, and risk-reduction protocols used for HIV-discordant couples that separate infected cells and free virus from sperm (sperm wash before insemination) could be applied when semen from directed donors infected with HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 is used to inseminate an uninfected partner.

### Anti-human T-Cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibody assays in cerebrospinal fluid for the diagnosis of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis [^114Cwp7k]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Anti-HTLV-1 Ab was regarded as showing true positivity in this study when both serum anti-HTLV-1 Ab by PA and PCR for HTLV-1 were positive, indicating that the subject was infected with the virus. All seropositive subjects showed PVLs of more than 10 copies/10 4 PBMCs, and all seronegative subjects showed no provirus. Diagnosis of HTLV-1 infection needs both a serum anti-HTLV-1 Ab screening test (PA, CLIA, or CLEIA) and a confirmatory test such as Western blotting or PCR. On the other hand, the diagnosis of HAM/TSP requires CSF anti-HTLV-1 Ab positivity in HTLV-1-infected individuals but not PCR positivity. Therefore, we detected CSF anti-HTLV-1 Ab PA titers over 4× but did not perform HTLV-1 PCR as a confirmatory test for anti-HTLV-1 Ab in CSF. Detection of HTLV-1 provirus in CSF may be difficult because HTLV-1 is usually detected in one of many cells, and PCR requires a large number of CSF cells. For example, even if we use a maximum of 10 mL of CSF for PCR, the total number of cells is limited to an order of magnitude of 10 4. When the number of HTLV-1 provirus is fewer than 10 copies in the CSF sample, detection of HTLV-1 provirus can fail by the quantitative PCR with a detection limit of 10 copies/10 4 cells. A study reported that PCR detected no PVL in CSF from subjects with serum Ab less than 64×. A method that is more sensitive and easier will be needed for confirmation of CSF anti-HTLV-1 Ab positivity.

INTRODUCTION

Infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) is lifelong and can lead to poor quality of life and substantially reduced life span if malignancy develops. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus–1 is associated with an aggressive malignancy and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), as well as an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system known as HTLV-associated myelopathy or tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Other HTLV types include HTLV-2, HTLV-3, and HTLV-4, though all are much less common than HTLV-1. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus–1 is the only type associated with oncogenic properties and is the most common type to be associated with disease; however, there remains no cure for HTLV-1, and treatment of the disease remains costly and the outcome is poor. For example, ATL, a universally fatal disease, has been shown in the United States to incur annual hospital expenses > U.S. $100,000 per patient per year. Pharmacotherapy such as integrase strand-transfer inhibitors and nucleoside analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors has demonstrated in vitro activity against HTLV-1; however, it has yet to show activity in vivo. In a pilot study, raltegravir was administered for 6 months to HTLV-1–infected persons, but it showed little reduction in HTLV-1 proviral load.

### Quantitative differences in HTLV-I antibody responses: classification and relative risk assessment for asymptomatic carriers and ATL and HAM / TSP patients from Jamaica [^114EESAn]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) are known to be caused by HTLV-I infection. However, current methods used to determine HTLV-I infection do not differentiate between HTLV-I asymptomatic carriers (ACs) and ATL and HAM/TSP patients. Using the luciferase immunoprecipitation system, a highly sensitive, quantitative technology that can efficiently detect HTLV-I Ab responses, we examined Ab responses for HTLV-I in serum/plasma samples from 439 subjects in Jamaica, including HTLV-I-seronegative donors, ACs, and ATL and HAM/TSP patients. The Ab responses of HTLV-I-infected subjects differed significantly from those of seronegative donors for all 3 immunodominant proteins, Gag, Env, and Tax. HAM/TSP patients had significantly higher Ab responses for Gag and Env compared with ACs, and Ab responses for all 3 Ags were higher in HAM/TSP patients than in ATL patients. Moreover, immunoreactivities for HTLV-I Ags as determined by the luciferase immunoprecipitation system could distinguish HAM/TSP patients from ACs at a true-positive rate of 85.42% and from ATL patients at a true-positive rate of 75.00%, and modeled in conjunction with subject information to distinguish HAM/TSP patients from ACs (odds ratio = 14.12) and from ATL patients (odds ratio = 7.00). The relative risk assessment resulting from these significant differences between Ab responses in HTLV-I-infected groups may be a useful diagnostic tool in the future.

### Retrospective review of serological testing of potential human milk donors [^115vxZxn]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of positive serology among potential donors to a human milk bank.

Design

Retrospective review of our experience with donor serological testing at our milk bank over a 6-year interval.

Setting

Not-for-profit, regional human milk bank.

Patients

Volunteer, unpaid potential donors of human milk.

Interventions

Serological testing for syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and human T cell lymphotropic virus type 2 (HTLV-2).

Main Outcome Measures

Results of serological screening tests performed on potential donors.

Results

Of 1091 potential donors, 3.3% were positive on screening serology, including 6 syphilis, 17 hepatitis B, 3 hepatitis C, 6 HTLV and 4 HIV.

Conclusions

There is a significant incidence of positive serology among women interested in donating human milk. This implies that there may be significant risk associated with peer-to-peer distribution of human milk from unscreened donors.

### Long-term serological follow-up of blood donors with an HTLV-indeterminate Western blot: antibody profile of seroconverters and individuals with false reactions [^113H9g5d]. Journal of Medical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

The high proportion of indeterminate results of the screening test for human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection has been a challenge worldwide. In this study, 60 persons with seroindeterminate results for HTLV were followed until their serological status was defined. At least two independent serological tests (EIA and WB) from sequential samples were performed at an average interval of 4.4 years, totaling 141 serum samples tested. Seroconversion occurred in 12 individuals (reactive by EIA, positive by WB and PCR), and 48 were classified as false reactions (non-reactive EIA and negative PCR, but indeterminate WB). The seroconverter group had epidemiological features similar to those seen in HTLV-1 carriers, and the average time of follow-up for seroconversion was 4 years. In the group with false reactions, the most frequent indeterminate WB pattern in the samples was the presence of p24 alone. This pattern was absent in the seroconverter group, suggesting that p24 alone is an indicator of false reactivity. In contrast, the presence of p19 and p24 seems to be an indicator of true reactivity, since this pattern was frequent (66.7%) among the seroconverters and much less common (10.4% of the first samples) among the individuals with false reactions (P = 0.0001). Thus, HTLV infection may be suspected when reactivity to p19 and p24 is observed. Individuals with an indeterminate WB pattern should be followed-up and retested. The improvement of the HTLV algorithm screening of blood donors has been necessary to reduce inconclusive results and to avoid unnecessary follow-up to define the status of infection.

Given the patient's geographic origin, serological tests for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 were conducted, yielding positive results. Peripheral blood flow cytometry revealed an abnormal population comprising 39.5% of total events, corresponding to mature CD4+ T cells with an aberrant immunophenotype: CD45+, CD2+, CD3+, CD4+, weak CD5+, CD25+ (95%), partial CD7 expression, and negative for CD8. Bone marrow flow cytometry demonstrated a similar abnormal T-cell population representing 48.85% of total events, with an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio (15:91) and aberrant expression of CD45+, CD2+, CD3+, CD4+, CD5+, CD25+ (98%), CD7+/−, and weak CD8+/−, consistent with mature T-cell neoplasia. The clinical presentation, HTLV-1/HTLV-2 seropositivity, consistent CD25 expression, partial CD7 loss, bone marrow involvement, and aggressive clinical course confirmed acute-phase ATLL. The patient received 3 cycles of the LSG-15 chemotherapy protocol (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone [VCAP]; doxorubicin, ranimustine, and prednisone [AMP]; vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisone [VECP]); however, no clinical improvement was observed. Immunophenotyping of both bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid revealed infiltration by aberrant lymphocytes, indicating relapse involving both the bone marrow and central nervous system. The patient was not considered a candidate for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation due to both parents testing positive for active HTLV-1 infection, and being an only child, no suitable sibling donors were available. Given these limitations, salvage chemotherapy was offered, but the patient's parents ultimately declined curative treatment. She is currently undergoing palliative care, with a focus on symptom management.

### History and update of HTLV infection in China [^116uxaMB]. Virus Research (2014). Low credibility.

Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection is a high risk factor for lymphoproliferative, inflammatory, and infectious disorders. The epidemiology of HTLV-I, II in industrialized countries has been intensively investigated, and mandatory screening of blood supplies for HTLV-I/II was implemented in mid-1980s in most developed and several developing countries, yet no expanding investigation has been executed in China so far and also been considered as a non-endemic region. However, Gessain et al. reported that the current number of HTLV carriers in the highly populated China is very probably much higher. Therefore, gaining insight into the epidemiology of HTLV infections is essential for avoiding HTLV-induced risk. To introduce the history and renew the HTLV infection in China, we reviewed literatures and conducted an investigation among blood donors in 9 provinces in China. Concluded from the historical and renewed data, the HTLV screen in China can be divided into three stages.

### Human T-lymphotropic virus / HIV co-infection: a clinical review [^115sTMi8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)/HIV co-infections are often undiagnosed, with important clinical implications. The literature is relatively sparse with key observations derived in the pre-highly-active antiretroviral therapy era.

Recent Findings

The epidemiology of co-infection, the impact of each virus on the other, with particular reference to clinical manifestations and the impact of antiretroviral therapy on HTLVs are described.

Summary

Important clinical effects of HTLV/HIV co-infection include the higher rates of myelopathy and other neurological disorders and the poor predicative value of CD4+ cell counts as a surrogate for immune suppression. Current antiretroviral therapies in isolation have no proven effect on HTLV-1/2 proviral load.

### How serious is the risk of HTLV-1 infection in Iranian hemodialysis-dependent patients? [^116FmN4R]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of HTLV-1 infection among the Iranian population undergoing hemodialysis was evaluated in a meta-analysis in 2015. Although it included only seven studies, the pooled prevalence of HTLV-1 infection among hemodialysis-dependent patients was similar to our results and equal to 2.9% (95% CI: 0.96–8.3). The number of studies on the seroprevalence of HTLV-1 in hemodialysis patients in other countries is low. One study conducted in Salvador, Brazil, between August and October 2011 evaluated HTLV-1 infection among 605 maintenance hemodialysis patients and confirmed the presence of the virus in 15 cases (2.48%). A multi-centric study in three cities of Chubu, Tokyo, and Okinawa, Japan, revealed a significant difference between endemic and non-endemic areas. In total, 1,132 hemodialysis patients were examined during this study, including 66 cases in endemic region of Okinawa with 14 positive HTLV-1 tests (21.2%), 220 patients in Tokyo as a non-endemic area, with six positive cases (2.7%), and 846 patients in non-endemic region of Chubu with only ten confirmed HTLV-1 infected cases (1.1%). Two studies were published on the prevalence of HTLV-1 infection among hemodialysis patients in Italy and Greece, with a total population of 138 and 370, respectively. They were unable to detect any positive cases. Our findings show intermediate levels compared to Japan and Brazil, where prevalence varies from 1.1 to 21.2% in endemic areas. This suggests a need for targeted screening in Iranian hotspots.

The seropositivity of HTLV-1 among the Iranian population varies by region. The prevalence of HTLV-1 in the general population begins at 0.07% in non-endemic areas and rises to 2.4% in Khorasan province, a historically endemic region. A meta-analysis of HTLV-1 infection among blood donors in Iran indicates that 0.2% of the total population of 3,626,364 blood donors reported in 34 studies were HTLV-1 positive. The significantly higher prevalence of HTLV-1 infection among hemodialysis-dependent patients suggests possible implications for hemodialysis as a critical route of disease transmission in individuals with kidney disease, highlighting the need for a protocol regarding screening for this virus in the hemodialysis population. Such protocols have been applied in the case of blood transfusion and yielded good results.

Useful in certain circumstances are HIV testing, Hepatitis B and C testing, Assessment of HTLV-1/2 by serology or other methods as clinically indicated, Ophthalmologic exam, Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and Discuss fertility preservation. Bone marrow aspirate notes that lymphoid aggregates are rare, and are considered involved if Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA (EBER)-1 positive; hemophagocytosis may be present. Patients with T-cell lymphomas often have extranodal disease, which may be inadequately imaged by CT, and PET scan may be preferred in these instances. EBV viral load is important in diagnosis and possibly in monitoring of disease. A positive result is consistent with NK/T-cell lymphoma. Lack of normalization of EBV viremia should be considered indirect evidence of persistent disease. It is preferred that treatment occur at centers with expertise in the management of this disease. See map for prevalence of HTLV-1/2 by geographic region, and HTLV-1/2 has been described in patients in non-endemic areas. Fertility preservation options include sperm banking, semen cryopreservation, IVF, or ovarian tissue or oocyte cryopreservation. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Molecular evidence of human T-cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) infections in HTLV seroindeterminate individuals from S ã o paulo, Brazil [^116K5PYP]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Using enzyme immunoassays and Western blot (Wb) tests, HTLV serodiagnosis yields indeterminate results in a significant number of cases.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of HTLV infection among HTLV-seroindeterminate individuals.

Study Design

We studied peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 65 anti-HTLV Wb-seroindeterminate individuals by attempting to amplify proviral DNA sequences (tax and pol) to identify HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infections.

Results

These 65 specimens exhibited predominantly (43%) anti-HTLV antibodies to gag-coded antigens in the absence of anti-p24 on Wb analysis. Tax proviral sequences were detected in 6 (9.2%) samples. According to restricted fragment polymorphism analysis (RFLP), we identified HTLV-1 proviral DNA in 4 samples, HTLV-2 in one and sequences from both in another. Nested PCR for the pol region was positive in 3 (4.6%) specimens, which were also positive for tax sequences. After hybridization HTLV-1 infection was confirmed in 2 samples (3.1%) and HTLV-2 in another (1.5%). Detection of a single HTLV DNA sequence may be due to infection by defective provirus, but its significance remains undefined. In this cohort, no Wb reactivity pattern was predictive of proviral detection. HTLV-1 infection was demonstrated in an individual who had Wb reactivity to gag-coded antigens only.

Conclusions

This emphasizes the importance of clinical and laboratory follow-up of HTLV-seroindeterminate individuals from endemic areas.

### An unusual case: adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma in pediatric patient with human T-lymphotropic virus 1 infection. clinical implications and therapeutic challenges [^113kEtwF]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs) are retroviruses classified into 2 main groups: HTLV-1 and HTLV-2; these viruses infect CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, respectively. Most patients infected with HTLV-1 remain asymptomatic; however, a small percentage develop adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Approximately 6% to 7% of male and 2% to 3% of female HTLV-1 carriers develop ATLL after a latency period of 30–50 years postinfection. ATLL is considered almost exclusively adult-onset and is extremely rare in the pediatric population.

In light of this scenario, we endeavored to conduct a systematic evaluation of the performance of commercial screening test kits for HTLV infection diagnosis. Statistical tools were used to obtain a robust assessment of the performance of each serological test by determining the following diagnostic test parameters: sensitivity (the probability of a test being positive in the presence of infection) and specificity (the probability of a test being negative in the absence of infection).

### Quantification of T cell clonality in human T cell leukaemia virus type-1 carriers can detect the development of adult T cell leukaemia early [^114GoAJw]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

OCI-flow appears to be more specific for identifying patients with 'ATL-like' clones than methods which predict ATL development by measuring CD7 downregulation, since CD7 downregulation increases with PVL, regardless of oligoclonality. Although CD7 expression analysis may replace assays of PVL in assessing ATL risk, they should not replace a direct measure of clonality, because the correlation between this method and OCI-flow is weak. OCI-flow can also predict transformation even when the absolute abundance of clones is small, whereas older techniques such as Southern blotting only detect clones of high abundance. In conclusion, OCI-flow is a practical tool to identify HTLV-1 carriers at high risk of ATL. We recommend annual OCI-flow testing in all HTLV-1 carriers with PVL ≥ 4%.

### Anti-human T-Cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibody assays in cerebrospinal fluid for the diagnosis of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis [^1152v8KS]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a human retrovirus that causes adult T-cell leukemia, HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and other related diseases. HAM/TSP is a neurological disorder characterized by spastic paraparesis and urinary dysfunction. The WHO diagnostic criteria for HAM/TSP include the unique neurological symptoms, positive anti-HTLV-1 antibody (Ab) in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and exclusion of other diseases.

A screening assay for anti-HTLV-1 Ab was established in 1983. The gelatin particle agglutination (PA) assay, which has high sensitivity and detects IgG and IgM to HTLV-1, became commercially available in 1986 (Serodia-HTLV-1; Fujirebio Inc. Tokyo, Japan). The sensitivity and specificity of PA were 100% in 200 samples verified by an HTLV-1 serum panel. Therefore, PA has primarily been used as a reliable screening test for HTLV-1. PA does not distinguish between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. The latter is suspected to cause hairy cell leukemia, and their relation to neurological disease is controversial. In Japan, HTLV-2 is not a health problem because HTLV-2 infection is extremely rare and was not detected in HAM/TSP patients. However, it is necessary to discriminate between the two types in some areas of the world where HTLV-2 infection rates are relatively high. As a confirmatory test for anti-HTLV-1/HTLV-2 Ab, Western blotting often shows the intermediate state by the WHO criteria. Therefore, efforts have been made to create a better system for diagnosing HTLV-1 infection. As an alternative confirmatory test, the line immunoassay (LIA) was developed to improve discrimination between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 in serum.

Of note, the reasons described above to explain WB-inconclusive results could also be applied to the PCR-negative results in truly HTLV-1/2-infected individuals, including the low proviral loads in HIV/AIDS patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy in G1 and, in some cases, in G2; the observation that HTLV-2 infection is known to show low proviral loads; the presence of defective provirus not detected by the primers employed in the PCR assays; and infection with other viruses, such as HTLV-3 or HTLV-4, which can be detected only by using specific primers.

It is noteworthy that since the discovery of HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 in central Africa, studies have been conducted to ascertain whether assays that are commercially available and employed for HTLV-1/2 diagnosis are able to detect these new HTLVs. The results obtained confirmed that HTLV-1/2 screening assays are sensitive for the detection of antibodies to HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 and disclosed discordant and misclassified results in relation to confirmatory serological assays (WB and LIA).

### Human T-Lymphotropic virus screening of blood donations in england between 2002 and 2021-comparison of screening strategies [^116rRFB8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Human T-lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) are closely related enveloped retroviruses. Most HTLV infections are asymptomatic, and those infected are frequently unaware of their infection. However, HTLV-1 has been linked to disease through three major pathways: inflammation, proliferation and coinfection. Most etiological studies have been conducted in endemic countries where 0.25% and 3.8% of HTLV-1 infected people will develop HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), the best-known consequence of inflammation associated with HTLV-1 infection, but noting multiple other systems are also often affected. The life-time risk of developing adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is around 2.5% to 5% (ATLL). HTLV-1 coinfection adversely impacts a range of bacterial, viral, helminthic and parasitic infections (reviewed by Rosadas and Taylor 2022).

HTLV-1 is endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions, including the Caribbean, Iran, Australia, Melanesia, South America, southern India, southern Japan, and Western Africa, with a seroprevalence often exceeding 10%. HTLV-2 is more commonly found among indigenous American populations and has also spread among people who inject drugs. In endemic countries, HTLV-1 is predominantly acquired through vertical transmission, especially via breastfeeding, or through unprotected sexual contact. Although HTLV-1 infection is considered rare in much of Europe, it is endemic in Romania. Elsewhere in Europe, most HTLV-1 infections are identified in persons migrating from endemic areas or has been acquired via their sexual partners linked to endemic areas. For example, over 80% of HTLV-positive individuals identified via blood donor or antenatal screening were from or had sexual partners from the HTLV-1 endemic areas. Furthermore, HTLV can also be transmitted through blood transfusion, organ, stem cells or bone marrow transplantation as well as cells of reproductive origin.

### Is seroprevalence of HTLV-I / II among blood donors in Lebanon relevant? [^112beApR]. American Journal of Infection Control (2004). Low credibility.

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is associated with certain hematologic and neurologic disorders. Seroprevalence studies demonstrated that the distribution of HTLV-I is heterogeneous worldwide and not specific to 1 region. Because blood is one of the major routes of transmission of the virus, blood banks of several countries routinely screen all blood donations for HTLV-I. The aim of the present study was to assess the seroprevalence rate of HTLV-I/II antibodies among Lebanese blood donors. Between August 2001 and March 2002, consecutive blood samples of 3529 blood donors were collected at blood banks of 4 major hospitals in Lebanon. Initial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening resulted in 23 (0.7%) positive samples, of which 12 (0.3%) were reconfirmed positive by ELISA. Further analysis by Western blot resulted in 2 (0.06%) positive samples, of which 1 tested positive for HTLV-I by PCR (0.028%). Although its very low prevalence among Lebanese blood donors does not support routine screening of Lebanese blood donors for HTLV-I, screening of blood donors from other nationalities may be exercised, especially those from HTLV-I endemic areas.

### Human T-Lymphotropic virus screening of blood donations in england between 2002 and 2021-comparison of screening strategies [^115MV5gG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Blood donation screening alone for HTLV will not be sufficient to address the WHO strategic targets aiming to prevent sexual, parenteral and the mother-to-child transmission of HTLV. During our 20-years of HTLV screening of blood donations we have encountered some HTLV-infected women, where potentially the opportunity to prevent the transmission of HTLV to their children was missed. Furthermore, current UK policy recommends screening umbilical cord blood donors for HTLV at the time of collection which delays the HTLV diagnoses of mothers to newborn babies by several weeks; this has resulted in 8 referrals for HTLV-1 infection where the opportunity to prevent vertical transmission of HTLV has been missed. The spread of HTLV-1 infection from mother-to-child can be prevented by advising not to breastfeed, but only if those at risk are identified by health-care workers. The importance of using every opportunity to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HTLV infection should be used, as the risk of infection being more severe is higher if the infection is acquired at young age.

This study focuses on comparing the specificity of HTLV screening assays between pooled and individual testing. Over 30 million blood donations were screened between 2002 and 2021, with a total of 282 confirmed HTLV-positive samples. These data demonstrate the high specificity of HTLV screening assays available since 2002 allaying fears of low specificity which was reported for historical assays, still inappropriately cited. Specificity for pooled testing was higher, at 99.999%, compared to 99.985% for individual testing. The non-specific reactivity rate was significantly lower in pooled compared to individual screening (1/100 000 vs 50/100 000). The confirmatory rate consequently increased from 0.9% (30/3349) with individual testing of all blood donations in a low-prevalence setting to 47.7% (197/413) with pooled screening. Despite the higher specificity of pooled testing, individual screening improved detection sensitivity, identifying two HTLV-infected donors missed by pooling. In the presence of leucodepletion, however, these would not have posed a blood safety risk.

Findings confirm that pooled testing is advantageous in low-prevalence settings due to its high specificity and reduced non-specific reactivity, making it more cost-effective. Whether pooling could also be used in resource-poor, high-prevalence countries, requires further investigations.

### HTLV-1 persistence and the oncogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma [^111diSoT]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

The ability to detect potential driver mutations before the development of ATL raises the question whether it is possible to identify HTLV-1–infected individuals at high risk of progression to malignancy, who might benefit from treatment to halt or slow the progression. The following 4 criteria of high risk can be identified in a patient who is immunocompetent,: age > 60 years, a PVL > 4% of PBMCs, mutations in known oncogenic drivers, and disproportionate proliferation of 1 clone.

A cardinal feature of HTLV-1 infection is oligoclonal proliferation of the infected cells, that is, the growth to high abundance of a small number of infected T-cell clones in the circulation. This oligoclonal proliferation, which is present in some degree in all HTLV-1–infected persons, does not necessarily presage the onset of ATL. However, early detection of exceptional clonal proliferation might allow for early intervention in the emergence of a premalignant clone to prevent or slow down the progression to frank malignancy. Early identification of people who are infected and at risk of progression requires objective quantification of the degree of oligoclonality. Rowan et al, have developed a practical assay to quantify oligoclonality in the laboratory: the oligoclonality indexmeasured via flow cytometry, based on the Gini index, quantifies the degree to which 1 or a small number of clones dominates in the population with PBMC. These authors showed that an oligoclonality index measured via flow cytometry > 0.77 was associated with a high risk of subsequent development of ATL.

Suspecting a lymphoproliferative syndrome, a skin biopsy and complementary studies were performed. Histopathology (hematoxylin and eosin) revealed a dense lymphohistiocytic infiltrate in the dermis, arranged around the dermal plexuses, infiltrating cutaneous appendages, nerve filaments, and eccrine units (Fig 2). Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, and CD43. Blood tests showed leukemoid reaction and atypical lymphocytes with cleaved nuclei in the peripheral smear.

### Confirmatory molecular method for HTLV-1 / 2 infection in high-risk pregnant women [^113A7fkX]. Journal of Medical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus types 1/2 (HTLV-1/2) are transmitted through sexual intercourse, transfusion of blood components, and vertical transmission, predominantly through breastfeeding. Six hundred forty-three pregnant women from a high-risk prenatal care unit at a general hospital were tested by serological tests using chemiluminescence (CMIA) for screening, followed by a molecular confirmatory test. Four patients (0.6%) tested positive for HTLV-1/2 by CMIA, two samples (0.3%) for each patient were confirmed as having HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 by PCR. The results show the importance of inclusion of HTLV-1/2 screening for pregnant women in high-risk prenatal care and the need for a molecular biological method to confirm HTLV-1/2 infection.

Although human T-cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV-1/2) were described over 30years ago, they are relatively unknown to the public and even to healthcare personnel. Although HTLV-1 is associated with severe illnesses, these occur in only approximately 10% of infected individuals, which may explain the lack of public knowledge about them. However, cohort studies are showing that a myriad of other disease manifestations may trouble infected individuals and cause higher expenditures with healthcare. Testing donated blood for HTLV-1/2 started soon after reliable tests were developed, but unfortunately testing is not available for women during prenatal care. Vertical transmission can occur before or after birth of the child. Before birth, it occurs transplacentally or by transfer of virus during cesarean delivery, but these routes of infection are rare. After childbirth, viral transmission occurs during breastfeeding and increases with longer breastfeeding and high maternal proviral load. Unlike the human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, HTLV is transmitted primarily through breastfeeding and not transplacentally or during delivery. In this study, we review what is currently known about HTLV maternal transmission, its prevention, and the gaps still present in the understanding of this process.

INTRODUCTION

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) is a cell-associated retrovirus, and four types have been identified to date. Type 1 (HTLV-1) is the only type that has been linked conclusively to disease. Infection with HTLV-1 is associated with the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), with the former occurring in up to 5% and the latter in up to 3% of infected individuals. HTLV-1 infection is also linked to a number of inflammatory conditions other than HAM/TSP. In contrast to HTLV-1, HTLV-2 has not been proven to cause disease. However, HTLV-2 infection has been associated with increased lymphocyte and platelet counts, an increased overall cancer mortality, sporadic reports of myelopathy, and a slightly increased risk of bacterial infections, particularly of the chest and bladder/kidney. The potential for HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 to cause disease is currently unknown.

HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are the most prevalent types, but their global distribution is unusual and their prevalence is poorly understood. The most recent estimate suggests that 5 to 10 million people worldwide are infected with HTLV-1, but the actual number of infected individuals is likely to be much higher. HTLV-1 is highly endemic in the southwestern part of Japan; parts of sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and the Caribbean; and certain foci in the Middle East and Australo-Melanesia. In comparison, HTLV-2 is prevalent in indigenous populations of Africa, native inhabitants of Central and South America, and intravenous drug users in Europe and the United States.

HTLV is transmitted through sexual intercourse, blood transfusions, organ transplantation, and needle reuse or from mother to child, predominantly during breastfeeding. HTLV has also been shown to be acquired by humans through a bite from a simian T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (STLV-1)-infected nonhuman primate. In the absence of a preventive vaccine and with limited treatment options for HTLV-related diseases, the focus is on prevention of viral transmission by diagnosing infected individuals and providing appropriate education. However, HTLV-1/2 infection remains underdiagnosed, partly because the majority of infections are asymptomatic.

### Quantification of T cell clonality in human T cell leukaemia virus type-1 carriers can detect the development of adult T cell leukaemia early [^116uVBYf]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

For both clinicians and HTLV-1 carriers, the probability of developing ATL is of frequent concern. While the often-quoted figure of 5% is useful epidemiologically, it offers little to individual patients. Quantification of proviral load can further refine this estimate of lifetime risk, which reaches 20% in high PVL patients, but a lack of further known risk factors contributes to diagnostic and prognostic uncertainty in clinicians. The data presented here suggest carriers at very high risk of ATL can be identified and potentially offered interventions whilst low risk carriers can be reassured, including those with high PVL.

This study shows that flow cytometry, which is quantitative, fast and more widely accessible than LMPCR/HTS, can be used to derive an oligoclonality score for HTLV-1-infected cells which serves as a clinically useful prognostic and diagnostic index. Patients with leukaemic ATL have high OCI-flow scores. Carriers who did not develop ATL during > 7 years' follow-up all had an OCI-flow less than 0.770, whereas those with an OCI-flow > 0.770 were over seven-fold more likely to develop the disease as compared to all carriers, and five times more likely to develop ATL than carriers with a PVL > 4%. This threshold for OCI-flow is supported by clinical and demographic differences between subjects. There are few data in patients with HTLV-1 on the impact of immunosuppressive therapy on the development of ATL. The lack of association observed in this study between high OCI-flow and immunosuppressive therapy is reassuring. Our regression model supports the use of known ATL risk factors in predicting high OCI-flow. However, these criteria alone are inadequate, because patients aged > 50 with a peripheral blood lymphocyte count < 2 × 10 9 /L do develop ATL, albeit at a lower frequency; therefore, we recommend assessment of clonality by flow cytometry for all carriers with a PVL ≥ 4%.

Peripheral T-cell lymphomas — diagnostic studies useful in certain circumstances highlight molecular and cytogenetic testing and additional characterization. Molecular analysis to detect clonal TCR gene rearrangements to provide further assessment of clonality is listed. Consider cytogenetics (fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] and karyotype) to detect DUSP22 rearrangement of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), ALK negative, and TP63 rearrangement if IHC is positive for TP63. Consider next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel to support the diagnosis of TFH subtypes. Additional immunohistochemical studies to characterize subsets of PTCL including cytotoxic granule proteins (TIA-1, granzyme B, perforin) are included. Assessment of human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1/2) serology or other methods is encouraged, as results can impact therapy.

### Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus infection in organ donors: a need to reassess policy? [^111SDzXy]. American Journal of Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV)-I/II infection has been considered a contra-indication to organ donation due to the risk of transmission of infection and the subsequent development of either adult T-cell leukemia or HTLV-I-associated myelopathy. However, neither the incidence of HTLV-I/II infection in organ donors nor the risk of transmission of HTLV-I/II by solid organ transplantation has been defined. Further, it is not known if HTLV infection contributes to significant morbidity in solid organ recipients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of HTLV-I/II infection in organ donors in USA and to determine if transplanting these organs resulted in HTLV-related morbidity or mortality. We utilized the UNOS database to: (i) identify organ donors that were positive for HTLV-I or II infection between 1988 and 2000, and (ii) evaluate outcomes in the recipients of these organs. There were 25 HTLV-I/II-positive organ donors reported to UNOS between 1988 and 2000. Based on organ donors with a known HTLV-I/II status, the prevalence of HTLV-I infection in organ donors is 0.027% and the prevalence of HTLV-II is 0.064%. Twenty-two organs were transplanted from these HTLV-positive donors. There have been no reports of HTLV-I/II-related disease in the recipients with a median follow-up of 11.9 months. At our center, over the last 1.5 years there have been four multiorgan donors with false-positive HTLV-I/II screening assays, which resulted in the decision not to use organs from these donors. Based on the minimal chance of HTLV-related disease following transplantation of HTLV-I/II organs in this series, we recommend that careful consideration be given to transplanting organs from HTLV-I/II-positive organ donors.

HTLV-1 is a significant global health problem but remains largely confined to endemic areas and risk groups. However, increasing migration may mean that the virus will be encountered more frequently in areas traditionally thought of as virtually free of HTLV-1. In this review we discuss the epidemiology, transmission, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of HTLV-1, focussing specifically on the neurological manifestations. We highlight the circumstances in which HTLV-1 should be suspected and outline the current understanding of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy and other neurological presentations.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Human Research Participants

Before April 2022, Brazil lacked widespread prenatal HTLV‐1 screening. Participants were recruited from the Institute of Infectology Emílio Ribas, which hosts the largest HTLV‐1 outpatient cohort globally, and Climerio de Oliveira Maternity Hospital, a referral center for high‐risk pregnancies in Salvador, Bahia. The latter performs approximately 1300 deliveries annually and identifies HTLV‐1 in an average of 10.8 pregnancies per year among seropositive mothers. Nine HTLV‐1‐seropositive mothers were enrolled between December 2019 and March 2024, with recruitment paused from February 2020 to February 2022 due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. A control group of nine HTLV‐1‐seronegative mothers was included, all aged18 years (range: 19–42 years), with full‐term pregnancies, negative serology for hepatitis B/C, rubella, and toxoplasmosis, and no history of smoking or prolonged membrane rupture (> 8 h).

No medical guidelines currently specify a preferred delivery mode for HTLV‐1‐seropositive mothers. Delivery mode (vaginal or cesarean) was determined through shared decision‐making between patients and clinicians. As no antivirals exist to suppress HTLV‐1 replication, none of the seropositive mothers received antiretroviral therapy. The complete clinical histories of all 18 participants, including one seropositive individual treated with methylprednisolone for HTLV‐1‐associated myelopathy (HAM), are detailed in Supporting Information S1: Table 1. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees of the Institute of Tropical Medicine/Faculty of Medicine (University of São Paulo; CAAE: 43288720.4.1001.0068), the Institute of Infectology Emilio Ribas (CAAE: 43288720.4.3003.5543), and Climerio de Oliveira Maternity Hospital (CAAE: 43288720.4.3001.0061). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^111ZwbNE]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV-2 infection — epidemiology and testing implications: Fewer than 200 cases of HIV-2 in the United States had been reported to CDC through 2009, although criteria for an HIV-2 case definition were not specified until 2014; the majority of U.S. HIV-2 diagnoses have been in persons born in Africa, especially West Africa, but 12% of HIV-2 diagnoses were made in persons whose birthplace was India, North America or Europe. It is theoretically possible that acute HIV-2 infection might produce a repeatedly reactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassay result with nonreactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay and HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT) results, and based on expert opinion and the low prevalence of HIV-2 infection in the United States, this sequence most likely indicates a false-positive initial immunoassay result; laboratories should report that such test results indicate no laboratory evidence for HIV-1 infection and suggest follow-up testing for HIV-2 if clinically indicated. Although accurate diagnosis of HIV-2 is clinically important because HIV-2 strains are naturally resistant to several antiretroviral drugs developed to suppress HIV-1, diagnosis of HIV-2 can be problematic; only two reports of acute HIV-2 infections have been published, the reliability of HIV-2 NAT during acute HIV-2 infection is unknown, and in specimens obtained 5 to 6 months after seroconversion, plasma HIV-2 viral load was 28 times lower in HIV-2 seroconverters than among comparable HIV-1 seroconverters.

### Anti-tax antibody levels in asymptomatic carriers, oligosymptomatic carriers, patients with rheumatologic disease or with HAM / TSP do not correlate with HTLV-1 proviral load [^1153u5te]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

HTLV-1 infects millions of people around the world and induces myelopathy (HAM/TSP), adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) or other inflammatory or rheumatologic diseases. The host-virus interaction causes asymptomatic carriers to develop HAM/TSP. Biomarkers are needed to predict patients who are at risk for HAM/TSP. Tax is highly immunogenic and is a major target protein recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Anti-Tax antibodies are involved in HAM/TSP pathogenesis.

Objectives

To assess anti-Tax IgG reactivity with a flow cytometry assay (FCA) using an infection/transfection system with Vaccinia virus and pLW44/Tax-expressing Tax and to correlate the anti-Tax response and the HTLV-1 proviral load.

Study Design

We enrolled 81 individuals: 9 HTLV-1 seronegative (NP) and 72 HTLV-1 positive (23 HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (AC), 12 oligosymptomatic patients (OL), 7 with rheumatologic diseases (DR) and 30 with HAM/TSP (HT)). Anti-Tax reactivity was assessed by FCA, and HTLV-1 proviral load was measured with real time PCR.

Results

The HT and DR groups showed greater anti-Tax IgG reactivity (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 comparing HT to the OL and AC group, respectively; p < 0.05 comparing DR to the OL group), and the reactivity in the DR+HT group was significantly different when compared to the AC group (p < 0.05) and to the OL group (p < 0.001). The proviral load was higher in the HT group compared to the OL (p < 0.001) and in the HT+DR group compared to OL (p < 0.001). There was no correlation between anti-Tax IgG reactivity and proviral load in any of the HTLV-1-infected groups.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that although anti-Tax IgG reactivity and the HTLV-1 proviral load are important markers of the development of HTLV-1-associated diseases, their levels are not correlated.

Methods

Subjects and sites

We screened MHD patients enrolled in the Prospective Study of the Prognosis of Chronic Hemodialysis Patients (PROHEMO) cohort. The current phase of the PROHEMO study cohort began in 2010; it includes MHD patients from four (out of a total of twelve) outpatient dialysis units in the city of Salvador, the capital of Bahia, located in the northeast region of Brazil. We do not have an epidemiologic profile of the remaining eight clinics, but we believe the four clinics studied to be representative of all clinics in Salvador. We included all adult (18 or older) members of the PROHEMO cohort who were alive and undergoing MHD at the time of the collection of blood samples for HTLV-1 serology screening (between August and October 2011). At this time, the cohort contained 695 patients; we excluded 90 patients due to lack of essential clinical data. Therefore, our analyses were conducted on 605 patients, corresponding to 87% (605/695) of the entire cohort.

Design

Cross-sectional study nested in a prospective cohort study of MHD patients. Information on socio-demographic, laboratorial and clinical variables ware obtained directly from the PROHEMO database, which contains data prospectively collected from patients and medical records. Information on HTLV-1 status was obtained by screening stored blood samples. Between August and October 2011, at the time of blood collection for monthly dialysis labs, additional 10 mL samples of blood were drawn and stored at −20 °C for future analyses. These samples were screened for antibodies against HTLV 1/2, using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) - Gold ELISA HTLV-1/2 (REM Indústria e Comércio LTDA) and the positive cases were confirmed by a Western Blot (WB) immunoassay (HTLV Blot 2.4, MP Biomedicals Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. Singapore).

The economic class of the patients (A, B, C, D and E) was determined using the classification system of the Brazilian Institute of Market Research (Abipeme) that considers consumer goods, such as refrigerators, televisions and telephones. Patients in classes D and E were categorized as poor or very poor.

A variable "history of blood transfusion" was available in the dataset. Participants of the cohort were asked the following question "Did you receive blood transfusion over the past three months?" There were no data on transfusions past this period or on the number of units transfused.

### HTLV-1 persistence and the oncogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma [^113EhjBB]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Implications for clinical management of ATL

If the main mechanism of oncogenesis in ATL is persistent mitotic replicative error in the long-lived HTLV-1–infected T-cell clones, what are the implications for clinical management? Current guidance on therapeutic options for the different forms of ATL has been recently reviewed; here, I consider the underlying principles. These principles are not fundamentally different from those in other malignancies; what is unusual in ATL is that the premalignant clone can, in some cases, be identified at an early stage in the oncogenic process, making possible an understanding of the order and the trajectory of the successive steps in oncogenesis, and raising the possibility of early detection and intervention in individuals at high risk.

Perhaps the chief reason for the refractoriness to treatment of ATL is the huge diversity of HTLV-1–infected clones in each person. If 1 clone has undergone transformation to ATL, it is likely that other clones in that individual have acquired driver mutations. There is evidence for this in the well-documented phenomenon of clonal succession.

As in other malignancies, an important therapeutic principle is to target more than 1 pathway that confers a proliferative or survival advantage to the clone, in order to minimize the rate of emergence of resistance mutations. The AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway plays an important part in ATL cell survival and proliferation. Daenthanasanmak et alshowed that simultaneous treatment with 3 agents, which respectively inhibit BET (bromodomain and extraterminal motif protein), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and NF-κB, strongly inhibited the growth of ATL cells both in vitro and in xenografts of ATL cells in mice, reducing c-myc expression and increasing apoptosis. Similarly, inhibition by valemetostat of both enhancers of zeste homolog 1 and 2, central enzymes in the polycomb transcriptional complexes, has theoretical potential as a new therapeutic agent in ATL.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^1129Y8sr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) laboratory diagnosis — specimens, assays, and interpretation — is summarized as follows: Serology for HTLV-1/2 antibody can be performed on cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, or serum with transport conditions of sterile, preservative-free tube, RT, ≤ 24 h; EDTA tube, RT, ≤ 2 h; PPT tube, RT, ≤ 6 h; or clot or SST tube, RT, ≤ 2 h. For nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), HTLV-1 proviral DNA (qualitative or quantitative) uses whole blood with EDTA or citrate tube, RT, ≤ 2 h. Due to the potential for false positive results in initial tests, supplemental serologic assays are used to confirm initial reactive results and to differentiate between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 antibodies. Current World Health Organization diagnostic guidelines for HAM/TSP include laboratory detection of HTLV-1 antibodies or antigens in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid as a criterion for diagnosis. HTLV-1 RNA is present at very low levels (< 100 copies/mL) in plasma, precluding it as a useful marker for disease progression, whereas HTLV-1 proviral DNA can be detected and quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Although high proviral loads (eg, > 5000 copies/10^6 PBMC) are associated with a higher risk of disease progression, there is no current consensus on a proviral load threshold to predict disease outcome or guide patient management, and available qualitative HTLV-1 proviral DNA tests are non-standardized laboratory-developed assays performed on whole blood at reference or research laboratories.

### Editorial commentary: human T-Cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis [^1158oriE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The risk of HAM/TSP has been strongly associated with proviral load and, in particular, with a cutoff of 1 HTLV-1 DNA copy per 100 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (a proviral load of 1%). The Miyazaki Cohort Study followed almost 2000 persons, among whom 27% were HTLV-1 infected, in a decade-long study and reported paraesthesia, polyuria, and nocturia to be twice as common among those infected with HTLV-1. However, finding no association with HTLV-1 proviral load or strength of antibody response, they concluded that HTLV-1 per se was not causatively associated. Similarly, Tanajura et al found no association with the frequency of sensory, bladder, or even motor symptoms and HTLV-1 proviral load even though up to 30% of the study participants developed such symptoms during follow-up. They did find, however, that carriers with HTLV-1 proviral loads of > 5% were more likely to have demonstrated deterioration in expanded disability status score. Also at baseline, subjects diagnosed with HAM/TSP had higher median HTLV-1 proviral load (14.8%) than those who were initially asymptomatic (2.5%), with the probable/possible HAM/TSP subset intermediate at 4%. It seems, therefore, that the proviral load in this cohort may be higher than in other cohorts that cite a median of 1% for asymptomatic carriers. Even so, this does not fully account for the exceptionally high prevalence and incidence of definite HAM/TSP as assuming a lifetime risk of HAM/TSP of up to 3%, even subjects with proviral loads > 1% have only a 6% lifetime risk.

Conclusions

The term ATLL is misleading, as it can also occur in children, as demonstrated in this case. ATLL is an aggressive T-cell neoplasm caused by chronic HTLV-1 infection. It is challenging to diagnose, has a poor prognosis, and represents a public health issue in HTLV-1 endemic regions of Latin America. Education about transmission pathways, early serological detection, elective cesarean sections, and breastfeeding suppression in seropositive women are key measures to mitigate the impact of this disease.

### Chronic progressive cervical myelopathy with HTLV-I infection: variant form of HAM / TSP? [^113VCNgR]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the role of human T-lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection in four patients who developed slowly progressive myelopathy with abnormal MRI lesions in the cervical cord levels.

Methods

Clinical and neuroradiologic examinations were performed, and the odds that an HTLV-I-infected individual of specified genotype, age, and provirus load had HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM)/tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) were calculated.

Results

Anti-HTLV-I antibodies were positive in both the serum and the CSF in all of the patients. Biopsied sample from spinal cord lesions showed inflammatory changes in Patient 1. Patient 2 had a demyelinating type of sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Two of the three patients examined showed high risk of developing HAM/TSP in virologic and immunologic aspects.

Conclusion

These four cases may belong to a variant form of HAM/TSP, predominantly involving the cervical cord levels.

### Human T-Lymphotropic virus screening of blood donations in england between 2002 and 2021-comparison of screening strategies [^111VAp9C]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

HTLV has been recently recognised as a neglected infection of global concern where HTLV testing will play a vital role in reaching the strategic targets set by the World Health Organization (WHO). For these reasons, it is important to consider what can be learnt from the experience acquired via the universal blood donation screening for anti-HTLV antibodies introduced in the United Kingdom over 20 years ago. Donations were initially screened in pools (2002–2012) or individually (2013–2016), whereas a change from universal screening to selective testing of donations from first-time donors and without leucodepletion was implemented in 2017. During the first 20-years of screening, over 30 million blood donations have been successfully tested with the Abbott Murex or Prism HTLV-1/HTLV-2 chemiluminescent immunoassay which has demonstrated remarkable overall assay specificity of 99.985%. This is comparable, if not better, than previously evaluated assays used for serological screening of blood donations and exceeds the general recommendations applied for antenatal screening.

We have compared data acquired with the different strategies used for HTLV screening of blood donations at presidential scale. Firstly, the excellent specificity of 99.952% based on 6 908 058 donations individually tested and its further increase to 99.999% with the pooled screening of 22 511 003 donations is noteworthy. This represents over a 50-fold reduction in non-specific reactivity with pooling compared with individual sample testing; an issue not previously widely discussed. These data allay concerns that screening results in large numbers of samples with non-specific reactivity thus placing an excessive demand on laboratory services to provide the confirmatory tests. Second, the benefit of the reduced demand for confirmatory testing with the pooled testing strategy, easily outweighs the complexity of pooling at least in low HTLV endemicity areas such as the United Kingdom. Over the 20-year study period, only 5032 repeat reactive donations required confirmatory HTLV testing with 278 (5.5%) confirmed positive. However, < 10% of these repeat reactive samples originated from pooled screening (n = 413) and the proportion of these confirmed as HTLV-positive was 27-fold higher with the pooled testing compared to individual screening (47.7% 197/413% vs 1.8%; 81/4619).

### Editorial commentary: human T-Cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis [^117SSXsd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Because only 59% of the cohort was identified through screening, with 32% self-referred and the remainder identified by the neurology service or by having HTLV-1 in the family, further breakdown of the data from the blood donors only would be more comparable with other studies and potentially contribute to understanding the role, if any, of selection bias. In particular, the high rate of sensory symptoms of the upper limbs are difficult to explain from previous reports of HAM/TSP and raise various possibilities, including overreporting by study participants and the presence of additional factors or alternative etiologies.

It is difficult to comment on the contribution of environment (clinic and community), but there is now an urgent need to test these findings in a new study with HTLV-1–uninfected matched controls. If confirmed, at least in some infected communities, the disease burden of HTLV-1 is considerably higher than previously reported, and this should stimulate broader and more effective prevention programs and greater interest and financial support for research into the treatment of HAM/TSP.

### Human T-Lymphotropic virus screening of blood donations in england between 2002 and 2021-comparison of screening strategies [^116tXFEu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

HTLV infection is usually diagnosed through the detection of HTLV-specific antibodies. HTLV-1 testing was introduced into clinical practice in the United Kingdom in 1986, whereas routine blood donation testing for HTLV antibodies began in 2002. Despite that, most HTLV infections remain undiagnosed in the United Kingdom. This is based on a previous estimate that up to 30 000 people are living with HTLV in the United Kingdom but < 100 HTLV diagnoses are made each year in the United Kingdom. Although the sensitivity of serological HTLV assays approaches 100%, the reported specificity of antibody assays remains just below 100%. This can be problematic in a low-prevalence population such as the United Kingdom, and for these reasons, it is important to apply more than 1 assay to confirm HTLV-1 (and HTLV-2) positivity. In UK practice, HTLV diagnosis is usually confirmed using 2 different immunoassays, followed by a western blot and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect proviral DNA in a cellular sample.

This article focuses on HTLV screening of blood donations by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) in the England, implemented in 2002. Initially screening was performed on pooled plasma samples from 48 donations prepared for viral molecular screening. In 2009, plasma pool size utilised for HTLV screening was reduced to 24 donations to reflect a change in the molecular screening system requiring smaller pool size than previously used. In 2013, HTLV screening moved from pooled to individual testing utilizing fully automated serological platforms for the first time. The HTLV screening strategy was reviewed two years later. An extremely low HTLV seroprevalence, rarity of seroconversions and lack of documented transfusion transmitted HTLV infection via leucodepleted components in the England prompted a change from universal screening to testing donations from first-time donors and donations made into components that could not be leucodepleted only from 2017.

Here we determine the specificity of the algorithms used for anti-HTLV antibody screening of blood donations in the England between 2002 and 2021. We also review the epidemiology of the blood donors confirmed to be HTLV-positive and report the likely sources of HTLV infection in a low-endemic country.

### Editorial commentary: human T-Cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis [^115iWYBE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is an oncogenic retrovirus that is transmitted from mother to child, particularly through prolonged breastfeeding; between sexual partners through unprotected intercourse; and from donors to recipients through transfusion and transplantation. Thirty-five years after its discovery, screening for HTLV-1 infection is at best patchy and mostly nonexistent. There are 2 main reasons for this: first, the most recent estimate of the prevalence of HTLV-1 is 5–10 million persons worldwide, with the important caveat that 86% of the global population is data poor in this regard; second, there is a perception that disease related to this virus, which has coexisted with humankind for 60 000 years, is uncommon. Whether this reputation is justified requires up-to-date and reliable sero- and clinical epidemiology.

The lifetime risk, among carriers, of adult-T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is 2%–6% regardless of the region of study. However, for HTLV-1–associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), more varied risks are reported with strong hints that, apart from the route of infection, ethnicity and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types impact significantly on risk. Furthermore, HTLV-1 has been associated with a range of other inflammatory manifestations affecting many organs but particularly eyes, lungs, and thyroid and with increased susceptibility to a number of infections, most notably Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfestation syndrome. (Given the high mortality of this latter condition, it is our policy to screen all HTLV-1 carriers who have resided in endemic areas for S. stercoralis). These diseases are much less well recognized even than HAM/TSP, with no data on incidence or prevalence among carriers. How, then, are we to judge the global disease burden of HTLV-1 infection?

### Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 infection and solid organ transplantation [^116Rpdzs]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

HTLV infection appears to be more common among renal transplant candidates than in the related general population. HTLV-1-associated diseases may occur in carriers who are transplanted but there is insufficient evidence to confirm whether these occur more frequently as a result of the associated immunosuppression. Consequently, pre-existing HTLV-1 infection should not be considered a contra-indication to transplantation. The risk of transmission of HTLV-1 through solid organ transplantation from a confirmed infected donor is unknown. There are anecdotes of multiple infections from a single donor. Biologically due to the significant volume of blood and the lack of storage, transmission would be expected to be higher than following blood transfusion. The rate of subsequent disease is unknown, but there are now 11 reports of HAM and 2 of ATL occurring within 4 years of transplantation associated infection. There are insufficient data to know whether the time from infection to onset of disease and the rate of progression differ from transmission through other routes, but early onset and rapid progression is a concern. Responses to enhanced immunosuppression for the treatment of HAM are variable. The risk of HTLV-1 associated disease in exchange for a life-saving major organ transplantation from an infected donor might be considered worth taking by some HTLV-1 uninfected patients. Peri-transplantation antiretroviral prophylaxis with zidovudine and raltegravir is biologically sound but therapeutically unproven. The risks related to HTLV-1 infection appear to preclude the use of any other tissue. All transplant donors should be screened for HTLV-1 infection regardless of perceived risk.

### Human T-Lymphotropic virus screening of blood donations in england between 2002 and 2021-comparison of screening strategies [^111qHyMV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the confirmatory tests are important to determine true HTLV infection, categorizing signal to cut-off (S/CO) ratios obtained from immunoassays can be used to quickly assess the likelihood of true HTLV-1 infection. Although we were not able to review the S/CO ratios for our confirmed HTLV-1 positive or negative blood donors, a previous study undertaken by a national HTLV reference laboratory with Abbott Architect HTLV assay showed that when the S/CO ratio was below 4.0 the likelihood that HTLV infection will be confirmed, in the United Kingdom, is low, whereas a ratio higher than 20 is highly predictive of true infection. These data have since been confirmed by another UK study, the aim being to reduce the number of non-specific reactive samples that required confirmatory testing and to utilise organs from such donors faster for transplantion providing the appropriate risk assessment has been completed. Furthermore, alternative and simplified strategies for confirmatory testing for blood donors have also been recently suggested.

The value of pooled testing, and its potential effect on assay sensitivity has been debated for several years. It has not been previously recommended for serological screening of blood donations, whereas it is a generally accepted strategy for molecular-based screening of blood donations and was also successfully pursued to increase testing capacity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2(RNA in the early stages of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Pooling of samples for testing has been recognised as a cost-saving measure, but any cost savings have to be balanced against the risk of failing to detect a positive donation due to sensitivity being compromised in diluted sample. Although not systemically investigated in this study, we are aware of 2 blood donors whose HTLV-infection was noted only after the individual screening was implemented. Further arguments against pooling of samples for serology testing include the potential risk of sample handling errors during the pooling, or when resolving individual samples in each pool, and time taken to complete testing. However, these issues are resolvable via automation as shown with molecular screening of blood donors still applied widely. The counter argument of better specificity seen with pooling has not been previously discussed.

### Human T-cell lymphotropic virus antibody prevalence in HIV-1-infected individuals attending a sexual health clinic in south-east london [^111jEpwe]. Journal of Medical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) are both retroviruses with similar routes of transmission. A number of reports suggest variable clinical outcomes in HIV and HTLV co-infected individuals. There is no published information regarding the prevalence of HIV and HTLV co-infection in the UK. We therefore carried out an unlinked anonymised retrospective study to investigate the prevalence of HTLV co-infection in HIV infected patients attending a sexual health clinic in South-East London. We identified sera from 777 HIV-1 positive adults (504 male, 273 female) who had attended our sexual health clinic between January 2000 and March 2001. Serum samples stored at -20 degrees C were initially tested by HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 antibody enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA). An immunoblot assay was carried out on reactive samples to discriminate between viral subtypes. Samples with indeterminate results were also analyzed by Western blot. The prevalence of HTLV antibody was 0.8% (five patients with HTLV-1 and one with HTLV-2). Four of the HTLV-1 co-infected patients were females born abroad, of Black African or Caribbean origin. The other HTLV-1-infected patient was a male in the Black Other ethnic group born in the UK, demonstrating that transmission may occur outside recognized areas of high endemicity. The HTLV-2 co-infected individual was a White male born in Italy, and was likely to have been infected through intravenous drug use. The results suggest HTLV antibody screening should be considered in the local HIV infected population of south London.

### HTLV-1 persistence and the oncogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma [^117VGLS7]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), also known as human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, causes the aggressive malignancy known as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) in 5% of infected people and a chronic progressive inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, HTLV-1-associated myelopathy, in ∼0.3% to 4% of them, varying between regions where it is endemic. Reliable treatments are lacking for both conditions, although there have been promising recent advances in the prevention and treatment of ATL. Because ATL typically develops after several decades of infection, it is necessary to understand how the virus persists in the host despite a strong immune response, and how this persistence results in oncogenesis.

### Respiratory and urinary tract infections, arthritis, and asthma associated with HTLV-I and HTLV-II infection [^113fERSW]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Participants

This study is a prospective, multicenter cohort of persons with HTLV-I and -II infections, which were detected at the time of attempted blood donation at five U.S. blood centers and comparable HTLV–seronegative donors. Details of the cohort enrollment and follow-up procedures have been published previously. The study protocol was approved by the USCG committe on Human Research and by IRBs at other participating institituions

We determined HTLV serostatus by obtaining enzyme immunoassay test results followed by confirmatory Western blot. A central laboratory performed HTLV-I versus -II typing with a type-specific serologic assay, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or both, as previously described. Unequivocal results from the type-specific serologic assay correlated well with those from the polymerase chain reaction assay. All participants were seronegative for HIV when baseline test were performed. For most participants, hepatitis C virus antibody status was not available at the time of enrollment.

Disease Endpoints

Each visit with a study nurse consisted of an interviewer-administered health history questionnaire and phlebotomy of blood for complete blood count and other studies. Selected diagnoses (cancer, neurologic and autoimmune conditions) reported on the questionnaire triggered requests for confirmatory medical records. We included nine conditions or diseases (pneumonia, acute bronchitis, bladder or kidney infection, arthritis, hypertension, asthma, cancer, diabetes, and thyroid disease) and eight symptoms (trouble walking, climbing, or rising from chair; incontinence; pre- or post-void urgency; lymphadenopathy; night sweats; weight loss; foot paresthesias; and impotence [males]) in the data analysis.

### Analysis of HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) and antibody detected with various kinds of tests in Japanese blood donors to understand the relationship between PVL and antibody level and to gain insights toward better antibody testing [^115eX5GS]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) occurs in approximately 5% of individuals infected with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). A high proviral load (PVL; more than four copies per 100 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or 1.6 copies per 100 blood leukocytes) and being male are risk factors for ATL development. Whether anti-HTLV-1 antibody level is related to such risk is unknown. Here, PVL and antibody levels were examined using real-time PCR and other tests in 600 HTLV-1 positive screened Japanese blood donors to understand the relationship between PVL and antibody level in asymptomatic carriers and to gain insights toward better antibody testing for HTLV-1 infection. The 430 donors in whom proviral DNA was detected were considered as true positives for HTLV-1 infection. Among donors aged 40 years or older, more males than females had a PVL corresponding to more than 1.6% infected leukocytes, and an antibody titer below the median (P = 0.0018). In antibody tests using an HTLV-1 positive cell line or Env antigens there was a large discrepancy in antibody titer among 13 provirus-positive samples, probably suggesting that antibody-based screening tests should incorporate multiple HTLV-1 antigens, such as Gag and Env antigens.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) tissue and serologic diagnostics — when noninvasive testing is inconclusive, brain biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, and PML can usually be identified by characteristic tissue cytopathology with identification of JCV or cross reacting polyoma virus by immunohistochemistry, in situ nucleic acid hybridization, or electron microscopy. Serologic testing is generally not useful because of high anti-JCV seroprevalence in the general population, although antibody testing has been assessed for stratifying risk of PML with natalizumab treatment, and significant increases in JC virus specific antibody titers and detection of intrathecally produced anti-JCV antibodies may prove useful for diagnostic testing but require further prospective study.

### Human T-lymphotropic virus 1: recent knowledge about an ancient infection [^115sNb7C]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) has infected human beings for thousands of years, but knowledge about the infection and its pathogenesis is only recently emerging. The virus can be transmitted from mother to child, through sexual contact, and through contaminated blood products. There are areas in Japan, sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and South America where more than 1% of the general population is infected. Although the majority of HTLV-1 carriers remain asymptomatic, the virus is associated with severe diseases that can be subdivided into three categories: neoplastic diseases (adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma), inflammatory syndromes (HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and uveitis among others), and opportunistic infections (including Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection and others). The understanding of the interaction between virus and host response has improved markedly, but there are still no clear surrogate markers for prognosis and there are few treatment options.

### Mechanisms of HTLV-1 persistence and transformation [^116gaH5U]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) belongs to the Deltaretrovirus genera of the Orthoretrovirinae subfamily. HTLV-1 is the first discovered human retrovirus, isolated in the early 1980s from peripheral blood samples of a patient with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Even if the exact number of sero-positive individuals is not known, an estimated 20 million people would be infected with HTLV-1 worldwide. HTLV-1 is endemic in the Caribbean, Southern Japan, Africa, South America and Pacific islands. HTLV-1 is also present in Europe and North America where infection is epidemic. HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of an aggressive leukaemia, called adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL) as well as inflammatory disorders including tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM), arthritis, uveitis, dermatitis, lymphadenitis and Sjögren's syndrome. In addition to HTLV-1, other members of the Deltatretovirus genus are HTLV-2, -3 and -4 as well as bovine leukaemia virus (BLV). HTLV-2 was identified in cell lines derived from a patient with atypical hairy cell leukaemia although further studies failed to confirm the association of HTLV-2 with lymphoproliferative diseases. HTLV-3 and -4 subtypes have recently been identified in bushmeat hunters in Central Africa; infection by these two viruses being presently not associated to any pathology. BLV is the causative agent of a B-cell neoplastic disease in cattle (reviewed by).

Most HTLV-1 carriers remain infected lifelong without developing any major clinical manifestation. After several decades, only a small proportion (2.1% for females and 6.6% for males) of HTLV-1-infected subjects will progress to ATL. The term ATL includes a spectrum of diseases that are referred to as smoldering, chronic, lymphoma and acute. ATL patients have atypical lymphoid cells with multilobulated nuclei (so-called flower cells) in their peripheral blood. ATL cells are consistently monoclonal with respect to proviral integration and originate from initial polyclonal/oligoclonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells. Leukaemia may progress from a smouldering phase to chronic and acute clinical manifestations. Acute and lymphoma subtypes show aggressive and rapidly fatal clinical courses with a median survival time of about 1 year. Although tumour cells are sensitive to conventional chemotherapy, patients rapidly relapse and become resistant to further treatment. Chronic and smouldering stages have a more indolent course and do not require chemotherapy.

### Self-flagellation as possible route of human T-Cell lymphotropic virus type 1 transmission [^113sRahK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: Blood donors in Australia who test positive for transfusion-transmissible infections, including human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus, and HIV, undergo posttest counseling, as previously described. Similar to Tang et al. we identified self-flagellation as a possible unique risk factor for HTLV-1 infection. History of self-flagellation was elicited in 7 (28%) of 25 HTLV-1–positive donors identified during January 2012–December 2018. All 7 donors were men 20–37 years of age, of whom 5 were born in Pakistan and 2 in India; 6 had given blood in Victoria, Australia. The 18 remaining HTLV-1–positive donors were 29–68 years of age; 10 (56%) were men; 1 was born in India and none in Pakistan; and 7 (39%) gave blood in Victoria.

HBV shares transmission routes with HTLV-1 and is highly infectious, including through minor blood exposures. After discussion of recognized infective risk factors, the 610 HBV-positive donors from the same period, of whom 83 were born in India or Pakistan, were asked about any other potential blood exposures. None reported self-flagellation.

At the time of posttest counseling, no previous HTLV results were available for donors reporting self-flagellation or for their family members. Until the known modes of vertical and sexual transmission have been excluded by such results, the likelihood of self-flagellation as an infective risk factor remains unclear. Although India and Pakistan are not known to be geographic risk areas for HTLV-1, few prevalence studies are available, and HTLV-1 is commonly present in small geographic foci. In addition, a noticeable degree of transmission through communal self-flagellation would first require a raised prevalence of infection among the practicing group. We look forward to further research that may clarify the apparent link between self-flagellation and HTLV-1 infection.

### Norwegian scabies in Peru: the impact of human T cell lymphotropic virus type I infection [^113hkx5e]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2005). Low credibility.

Isolates cases and groups of patients co-infected with human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and Norwegian scabies have been previously reported. Peru is considered to be endemic for HTLV-I. Between June 1999 and December 2000, 23 patients with Norwegian scabies were enrolled in this study after written informed consent was obtained. Antibodies against HTLV-I were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmatory Western blot. Patients ranged in age from 3 months to 84 years; 15 (65.2%) were female. Infection with HTLV-I was found in 16 (69.6%) patients. Comorbid features included corticosteroid therapy (8.6%), malnutrition (8.6%), and Down's syndrome (4.3%). Among those who consented to be tested for human immunodeficiency virus (n = 13, 56.5%), no one had a positive result. The three patients that reported one or more prior episodes of Norwegian scabies were infected with HTLV-I and two of these HTLV-I-positive patients died. Infection with HTLV-I is an important co-factor related to Norwegian scabies in Peru. In our setting, the evaluation for HTLV-I in all Norwegian scabies cases is highly recommended, especially when no other risk factors are apparent.

### Early identification of seronegative human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection with severe presentation [^111WoqyL]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

Specific antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), usually used for diagnosis, almost invariably become detectable within 3 months of exposure. We report on a patient whose HIV infection was identified early by a combined antigen/antibody test, but seroconversion did not occur for 7 months, until the implementation of antiretroviral therapy.

### Neither molecular diversity of the envelope, immunosuppression status, nor proviral load causes indeterminate HTLV Western blot profiles in samples from human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 2 (HTLV-2)-infected individuals [^1129wjLR]. Journal of Medical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Although human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 2 (HTLV-2) is considered of low pathogenicity, serological diagnosis is important for counseling and monitoring. The confirmatory tests most used are Western blot (WB) and PCR. However, in high-risk populations, about 50% of the indeterminate WB were HTLV-2 positives by PCR. The insensitivity of the WB might be due to the use of recombinant proteins of strains that do not circulate in our country. Another possibility may be a high level of immunosuppression, which could lead to low production of virus, resulting in low stimulation of antibody. We found one mutation, proline to serine in the envelope region in the position 184, presented at least 1/3 of the samples, independent the indeterminate WB profile. In conclusion, we found no correlation of immune state, HTLV-2 proviral load, or env diversity in the K55 region and WB indeterminate results. We believe that the only WB kit available in the market is probably more accurate to detect HTLV-1 antibodies, and some improvement for HTLV-2 detection should be done in the future, especially among high-risk population.

### The host genomic environment of the provirus determines the abundance of HTLV-1-infected T-cell clones [^1161hFMW]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL), HTLV-1–associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), uveitis, and infective dermatitis. It is estimated that 15 to 20 million persons live with HTLV-1 infection worldwide. A small proportion (up to 7%, depending on the area) of HTLV-1–infected persons develop disease, whereas the majority remain asymptomatic carriers (ACs). Infection occurs via breastfeeding, transfusion of infected cellular blood products, or sexual intercourse. Symptoms appear after a long period (years or decades) of clinical latency. The HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) remains stable within each infected person and correlates with the outcome of infection. However, the PVL varies widely among infected people, even within a particular diagnostic group. – The sequence of HTLV-1 is also stable within a person, indicating that the PVL is maintained in vivo mainly by mitosis of infected cells during the chronic phase of the infection. This interpretation is supported by the observation that individual clones of infected cells can persist in patients for several years. – Thus, it has been hypothesized that infectious transmission of HTLV-1 is important early in infection across the virologic synapse, whereas mitotic replication is responsible for maintaining proviral load once a persistent infection has been established and reached an equilibrium with the immune response. In approximately 5% of infected people, persistent clonal proliferation culminates in malignant transformation in the disease ATLL. The leukemic clones carry generally one (complete or defective) provirus per cell. –

### The slowdown of new infections by human retroviruses has reached a plateau in Spain [^113vxk62]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2022 annual meeting of the HTLV & HIV-2 Spanish Network was held in Madrid on December 14. We summarize here the main information presented and discussed at the workshop and review time trends for human retroviral infections in Spain. As transmissible agents, infections by human retroviruses are of obligatory declaration. Until the end of 2022, the Spanish national registry had recorded 451 cases of HTLV-1, 821 of HTLV-2, and 416 of HIV-2. For HIV-1, estimates are of 150000 people currently living with HIV-1 and 60000 cumulative deaths due to AIDS. During year 2022, new diagnoses in Spain were of 22 for HTLV-1, 6 for HTLV-2, and 7 for HIV-2. The last updated figures for HIV-1 are from 2021 and counted 2786 new diagnoses. The slowdown in yearly infections for HIV-1 in Spain points out that new strategies are needed to achieve the United Nations 95–95–95 targets by 2025. For the remaining neglected human retroviral infections, their control might be pushed throughout four interventions: (1) expanding testing; (2) improving education and interventions aimed to reduce risk behaviors; (3) facilitating access to antiretrovirals as treatment and prevention, including further development of long-acting formulations; and (4) increasing vaccine research efforts. Spain is a 47 million population country in South Europe with strong migration flows from HTLV-1 endemic regions in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. At this time universal HTLV screening has been implemented only in the transplantation setting, following the report of 5 cases of HTLV-associated myelopathy shortly after transplantation of organs from HTLV-1 positive donors. There are four target populations for expanding testing and unveiling asymptomatic carriers responsible for silent HTLV-1 transmissions: (1) migrants; (2) individuals with sexually transmitted infections; (3) pregnant women; and (4) blood donors.

Most positive donors were infected with HTLV-1 (247/274, 90%), were female (195/274, 71%), UK-born (138/274, 51%) and with a mean age of 43 years (range: 17–70 years). Almost all confirmed HTLV-positives were first-time and previously HTLV-untested donors (262/274). New diagnosis of HTLV infection was documented in 11 repeat donors: a seroconversion within a year from the previous donation was confirmed for 5, seroconversion within 2–3 years of previous donation for 2, and seroconversion over 3 years ago for 2 donors. Two donors with HTLV-1 had no evidence of a previous negative result and were identified following the introduction of individual sample testing in 2013. Interestingly, they both had tested negative in pooled screening, but their archive samples were found to be seropositive in retrospective individual testing confirming their infection at the time of the previous donations. Thus, there were 9 incident HTLV infection identified over 20 years of testing. Where the probable source of infection was reported, 58% (138/237) HTLV infections were associated with endemic countries (including the Caribbean region, West Africa, Iran, India, and Japan) and were likely acquired through breast feeding or heterosexual intercourse. In 6 blood donors, epidemiological investigation concluded that infection had probably occurred through self-flagellation (first 3 cases are described here;). Furthermore, all 9 donors with incident infections were born or had lived in the United Kingdom since childhood, and most likely acquired their infection via heterosexual partner in the United Kingdom.

### HTLV-1 persistence and the oncogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma [^114mG33x]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

The strongest correlate of the risk of both HTLV-1–associated myelopathyand ATLis the PVL, that is, the percentage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with the virus. The PVL is usually higher than that seen in HIV-1 infection, and often exceeds 5% of PBMCs. The PVL is stable in each host within a factor of approximately fivefold but differs between individuals by more than 1000-fold. The PVL is proportional to the total number of HTLV-1 + T-cell clones in the individual, which typically lies between 10 3 and 10 5 but can exceed 10 6. Each clone carries a single copy of the HTLV-1 provirus integrated in a unique position in the host cell genome.HTLV-1 replication does not kill the host T cell, and many infected clones can be repeatedly detected for at least 10 years. It is likely that most of them survive for the remaining lifetime of the host. This clonal longevity is key to understanding the oncogenesis of ATL.

### Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of mogamulizumab with open-label extension study in a minimum number of patients with human T-cell leukemia virus type-1-associated myelopathy [^114LjrKk]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients

Eligible patients were ≥ 20 years old and had been diagnosed with HAM/TSP in accordance with the diagnostic criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) with a positive test result for anti-HTLV-1 antibodies in serum and CSF and with exclusion of other diseases by spinal magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were required to have a ≥ 1-year history of HAM/TSP and ongoing medication for HAM/TSP with no changes for 3 months before enrollment or an inadequate response or intolerance to prior medication. Patients on maintenance corticosteroid therapy must have been receiving ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisolone equivalent continuously for at least 3 months before enrollment. Patients must not have experienced a change in the degree of motor dysfunction by OMDS for at least 3 months before the date of screening as judged by the investigators or subinvestigators, and were required to have an OMDS of ≥ 3 and the ability to walk ≥ 10 m at screening (use of a single- or double canes was allowed).

Patients were excluded from the study if they had notable concomitant diseases. Patients with a positive viral infection test result for hepatitis B (HB) and C, and human immunodeficiency virus at screening, were excluded, with the exception of patients who had a negative result for HB surface antigen with a positive result for HB core antigen antibody and/or HB surface antigen antibody, with a subsequently measured HB virus DNA level below the limit of detection (HB virus DNA levels were measured every 4 weeks). The following patients were also excluded: those with a concurrent spinal cord compression lesion (e.g. cervical spine disease, disc herniation, or ossification of the ligamentum flavum), with the exception of conditions that did not affect the efficacy evaluation in the study as judged by the investigator or subinvestigator.

### Seroprevalence of human T-Cell lymphotropic virus-1 in a Jamaican antenatal population and assessment of pooled testing as a cost reduction strategy for implementation of routine antenatal screening [^111iYka7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Shortly after the initial discovery of HTLV-1 in 1980, HTLV-1 research flourished; however, the number of published HTLV-1 studies has declined since just before the 21st century. This limited research has resulted in a lack of basic knowledge, such as unclear estimates of the burden, and has led some experts to consider HTLV-1 a neglected disease. The current estimate of individuals infected with HTLV-1 is approximately 5 to 10 million people; however, these estimates are based solely on data collected from known endemic areas where epidemiological data are available, accounting for around 1.5 billion individuals. It is challenging to estimate the prevalence for densely populated regions such as India and China, and it is therefore likely that the actual number of HTLV-1 carriers is significantly higher. The virus is highly prevalent in some countries, such as the southern part of the Japanese archipelago, large regions of sub-Saharan Africa, several areas in the Caribbean and South America, Iran, and some areas of Australo-Melanasia. Most of these are developing countries that may not have adequate testing to identify infected persons and limit onward transmission. Furthermore, the lack of routine surveillance can lead to unclear estimates of prevalence. In Jamaica, after the initial epidemiological descriptions of HTLV, research has largely focused on HTLV-associated disease. An assessment of the current HTLV prevalence and strategies to reduce transmission in Jamaica are lacking.

The routes of HTLV-1 transmission include sexual transmission and transfusion of blood and blood products, as well as mother to child transmission (MTCT) primarily through breastfeeding and, rarely, zoonotic transmission of simian T-cell lymphotropic virus-1, which occurs mainly through severe nonhuman primate bites. Mother to child transmission is one of the most important transmission routes, as it is associated with the greatest risk of developing ATLand is also associated with increased risk of infective dermatitis and HAM/TSP. In late 20th century Jamaica (1983–1985), the prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in pregnant women as reported to be one of the highest in the world, with a seroprevalence as high as 3.5%, and a 2% (95% CI: 0.6–5.0%) seroprevalence was reported in 1988 for the same antenatal clinic. A knowledge attitudes and practices study of Jamaican women participating in the Jamaica Breastfeeding Intervention Study indicated limited knowledge of HTLV disease and transmission among study participants and showed that the majority of women were multiparous, indicating risk for HTLV MTCT to multiple children.

### Treatment of adult T-cell leukaemia / lymphoma: is the virus a target? [^115mRnaq]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss current understanding of the mechanisms of human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) tumorigenesis and current and potential treatment strategies for adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL), an aggressive malignant disease of CD4 cells caused by HTLV-1.

Recent Findings

Treatment of the aggressive subtypes of ATL remains inadequate, with little improvement in overall survival in the 30 years since HTLV-1 was discovered. Detailed analysis of the clonal expansion of HTLV-1 has provided new insight into pathogenesis. Most HTLV-1-infected cells, including ATL, express CCR4 which can be targeted. Reports of antitumour effects with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation provide a rationale for novel immunotherapy approaches. Progress has been made in the indolent subtypes of ATL with the use of 'antiviral' therapies.

Summary

ATL has poor prognosis. There is a major, urgent, unmet clinical need to identify HTLV carriers who will develop ATL to develop biomarkers of transforming disease and disease progression and to provide novel treatment approaches within the context of clinical trials. Several strategies now include putative or actual antiviral therapy. Potentially, the risk of ATL would be reduced by eliminating some or all infected clones. HTLV-1 infection, and hence ATL, can be prevented by antenatal HTLV-1 screening.

### Rapid onset and progression of myelopathy following an STI: a case for screening? [^113Q9ME4]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is recognised as an STI with serious manifestations of the disease in approximately 10% of those infected. This case report is the first to describe the short interval from sexual acquisition of HTLV-1 to the onset of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy and rapid progression to spastic paraparesis. The number of adult infections in the UK per annum is unknown, but surveillance data indicate that around 30% of newly diagnosed infections are occurring in persons born in the UK, rather than in migrants from HTLV-1-endemic regions. Despite this, and despite the risk of chronic debilitating disease, HTLV-1 infection is not part of sexual health screening in the UK, with the consequence that patients requesting sexual health screens are not informed of their carrier status and transmission from asymptomatic carriers to the partners will continue.

### Line immunoassay for confirmation and discrimination of human T-Cell lymphotropic virus infections in inconclusive Western blot serum samples from Brazil [^113wuzW3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the LIA was shown to be the best serological test for confirming HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infections, regardless of whether individuals were HTLV monoinfected or coinfected. We further highlight the need to review some WB criteria based on our results and those reported previously by others. It remains to be determined whether the superior performance of the LIA was due to the less stringent criteria employed than for WB. Further studies are necessary to confirm these results in a variety of risk populations from Brazil and elsewhere.

### Evaluation of a new screening assay for HTLV-1 and-2 antibodies for large-scale use [^1159zysY]. Journal of Medical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Laboratory testing for Human T-lymphotropic Virus type 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and -2) infections has become routine in blood transfusion, tissue transplantation and clinical diagnoses in many countries worldwide. Screening is usually based on the detection of antibodies to HTLV-1 and/ or -2. The number of commercially available assays is limited, and among them, ELISA tests based on microtiter format are most commonly used. Recently, the new rHTLV-I/II assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) was released; this assay was developed for an automatic large-scale screening platform. This assay was evaluated using pre-characterized serum panels and routine samples from the clinical laboratory. The sensitivity was 100% for HTLV-1 and -2 (99/99 and 42/42, respectively, including one sample that was dually reactive, HTLV-1 + 2). To test assay specificity, panels of blood donor sera, specimens from patients with autoimmune diseases and some viral infections were used. False-reactive samples from previous HTLV diagnoses were also included. With these panels, the specificity was 99.4% (619/623). However, the four false-reactive samples all belonged to the group of samples that were previously considered as false-reactive for HTLV-antibodies. All other samples were negative by the rHTLV-I/II assay, and thus 100% specificity was obtained. The 1,412 samples tested in the clinic by this assay in routine use were all negative (100% specificity). Taken together, the overall specificity was 99.8%. The assay was sensitive, specific and appropriate for the large-scale screening of samples for HTLV-1/2 antibodies.

Pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) infectious disease testing — pretransplantation recommendations specify "Universal testing of all recipients for: HIV, HTLV1/2, CMV, EBV, HSV, VZV, HBV, HCV, West Nile virus, syphilis, Chagas disease, and Toxoplasma", with "Additional tests per epidemiologic/social risks:

- histoplasma, blastomyces, coccidiodes, strongyloides, stool for ova and parasites, tuberculosis, malaria, Zika". Pediatric notes add that "Confirming a negative respiratory viral panel is recommended before starting conditioning", and future work calls for "Evidence-based screening plans for primary or reactivated infection through the HCT course are needed, depending on the risk factors each patient brings to HCT".

### False positive antibody results against human T-cell lymphotropic virus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome [^116V2n8m]. Journal of Medical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

Taiwan suffered from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Our laboratory performed a series of virology and serology tests for SARS patients admitted to our hospital. Cross-reactivity was found when testing for antibody against human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) in one patient with SARS. Therefore, antibodies against HTLV were examined in paired-sera from 26 SARS patients. ELISA and a neutralization test were used to measure anti-SARS antibodies. Seroconversion for antibody against SARS-CoV was observed in all patients. Surprisingly, with the use of ELISA for HTLV, sera for 13 patients were positive for HTLV (50%), and seroconversion for HTLV was also observed in 10 patients (38.5%). Western blot for HTLV on those 26 paired-sera from 13 HTLV-positive patients displayed 5 positive results for HTLV-I, 7 positive results for HTLV-II, 1 positive result for both HTLV-I and II, 9 negative results for either HTLV-I or HTLV-II, and 4 "indeterminate" results. The findings that antibody to HTLV can be detected in blood samples collected from SARS patients provide important information for safe handling of blood products. Without such knowledge, blood products can be discarded mistakenly even though they contain anti-SARS-CoV antibodies that may be potentially valuable for SARS therapy.

Future directions

Firstly, reviewing the information and advice provided to donors is vital, especially surrounding the messaging on what having OBI entails for the individual. Communication with donors should be clear and culturally sensitive regarding risk notification and guidance to accessible resources. The involvement of donors carrying OBI in research would enable a better understanding of the needs and expectations of donors who receive an OBI diagnosis. Such research would give insight into how an OBI diagnosis affects the psychological well-being of donors and whether current support mechanisms are adequate. It is expected that some donors with OBI may prefer to have the opportunity to be followed up, even though the rationale for doing so might be unclear. Although studies, mainly in Asia and Africa, have observed OBI in vaccinated newborns from HBsAg-positive mothers, there exists uncertainty surrounding the infectivity of individuals with OBI and the precautions that the individual and their contacts may take.

There is a need to consider the oncogenic impact of OBI. Extensive and methodologically appropriate studies are necessary to investigate the real-world prevalence of OBI in cohorts of patients with chronic liver disease, especially those of cryptogenic and non-HCV-related origins. Follow-up data regarding the prognosis of OBI individuals is also needed, as well as establishing a longitudinal cohort study to ascertain the presence or absence of liver disease in OBI blood donors. The risk of liver-related complications may also vary between different origins of OBI, e.g. occult infection following decades of HBsAg-positive infection compared to OBI following acute HBV infection or seronegative OBI individuals. Such studies may provide the necessary data to delineate individuals with OBI at risk of HCC through viral and host factors. However, blood donors are pre-selected for low frequencies of co-morbidities and low risk of infectious disease acquisition, meaning that such studies would require several decades of follow-up. The unrepresentative nature of donors is highlighted by the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) registry study showing that blood donors with asymptomatic HTLV infection identified via blood donation were invariably asymptomatic and showed a greatly reduced risk of developing HTLV-associated myelopathy or adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma compared to non-donor cohorts. Nonetheless, creating a global cohort of OBI donors with standardised aggregated data collection on their clinical outcomes, including complications of liver disease, would provide the necessary evidence to guide future policy for the follow-up of an OBI carrier, such as whether they should be assessed with liver function tests and an evaluation of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis.

### Human T-Lymphotropic virus screening of blood donations in england between 2002 and 2021-comparison of screening strategies [^111ZSYwL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Blood donations screening for 20 years has identified a total of 278 HTLV-infected individuals in England. The highest rates of confirmed cases were obtained when screening first-time and non-leucodepleted component donors; this strategy with a focus on testing first-time donors known to carry the highest risk of transfusion-transmitted infections was shown to be the most cost-effective option in the United Kingdom without compromising blood safety. Furthermore, most HTLV infections were identified in the UK-born individuals who had most likely acquired their infection unknowingly through breast feeding or heterosexual intercourse with an individual associated with an HTLV-endemic country. This is consistent with the results from the first blood donor screening study performed in England in 1991, which identified 4 HTLV-1 seropositive blood donors, all of whom were White, UK-born, females with sexual contact identified as the only risk factor for infection. Similarly, data from an antenatal pilot also showed that whilst high-risk HTLV populations could be identified — for example Afro-Caribbean mothers living in the United Kingdom — a targeted screening approach would likely identify only around 50% of HTLV-1 infected mothers, even if clinicians apply specialist knowledge of risk factors for HTLV infection. Common for all studies, HTLV-infected individuals identified via the screening programmes were asymptomatic, often belonging to ethnic minority groups and unaware of their HTLV status, allowing ongoing viral transmission. Although it is important not to miss the role of HTLV in patients presenting with the most severe disease outcomes such as ATLL and myelopathy, the generally asymptomatic nature of HTLV infection means that diagnosis will most likely need to be based on the epidemiological risk only. The lack of awareness about HTLV infection by the general population and specifically about self-carrier status are major challenges. These underline the importance of universal screening programs with appropriate confirmatory testing, availability of information on HTLV infection to those affected including their families, and further linkage to care pathways.

### Editorial commentary: human T-Cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis [^114L55Ts]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

In this edition of Clinical Infectious Diseases, Tanajura et al report on a longitudinal study of 414 HTLV-1–infected individuals in Brazil. There are a number of striking findings. First, among study participants not previously diagnosed with HAM/TSP, 18.4% had, at baseline assessment, symptoms, signs, and investigations consistent with a definite diagnosis of HAM/TSP. Second, an additional 21%, again at baseline, had possible or probable HAM/TSP on the basis of having either 1 motor sign consistent with HAM/TSP or a neurogenic bladder (probable) or a clinical diagnosis of HAM/TSP without exclusion of other possible diagnoses (possible). Third, during up to 8 years of follow-up, 5 subjects (all from the probable HAM/TSP category) were diagnosed with definite HAM, an incidence of 1.5%. Finally, very high incidences of a range of neurological symptoms were documented, particularly sensory, including upper limb, even though the median per-person follow-up was only 2 years.

These findings are notable because they differ by an order of magnitude from most previous reports. Using data from the mid-1980s, Kaplan et al estimated a 0.25% lifetime risk of HAM in HTLV-1–infected Japanese individuals, based on an average of 24.3 new cases reported per year among approximately 794 800 seropositive individuals (3/100 000 cases per annum). These data have undoubtedly affected some public health decisions outside Japan. However, in the Caribbean, Murphy et al diagnosed myelopathy in 0.5% of HTLV-1 carriers in a case-control study, whereas Maloney et al estimated the lifetime risk of HAM/TSP at 1.9% with an age-standardized annual incidence of 17.3 per 100 000 infected males and 24.7 per 100 000 infected females. In the United States, Murphy et al diagnosed myelopathy in 2.4% (4/166) newly diagnosed HTLV-1–infected blood donors; importantly, this study included matched uninfected controls. Although there is an extensive literature on the influence of HLA types on risk of disease associated with HTLV-1 infection, especially through impact on proviral load, and further evidence of ethnic differences based on rates of HAM/TSP according to tribe in a small study from Zaire, the cross-sectional prevalence reported from Brazil suggests a lifetime risk in this population 10-fold higher than previously reported. Is this due to genetics or environment or selection bias?
