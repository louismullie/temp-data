## Question

Coronary artery dissection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining SCAD and distinguishing it from other coronary dissections. Then, I should verify epidemiology and the typical patient profile. Next, I will examine pathophysiology and predisposing factors. After that, I need to review clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria, including angiographic typing and intracoronary imaging. I will then evaluate acute management, including when to choose conservative therapy versus revascularization, and clarify guideline positions. Subsequently, I should confirm pharmacologic therapy and long-term care, including screening for extracoronary arteriopathies and recurrence prevention. Finally, I will consider special populations, summarize outcomes, and identify knowledge gaps and future directions, making sure each assertion is supported by appropriate references and that I correct any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't conflate entities. SCAD is a non-traumatic, non-iatrogenic, and non-atherosclerotic coronary artery dissection characterized by separation of coronary wall layers with intramural hematoma and false lumen formation, compressing the true lumen and causing ischemia or infarction; this contrasts with atherosclerotic plaque rupture dissections, iatrogenic catheter-induced dissections, and traumatic dissections, which have different mechanisms and management implications [^113ZNnQX] [^115R5bvy] [^1124EXfQ] [^114qPia1].

> I should double-check the epidemiology and patient profile before drawing conclusions. SCAD accounts for roughly 1–4% of ACS overall but is disproportionately represented in younger women, comprising about 10–25% of AMI in women under 50 years and up to 43% of pregnancy-associated MI; most series show more than 90% female predominance, with mean age in the 40s to early 50s, and many patients lack classic atherosclerotic risk factors, although hypertension and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) are common associations [^1139qhWQ] [^113TSNCC] [^115D93pK] [^1116K8Ph] [^112Up21R].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms without reviewing the pathophysiology. SCAD arises from either an intimal tear with false lumen propagation or, more commonly, spontaneous hemorrhage within the media from vasa vasorum without a primary tear; the resulting intramural hematoma compresses the true lumen, reducing antegrade flow and causing ischemia or infarction, and this biology underpins the tendency for spontaneous healing over weeks to months in many cases [^113WNHJy] [^113ZNnQX] [^115oBqRb].

> I need to check predisposing and precipitating factors carefully. Systemic arteriopathies such as FMD are present in a substantial minority of SCAD patients, and screening for extracoronary vascular abnormalities is reasonable; pregnancy and the postpartum period are classic triggers, and intense physical or emotional stress is frequently reported; genetic susceptibility is suggested by collagen gene variants, including COL3A1 and COL5A1, and connective tissue disorders like vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; migraine and coronary tortuosity are also associated, reinforcing a mechanistic link to vessel wall vulnerability and shear stress [^113UUrhi] [^1139qhWQ] [^114Gnr5R] [^111cSxjM].

> Next, I should review clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria, and I need to ensure I don't overstate any single feature. SCAD most often presents as ACS, including STEMI and NSTEMI, with ventricular arrhythmias in a minority; sudden cardiac death occurs but is likely underrecognized; angiographic classification (Yip-Saw types 1–3) helps standardize recognition, with type 1 showing multiple lumens or a flap, type 2 a long smooth stenosis, and type 3 a focal stenosis mimicking atherosclerosis; intracoronary imaging (IVUS or OCT) is reserved for ambiguous cases because of the risk of iatrogenic propagation, and repeat angiography can document healing when diagnosis remains uncertain [^1116K8Ph] [^115oBqRb] [^112TRP3U] [^115p8vGN].

> Wait, let me verify the role of noninvasive imaging so I don't overpromise. Coronary CT angiography can occasionally depict SCAD, particularly in proximal segments, but its lower spatial resolution and frequent involvement of distal coronaries limit diagnostic reliability; it may be useful for follow-up of healed proximal lesions or for screening extracoronary vasculature, but it is not a substitute for invasive angiography when SCAD is suspected in the acute setting [^115LAg2Q] [^114ttWS2] [^117Steob].

> I will now examine acute management, and I should confirm the prevailing consensus before recommending any invasive strategy. Conservative management is preferred in clinically stable patients with preserved TIMI flow and no ongoing ischemia because most dissections heal spontaneously within weeks to months; PCI carries higher rates of technical failure, propagation, and complications in SCAD, and routine revascularization is discouraged; however, revascularization is appropriate for ongoing ischemia, hemodynamic instability, large myocardium at risk, or left main disease, with PCI attempted first and CABG reserved for failure or unsuitable anatomy [^113TSNCC] [^112WdESn] [^113aPKGa] [^115L4Cqf] [^113dBtwe].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence supporting conservative therapy so I don't overstate it. Multiple observational series and meta-analyses show no mortality advantage to routine PCI and higher procedural complications, with similar long-term outcomes between conservative and invasive strategies; spontaneous healing is common, and early MACE cluster in the in-hospital period regardless of strategy, supporting careful inpatient monitoring and selective, rather than routine, revascularization [^115pir9h] [^115LL7em] [^114EB6gH] [^115XL6Mk].

> Let me consider special high-risk scenarios, because I need to ensure I don't under-treat unstable patients. Left main SCAD is rare but carries high early morbidity and mortality; pooled case-level data suggest early revascularization reduces a composite of death, LVAD/transplant, recurrent MI, and urgent revascularization, though this remains hypothesis-generating and should be individualized; in SCAD-related STEMI with cardiogenic shock, mechanical circulatory support and revascularization may be required, with outcomes that can be favorable when expertly managed [^1117BB9X] [^1161gPzp].

> I should confirm pharmacologic therapy details and avoid extrapolating atherosclerotic ACS regimens wholesale. Dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated only when stents are placed; in conservatively managed SCAD, aspirin monotherapy is commonly used, though evidence is limited and some experts caution about bleeding risk given the intramural hematoma; beta-blockers are the only medication with consistent observational signal for reducing recurrence and are reasonable long-term if tolerated; statins are not indicated for SCAD per se but should be continued for global ASCVD risk or familial hypercholesterolemia; ACE inhibitors or ARBs are appropriate for LV dysfunction; anticoagulation is generally avoided outside the procedural setting due to hematoma risk [^112Jn6Dw] [^1169qtqd] [^113UUrhi] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review long-term care and recurrence prevention, and I need to ensure I cover extracoronary screening pragmatically. Evaluation for FMD and other extracoronary arteriopathies with head-to-pelvis CTA or MRA is reasonable given the association, though the yield varies and evidence that screening changes outcomes is limited; counseling on trigger avoidance, blood pressure control, and safe return to activity is essential; recurrence risk is approximately 10–20% at 3–5 years and may be higher with FMD, tortuosity, migraine, or hypertension; pregnancy after SCAD is not absolutely contraindicated but warrants multidisciplinary planning and close surveillance [^112dVF1F] [^113UUrhi] [^114Gnr5R] [^1139qhWQ].

> But wait, what about special populations and contexts that alter management thresholds. Pregnancy-associated SCAD often involves the left main or proximal LAD and may present with cardiogenic shock; conservative management is frequently feasible when stable, but urgent revascularization is indicated for ongoing ischemia or instability; exercise-related SCAD is increasingly recognized and should prompt counseling on gradual, monitored return to activity; men represent a minority and may have different trigger profiles, yet the same diagnostic and conservative-first principles apply [^117NFbwC] [^115D93pK] [^114z4ec7] [^1116K8Ph].

> I should double-check outcomes and prognosis to set expectations accurately. In-hospital mortality is low (generally 0–3%), but MACE in the first year are driven by recurrence and heart failure; long-term mortality remains low, yet recurrence is not rare and can involve new vessels; quality of life is frequently impaired by anxiety, fear of recurrence, and uncertainty, underscoring the need for structured follow-up, cardiac rehabilitation adapted to SCAD, and mental health support [^114oREDr] [^114Gnr5R] [^112kgyqk] [^113SrVvV].

> Finally, I need to identify knowledge gaps and future directions so I don't imply certainty where evidence is weak. There are no randomized trials comparing conservative therapy versus revascularization or defining optimal pharmacotherapy; the role and timing of extracoronary vascular screening remain uncertain; risk stratification tools to predict failure of conservative therapy are lacking; and patient-centered outcomes research is needed to tailor rehabilitation and counseling; ongoing registries and collaborative networks are critical to address these gaps [^117XyYKX] [^113ebUTz] [^114m8EuQ].

> In summary, I should confirm the practical clinical takeaway. SCAD is a non-atherosclerotic ACS with a female predominance and a propensity for spontaneous healing; in stable patients with preserved flow, conservative management with beta-blockade and careful monitoring is preferred, reserving PCI or CABG for ongoing ischemia, hemodynamic instability, or left main disease; extracoronary vasculopathy screening and recurrence counseling are reasonable, and patients benefit from structured follow-up and psychosocial support while we await stronger trial data to refine management [^113TSNCC] [^113aPKGa] [^115WsZpi] [^1169qtqd].

Coronary artery dissection is a **non-atherosclerotic separation of coronary arterial layers** [^113ZNnQX], most often presenting as acute coronary syndrome in young women [^115JXzJu]. Diagnosis relies on **coronary angiography** [^115oBqRb], with intracoronary imaging when needed [^1139qhWQ]; **conservative management is first-line** unless there is ongoing ischemia or hemodynamic instability [^113aPKGa] [^112WdESn]. Revascularization is reserved for high-risk cases due to higher complication rates [^113Zc2gV] [^115L4Cqf]. Recurrence is common, so beta-blockers are recommended [^1169qtqd], and patients should be screened for extracoronary vasculopathies [^113UUrhi] and counseled on triggers and risk of recurrence [^1121fH5n].

---

## Pathophysiology

Coronary artery dissection involves a **spontaneous separation of the coronary arterial wall layers** [^113ZNnQX], creating a false lumen that compresses the true lumen and reduces coronary flow [^115oBqRb]. Two mechanisms are recognized: an **intimal tear** allowing blood to enter the media, and **vasa vasorum rupture** causing intramural hematoma without an intimal tear [^111UYWRu]. Both lead to myocardial ischemia or infarction [^1116K8Ph].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

- **Demographics**: Predominantly affects women (82–98%) [^111UYWRu], often < 50 years old [^116oL1zc], with minimal traditional risk factors [^112Up21R].
- **Pregnancy/postpartum**: Strongly associated; 10–20% of SCAD cases are pregnancy-related [^1139qhWQ] [^115D93pK].
- **Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD)**: Present in ~20–50% of cases [^111q4feJ].
- **Connective tissue disorders**: Ehlers-Danlos, Marfan, Loeys-Dietz [^111cSxjM].
- **Triggers**: Intense physical exertion, emotional stress, hormonal therapy, cocaine use [^114Gnr5R] [^116Aw4KS].

---

## Clinical presentation

Presentation spans the ACS spectrum — NSTEMI is most common, followed by STEMI — and may include ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death [^1116K8Ph] [^111MWjt2]. Typical angina-like chest pain or dyspnea is common, and **cardiogenic shock is rare but more frequent in STEMI** [^1161gPzp].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Coronary angiography**: Gold standard [^114m8EuQ]; identifies characteristic appearances (Yip-Saw types 1–3) [^114m8EuQ].
- **Intracoronary imaging**: IVUS or OCT for ambiguous cases or to confirm diagnosis [^114m8EuQ] [^115UebE1].
- **Noninvasive imaging**: Cardiac CT/MRI for stable patients or follow-up [^115LAg2Q] [^114ttWS2].
- **Extracoronary screening**: Head-to-pelvis CTA/MRA for FMD or aneurysms [^111q4feJ].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

Conservative management is **first-line for stable patients with preserved flow** (TIMI 2–3) [^113aPKGa] [^112WdESn]. Medical therapy includes beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, and short-course dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) if no stenting is planned [^1169qtqd] [^115i8H3J]. Observation with close monitoring is essential, as most dissections heal spontaneously within weeks to months [^115XL6Mk].

---

### Invasive management

- **Indications**: Ongoing ischemia, hemodynamic instability, left main disease, or large myocardial territory at risk [^113aPKGa] [^113Tw5Zx] [^113TSNCC].
- **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)**: Higher complication rates (dissection propagation, stent malapposition); reserve for high-risk cases [^113Zc2gV] [^112XNPCy] [^115L4Cqf].
- **Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)**: Consider for left main or multivessel disease, or failed PCI [^114m8EuQ].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **generally favorable**, with low in-hospital mortality (0–3%) [^114oREDr]. Recurrence is common (10–20% at 1–3 years) [^notfound]; beta-blockers reduce risk [^1169qtqd], and triggers should be addressed [^1121fH5n].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus emphasize **conservative management as the default** for stable SCAD [^113aPKGa] [^112WdESn]. Revascularization is reserved for ongoing ischemia or instability [^113Tw5Zx], and beta-blockers are recommended to reduce recurrence [^1169qtqd]. Extracoronary vasculopathy screening and counseling on triggers and recurrence risk are advised [^113UUrhi] [^1121fH5n].

---

Coronary artery dissection is a non-atherosclerotic coronary wall separation that **requires a high index of suspicion** in young women with ACS [^115JXzJu]. Conservative management is preferred unless high-risk features are present, and recurrence is common, necessitating beta-blocker therapy and vasculopathy screening [^113UUrhi].

Introduction

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an important non-atherosclerotic aetiology underlying acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or sudden cardiac death in young and middle-age women. Knowledge of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of SCAD has exponentially increased over the last years, leading to more awareness and enhanced recognition by cardiologists worldwide. This also explains the creation of dedicated working groups, alongside with e-platforms intended to gather patients with SCAD, and get them involved in research projects. Similarly, patients have initiated social networks to increase SCAD awareness and promote self-support and research.

Simultaneously to this breakthrough, cardiologists are in the phase of integrating the new evidence and familiarising with this distinct entity, from its etiopathogenesis to the patient profile and outcomes. At present, clinical approach and management of SCAD is still too heterogeneous and, as a consequence, patients perceive disinformation and lhelplessness. Following the two positioning papers published recently, the present review aims to put together and synthesise the current state of the knowledge in SCAD. This article is intended to provide practical tips and guidance for clinicians dealing with this condition. Through the use of patient-centred algorithms and clear messages for practical application, we hope that the present work contributes to an improved and more uniform management of SCAD.

The growing use of imaging examinations has led to increased detection of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) as a non-atherosclerotic cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Since a greater awareness of pathophysiologic mechanisms has relevant implications in clinical practice, we aim to provide an update to current knowledge of SCAD pathophysiology. We discuss the most common conditions associated with SCAD, including predisposing factors and triggers, and focus on potential mechanisms leading to SCAD development. Furthermore, we report the main genetic research findings that have shed further light on SCAD pathophysiology. Finally, we summarize practical considerations in SCAD management based on pathophysiologic insights.

### Long-term outcomes comparing medical therapy versus revascularization for spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^115pir9h]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The ideal management of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has yet to be clearly defined. We conducted a comprehensive search of Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus, and Web of Science from database inception from 1966 through September 2020 for all original studies (randomized controlled trials and observational studies) that evaluated patients with SCAD. Study groups were defined by allocation to medical therapy (medical therapy) versus invasive therapy (invasive therapy) (ie, percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting). The risk of death (risk ratio [RR] = 0.753; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21–2.73; I² = 21.1%; P = 0.61), recurrence of SCAD (RR = 1.09; 95% CI: 0.61–1.93; I² = 0.0%; P = 0.74), and repeat revascularization (RR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.21–1.94; I² = 57.6%; P = 0.38) were not statistically different between medical therapy and invasive therapy for a follow-up ranging from 4 months to 3 years. In conclusion, in this meta-analysis of observational studies, the long-term risk of death, recurrent SCAD, and repeat revascularization did not significantly differ among patients with SCAD treated with medical therapy compared with those treated with invasive therapy. These findings support the current expert consensus that patients should be treated with medical therapy when clinically stable and no high-risk features are present. Further large-scale studies including randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

### Contemporary review on spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^111o6GZj]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is gaining recognition as an important cause of myocardial infarction, especially in young women. There has been a surge in the diagnosis of SCAD in recent years, presumably due to an increased use of coronary angiography, and the clinical availability and application of high-resolution intracoronary imaging. The improved recognition and diagnosis, together with increased publications and attention through social media, have considerably raised awareness of this condition, which was once believed to be very rare. Recent publications of moderate to large contemporary case series have helped elucidate the early natural history, presenting characteristics (clinical and angiographic), underlying etiology, management, and cardiovascular outcomes with this condition, thus providing observations and important clinical insights of value to clinicians managing this challenging and perplexing patient cohort. The aim of our review is to provide a comprehensive contemporary update of SCAD to aid health care professionals in managing these patients in both the acute and chronic settings.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: current state of the science: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115R5bvy]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has emerged as an important cause of acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, and sudden death, particularly among young women and individuals with few conventional atherosclerotic risk factors. Patient-initiated research has spurred increased awareness of SCAD, and improved diagnostic capabilities and findings from large case series have led to changes in approaches to initial and long-term management and increasing evidence that SCAD not only is more common than previously believed but also must be evaluated and treated differently from atherosclerotic myocardial infarction. High rates of recurrent SCAD; its association with female sex, pregnancy, and physical and emotional stress triggers; and concurrent systemic arteriopathies, particularly fibromuscular dysplasia, highlight the differences in clinical characteristics of SCAD compared with atherosclerotic disease. Recent insights into the causes of, clinical course of, treatment options for, outcomes of, and associated conditions of SCAD and the many persistent knowledge gaps are presented.

### Contemporary diagnosis and management of spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^1126TwR8]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has emerged over the last decade as an increasingly recognised cause of myocardial infarction, especially among younger women. The advances in our understanding of SCAD and the evolution of coronary angiography and intracoronary imaging have led to improved diagnoses and outcomes; however, there are still knowledge gaps and challenges in the management of this condition. In this review, we summarise the pathogenesis, genetics, diagnosis and acute and chronic management of patients with SCAD. We also provide focused updates on the following: genetics of SCAD, the role of cardiac CT angiography and cardiac MRI, the use of intracoronary imaging, revascularisation techniques and the overlap between SCAD and Takotsubo syndrome.

Considering all these aspects, a simplified practical algorithm for decision-making in the acute management of SCAD is proposed in figure 5. This algorithm primarily considers patient clinical status for decision-making, but also encompasses anatomical features such as size of the dissected vessel and degree of flow impairment.

Clinically driven repeat angiography

After either conservative or revascularisation management, it is imperative to monitor the patient closely for early detection of ischaemic relapses. Recurrent atypical chest pain episodes are common after the SCAD event and can last long after discharge in some patients. After-event chest pain is frequently not accompanied by new angiographic findings. Thus, when returning a SCAD patient to the catheterisation laboratory for chest pain, one should consider the possibility of spurious linking between symptoms and angiographic findings, but also bear in mind the dynamic behaviour of SCAD lesions. Precisely, a particular phenomenon that may occur in SCAD is the delayed longitudinal propagation of the dissection plane to a different segment or vessel. In the event of a relapse with objective ischaemia and worsening clinical status, the decision to revascularise should not be very different to that recommended for initial presentation, particularly avoiding PCI if thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) coronary flow is preserved (figure 5).

### Coronary artery dissection: a management dilemma in the district general hospital [^1165ULap]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of myocardial ischaemia with a high mortality. It most commonly occurs in young women with few risk factors for atherosclerosis. Presentation is varied, from sudden death to chest pain with features of myocardial ischaemia. The case presented highlights the dilemma of the need to treat a myocardial infarction within an acceptable time frame versus exploring a rare but entirely possible pathology, which may only be diagnosed in a tertiary referral centre a minimum of 90 min away.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: JACC state-of-the-art review [^1143VQbY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the past decade, spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has emerged as an important cause of myocardial infarction, particularly among younger women. The pace of knowledge acquisition has been rapid, but ongoing challenges include accurately diagnosing SCAD and improving outcomes. Many SCAD patients experience substantial post-SCAD symptoms, recurrent SCAD, and psychosocial distress. Considerable uncertainty remains about optimal management of associated conditions, risk stratification and prevention of complications, recommendations for physical activity, reproductive planning, and the role of genetic evaluations. This review provides a clinical update on the diagnosis and management of patients with SCAD, including pregnancy-associated SCAD and pregnancy after SCAD, and highlight high-priority knowledge gaps that must be addressed.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection with cardiogenic shock: how frequent is it? How should we treat it? [^1161gPzp]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) may represent 1–2% of all STEMI and 20–25% of STEMI in women < 50. Cardiogenic shock is relatively low (2–3%) in the overall SCAD population but may occur in up to 25% of SCAD patients with STEMI. The ideal treatment for a SCAD patient with cardiogenic shock requires thoughtful patient specific-management decisions in regards to both the choice of revascularization and the choice of mechanical circulatory support. When treated appropriately these patients have excellent long-term outcome, with mortality lower than STEMI or cardiogenic shock related to atherosclerosis.

### Revascularization in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection: where are we now? [^115XL6Mk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection classification and revascularization challenges.

SCAD indicates spontaneous coronary artery dissection.

However, revascularization is associated with suboptimal procedural success rates and high rates of complications despite preserved coronary flow. Most importantly, revascularization strategies may not protect against future target vessel revascularization or recurrent SCAD. Overall, revascularization should be avoided, particularly in patients with low‐risk features (eg, no active ischemia, coronary dissection in an arterial segment subtending a small territory), because the majority of dissections in patients with SCAD will heal spontaneously. In a study of 156 patients with SCAD (182 lesions) who underwent repeat coronary angiography with a median time of 154 days (interquartile range, 70–604 days) for a variety of indications, 95% of SCAD lesions were healed when angiography was performed ≥ 30 days after the acute SCAD event.

### Left main spontaneous coronary artery Dissection: clinical features, management, and outcomes [^1117BB9X]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an uncommon cause of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and is associated with substantial adverse events. SCAD involving the left main coronary artery (LM) is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. Currently, minimal data on LM SCAD have been reported.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate clinical features, contemporary management, and clinical outcomes of patients with LM SCAD.

Methods

A systematic review and pooled analysis of published case reports was conducted using "left main" and "dissection" as keywords. The authors screened 1,106 papers in MEDLINE and Embase published between 1990 and 2023.

Results

The final analysis included 132 patients (mean age 40 ± 11 years, 80% women) diagnosed with LM SCAD. Remarkably, 36% of cases occurred during pregnancy, and 95% presented with acute coronary syndrome, 22% with cardiogenic shock, and 8% with ventricular arrhythmias. At 120-day median follow-up, all-cause death occurred in 9%, left ventricular assist device implantation or heart transplantation in 4%, recurrent MI in 13%, and urgent myocardial revascularization (MR) in 21%. Compared with conservative management, early revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting significantly reduced the composite endpoint of all-cause death, left ventricular assist device implantation or heart transplantation, recurrent MI, and urgent MR (adjusted HR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20–0.69; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

LM SCAD carried significant acute morbidity and mortality. Early revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft) was associated with a lower incidence of early adverse outcomes compared with conservative management, driven largely by reduction in recurrent MI and urgent MR. These hypothesis-generating data should be confirmed in future prospective registries and clinical trials.

Conclusion

In clinical practice, the diagnosis and management of patients with SCD can be improved by incorporating available knowledge of this condition. Awareness of its high prevalence in middle-age women presenting with ACS in combination with diagnostic workflow algorithms will ultimately aid to deliver an individualised treatment. Patients with SCAD also benefit from personalised counselling and assessment of their concomitant medical disorders.

Despite marked advancements in the recognition and diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) over the past decade, knowledge of the basic pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease, contributing factors, and treatment continue to be poorly understood. We describe significant research gaps in our knowledge of SCAD and introduce strategies including the role of patient advocacy, independent registries, and creation of diverse centers of excellence to bridge the gap in clinical care, research, and outcomes. Lastly, we introduce an innovative patient-centered clinical care and research framework established through the SCAD Alliance and International Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection registry as a model for advancing knowledge of SCAD.

In contrast to the common atherosclerotic ACS, it is now widely acknowledged that conservative management is the preferred strategy for patients with SCAD whenever clinically possible (ie, preserved epicardial flow and clinical stability); yet, no direct randomised comparison between revascularisation and conservative strategy has been undertaken.

The preference of conservative management resides in the natural history of spontaneous healing in SCADcoupled with the challenging scenario that the dissected coronary vessels means for PCI (fragile vessels, often mid-distal location) and the consequent high rates of failure and/or complications. As a matter of fact, conservative management is generally associated with favourable outcomes and low rates of early urgent revascularisation (< 10%), whereas revascularisation subgroups have consistently shown poor clinical outcomes. As stated above, this are not randomised comparisons and consequently there is a potential confusion bias. In fact, patients selected for revascularisation present from the beginning with high-risk prognostic-modifying features such as impaired TIMI flow at presentation, extensive ischaemia and haemodynamic instability.

The real-world practice reflected in the series published in the last years shows revascularisation rates varying from 12% to 56%. However, the paradigm shift appears to be taking place, as a recent national temporal trend analysis has revealed a decrease in in-hospital mortality in SCAD patients parallel to a decline in PCI rates. Nevertheless, in some cases, SCAD leads to extensive ongoing myocardial ischaemia that jeopardises a significant amount of myocardium, particularly where SCAD affects more proximal coronary segments. These patients may benefit from revascularisation with PCI or emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).

PCI is usually attempted as the first revascularisation method given its readiness and less invasiveness, whereas CABG is generally deemed auxiliary or reserved for cases where PCI is deemed too complex. CABG has shown acceptable clinical outcome in SCAD series, though graft failure has been reported as high as two thirds in the follow-up, likely consequence of the spontaneous healing of the native vessel. A firm recommendation cannot be issued for selecting patients with SCAD for CABG, but rather this should be dictated by site expertise.

### Multimodality imaging of coronary artery dissection: a pictorial essay [^115oWQ9F]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare and underdiagnosed entity that can lead to acute coronary syndrome. This condition has a gender predilection, predominantly affecting women, especially those with known risk factors such as pregnancy and the postpartum period. Hormonal changes and hemodynamic stress during these stages significantly contribute to the occurrence of SCAD. Recognizing and understanding this entity, as well as its imaging findings, have a favorable impact on patient prognosis. Accurate diagnosis through imaging techniques such as coronary angiography and computed tomography is crucial for the appropriate management of SCAD, allowing for early and specific interventions that can significantly improve clinical outcomes and reduce associated mortality. Continuous education and awareness about this condition are essential to improve detection rates and effective treatment.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: an underdiagnosed clinical entity – A primer for cardiac imagers [^115LAg2Q]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a nonatherosclerotic cause of myocardial infarction in young and middle-aged women that has gained increasing awareness in recent years. Its diagnosis presents a challenge. Invasive coronary angiography is the primary imaging modality for diagnosing SCAD; however, it carries risk in these patients, who have an increased predisposition to complications. Advances in CT technology enable robust noninvasive evaluation of the coronary arteries at low radiation doses and have been increasingly utilized for the diagnosis or resolution of SCAD, in hemodynamically stable patients or when diagnosis of SCAD is uncertain at invasive angiography, particularly in proximal vessels. However, criteria for the diagnosis of SCAD with use of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) have not been currently established, and sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis have not yet been defined. The appearance of SCAD at CCTA can be subtle and can be missed, especially in distal small-caliber coronary arteries; hence utilization of other noninvasive imaging multimodalities may help solve this diagnostic challenge. Accurate and prompt diagnosis is vital, as management of SCAD differs significantly from that of traditional atherosclerotic acute coronary syndromes, with conservative management preferred for the majority of SCAD patients, and invasive treatment reserved for those with ongoing or recurrent ischemia, heart failure, or hemodynamic compromise. The goal of this review is twofold: (a) to discuss the potential role of CCTA in the diagnosis of SCAD, and (b) to discuss the role of multimodality imaging that may improve diagnostic yield, guide management, and enable subsequent surveillance.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: pitfalls of angiographic diagnosis and an approach to ambiguous cases [^115oBqRb]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is recognized as an important cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) leading to myocardial infarction. It is caused by hematoma formation within the tunica media of the coronary vessel wall, leading to the development of a false lumen that tracks both longitudinally and circumferentially. There is increasing evidence that in most cases, this hematoma arises de novo within the vessel wall, rather than as a consequence of a primary endothelial-intimal tear or flap. Compression of the true lumen leads to coronary insufficiency, myocardial infarction, and in some cases ventricular arrhythmia. Accurate diagnosis is critical, as management of SCAD differs compared with that for ACS of atherosclerotic etiology both in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and afterward. For example, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in SCAD is associated with high rates of complications and lower rates of angiographic success, whereas conservative management is associated with complete coronary healing in most cases. For this reason, both European and American consensus documents recommend a conservative strategy when practicable. The diagnosis of SCAD can be challenging. At present, there is no biomarker that reliably differentiates SCAD from atherosclerosis. Noninvasive diagnosis by computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTCA) is not routinely recommended, because of its lower spatial resolution, which limits assessment of the more distal coronary territories that are frequently affected by SCAD. As such, the diagnosis continues to rely upon recognition of characteristic features on invasive angiography. The aim of this review is to revisit the diagnostic features of SCAD, present potential pitfalls including SCAD mimickers, and suggest an approach to optimize accurate diagnosis.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^116Aw4KS]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an unusual cause of acute myocardial ischemia with complex pathophysiology. This paper reviews the major diagnostic and therapeutic issues of this rare but important disease. The diagnosis of SCAD should be strongly considered in any patient who presents with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial ischemia, particularly in young subjects without traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease (especially in young women during the peripartum period or in association with oral contraceptive use). Urgent coronary angiography is indicated to establish the diagnosis and to determine the appropriate therapeutic approach. The decision to pursue medical management, percutaneous coronary intervention, or surgical revascularization is based primarily on the clinical presentation, extent of dissection, and amount of ischemic myocardium at risk.

### First international consensus on the diagnosis and management of fibromuscular dysplasia [^1139qhWQ]. Vascular Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) — epidemiology, diagnosis, and management are summarized: SCAD is an uncommon cause of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with a strong female predilection (> 90% female), and a minority of cases (~10%) occur during or after pregnancy; SCAD accounts for 10–25% of AMIs in women under 50 years and 50% in the post-partum period. SCAD can usually be diagnosed angiographically and intracoronary imaging can be helpful in equivocal cases. There is a growing consensus in favor of conservative medical management when possible (e.g. TIMI 3 flow and no ongoing documented ischemia). Although most dissections heal completely within 3–6 months, recurrent SCAD has been reported in 10.4% from 327 patients in one prospective series followed for a median 3.1 years. Data on optimal medical therapy are limited, with initial evidence suggesting a potential role for beta-blockade and control of hypertension in reducing recurrence risk.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: clinical implications and diagnostic challenges. overlooked and underappreciated in Asia? [^116WrSsi]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the last decade, spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has garnered much attention as a significant cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and sudden cardiac death in women without classic cardiovascular risk factors. SCAD has been mostly studied in the West, with little recognition in Asia leading to under-diagnosis and under-representation. In this review, we highlight two distinct cases occurring at our center in Singapore, affecting two Singaporean women of Malay and Chinese descent. These 2 cases highlight that pregnancy-associated SCAD is neither the most common nor only manifestation of SCAD. Through review of the literature, we emphasize the heterogeneity in case presentation paying particular attention to SCAD and its association with connective tissue disorders such as fibromuscular dysplasia. SCAD remains a diagnostic challenge for many cardiologists, here we shed light and dispel myths surrounding coronary angiography and review the use of intracoronary imaging. The successful treatment of this unique group of patients requires a high index of suspicion, and management within a multidisciplinary team. The development of a recovery program with access to support groups, allied health, and cardiac rehabilitation is paramount in improving outcomes for these patients in the long term. Further research and studies in our Asian population will help to enhance our understanding of this disease and develop practices to best manage our patients.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) — in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) among younger patients, particularly women, SCAD is present in roughly one-fourth of women ≤ 50 years of age presenting with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Management has shifted toward cautious use of PCI because case series demonstrated low success rates and higher complication rates with PCI for SCAD and good long-term outcomes with conservative care; expert consensus statements emphasize conservative care in most patients. However, patients with ongoing symptoms, hemodynamic instability, or severely compromised blood flow involving a large myocardial territory (the proximal LAD or left main lesions) may not be suitable for conservative care, and further investigation is needed to define when and how to revascularize.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has gained attention as a key cause of acute coronary syndrome and sudden cardiac death among women. Recent advancements in cardiac imaging have improved identification and accelerated awareness of SCAD. Accurate diagnosis of SCAD through use of imaging is critical, as emerging evidence suggests that the optimal short- and long-term management strategies for women with SCAD differs substantially from that of women with atherosclerotic coronary disease. This review summarizes the application of both invasive and noninvasive imaging for the diagnosis, assessment, surveillance, and treatment of women affected by SCAD.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare cause of acute coronary syndrome. It is most commonly seen in young women, without atherosclerosis, in the peripartum period. Management options include conservative medical treatment, percutaneous coronary intervention or a surgical approach depending on the presentation, extent of dissection and luminal stenosis. We describe three unusual cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection occurring in young/middle-aged men-the first in association with heavy mechanical work, the second in association with high levels of anxiety and emotional distress and the third in association with intense physical exercise. In each case we report the use of coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound in the diagnosis of the condition, and their successful management using percutaneous coronary intervention.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: the management dilemma continues [^114mgcV9]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognised cause of acute coronary syndrome, particularly in women. A 36-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our hospital with sudden onset chest pain and was diagnosed with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography revealed mid and distal left anterior descending artery (LAD) dissection with distal LAD occlusion. A short segment of apical LAD filled late with incomplete opacification (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 1 flow). A decision was made to treat the patient conservatively, with subsequent resolution of dissection over the next 3 months. Our patient made a good clinical recovery with healing of her affected coronary vasculature on subsequent angiogram. The case illustrates that SCAD can be managed conservatively with antiplatelet agents, β-blockers, heparin and statins, if the patient is haemodynamically stable and coronary flow is adequate.

### Initial management strategy and long-term outcomes in 186 cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^115LL7em]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare but important nonatherosclerotic cause of acute coronary syndrome. Indications for revascularization and long-term outcomes of SCAD remain areas of active investigation. We report our experience with initial management strategy and long-term outcomes in SCAD. We reviewed all patients treated at our institution from 1996–2021 with a SCAD diagnosis. Demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentations, angiography findings, and management strategies were obtained by chart review. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiac death, recurrent/progressive SCAD, subsequent diagnosis of congestive heart failure, or subsequent/repeat revascularization after the initial management. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Of 186 patients with a SCAD diagnosis treated at our institution, 149 (80%) were female. Medical management was the initial treatment in 134 (72.0%) patients, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 43 (23.1%), and coronary artery bypass grafting in 9 (4.8%). Surgery/PCI intervention was associated with younger age (38.8 vs 47.7 years, P = 0.01), ST elevation myocardial infarction on presentation (67.0% vs 34.0%, P < 0.001), lower ejection fraction (45.0% vs 55.0%, P = 0.002), and left anterior descending coronary artery dissection (75.0% vs 51.0%, P = 0.006). Ten-year freedom from our composite outcome was similar between revascularized patients and those managed with medical therapy (P = 0.36). Median follow-up time was 4.5 years. SCAD in the setting of ST elevation myocardial infarction, left anterior descending coronary artery involvement, or decreased cardiac function suggests greater ischemic insult and was associated with initial percutaneous or surgical revascularization. Despite worse disease on initial presentation, long-term outcomes of patients undergoing revascularization are similar to medically managed patients with SCAD.

6 MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS

6.1 Conservative management

Whilst there have been no prospective studies to‐date evaluating the optimal revascularization strategy in SCAD, observational data have indicated that a conservative approach is preferable. This recommendation relies on observations that the majority of SCAD lesions heal spontaneously in the weeks to months after conservative management of the index event, and that revascularization is associated with high failure rates, as well as major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) both in‐hospital and during follow‐up. Furthermore, a recent meta‐analysis of studies comparing the efficacy and safety of a conservative approach demonstrated similar outcomes and lower likelihood of the need for target vessel revascularization when compared to invasive revascularization.

The currently available consensus statements, therefore, advocate a conservative strategy for the management of acute SCAD in the majority of patients. Notable exceptions are patients with ongoing ischemia, haemodynamic or electrical instability or left main dissection who may require urgent revascularization with PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). A proposed management algorithm for the acute treatment of SCAD is depicted in Figure 3. In the CanSCAD study the majority of patients were managed conservatively (86.4%), with only 2.3% requiring subsequent revascularization (2% with PCI and 0.3% with CABG). The risk of early complications, including recurrent MI, in conservatively managed patients has led experts to suggest an extended period of monitoring in‐hospital for conservatively managed SCAD patients. Typically this is 3–5 days, depending on symptoms and the location of SCAD.

### Revascularization in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection: where are we now? [^114uShYV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a heterogeneous condition that often presents as an acute coronary syndrome in young patients with a paucity of cardiovascular risk factors. In most registries, > 90% of patients with SCAD are women.SCAD is primarily a non‐atherosclerotic, non‐calcified, non‐iatrogenic dissection of the coronary artery resulting from either an intramural hematoma (IMH) alone, an intimal tear alone, or both an IMH and an intimal tear. Recent studies suggested that an IMH usually precedes the occurrence of an intimal tear. Although underlying mechanisms remain unclear, fibromuscular dysplasia, pregnancy, as well as certain autoimmune and inflammatory disorders have been reported as possible predisposing factors in patients with SCAD. To date, there are no randomized clinical trials comparing revascularization versus conservative management for SCAD; thus, SCAD management is primarily based on observational data and expert opinion,(Table 1).,

Table 1
Registries in Patients With SCAD Comparing Conservative Management Versus Revascularization

A retrospective analysis from the Mayo Clinic showed that in patients presenting with SCAD and low‐risk features (clinically stable with TIMI [Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction] flow 2–3), both conservative management and revascularization were associated with low mortality (1 of 94 conservative versus 1 of 95 revascularization). However, an earlier systematic review inclusive of 440 patients from a total of 381 reports identified in a Medline database search between 1931 and 2008 demonstrated that 21% of conservatively treated patients with SCAD required subsequent revascularization because of early SCAD progression and recurrent ischemia. A recent study (n = 750 patients) showed that 8.8% of conservatively treated patients with SCAD had major adverse cardiac events within 30 days of initial presentation. Another recent study showed that SCAD‐related ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) had a higher frequency of left main or left anterior descending culprit lesions (13% versus 1%; P = 0.003), and cardiogenic shock (19% versus 9%; P = 0.026) compared with STEMI attributable to atherosclerotic plaque disruption. We herein summarize the contemporary evidence for revascularization after SCAD and review the indications, techniques, and factors influencing its outcomes.

### A successful emergency management of spontaneous coronary artery dissection and review of the literature [^115ZjzFw]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare and lethal myocardial ischemic event, which usually causes acute coronary syndrome and sudden death. Emergency management of SCAD includes medical treatment, percutaneous coronary interventions, and coronary artery bypass grafting. Here, we report 1 case of 37-year-old young woman who was found to have a mid-distal SCAD of the left anterior descending artery, taking conservative management decision. In another case of a 50-year-old woman who was found to have a proximal-middle spiral SCAD of the right coronary artery, she underwent coronary angioplasty. After 6 months later at follow-up, 2 patients remained stable without symptom and in recovery of the left ventricular function; angiogram showed the SCAD healed.

Diagnosis

Coronary angiography remains central for SCAD diagnosis. A simplified angiographic classification was described to enhance its recognition. This classification has its primer in the insight gained from the early use of intracoronary imaging (ICI) in SCADand it has a correspondence with the pathological substrates depicted with ICI (figure 2). Nevertheless, the angiographic aspect is sometimes too ambiguous to make a firm diagnosis of SCAD, requiring confirmation through ICI or by assessing vessel restoration in repeat angiography. Considering all the available resources and its appropriate use is key to refine diagnosis and avoid overlooking SCAD, which would crucially change patient management and prognosis.

Angiographic presentations of spontaneous coronary artery dissection and corresponding anatomopathological features. First row describes the anatomical lesions behind each angiographic lesion (circles). Column 1 corresponds to angiotype 1: double lumen or luminal flap. Column 2 corresponds to angiotype 2: long smooth tapering. Column 3 corresponds to angiotype 3: focal stenosis.

The orientation provided in this regard by the position papers recently publishedis vague and perhaps too simple for practical application. Adapting the existing guidance and available evidence, we here propose an up-to-date diagnostic algorithm intended to maximise the role of coronary angiography for SCAD diagnosis (figure 3).

Diagnostic coronary angiography and percutaneous and surgical management

Invasive coronary angiography remains the gold standard for the appropriate identification and diagnosis of suspected SCAD. The Yip-Saw angiographic classificationis used for the phenotypic recognition of angiographic SCAD patterns with the use of additional intracoronary imaging only in the context of angiographic uncertainty given the increased risk of iatrogenic extension of the IMH and dissection propagation. However, angiographic classification has neither been shown to assist in decision-making nor to be predictive of outcomes. The high rates of procedural complications associated with percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) in SCAD, such as extension of dissection, technical failure, and long-term risk of stent restenosis and thrombosis, have led to low rates of revascularization among patients with identified SCAD. Additionally, given the high rates of short-term spontaneous angiographic healing and no association between PCI and reduction in the risk of recurrent SCAD, the majority of SCAD lesions are primarily medically managed. Limited data exist to guide appropriate risk stratification to predict which patients will demonstrate SCAD progression and/or failure of medical management upfront.,

Surgical management using coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been described in case series, observational studies, and case reports. Data support initial technical success but a high rate of graft failure due to the natural history of SCAD lesion healing. Given that CABG has usually been reserved for unstable patients with left main lesions, PCI complications, or failures, there is neither prospective comparison of PCI to CABG nor of CABG conduit type in the setting of SCAD. Use of venous bypass grafts and preservation of arterial conduits for future revascularization should be considered and further investigated.

Optimal strategies for invasive management of high-risk anatomy for which neither PCI nor surgical strategies have been optimized for SCAD are currently unknown. Prospective studies should focus on innovation in invasive options, role of temporary mechanical circulatory support devices, and understanding mechanisms of stent restenosis and thrombosis in SCAD PCI.

### Characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^1116K8Ph]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in young patients. 1 SCAD is characterized by spontaneous development of a false lumen within the coronary artery wall, either from an intimal tear or through spontaneous hemorrhage arising from the vasa vasorum within the vessel wall. 2, 3, 4 This results in compression of the true lumen and compromise of coronary flow. The vast majority of patients with SCAD present with ACS, with up to half of the cases being ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction; life‐threatening ventricular arrhythmias occur in ≈4% of cases. 5

In the general population, SCAD is the cause of ACS in the minority of cases, accounting for 1% to 4% of cases. 6, 7 In contrast, SCAD is an important cause of ACS in young women, accounting for almost a quarter of cases of ACS in women < 50 years of age. 8, 9 Remarkably, patients with SCAD tend not to have conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease. 5, 10 The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of SCAD are not well understood, although several factors, including connective tissues disease, fibromuscular dysplasia, emotional or physical stress, and pregnancy, were associated with SCAD and are believed to increase a patient's susceptibility. 1, 11

The optimal management strategy is not well defined. It is unclear if secondary preventive treatments proved to be effective in patients with ACS attributable to atherosclerotic disease confer similar benefits in patients with SCAD. No randomized trials exist to guide therapy. The long‐term outcome of patients with SCAD is not well established, with published case series reporting significantly different rates of morbidity and mortality. 10, 12, 13 The variation in outcomes between published series may be partly because of referral bias inherent in registry studies conducted at major tertiary referral centers.

The purpose of this study was to perform a population‐based analysis, using a community‐based cohort of patients followed by a health system in southern California, to determine the clinical characteristics, treatment strategy, and long‐term clinical outcomes of patients with SCAD and to identify clinical factors associated with recurrent SCAD.

6.3 Pharmacologic therapy

Like the invasive management of SCAD, there remains no evidence‐based guidelines to guide the medical treatment of SCAD patients either in the acute, or in the long‐term setting. It is unknown whether the standard guidelines‐directed medical therapy for patients with atherosclerotic disease and ACS apply to individuals with SCAD, as the latter has never been specifically studied, and based on the pathophysiology there are likely to be core differences in their management. Thus, current strategies for medical therapy in SCAD are largely based on expert opinions from observational series.

The key medications administered in SCAD patients are beta‐blockers and antiplatelet therapy. Theoretically at least, the administration of beta‐blockade in SCAD patients is generally thought to reduce coronary arterial wall sheer stress, similar to their therapeutic action in patients with aortic dissection. Strengthening this theoretical benefit of beta‐blocker was the demonstration of a lower risk for the recurrence of SCAD (hazard ratio: 0.36, p = .004) in a Vancouver series of 327 patients.

Clinical Perspective

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a spontaneous separation of the coronary artery wall by intramural hemorrhage that may occur with an intimal tear or bleeding from vasa vasorum, consequently resulting in partial or total occlusion of coronary vessels. SCAD presents most frequently as a myocardial infarction. The incidence of SCAD has been estimated to account for ≈1% to 4% of cases of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but for younger women (aged < 50 years), ≈40% of myocardial infarctions are due to SCAD. At the time of ACS, SCAD is detected and confirmed by coronary angiogram, and may be supplemented by intracoronary imaging with intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography. The pathophysiology of SCAD is heterogeneous, but an accumulating evidence base has identified predisposing arteriopathies, genetic factors, hormonal influences, and precipitating intense physical or emotional stressors as prominent precursors. A recent systematic review and meta‐analysis of 19 studies (N = 2172) reporting on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with SCAD determined that approximately half of patients with SCAD have concomitant hypertension, two‐thirds have been diagnosed with fibromuscular dysplasia, and three‐quarters reported identifiable physical or emotional stressors. Recommendations are for SCAD to be conservatively managed; invasive coronary revascularization procedures have been reported in 15% to 30% of cases.

### Exercise-related spontaneous coronary artery dissection: case report and literature review [^114z4ec7]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare cause of acute cardiac events and occurs most frequently in the peripartum period. Coronary artery dissection related to exercise is even more unusual, with only a few cases reported in the literature. We report a case of acute coronary artery dissection related to exercise in a 17-yr-old high school athlete, and we review the available literature on exercise-related coronary dissection.

Methods

We performed a PubMed literature search using the search terms exercise, sports, spontaneous coronary dissection, and athletics. We found seven cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection that had occurred during intense physical exercise. Vigorous exercise can provoke acute ischemic events, but such events occur primarily in adults with atherosclerotic disease. Many of the cases reported as spontaneous coronary artery dissection are more likely atherosclerotic plaque rupture, in which cases they are not truly spontaneous. Because spontaneous coronary dissection is so rare, there are no available recommendations on how to manage young athletes with this condition. We permitted this athlete to return to limited competition, without data to support either a total restriction or even a limited restriction, with the written understanding that a recurrent event is possible but probably unlikely. In summary, spontaneous coronary artery dissection should be considered in young individuals presenting with exercise-related acute ischemic cardiac events.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an acute coronary event of uncertain origin. Clinical features and prognosis remain insufficiently characterized.

Methods and Results

A retrospective single-center cohort study identified 87 patients with angiographically confirmed SCAD. Incidence, clinical characteristics, treatment modalities, in-hospital outcomes, and long-term risk of SCAD recurrence or major adverse cardiac events were evaluated. Mean age was 42.6 years; 82% were female. Extreme exertion at SCAD onset was more frequent in men (7 of 16 versus 2 of 71; P < 0.001), and postpartum status was observed in 13 of 71 women (18%). Presentation was ST-elevation myocardial infarction in 49%. Multivessel SCAD was found in 23%. Initial conservative management (31 of 87) and coronary artery bypass grafting (7 of 87) were associated with an uncomplicated in-hospital course, whereas percutaneous coronary intervention was complicated by technical failure in 15 of 43 patients (35%) and 1 death. During a median follow-up of 47 months (interquartile range, 18–106 months), SCAD recurred in 15 patients, all female. Estimated 10-year rate of major adverse cardiac events (death, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and SCAD recurrence) was 47%. Fibromuscular dysplasia of the iliac artery was identified incidentally in 8 of 16 femoral angiograms (50%) undertaken before closure device placement and in the carotid arteries of 2 others with carotid dissection.

Conclusions

SCAD affects a young, predominantly female population, frequently presenting as ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Although in-hospital mortality is low regardless of initial treatment, percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with high rates of complication. Risks of SCAD recurrence and major adverse cardiac events in the long term emphasize the need for close follow-up. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a novel association and potentially causative factor.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: pitfalls of angiographic diagnosis and an approach to ambiguous cases [^112TRP3U]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a pathophysiologically distinct cause of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). It is increasingly recognized that optimal management is different from that for atherosclerotic ACS and that a SCAD diagnosis has specific long-term prognostic and therapeutic implications. Accurate diagnosis is therefore essential to ensure the best treatment of patients. At present this relies on the recognition of typical features of SCAD identified on invasive coronary angiography. Although most SCAD can be readily distinguished angiographically from alternative causes of ACS, false positive and false negative diagnoses remain common. In particular, sometimes non-SCAD presentations, including atherothrombosis, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, coronary embolism, coronary vasospasm, contrast streaming, and myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries, can mimic angiographic features usually associated with SCAD. The authors present the combined experience from European and US SCAD referral centers reviewing the classical angiographic appearances of SCAD, presenting potential diagnostic pitfalls and exemplars of SCAD mimickers. The authors further review the benefits and limitations of intracoronary imaging in the context of SCAD. Finally, the authors discuss the investigation of ambiguous cases and an approach to minimize misdiagnosis in difficult cases.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^113uVVuC]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

A new Study Group for this unusual and serious condition was announced at ESC Congress in Rome by the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACCA) of the ESC.

Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognized cause of non-atherosclerotic acute coronary syndromes afflicting predominantly younger women. It is characterized by a separation of the layers of the coronary arterial wall by an accumulation of blood to form a false lumen. A build-up of pressure within the false lumen leads to external compression of the true coronary lumen restricting coronary blood flow and leading to myocardial ischaemia or infarction. SCAD should be distinguished from atherosclerotic dissections arising from plaque rupture events or erosions and from traumatic dissections or iatrogenic dissections arising during coronary procedures.

Historically SCAD was primarily considered to be a condition of pregnancy or associated with known connective tissue disorders. However, it is now clear these cases make up a small proportion of the prevalent population and most events occur unheralded in patients with minimal cardiovascular risk factors.1–3 In this conventionally low-risk group, diagnosis is frequently missed or significantly delayed. Furthermore, characteristic angiographic and intracoronary imaging appearances are not widely recognized, partly because of a common misconception that a visible dual lumen or linear dissection 'flap' will usually be present.2,4

Accurate diagnosis of SCAD is important because of key differences in management compared to atherosclerotic coronary disease. Success rates following revascularisation are lower in SCAD and if conservative management is possible (e.g. in haemodynamically stable patients with TIMI 3 flow in the infarct related artery), the dissection usually heals over a few weeks/months.5 Stenting may be essential to restore coronary blood flow but is complicated by the risk of proximal and distal migration of the mural haematoma such that long lengths of stenting may be required to restore coronary integrity and flow. Bypass surgery can be used as a bail out where percutaneous coronary intervention has failed or for high-risk left main stem or proximal dissections but longevity of grafts in the context of SCAD is reduced by healing of the native coronary and subsequent competitive flow leading to high-graft occlusion rates.

Management of SCAD-survivors is challenging with considerable uncertainty about the optimal approach. For example, antiplatelet therapy, whilst required in patients following coronary stenting, can precipitate menorrhagia and the indication in conservatively managed patients for a condition whose primary pathophysiological event is an intramural bleed, is less clear, especially after the acute phase. Likewise, the use of statins has been questioned for a condition whose primary pathophysiology appears distinct from atherosclerosis and unrelated to cholesterol. Furthermore, SCAD patients face particular questions unusual in an atherosclerotic population, such as about safe contraception and the risk of pregnancy. Of particular concern is recurrent SCAD which is well recognized and may affect as many as one in four patients over 5 years.4,6

To date research in Europe has been limited to a number of national registries, small clinical studies, and case series. Globally the largest reported series contain just a few hundred cases. As a result, SCAD represents a substantial area of unmet clinical need.

There is therefore an urgent necessity to coordinate research internationally to enable larger numbers of patients to be studied. This will advance our knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical management of SCAD. With this aim, an inaugural meeting was held to welcome the SCAD Study Group within the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association of the ESC at the recent ESC Congress in Rome. Support from the European Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) Group (a condition which occurs in a significant proportion of SCAD patients1–3) was especially welcome. The aims of the Study Group are:

- To establish a collaborative partnership to advance research into SCAD

- To maintain a European registry of SCAD patients to advance understanding of epidemiology and variations in patient management and outcomes

- To coordinate and support clinical and pre-clinical research into SCAD

- To formulate and disseminate a European consensus on the diagnosis and management of SCAD

- To improve accurate diagnosis by raising awareness of SCAD

- To support patients with this condition

The Study Group welcomes any interested clinicians to make contact and hope by working together we can make an important contribution to better understanding SCAD and improving our care and support for SCAD-survivors.

### Asymptomatic spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^1135AVYD]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of myocardial ischemia that could present as angina, acute myocardial infarction, or even sudden death. It occurs more commonly in women and it has been associated with autoimmune and collagen vascular diseases. The management and prognosis in these patients depend on the initial clinical presentation and the extent of dissection. In this article, we report 2 cases of asymptomatic SCAD that were diagnosed on routine preoperative evaluation. The management options and clinical implications are discussed.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: revascularization versus conservative therapy [^113Zc2gV]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a nonatherosclerotic acute coronary syndrome for which optimal management remains undefined.

Methods and Results

We performed a retrospective study of 189 patients presenting with a first SCAD episode. We evaluated outcomes according to initial management: (1) revascularization versus conservative therapy and (2) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus conservative therapy stratified by vessel flow at presentation. Demographics were similar in revascularization versus conservative (mean age, 44 ± 9 years; women 92% both groups), but vessel occlusion was more frequent in revascularization (44/95 versus 18/94). There was 1 in-hospital death (revascularization) and 1 late death (conservative). Procedural failure rate was 53% in those managed with PCI. In the subgroup of patients presenting with preserved vessel flow, rates of PCI failure were similarly high (50%), and 6 (13%) required emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. In the conservative group, 85 of 94 (90%) had an uneventful in-hospital course, but 9 (10%) experienced early SCAD progression requiring revascularization. Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year rates of target vessel revascularization and recurrent SCAD were no different in revascularization versus conservative therapy (30% versus 19%; P = 0.06 and 23% versus 31%; P = 0.7).

Conclusions

PCI for SCAD is associated with high rates of technical failure even in those presenting with preserved vessel flow and does not protect against target vessel revascularization or recurrent SCAD. A strategy of conservative management with prolonged observation may be preferable.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on sex-specific considerations in myocardial revascularization [^115D93pK]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2022). High credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) — epidemiology and initial management in women emphasize substantial burden and conservative strategy when stable. SCAD accounts for 25–33% of MIs in women younger than 50 years and is the most common cause of pregnancy-associated MI (43%), and 10%-20% of SCADs are peripartum-related, typically occurring in the postpartum period. Because revascularization in SCAD is associated with increased complications, it is reasonable to defer revascularization in patients with preserved coronary flow, minimal ischemia, and distal coronary involvement, particularly since spontaneous healing has been shown to occur in 95% of patients after 30 days. In the absence of high-risk clinical features, most patients can be managed with conservative therapy, and while guideline-based heart failure medications are used for left ventricular dysfunction, the benefit in preserved function is unclear except for beta-blockers, which may reduce recurrence of SCAD.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection across the health care pathway: a national, multicenter, patient-informed investigation [^112kgyqk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines for the management and convalescence of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) have yet to be developed. The targeted content, delivery, and outcomes of interventions that benefit this population remain unclear. Patient-informed data are required to substantiate observational research and provide evidence to inform and standardize clinical activities.

Methods and Results

Patients diagnosed with SCAD (N = 89; 86.5% women; mean age, 53.2years) were purposively selected from 5 large tertiary care hospitals. Patients completed sociodemographic and medical questionnaires and participated in an interview using a patient-piloted semistructured interview guide. Interviews were transcribed and subjected to framework analysis using inductive and then deductive coding techniques. Approximately 1500 standard transcribed pages of interview data were collected. Emotional distress was the most commonly cited precipitating factor (56%), with an emphasis on anxiety symptoms. The awareness and detection of SCAD as a cardiac event was low among patients (35%) and perceived to be moderate among health care providers (55%). Health care providers' communication of the prognosis and self-management of SCAD were perceived to be poor (79%). Postevent psychological disorders among patients were evident (30%), and 73% feared recurrence. Short- and longer-term follow-up that was tailored to patients' needs was desired (72%). Secondary prevention programming was recommended, but there were low completion rates of conventional cardiac rehabilitation (48%), and current programming was deemed inadequate.

Conclusions

This early-stage, pretrial research has important implications for the acute and long-term management of patients with SCAD. Additional work is required to validate the hypotheses generated from this patient-oriented research.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: contemporary aspects of diagnosis and patient management [^113ZNnQX]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Definition

SCAD is a non-traumatic, non-iatrogenic and non-atherosclerotic coronary artery disorder that expresses clinically as an ACS or, less often, as arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death. The pathology consists in the acute and spontaneous separation of the coronary artery wall layers that leads to the generation of an intramural space (false lumen), which may or may not be communicated with the true lumen through an intimal tear (flap fenestration). In any case, the pathological hallmark is the presence of a myoendothelial tissue lamina (intimomedial flap) dividing the two vascular spaces. The initiator of this phenomenon seems to be a haemorrhage at some level within the tunica media and adventitia, although it remains unclear whether the intimal tear, when present, could be the primary event.

Myocardial ischaemia and associated symptoms are thought to develop as a result of any of the following: (i) significant bulging of the compressed intima by an intramural haematoma; (ii) extension of the dissection by antegrade coronary flow causing an obstructive false vascular lumen; (iii) thrombosis associated to disturbed haemodynamics and exposure of deep components of the vessel wall to the blood stream; and (iv) the arterial dissection itself and subsequent healing process could potentially cause chest pain in the absence of myocardial ischaemia.

SCAD aetiology is not fully understood but is frequently explained as a combination of patient susceptibility and a variety of triggering factors. As per the modern definition of SCAD, external high-energy traumatisms (eg, traffic accident), direct vessel instrumentation or complicated atherosclerosis should be excluded. The latter deserves further clarification as the presence of atherosclerosis is not an exclusion criterion itself; rather, the cause of the dissection cannot be attributable to a complicated atherosclerotic plaque that initiates the dissection (atherosclerotic plaque erosion, disruption or rupture). This differential diagnosis may be troublesome and usually involves intracoronary imaging (ICI), which is discussed in a specific section. Last but not least, when acute aortic dissection (Stanford type A) is simultaneously presented with coronary dissection, the latter is usually a secondary diagnosis in the context of the former.

Spontaneous intramural haemorrhage, with or without intimal disruption, are distinctive pathological features of SCAD that ultimately translate clinically as a classic acute coronary syndrome or life-threating arrhythmia.
SCAD is a different pathological entity than coronary dissection associated to atherosclerosis, direct vessel instrumentation, high-energy external traumatism or primary aortic dissection.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) — revascularization versus conservative care: Observational data note that "62% underwent revascularization with PCI and 7.5% with CABG", and a single-center series of "189 patients with SCAD reported similar mortality rates at 5 years with a strategy of revascularization and with conservative care", with "a higher rate of emergency or urgent CABG… when they were treated with PCI versus conservative care". Across "Three large, single-center retrospective studies of patients undergoing PCI for SCAD" the "failure rate of 35% to 53% and a need for urgent CABG of 9% to 13%" were reported, whereas "conservatively treated patients experienced recurrent symptoms leading to revascularization only 2% to 10% of the time". Meta-analyses found "no differences in short- or long-term mortality rate, MI, heart failure, or SCAD recurrence between the groups", and the text concludes that "the data support a conservative management approach in clinically stable patients", while noting that "it is reasonable to consider revascularization in the presence of ongoing ischemia and hemodynamic instability".

### Outcomes during the first year following spontaneous coronary artery dissection: a systematic timeframe pooled analysis [^114EB6gH]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to compare the incidence and timing of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within the first year after spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) according to the management strategy: conservative versus invasive.

Background

Treatment of SCAD remains controversial.

Methods

A pooled analysis of studies providing separate individual clinical outcomes for conservative and invasive treatment strategies within 1year after SCAD was performed. The primary outcome measure was MACE incidence within three predefined study periods after SCAD, namely "in-hospital", "discharge-to-6-months" and "6-to-12-months". MACE was defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, heart failure and SCAD recurrence.

Results

A total of 16 studies (444 patients) were included; 277 (62%) patients were treated conservatively and 167 (38%) invasively. Within 1-year follow-up, 39 (67%) MACE occurred during the in-hospital period compared to 10 (17%) in the "discharge-to-6 months" period and 9 (16%) in the "6-to-12-months" period (p < 0.0001 for the overall comparison). MACE incidence was also significantly different between the three study periods in the conservatively-treated group (23 [78%] vs. 7 [23%] vs. 0 [0%], respectively; p < 0.0001) and the invasively-treated group (12 [66%] vs. 3 [17%] vs. 3 [17%], respectively; p < 0.0001), although no significant difference was found regarding MACE incidence in the intra-period comparisons between conservative and invasive treatment strategies.

Conclusions

This pooled analysis showed that most MACE following SCAD occurred during the in-hospital period compared to the following two semesters, regardless of the treatment strategy. No difference regarding MACE incidence was found between conservative and invasive strategies in each study period.

"Given the pathophysiology of SCAD, statin therapy is not indicated for SCAD but should be continued for patients who qualify for statin therapy based on global cardiovascular risk or inherited disorders like FH". "Patients who received a stent during their acute hospitalization for SCAD should continue DAPT… in the outpatient setting".

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD): a contemporary review [^117VMCzv]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

7 CONCLUSIONS

SCAD remains an infrequent cause of ACS in the general population, but accounts for a significant proportion of young women who present with MI, up to 35% in women younger than 50 years. Although both SCAD and atherosclerotic ACS may have a similar presenting symptoms and signs, the disease pathophysiology, predisposing factors, patient demographics and prognostic implications are noticeably distinct. And while we have relatively good evidence behind the rationale for treatment of atherosclerotic ACS, the same is lacking for patients with SCAD. Although large prospective cohort studies have paved the way for improving our understanding of its natural history, randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in SCAD patients are highly anticipated. Furthermore, improving clinician understanding and index of suspicion for this infrequent, but important, cause of morbidity and mortality in young women especially will hopefully improve both immediate and long‐term outcomes in these patients.

### Interventional versus conservative strategy in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissections: insights from DISCO registry [^114Hoxbv]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is defined as a coronary epicardial dissection not related to trauma, iatrogenic injuries, or atherosclerotic disease. It accounts for up to 4% of acute coronary syndromes in the general population. – Although current guidelines suggest pursuing a conservative strategy whenever clinically possible, uncertainty remains regarding the potential advantage of performing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as first approach to avoid early progression and propagation of hematoma to proximal segments, with a consequent risk of serious adverse events. Additionally, in many cases of ongoing ischemia or hemodynamic instability, a conservative approach is arguable and ineffective in clinical practice. However, PCI is burdened by higher procedural risks and lower success rate in SCAD compared to classical atherosclerotic disease. Furthermore, spontaneous healing is often possible in the short-to-mid-term, whereas bailout revascularization is rare in conservatively managed individuals.

In the absence of randomized trials, the choice between these approaches remains largely based on expert recommendations, and observational evidence, with few studies, and meta-analyses, specifically comparing an initial strategy of invasive versus conservative management.

In a SCAD cohort enrolled in the multicenter DISCO (Dissezioni Spontanee Coronariche) registry, we aimed to investigate: (1) the prevalence of PCI or medical therapy as the initial approach, (2) the predictors of the initial treatment strategy, and (3) the association between the initial treatment strategy and clinical outcomes.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on the management of patients with STEMI referred for primary PCI [^115GN2rB]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2024). High credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) in STEMI — angiographic patterns and treatment approach: SCAD with intimal disruption and intramural hematoma is an increasingly recognized nonatherosclerotic mechanism of STEMI leading to acute coronary occlusion and is often a cause of myocardial infarction in young women. Recognition of SCAD features on coronary angiography is critical, as the management of STEMI due to SCAD is different than the management of STEMI due to atherosclerosis; angiographic SCAD classification includes type I (multiple radiolucent lumens or arterial wall contrast staining), type II (diffuse stenosis of varying severity and length), and type III (focal or tubular stenosis that mimics atherosclerosis). Conservative therapy is often indicated especially in stable patients or with a limited territory of myocardium at risk, whereas PCI (or coronary bypass surgery) may be necessary in acute total occlusion, large myocardium at risk, refractory ongoing symptoms, or hemodynamic instability. If PCI is indicated, the goal is to restore vessel patency and achieve TIMI flow, and if this can be achieved without stent placement, a balloon alone is preferred; when PCI is used in STEMI, contemporary data suggest reasonable success with rates exceeding 90%.

### Pregnancy-related spontaneous coronary artery dissection: a Case series and literature review [^117NFbwC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac emergencies during pregnancy are rare but have significant associated morbidity and mortality when they do occur. The emergency physician must not only be aware of potentially life-threatening conditions in the pregnant woman, but also know the emergent management and treatment of these conditions to avoid worsening of the underlying condition. Pregnancy-related spontaneous coronary artery dissection has been described in the cardiology literature, but is not well-known in emergency medicine literature.

Case Series

We present a case series of six previously healthy women ages 27 to 39 years who presented 1 to 75 days after delivery with spontaneous coronary artery dissection. The left main coronary was involved in 5 of 6 cases. One patient died, 5 survived. Two survivors maintained significant long-term disability. The patient that died had the diagnosis made on autopsy, the others were diagnosed with coronary angiography. Two patients were treated with stents, 2 with coronary artery bypass surgery, and 2 with medical management. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergent coronary catheterization is indicated if this diagnosis is suspected. However, emergency care teams must also understand how and why management including coronary artery catheterization can exacerbate the underlying condition. The role of coronary artery computed tomography remains unknown, although it exposes the fetus to significant radiation if the woman is still pregnant at presentation. Medical management is indicated with diffuse or distal disease as pregnancy-related coronary artery dissections often resolve with time. Localized discrete lesions may be stented. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery may be considered if the left main artery is involved or there are multiple proximal lesions. Cardiac transplantation is indicated rarely.

### Traumatic coronary artery dissection: a case report and literature review [^114qPia1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary artery dissection after blunt chest trauma is a rare, life-threatening condition.

Objectives

To present a case of coronary artery dissection after blunt chest trauma and to outline the appropriate management of this condition based on a literature review.

Case Report

We report the case of a 50-year-old woman with traumatic coronary artery dissection after a high-speed motor vehicle collision. She presented to the Emergency Department via ambulance within a few hours of the collision, and her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly. A 12-lead electrocardiogram on arrival demonstrated anterolateral ST-segment elevation. The patient was intubated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and she required inotropes for blood pressure support. Computed tomography imaging revealed pulmonary edema and right third and fourth rib fractures. Emergent angiography demonstrated dissection of her left main coronary artery, requiring placement of a stent.

Conclusion

Early recognition of this clinical entity with a screening electrocardiogram, and aggressive management, may result in a favorable outcome. A literature review reveals that coronary artery bypass grafting, angiography with stent placement, and conservative management may all be considered viable treatment options for this condition.

### Iatrogenic catheter-induced ostial coronary artery dissections: prevalence, management, and mortality from a cohort of 55, 968 patients over 10 years [^1124EXfQ]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Iatrogenic catheter‐induced ostial coronary artery dissection (ICOCAD) is a recognized complication of cardiac catheterisation, which can lead to abrupt vessel closure with consequent myocardial infarction and death. ICOCAD refers to diagnostic or guide catheter causing ostial native coronary or graft vessel dissections. Prompt recognition and maintenance of coronary perfusion is key to prevent immediate life‐threatening complications. Depending on the severity of the dissection, conservative treatment or revascularisation with bailout percutaneous coronary artery intervention (PCI) or surgery have been described as potential treatment strategies. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, describe the management strategies, and evaluate the prognosis of patients with ICOCAD.

Regarding specific circumstances for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to perform PCI in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection only in case of symptoms and signs of ongoing myocardial ischemia, a large area of myocardium in jeopardy, and reduced antegrade flow.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: contemporary aspects of diagnosis and patient management [^114oREDr]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical outcomes and prognosis

In-hospital mortality is reported low, 0% in many series and no higher than 3%. In-hospital MACE was reported in 8.8% of the recently presented Canadian registry (n = 750), with about half of them being reinfarctions.P-SCAD, TIMI flow 0–1, proximal dissections and STEMI are characteristics that associate a worse in-hospital outcome.

Reported long-term MACE of patients with SCAD vary from 6% to 28% in the different series, and this is not explained by different follow-up times. Long-term mortality rate is very low across the series (0%–5% with follow-up medians of 3–6 years). Long-term MACE are mainly driven by recurrent SCAD and MI in these patients, and revascularisation does not prevent it, nor prevents late target vessel revascularisation. The wide variability observed in the rates of MACE is likely due to a heterogenous criteria for adjudicating SCAD recurrence. The latter should be distinguished from late propagation, which is the early relapse that tends to occur within first days (weeks the latest) after the index event. A true recurrence, also called de novo recurrence, is a new event occurring in the mid to long term and consists in a new SCAD that appears to invariably involve a distinct coronary segment (and vessel in most cases) from the initially dissected and subsequently healed one. True or de novo recurrences occurred in 10.4% at a median of 3.1 years in the largest series published.

To date, apart from coronary tortuosity, no other predictors for recurrence have been identified and, as abovementioned, no evidence-based therapies effectively modify prognosis. However, for the time being, the recommendations presented in this review, which are essentially in keeping with those from expert consensus from Europe and North America, are considered the best standard of care for patients with SCAD, and are assumed to provide the better outcomes.

ACC/AHA/SCAI coronary revascularization guideline — spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD): In patients with SCAD who have hemodynamic instability or ongoing ischemia despite conservative therapy, revascularization may be considered if feasible (COR 2b, LOE C-LD), while routine revascularization for SCAD should not be performed (COR 3: Harm, LOE C-LD). Observational studies indicate that most conservatively managed patients recover well without intervention, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may propagate the dissection and balloons and stents can extend the hematoma and lead to vessel occlusion; coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) onto a dissected vessel is challenging, with as many as 30% of patients having acute graft closure.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: contemporary aspects of diagnosis and patient management [^111MWjt2]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation

Nearly all patients with SCAD present as typical ACS. Despite progresses in diagnosing ACS, there is still a risk of underdiagnosing it in women owing to their low cardiovascular risk profile or atypical symptoms at presentation. A high index of suspicion is required to avoid misdiagnosis and appropriately refer the patient for coronary angiography. Although most patients with SCAD present with acute onset chest pain with raise in cardiac biomarkers, a smaller proportion (11%–16%) present with cardiogenic shock or ventricular arrhythmias. Sudden cardiac death, although likely underestimated, accounts for the least common presentation (< 1%).

The proportion of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI varies significantly among SCAD series: STEMI 26%–87% (weighed average 37%), non-STEMI 13%–77% (weighed average 63%). This variation likely owes to the dynamic behaviour of the SCAD lesion and its translation into the ECG. Single-vessel dissection is the most common anatomical presentation, with only ~10% of SCAD cases presenting with multivessel involvement (the least in non-contiguous vessels). Principal vessels' territories are affected in the following frequencies (not exclusive): left anterior descending (~57%), left circumflex (~32%), right coronary artery (~23%) and left main (~3%). Although not homogeneously reported, it is known that SCAD typically presents in mid to distal segments, with about 10% involving proximal vessels.

Chronic management after spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) — In patients with chronic coronary disease (CCD) who have experienced SCAD, counseling should be provided regarding potential triggers and risk of SCAD recurrence (COR 1, LOE C-LD). In patients with CCD who have experienced SCAD, evaluation for underlying vasculopathies is reasonable to identify abnormalities in other vascular beds (COR 2a, LOE C-LD). In patients with CCD who have experienced SCAD, beta-blocker therapy may be reasonable to reduce the incidence of recurrent SCAD (COR 2b, LOE C-LD).

### A case of spontaneous coronary artery dissection: it is not always plaque rupture [^111mvnNA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an extremely rare cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients may present with a broad spectrum of clinical scenarios, ranging from angina pectoris to myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and sudden death. Standard therapy has not been established; current treatments range from conservative management to percutaneous revascularization or coronary artery bypass surgery.

Objective

SCAD greatly mimics ACS, and this diagnosis should be considered when evaluating young patients who present with ACS with or without classical risk factors for coronary artery disease.

Case Report

We report a case of a 45-year old man who presented with chest pain typical of ACS. He had no risk factors except for a smoking history of 2.5 pack-years. Once the clinical findings suggested acute inferolateral myocardial infarction, the patient underwent emergent cardiac catheterization, which revealed left anterior descending coronary artery dissection. This in itself is not a common cause of inferolateral ST elevation changes on electrocardiogram.

Conclusion

This case highlights the fact that although SCAD is a rare entity, it is increasingly being recognized as a significant cause of ACS. Urgent angiography should be considered if SCAD is suspected, because early diagnosis and appropriate management significantly improve the outcome in these patients.

### Outcomes of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^1164eAwK]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

The majority of SCAD patients in the study were managed medically; albeit that this management was highly variable among the patients. Most patients received aspirin, a second antiplatelet agent and a β-blocker. There was no apparent difference in the medical management of the patients who had recurrent SCAD episodes and the broader cohort, and unfortunately no data were available on patient compliance. Optimal medical management of SCAD has not been described but often includes short-term inpatient cardiac monitoring and administration of an antiplatelet agent, a β-blocker and, if dyslipidaemia is diagnosed, a statin. These treatments are largely empirical and have not been studied in prospective clinical trials of SCAD patients. A conservative treatment approach should be the default management option in patients with SCAD as there are high rates of complications from PCI and similar 5-year outcomes when compared with conservative treatment. In unstable patients or those with ongoing ischaemia, revascularisation of the coronary artery in the form of PCI or surgery may be required. The complication rate from PCI in SCAD is high due to vessel fragility and technical difficulties. A retrospective study of 189 patients presenting with their first SCAD event, of whom 87 underwent initial PCI, reported a PCI failure rate of 53%.

At follow-up, 8% of our patients had at least one new coronary dissection. An additional 8% of patients had another coronary vascular event at follow-up. Patients with SCAD therefore require close outpatient surveillance. Early recurrence is commonly due to extension of dissection in the affected coronary artery, whereas recurrence more than 2 months after the initial SCAD tends to be in a remote coronary vessel.SCAD recurrence was reported at 6% in a recent small retrospective study. Another retrospective study of 75 patients reported a recurrence rate of 24% over a 15-year period.SCAD recurrence was 13% over a variable follow-up period in a mixed retrospective (median follow-up 6.9 years) and prospective (median follow-up 0.8 years) cohort. A prospective study of 115 patients with SCAD found a recurrence rate of 28% over a median follow-up of 21 months.

Convalescence management

Special considerations for management of patients with SCAD after clinical stabilisation are summarised in Box 2. In-hospital management is similar to that of any other patient with ACS, with extra consideration regarding the appearance of ischaemic relapses (including late propagation). Most cases can be safely discharged after a few days of convalescence, yet this should be individualised to each case. Ventricular function should be monitored during hospitalisation and later after discharge since left ventricular systolic impairment at baseline has shown to improve significantly in the short term. This has implications for tailoring medical treatment and, especially, for appropriately indicating primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in those patients with severe ventricular disfunction. If left ventricular function is severely depressed, until reassessment, the role of wearable defibrillators for this relatively young population is appealing.

Box 2
Summary of recommendations for spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) survivors

Reassessment of left ventricular function (life vest if necessary until then)

Differential diagnosis of chest pain after SCAD should distinguish non-ischaemic chest pain from less common serious causes: late propagation (days, weeks) or de novo SCAD recurrence (months, years), which may occur regardless of the treatment received

Medications:

Tailor heart failure therapy in accordance with left ventricular function that should be monitored to evaluate recovery
Dual antiplatelet therapy only for patients having stents implanted
Consider long-term beta-blocker if well tolerated (nebivolol for coexisting migraine)
Statins only for dyslipidaemia or evidence of atherosclerosis
For patients with fibromuscular dysplasia: aspirin, beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor or ARB

Systematic screening of extracoronary arteriopathy, preferably with a magnetic resonance angiography-based protocol

Genetic testing only if a connective tissue syndrome or familiar aggregation is suspected

Cardiac rehabilitation programmes and mental health assessment are appropriate

Discharge counselling:

Control of cardiovascular risk factors, with special emphasis in smoking and blood pressure
Encourage physical activity but avoid extenuating or isometric exertion (weight lifting)
Avoid recognisable emotional stressors
Preferential use of non-hormonal over hormonal therapies
Eventual pregnancies should be closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team

### Recurrent post-partum coronary artery dissection [^117Hryeq]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We present a case of recurrent post-partum coronary artery dissections. This presentation is highly unusual, and no guidelines exist whether management should be conservative or surgical. While there are some indications for CABG surgery we decided to pursue a conservative strategy with coronary artery stenting of the first dissection and medical management of the second dissection despite the inability to stent the second lesion. This strategy proved successful.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — definition and classification — are described as typically caused by the disruption (rupture or erosion) of an unstable coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque with associated partial or complete thrombosis and/or microembolism resulting in myocardial ischemia. ACS includes 3 related clinical conditions that exist along a continuum of severity: unstable angina, non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The initial diagnosis and classification of ACS should be based on the clinical history and symptomatology, interpretation of the ECG, and assessment of cardiac troponin (cTn). Unstable angina is defined by transient myocardial ischemia leading to diminished flow in the absence of significant myonecrosis detected by circulating troponin, whereas patients with NSTEMI may have a partially occluded coronary artery leading to subendocardial ischemia and those with STEMI typically have a completely occluded vessel leading to transmural myocardial ischemia and infarction. The pathophysiology of ACS can be dynamic and patients can rapidly progress from one clinical condition to another during the course of their presentation and initial evaluation and treatment. This guideline will focus on the acute management of ACS presumed to result from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or plaque erosion and subsequent thrombosis, and under the Universal Definition of myocardial infarction these will be classified as type 1 MI events, while diagnostic evaluation of chest pain and the management of type 2 MI, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, and MINOCA are covered in separate documents.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of acute coronary syndrome. In the literature, more than 1,200 cases of SCAD have been reported, with a low rate of recurrent spontaneous coronary artery dissection (r-SCAD) described in only 63 cases. Among these patients with r-SCAD, just three cases had three separate episodes of dissection and all were in women. We report the first case of r-SCAD in men, with three episodes of dissection in different coronary arteries and review the published literature on predisposing factors for r-SCAD and its management.

Introduction

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an uncommon cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) when compared with atherosclerotic plaque rupture, however should no longer be considered rare. In one recent study, 4% of patients presenting with ACS had SCAD on optical coherence tomography (OCT).SCAD typically occurs in patients without conventional cardiovascular risk factors, who are predominantly woman (82–98% of SCAD cases) with an average age in their early 40s to early 50s.SCAD was found to account for 22.5% of women younger than 60 years old with ACS in one recent single-centre study. The pathogenesis of SCAD remains incompletely understood. There are two distinct recognised aetiologies of SCAD that may be clinically indistinguishable. A tear in the intimal layer of an artery leading to the creation of a true and false arterial lumen or an intramural haematoma due to disruption of the vasa vasorum with the intima remaining intact. Myocardial ischaemia may arise with ongoing bleeding into and expansion of the false lumen, or expansion of the intramural haematoma causing external compression of the true arterial lumen. There is no single unifying disease process leading to SCAD, though there is an association with systemic vascular, inflammatory and connective tissue disorders, including fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), for which a genetic variant has recently been identified.

The lack of trial data on SCAD makes its management challenging. Medical management is generally recommended with percutaneous coronary revascularisation reserved for patients who have ongoing ischaemia or those who are haemodynamically unstable. Moreover, the outcome of patients presenting with SCAD is not well established. We therefore aimed to investigate, in patients presenting with SCAD, the associated medical issues and the clinical outcomes.

Diagnosis in occlusive SCAD

Severe flow impairment (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 0–1) generally impedes making an angiography-based diagnosis. For these cases, the diagnostic approach may overlap with the management strategy. If the vessel is small and distal, one may opt for an expectant attitude and scheduling a surveillance angiography. Conversely, if the dissected segment is amenable for intervention, an initial attempt to partially restore flow by wiring may be enough to unveil angiographic features that may support diagnosis. If that turns fruitless, ICI may be used. Overall, the risks and benefits of instrumenting a dissected vessel must be weighed. As mentioned above, in cases where PCI is clearly required (eg, proximal-mid LAD occluded), ICI is useful to both confirm diagnosis and guide intervention.

Computed tomography coronary angiography

CT coronary angiography, although potentially capable of diagnosing some cases, does not seem a reliable tool for making a definitive diagnosis nor ruling out SCAD. Its low spatial resolution to study vessel's wall coupled with the fact that SCAD often presents in distal segments limits its application. However, this imaging modality may have a role in some scenarios: (i) follow-up of conservatively managed patients with proximal vessel involvement; (ii) monitoring of untreated post-PCI proximally-propagated dissections; (iii) follow-up of complex PCI procedures or those involving coronary ostia; and (iv) follow-up of patients treated with bioresorbable stents.

Anatomically, SCAD has a preference for mid to distal coronary segments, and left anterior descending is the most commonly vessel involved, followed by circumflex and right coronary arteries. Multivessel affection is rare.
Angiographic features, along with the clinical profile, are usually enough to support the diagnosis of SCAD.
In dubious scenarios, use of intracoronary imaging may disclose the pathological substrate. Alternatively, repeat angiography can be performed to document healing and confirm the diagnosis of SCAD.
The advantages of intracoronary imaging should be carefully weighed against the potential harm of instrumenting a dissected vessel.

Patient profile

Epidemiology

Although the true incidence of SCAD is still uncertain, in modern series it has been reported to represent 1.1%–4% of all ACS casesand has been identified as the cause of 15%–35% of ACS in women under 50 years. Moreover, it has been suggested to underlie 0.5% of sudden cardiac deaths.SCAD is believed to be underdiagnosed at patient level (misdiagnosis of ACS in young otherwise healthy women) and in angiographic studies (oversight of angiographic subtle signs). However, with the advent of high-sensitivity troponin, the readiness of invasive angiography and availability of ICI, a higher number of SCAD cases can now be detected. All these advances have also permitted a better depiction of recognisable angiographic patterns that can raise the suspicion and, in many cases, establish the diagnosis of SCAD.

Table 1 summarises modern (from 2012) well-described SCAD series/cohorts (n = 1004). This entity predominantly affects female gender, which represent 81%–100% (weighed average 91.6%). Mean age ranges from 45 to 56 (weighed average 50 ± 9.8) years presenting normal distributions within series, where cases < 30 or > 80 years are rare. Caucasian or white race is reported in US and Canadian series as much as 76%–82% of the patients, though this is likely influenced by local demographics and referral bias. Cardiovascular risk factors, although not necessarily absent, are less prevalent in the SCAD population when compared with ACS population with similar age and sex.

Published spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) cohorts' demographics

Associated conditions and precipitating factors

An array of conditions frequently coexists with SCAD; however, it is not fully understood whether they act as preconditioners, precipitators or are just bystanders. Of note, a considerable number of patients do not present with these conditions and are sometimes labelled as idiopathic SCAD.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) synopsis and post-acute care — SCAD is an underrecognized cause of MI and is more common among women than men, occurring predominantly in younger women with lower burden of classic risk factors for ASCVD, with triggers including pregnancy, vigorous physical exertion, and severe emotional distress. SCAD may be a manifestation of an underlying arteriopathy, and pregnancy-associated SCAD has a worse prognosis than SCAD in the absence of pregnancy. Conservative medical management of the acute event is favored, but selected unstable patients may require percutaneous or surgical revascularization; medical care after SCAD is focused on managing sequelae of the acute event, evaluation and treatment of recurrent symptoms, and prevention of recurrent SCAD. In the absence of specific data among patients with SCAD, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after stenting should follow current DAPT guidelines while being aware that excess uterine bleeding in premenopausal women may require treatment, and observational data suggest benefits of CR and beta blockade.

### Role of computed tomography angiography in setting of spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^114ttWS2]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an infrequent cause of acute coronary syndrome, predominantly affecting young women. Catheter-based coronary angiography is the gold standard diagnostic test, especially when coupled with intracoronary imaging. Conservative management in stable patients is the preferred approach given the increased risk of complications associated with percutaneous interventions. Noninvasive coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) has a potential role in the diagnosis and follow-up of SCAD. CTA also plays a role in screening for extracoronary vascular abnormalities frequently associated with SCAD. The goal of this article is to review the potential role of CTA in evaluating SCAD.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)–associated extracoronary vascular abnormalities — prevalence and screening considerations include that "Multiple studies have reported a high prevalence of extracoronary vascular abnormalities (eg, cerebral aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms) and concomitant fibromuscular dysplasia among patients with SCAD". However, "The true prevalence of these disorders is unclear because reports are based on screening rates between 30% and 80%". "Table 14 lists screening questions that may point toward an underlying vasculopathy and, together with a detailed vascular physical examination, may facilitate a patient-clinician discussion about benefits and risks of imaging extracoronary vascular beds", and "no studies to date show that screening for underlying arteriopathies changes patient treatment or outcomes".

Post‐Revascularization Care

Several ongoing clinical trials and registries in patients with SCAD are currently underway (Table 3). Although a paucity of data on re‐imaging in patients with SCAD exists, repeat angiography should be considered in patients with an indication for angiography (eg, recurrent or ongoing chest pain), and revascularization is necessary for ongoing, unstable ischemia (or in the context of recurrent SCAD). It takes time for dissected vessels to heal, and evidence of residual dissection in the absence of clinical ischemia would not be an indication for revascularization. Follow‐up computerized tomography coronary angiography can also be considered in medically managed patients, particularly those with type 1 dissections. No clinical trial data exist to guide the need and timeline for repeat imaging, the duration of DAPT, or the merits of other pharmacotherapies in patients with SCAD. The American Heart Association Scientific Statement on SCAD suggests using DAPT as one would base on current guidelines for non‐SCAD PCI. In individuals at higher risk of bleeding events, per the expert consensus, consideration of recommending DAPT for at least 2 to 4 weeks after SCAD and low‐dose aspirin alone is reasonable. Long‐term DAPT may be considered in cases of severe late‐acquired stent mal‐apposition observed at follow‐up. Aspirin and clopidogrel are generally used, given the higher risk of bleeding with the newer generation P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors. In general, some experts recommended lifelong low‐dose aspirin DAPT for 1 year following the current guideline‐based therapy for acute coronary syndrome. In fact, the duration of DAPT therapy remains controversial and depends on the location of SCAD, revascularization modality, and the number and size of stents used. For example, there is a theoretical concern that antiplatelet therapy in patients with SCAD with IMH could potentially cause bleeding or dissection extension, even with low‐dose aspirin monotherapy. Further study of antiplatelet therapy in patients with SCAD is needed. Beta‐blockers may be considered in all patients with SCAD, as they likely help mitigate SCAD recurrence, possibly by reducing coronary arterial shear stress and reversing catecholamine‐mediated cardiac dysfunction. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin‐receptor blocker and follow‐up echocardiography should be considered if evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction is present. Statin use in patients with SCAD remains controversial but should be considered in patients with elevated atherosclerotic risk. Cardiac rehabilitation may be considered in all patients with SCAD to expedite their recovery and improve quality of life.

5 CONCLUSION

ICOCADs are uncommon but important complication of cardiac catheterisation. Most cases are caused by guide catheters which may cause deeper, traumatic intubation. The need for guiding catheter support should be balanced against the risk of ICOCAD especially in the presence of ostial coronary artery disease. Low‐grade coronary artery dissections in patients who are haemodynamically stable may be managed conservatively. In the majority of patients, timely recognition and prompt bailout PCI is a feasible option for high‐grade dissections and should be considered early to facilitate good clinical outcomes. Female patients may be more predisposed to high‐grade dissections and have worse outcomes.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: cardiovascular events incidence and quality of life evaluation in a single-center 10 years' experience [^1129V9Pv]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite recent advancements in the recognition and diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), pathophysiologic mechanisms, predisposing and precipitating factors, risk of recurrences remain poorly understood and evidence-based treatment strategies are still unavailable.

Aims

The goals of the study are to assess the characteristics of SCAD patients highlighting the predisposing and precipitating factors, to analyse the therapeutic management in the acute phase, to evaluate the incidence of SCAD recurrence and cardiovascular events during the follow-up and to assess the factors influencing the quality of life of patients after a SCAD event. We also aim to introduce our experience about the use of intra-aortic balloon pump in acute SCAD setting in order to support the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or its use as part of a conservative management.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, single-center, observational cohort study of patients with non-atherosclerotic, non-iatrogenic SCAD presenting to our Cath Lab in Santa Maria Annunziata Hospital (Bagno a Ripoli, Florence, Italy) with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We enrolled 84 patients who presented with acute coronary syndrome and SCAD documented by coronary angiography or intracoronary imaging, from January 2015 to December 2024. We excluded patients with iatrogenic dissection and coronary atherosclerotic disease.

Results

Mean age was 56.2 ± 11.6 years and 79 (94%) patients were women. At baseline, 40% had hypertension, 38.8% dyslipidaemia, 29.4% was current smoker, only 2.4% had diabetes mellitus. The most frequent hospital presentation was NSTEMI (70,6%), followed by STEMI (28,2%) and ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (3.5%). Majority of SCAD involved a single coronary artery territory (89.3%), and the most common coronary artery dissected was the left anterior descending artery and its branches (40.5%). Majority of patients (82%) were treated conservatively as initial strategy; 15 patients (18%) underwent myocardial revascularization with PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). In nine cases (10.6%) IABP was implanted to perform a protect PCI (4.8%), as bridge to emergency CABG in course of hemodynamic instability (2.4%) or as part of conservative management (3.6%) avoiding coronary instrumentation and PCI with positive long-term outcome. During the follow-up period (median follow-up 2.6 years with interquartile range 1.1–5.4 years) the primary endpoint, defined as major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) incidence and new onset or recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF), occurred in 18 patients (21.4%). Hypertension emerged as independent predictor of primary outcome (p 0.001, HR 7.965) and low-dosage aspirin at discharge appeared to be protective reducing risk of primary outcome (p < 0.001, HR 0.0034). The secondary outcome was to evaluate quality of life (QoL) of patients who suffered SCAD using EQ-5D-5L questionnaire and Seattle Angina Questionnaire-7. No significative differences emerged between patients treated by PCI and patients treated conservatively.

Conclusions

In SCAD patients, hypertension increases risk of primary outcome while low-dosage aspirin reduces risk during follow-up period. In terms of quality of life and post-SCAD chest pain, no significative differences emerged between patients treated by PCI and patients treated conservatively.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: contemporary aspects of diagnosis and patient management [^112XNPCy]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Stent malapposition or underdeployment are frequent findings in routine surveillance angiographies or autopsy. However, since an increased incidence of stent thrombosis in the setting of SCAD has not been confirmed, the clinical implication of these findings remains uncertain.

ICI guidance is paramount for ensuring true lumen access and avoiding stents deployed in the false lumen, which causes obliteration of the true lumen and pathological remodelling of the vessel. ICI also allows a fine depiction of the lesion and its extension, accurate dimensioning of the vessel and proper stent selection. In this regard, IVUS may be better for accurately sizing of the vessel and provide a more detailed characterisation of the false lumen, especially in cases where the true lumen is severely distorted and contrast filling is insufficient for OCT.

Dissection propagation, another issue derived from PCI in SCAD, frequently leads to further stenting of a longer artery segment. This can occur either by simple wiring or following dilatation that provokes blood displacement through the false lumen plane. Avoiding a constant target of 1:1 vessel:stent and optimal apposition, as well as being gentle with dilatation pressure, may help to prevent this complication.

Whenever clinically possible, conservative management is the preferred strategy in SCAD.
Because SCAD is a treacherous scenario for percutaneous coronary intervention, every precaution must be taken to prevent specific complications (see Box 1).

Conclusion and Suggested Approach

Most SCAD can be confidently diagnosed angiographically, and for these patients further investigations beyond extracoronary arteriopathy screening and an assessment of left ventricular function are unnecessary. However, some cases are challenging, and in these patients further investigations may help establish or refute a firm diagnosis of SCAD. This can be critical to determine the best long-term management. A suggested approach to investigations for different angiographic scenarios is shown in the Central Illustration.

### Aortic and coronary artery dissection during percutaneous coronary intervention: a case report and review article [^116CFcV4]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Coronary artery dissection is an uncommon but potentially serious complication in percutaneous coronary interventions. We treated a 53-year-old female patient with right coronary spasm, which was misdiagnosed as a coronary lesion. The coronary spasm resolved with nitrate administration, but proximal coronary dissection developed during angiography. It progressed anterograde and led to inferior myocardial infarction and severe hemodynamic instability due to right coronary artery occlusion. Percutaneous intervention failed, and it was determined that coronary dissection progressed retrograde, across the truncus of the aorta. Ascending aortic grafting and coronary bypass surgery were performed. The patient recovered and was discharged after 10 days. Close cardiothoracic observation is mandatory in patient evaluation and management.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection in a 27-year-old woman [^116EVup9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) causes acute coronary syndromes or sudden death in young patients who are often lacking classic coronary disease risk factors. Systemic inflammatory and connective tissue diseases have been suggested as risk factors for SCAD.

Objective

To review the risk factors, diagnosis, and management of this uncommon but life-threatening disease.

Case Report

We report a case of a 27-year-old woman with a history of an ill-defined inflammatory arthropathy who presented with an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. SCAD was diagnosed by coronary angiography. Percutaneous coronary intervention was attempted but was unsuccessful. The patient recovered uneventfully with medical management and was ultimately diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus.

Conclusions

SCAD is a rare but important cause of acute coronary syndromes and sudden death. It commonly occurs in young women. Although pregnancy is the most well-established risk factor, systemic inflammatory and connective tissue diseases have also been suggested as risk factors.

### Effectiveness of the "new rope coil" composite core suoh 0.3 guidewire in the management of coronary artery dissections [^114mZd93]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery dissection is a well-known complication of percutaneous coronary interventions. In this setting, coronary artery dissection is caused by mechanical injury of the arterial wall. However, dissection may also occur spontaneously. In both situations, an intimal tear or dissection allows blood entering and separating the layers of the coronary arterial wall. Despite percutaneous approach is still the preferred and the quickest way to restore coronary flow, it remains challenging. One of the main reasons for procedural failure is due to the difficult advancement of a guidewire into the true lumen. In such situation, the ideal wire should have a soft tip, high torque control, and excellent flexibility. Assuming that, the "new rope coil" composite core Suoh 0.3 guidewire, with its unique combination of characteristics, could allow better orientation insight into a dissected coronary artery increasing the chance of procedural success. We collected a case series of nine consecutive patients in which the Suoh 0.3 guidewire was able to gain the true lumen distally to a dissected segment.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection across the health care pathway: a national, multicenter, patient-informed investigation [^113SrVvV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the results provide a detailed description of SCAD across the health care pathway, grounded in patients' experiences. The results confirm that the awareness and detection of SCAD was low among patients, complicated by the range in symptoms and underappreciation of emotional distress as a significant risk factor for SCAD incidence. The data attest that among the acute health care community, SCAD is an increasingly recognized and understood form of ACS, but its prognosis and approaches for self‐management are poorly communicated to patients. Anxiety is pervasive, particularly in the early‐discharge period and among younger patients with unremarkable medical histories. Short‐ and long‐term follow‐up is desired. Conventional cardiac rehabilitation and other secondary prevention programming, including informational and psychosocial interventions, are recommended but are not currently meeting the perceived unique needs of patients with SCAD. Taken together, our research has important implications for the identification, and acute and long‐term management of patients with SCAD. Additional work is required to validate these findings and investigate hypotheses generated from this research among larger and more diverse samples of patients, both within Canada and internationally.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare clinical condition with a wide range of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic cases to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The exact pathophysiological mechanism has not been fully established yet. We would like to present a survivor of sudden cardiac death presenting with ventricular fibrillation due to spontaneous coronary artery dissection. The prompt evaluation, medical management, surgical myocardial revascularisation and value of off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery are discussed.

Diagnosis confirmation through surveillance angiography

When diagnostic confirmation is required, there are two possibilities (figure 3): (i) to gain further insight of the angiographic finding through ICI or (ii) to evaluate lesion's evolutive behaviour overtime with scheduled surveillance angiography. One should choose the most appropriate option according to each particular SCAD scenario. Scheduled surveillance angiography should be favoured over ICI in stable patients in which the operator does not intend to treat the affected vessel, and when there is a low likelihood of success of ICI due to proximal tortuosity and/or distal or small vessel diameter. As mentioned before, SCAD affects more frequently mid and distal segments, which discourages and sometimes precludes the use of ICI.

Spontaneously dissected coronary arteries tend to spontaneously heal — a pillar for the conservative attitude in SCAD management — and thus, if the initial angiographic finding correspond to SCAD, an evolutive change is expected in repeated studies (online supplementary figure B, material 1). In a study by Saw et al, all patients that were scheduled for surveillance angiographic follow-up after 4 weeks showed some degree of vessel healing. Ad integrum restoration or conversion to angiotype 1 support a definite SCAD diagnosis, whereas other findings are less conclusive and may require further investigation with ICI to disclose the underlying aetiology or perhaps to repeat angiography after a longer period (figure 3).

There is no definite time lapse for scheduling the surveillance study, but some authors have suggested 1 month. From our experience, SCAD healing process may last beyond 1 month in a number of SCAD cases (online supplementary figure B, material 1). Therefore, in order to optimise the role of surveillance angiography for detecting significant changes, as well as to minimise the risk of iatrogenic damage, it is reasonable to allow a longer time lapse for artery healing (⁓3 months). Nonetheless, this can be tailored according to the size of the lesion that is, small haematoma may reabsorb within 4 weeks whereas a largest one may take up to several months.

### Prevalence and disease spectrum of extracoronary arterial abnormalities in coronary artery dissection… [^111q4feJ]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

A, Multifocal fibromuscular dysplasia of the mid-distal segments of the right renal artery. B, Aneurysm of the right middle cerebral artery. C, Intimal flap due to a dissection of the right carotid artery. Lesions are indicated by arrowheads. In this case series including 173 patients with SCAD, using magnetic resonance angiography with blinded interpretation of the findings, 32% of the patients had fibromuscular dysplasia, 8% had aneurysms, and 2% had dissections; the prevalence of arterial tortuosity was similar in cases and controls. Extracoronary vascular events over a median 5-year follow-up were rare. Meaning The findings of this blinded analysis suggest that, in patients with SCAD, severe multivessel fibromuscular dysplasia, aneurysms, and dissections are infrequent and seldom associated with clinically evident vascular events.

Importance Spontaneous coronary artery dissection has been associated with fibromuscular dysplasia and other extracoronary arterial abnormalities. However, the prevalence, severity, and clinical relevance of these abnormalities remain unclear. typical FMD lesions, other extracoronary vascular abnormalities, such as aneurysms, dissections, irregularities, undulations, and/or arterial tortuosity, have been reported. 7 Based on these findings, both the SCAD1, 2 and FMD9, 10 consensus statements recommend brain-to-pelvis imaging by computed tomographic angiography or magnetic resonance angiography at least once. Analysis was undertaken in a single center, using viewing software. Analysis included cerebrovascular, renal, visceral, and iliofemoral vascular beds as well as the thoracoabdominal aorta.

The following lesions were considered: multifocal stenosis, focal stenosis, arterial aneurysms, and dissections. SCAD was predominantly diagnosed following a non–ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; 59 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and 5 patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. The most frequently affected vessel was the left anterior descending coronary artery.

### Fibrillar collagen variants in spontaneous coronary artery dissection… [^111cSxjM]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Weakening of the extracellular matrix of the coronary arteries may contribute to the development of SCAD. Importance Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an increasingly recognized nonatherosclerotic cause of acute myocardial infarction enriched among individuals with early-onset myocardial infarction but is of unclear etiology. Tissue was transferred into flat molds with 100% Eponate resin and oriented such that aorta would be transversely sectioned; embeddings were placed in an oven at 60 °C for resin polymerization. Thin sections were cut using a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome, collected onto formvar-coated grids, stained with uranyl acetate, 2%, and Reynold's lead citrate and examined in a JEOL JEM 1011 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Images were collected using an AMT digital imaging system. The most common risk factors were hypertension, fibromuscular dysplasia, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking.

Aneurysms and other dissections were infrequent among both the discovery and replication cohorts. The left anterior descending artery was the most commonly dissected coronary artery in both groups. Collagen ultrastructure of Col3a1+/− and Col5a1+/− murine aortas by electron microscopy showed decreased adventitial collagen content, most severely in Col3a1+/−: Col5a1+/− animals. Individual collagen fibrils were disorganized, with uneven fiber sizes and diameters. Arterial dissections have been reported in individuals with variants in COL4A5, 55 including SCAD. 56, 57 Finally, COL3A1 has the most well-known association with arterial dissections and/or ruptures, with variable severity associated with variant subtype.

58 Our group and others have reported COL3A1 variants discovered in patients with SCAD with syndromic findings of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 59, 60 and the 3 patients identified in this study with COL3A1 variants demonstrate the range of clinical findings in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
