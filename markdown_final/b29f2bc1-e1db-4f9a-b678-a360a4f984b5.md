## Question

Amicar moa

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the mechanism of action of Amicar (aminocaproic acid). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what aminocaproic acid is and how it's classified. Then, I should map its molecular targets within the fibrinolytic system. Next, I will examine its primary and secondary mechanisms and reconcile any apparent discrepancies across sources. After that, I'll synthesize the net pharmacodynamic effect, compare it with tranexamic acid, and finally contextualize clinical applications, dosing patterns, and safety considerations to ensure internal consistency with authoritative labeling and key reviews.

> Let me first confirm the identity and pharmacologic class. Aminocaproic acid, also known as ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and marketed as Amicar, is a synthetic lysine analogue categorized as an antifibrinolytic agent, akin to tranexamic acid within the lysine analogue class [^1151mYK1] [^111UhQd7].

> I need to check the physiological target and pathway context. The fibrinolytic system centers on plasminogen, its active enzyme plasmin, and plasminogen activators such as tissue plasminogen activator; binding of plasminogen to fibrin via lysine-binding sites and its activation to plasmin are key steps in fibrin degradation and clot dissolution [^111mB93D] [^112csfm2].

> Now, regarding the primary mechanism, let me think about lysine-site competition. As a lysine analogue, aminocaproic acid competitively engages lysine-binding sites on plasminogen, which impedes plasminogen's binding to fibrin and thereby diminishes its efficient activation on the fibrin surface; this is mechanistically analogous to tranexamic acid, although EACA is reported to be less potent in affinity terms by roughly an order of magnitude [^1151mYK1] [^111UhQd7] [^112csfm2].

> Wait, let me verify labeling language because I recall a potential discrepancy. The FDA labeling for aminocaproic acid emphasizes that its fibrinolysis-inhibitory effects are exerted principally via inhibition of plasminogen activators and to a lesser degree via antiplasmin activity, which might seem to underplay lysine-site competition; this is not mutually exclusive, and I should reconcile this by noting that occupation of lysine-binding sites on plasminogen/fibrin interfaces reduces activator-mediated conversion on the clot surface, while EACA can also weakly inhibit plasmin itself, so both descriptions are compatible with net antifibrinolysis [^113Udjiq] [^113Udjiq] [^111J1Cx5].

> Hold on, I should verify the comparative framework with tranexamic acid to ensure I'm not overextending EACA's direct antiplasmin effect. The TXA label rigorously details reversible occupancy of plasminogen's lysine-binding sites, displacing plasminogen from fibrin and inhibiting fibrin dissolution; reviews describe lysine analogues as preventing plasminogen-fibrin binding rather than primarily neutralizing free plasmin, in contrast to aprotinin which inactivates free plasmin, supporting the idea that EACA's predominant effect is at the plasminogen-fibrin interface with some ancillary pathway effects noted on its label [^111mB93D] [^112csfm2] [^1151mYK1].

> I will now synthesize the net pharmacodynamic consequence. By blocking plasminogen binding to fibrin and curtailing its activation and activity at the clot surface, aminocaproic acid stabilizes established fibrin clots and slows fibrinolysis, thereby enhancing hemostasis in conditions of hyperfibrinolysis; consistent with lysine analogue pharmacology, these effects occur without directly altering platelet count or coagulation factor levels at typical concentrations, as demonstrated clearly for TXA and mechanistically inferred for EACA [^1151mYK1] [^111mB93D] [^1151mYK1].

> But wait, what about potency and clinical interchangeability with TXA; I should double-check that nuance. Evidence syntheses and clinical reviews note that EACA is approximately 6–10 fold less potent than TXA in plasminogen binding affinity, yet both reduce surgical blood loss across settings; head-to-head and network analyses generally support similar clinical aims with dosing adjusted for potency, while high-dose TXA — but not EACA — has been associated with seizures in cardiac surgery cohorts, an important mechanistic-safety distinction to keep in mind [^111UhQd7] [^1151mYK1] [^1141yQaD].

> Next, I should review the clinical contexts where this mechanism is leveraged, to ensure the mechanistic explanation aligns with use. Aminocaproic acid is used to enhance hemostasis when fibrinolysis contributes to bleeding, including perioperative contexts such as cardiac surgery and selected orthopedic and spine procedures, and in hematologic conditions with hyperfibrinolysis or thrombocytopenia-related mucosal bleeding, reflecting the centrality of antifibrinolytic action to reduce blood loss and transfusion needs where fibrin breakdown is excessive [^111A9vfT] [^1161i3mF] [^115XdeQ8] [^116fy2xH].

> I need to ensure dosing patterns I mention are consistent with recognized practice, even though the question is mechanistic. Typical regimens employ a loading dose followed by continuous infusion to maintain inhibitory concentrations, with higher doses yielding greater antifibrinolytic effect in surgical settings; labeled oral and IV regimens for acute fibrinolytic bleeding align with this principle and provide practical frameworks for exposure supporting mechanism [^1151mYK1] [^111f51Ns] [^117VP4jC] [^113aVk4m].

> Hold on, I should verify key safety considerations tied to the mechanism so I don't overstate benefit without context. Because fibrinolysis is inhibited, there is a theoretical risk of pathologic thrombosis, and rapid IV administration may cause hypotension or bradyarrhythmias; however, reported intravascular clotting is often attributable to underlying conditions such as DIC rather than the drug itself, and careful patient selection with monitoring is warranted in high-risk thrombotic settings where antifibrinolysis is considered [^115dZFhU] [^111A9vfT].

> Let me reconsider the overall statement and make sure it remains internally consistent across sources. Aminocaproic acid (Amicar) functions predominantly as a lysine-analogue antifibrinolytic that competitively interferes with plasminogen's lysine-dependent binding to fibrin and thereby reduces activator-mediated conversion to plasmin on the clot surface; secondarily, it inhibits plasminogen activators and, to a lesser extent, plasmin itself, with the clinical net effect being stabilization of fibrin clots and reduction of fibrinolytic bleeding in appropriately selected indications [^1151mYK1] [^113Udjiq] [^111f51Ns] [^112csfm2] [^111A9vfT].

---

Amicar (aminocaproic acid) is a synthetic lysine analogue [^113Udjiq] that **competitively inhibits plasminogen activation** [^1151mYK1] by binding to its lysine-binding sites, thereby preventing conversion to plasmin and stabilizing fibrin clots [^112csfm2]. It also **directly inhibits plasmin activity** [^113Udjiq] at higher concentrations, further reducing fibrin degradation [^111J1Cx5]. This dual antifibrinolytic action underlies its clinical use to control bleeding in hyperfibrinolytic states [^1151mYK1].

---

## Molecular mechanism of action

### Competitive inhibition of plasminogen activation

Mechanistically, the **lysine-analogue structure** [^1151mYK1] allows aminocaproic acid to mimic lysine and bind plasminogen's lysine-binding sites [^112csfm2], blocking its attachment to fibrin and preventing activation by tPA/uPA [^113Udjiq]. Prevention of **plasmin formation** [^113Udjiq] results from this blockade of plasminogen–fibrin binding [^111mB93D], reducing plasmin generation [^1151mYK1] and subsequent fibrin degradation to preserve clot integrity.

---

### Direct inhibition of plasmin activity

At higher concentrations, **direct plasmin inhibition** [^113Udjiq] occurs, as aminocaproic acid inhibits plasmin [^111J1Cx5], further limiting fibrin breakdown and enhancing clot stability.

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

- **Absorption**: Oral bioavailability is complete (F = 1) [^113Udjiq], with peak plasma concentrations ~1.2 hours following a 5 g dose.

- **Distribution**: Widely distributed in intra- and extravascular compartments [^113Udjiq], including RBCs and tissues [^111J1Cx5].

- **Metabolism and excretion**: Primarily renally excreted unchanged [^111J1Cx5]; ~65% recovered in urine, ~11% as adipic acid; terminal half-life ~2 hours [^113Udjiq].

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Rapid onset [^113Udjiq] with sustained antifibrinolytic effect, reducing fibrin degradation and stabilizing clots [^1151mYK1].

---

## Clinical implications

Clinically, the **indications** include controlling bleeding in hyperfibrinolytic states [^111A9vfT], such as during cardiac surgery, orthopedic procedures [^111UhQd7], and in hematologic disorders [^1151mYK1] [^116fy2xH]. Safety considerations include that the drug is generally well tolerated; however, **rapid IV administration may cause hypotension or bradycardia** [^115dZFhU], and caution is warranted in patients with **thrombotic risk** [^111J1Cx5].

---

Amicar's antifibrinolytic effect is mediated by **competitive inhibition of plasminogen** and direct plasmin inhibition [^113Udjiq], making it effective for bleeding control in hyperfibrinolytic conditions [^1151mYK1].

### Drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion in major open vascular or endovascular surgery: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1151mYK1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic analogue of the amino acid lysine. It binds reversibly to lysine receptor sites on plasminogen, prevents activation of plasminogen into plasmin, and reduces fibrin breakdown. This improves clot formation, stability, and duration. TXA has been well-validated for use in perioperative, obstetric, and trauma care, as well as in cardiac surgery. A systematic review and network meta-analysis of antifibrinolytic adverse drug effects in the setting of cardiac surgery suggests TXA use reduces mortality compared to placebo or aprotinin and does not increase myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular attack (CVA), or renal failure or dysfunction. However, in high doses, TXA has been associated with seizures in the cardiac surgery setting.

ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) is another synthetic lysine analogue, with a similar mechanism of action to TXA. Comparative potency estimates suggest EACA is 7 to 10 times less potent than TXA. There is no known association with seizures.

Antifibrinolytic drugs such as EACA and TXA are usually administered intravenously after the induction of anaesthesia. Typically, a loading dose is given followed by continuous infusion. High doses appear to be more effective than low doses. Neither TXA nor EACA has been associated with increased risks of adverse effects.

### Aminocaproic acid [^113Udjiq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The fibrinolysis-inhibitory effects of aminocaproic acid appear to be exerted principally via inhibition of plasminogen activators and to a lesser degree through antiplasmin activity.

In adults, oral absorption appears to be a zero-order process with an absorption rate of 5.2 g/hr. The mean lag time in absorption is 10 minutes. After a single oral dose of 5 g, absorption was complete (F = 1). Mean ± SD peak plasma concentrations (164 ± 28 mcg/mL) were reached within 1.2 ± 0.45 hours.

After oral administration, the apparent volume of distribution was estimated to be 23.1 ± 6.6 L (mean ± SD). Correspondingly, the volume of distribution after intravenous administration has been reported to be 30.0 ± 8.2 L. After prolonged administration, aminocaproic acid has been found to distribute throughout extravascular and intravascular compartments of the body, penetrating human red blood cells as well as other tissue cells.

Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination. Sixty-five percent of the dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug and 11% of the dose appears as the metabolite adipic acid. Renal clearance (116 mL/min) approximates endogenous creatinine clearance. The total body clearance is 169 mL/min. The terminal elimination half-life for aminocaproic acid is approximately 2 hours.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of epsilon-aminocaproic acid for reducing blood loss in coronary artery bypass grafting surgery [^1161i3mF]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Epsilon-aminocaproic acid is a plasmin inhibitor that potentially reduces perioperative bleeding when administered prophylactically to cardiac surgery patients. To evaluate the efficacy of epsilon-aminocaproic acid, a prospective, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

- **Study design**: One hundred patients were randomly assigned to receive either epsilon-aminocaproic acid (100 mg/kg before skin incision followed by 1 g/hour continuous infusion until chest closure, 10 g in cardiopulmonary bypass circuit) or placebo. The efficacy of epsilon-aminocaproic acid was evaluated by the reduction in postoperative thoracic drainage volume and in donor blood transfusion up to postoperative day 12.

- **Results**: Postoperative thoracic drainage volume was significantly lower in the epsilon-aminocaproic acid group compared with the placebo group (epsilon-aminocaproic acid, 649 ± 261 mL; versus placebo, 940 ± 626 mL; p = 0.003). There were no significant differences between the epsilon-aminocaproic acid and placebo groups in the percentage of patients requiring donor red blood cell transfusions (epsilon-aminocaproic acid, 24%; versus placebo, 18%; p = 0.62) or in the number of units of donor red blood cells transfused (epsilon-aminocaproic acid, 2.2 ± 0.8 U; versus placebo, 1.9 ± 0.8 U; p = 0.29). Epsilon-aminocaproic acid did not reduce the risk of donor red blood cell transfusions compared with placebo (odds ratio: 1.2, 95% confidence interval; 0.4 to 3.2, p = 0.63).

### Diacomit [^117R7cHm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The mechanism by which Diacomit exerts its anticonvulsant effect in humans is unknown. Possible mechanisms of action include direct effects mediated through the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor and indirect effects involving inhibition of cytochrome P450 activity, resulting in an increase in blood levels of clobazam and its active metabolite.

There are no relevant data on the pharmacodynamic effects of Diacomit.

### A dietary fatty acid counteracts neuronal mechanical sensitization [^117D9iz1]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

The detection of touch relies on mechanosensitive ion channels expressed in sensory nerve endings. These channels translate mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, depolarize neurons, and, in turn, generate action potentials that propagate toward the central nervous system. PIEZO2 mediates a major proportion of the mechano-activated excitatory currents in mouse DRG neurons. As MA decreases mechano-currents (including those of PIEZO2), we sought to determine whether this saturated fatty acid would also impair the ability of DRG neurons to elicit mechanically activated action potentials. Indeed, we found that MA completely inhibited action potential generation in mouse DRG neurons when indentation steps were smaller than 12 µm. Nevertheless, we were able to elicit action potentials in MA-treated neurons after using larger indentation steps (≥ 12 µm for MA vs. 7–12 µm for control).

Stimulating DRG neurons with a series of 1 Hz mechanical stimulus trains revealed that cells enriched with MA evoked fewer action potentials than the control (< 12 µm), even at large indentation magnitudes (≥ 12 µm). Interestingly, MA-enriched neurons also displayed a progressive decline in membrane potential as the indentation-pulse number progressed. This suggests that after repetitive stimulation, it is more difficult to open mechanosensitive channels in MA-treated neurons.

### May toxicity of amiodarone be prevented by antioxidants? A cell-culture study [^115jcQCA]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) has a similar mechanism of antioxidant action, which is mediated either directly by scavenging reactive oxygen species or indirectly by production of glutathione. The cysteine component of NAC combines with glutamate and glycine, the precursors in the production of glutathione, where cysteine is the rate-limiting step. Glutathione itself is the most generic antioxidant in the body. Lee et al. demonstrated the preventive role of NAC against contrast-induced nephrotoxicity measured by MTT analysis in a similarly designed study on human embryonic kidney cells. We also believe that NAC prevents amiodarone-induced cytotoxicity via the glutathione pathway, but molecular analysis should be conducted for certainty.

When exploring the clinical side of the unknown equation of amiodarone-induced cytotoxicity, the additive effect of inflammation and oxidative stress, which play a role in the development of arrhythmias, should also be considered. Particularly, the inflammatory response associated with cardiopulmonary bypass is a critical cornerstone following cardiac surgery. Although not fully documented, the clinical use of antioxidants may have favorable effects in this setting. Rodrigo et al. reviewed the use of antioxidants for the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) and suggested using vitamins E and C, hypothesizing that their use would not only minimize the risk of post-cardiac surgery AF but also increase treatment success. Carnes et al. reported the antioxidant role of vitamin C and documented a decreased risk of postoperative AF in patients given prophylactic preoperative and postoperative treatment.

### The effects of Amicar and TXA on lumbar spine fusion in an animal model [^114yyPBh]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

The study was designed using an animal model to determine whether aminocaproic acid (Amicar) and tranexamic acid (TXA) inhibit spine fusion volume. Amicar and TXA are antifibrinolytics used to reduce perioperative bleeding. Prior in vitro data indicated that these antifibrinolytics reduce osteoblast bone mineralization. This study examined if Amicar and TXA inhibit spine fusion.

- **Methods**:
	- Posterolateral L4-L6 fusion was performed in 50 mice, which were randomized into groups of 10 to receive different treatments before and after surgery: (1) saline, (2) TXA 100 mg/kg, (3) TXA 1000 mg/kg, (4) Amicar 100 mg/kg, and (5) Amicar 1000 mg/kg. High-resolution plane radiography was conducted after 5 weeks, and micro-CT (computed tomography) was performed at the end of the 12-week study. Radiographs were graded using the Lenke scale, and micro-CT quantified fusion mass bone volume. One-way analysis of variance by ranks with Kruskal-Wallis testing compared radiographical scores. One-way analysis of variance with least significant difference post hoc testing compared the micro-CT bone volume.

- **Results**:
	- The average ± standard deviation bone volume/total volume (%) for the groups were: saline 10.8 ± 2.3%, TXA 100 mg/kg 9.7 ± 2.2%, TXA 1000 mg/kg 13.4 ± 3.2%, Amicar 100 mg/kg 15.5 ± 5.2%, and Amicar 1000 mg/kg 17.9 ± 3.5%. The Amicar 100 mg/kg (P < 0.05) and Amicar 1000 mg/kg (P < 0.001) groups showed significant differences compared with the saline group, with greater bone volume observed in the Amicar groups.

### The anti-allergic drug, N-(3',4'-dimethoxycinnamonyl) anthranilic acid, exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties in arthritis [^111rqEyd]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

The degradation of tryptophan by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase yields a number of immunomodulatory metabolites, including 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenic acid, and quinolinic acid. N-(3',4'-dimethoxycinnamonyl) anthranilic acid (3,4-DAA) is a synthetic anthranilic acid derivative that has been used therapeutically in Japan for many years as an anti-allergic drug and has recently been shown to be effective in a murine model of multiple sclerosis.

- **Objectives**: In the present study, we tested the efficacy of 3,4-DAA in collagen-induced arthritis, a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, and analyzed its mechanism of action.

- **Methods**: Administration of 3,4-DAA after arthritis onset reduced the clinical and histological severity of arthritis and reduced pain. It completely abrogated thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia. 3,4-DAA also suppressed Th1 cell activity in lymph node cell cultures and raised serum levels of IL-10. In vitro, 3,4-DAA suppressed IFN-gamma production and proliferation of both T and B lymphocytes in a manner comparable with the endogenous tryptophan metabolite, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, suggesting similar mechanisms of action.

- **Conclusion**: It is concluded that 3,4-DAA has both anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties and may therefore be useful in filling an unmet need in the treatment of rheumatoid and other forms of arthritis, especially in light of its analgesic properties.

### A randomized trial of intravenous amino acids for kidney protection [^111MLdfp]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study PROTECTION, published by Giovanni Landoni and colleagues in 2024 in the New England Journal of Medicine, focuses on diseases related to cardiac surgery and acute kidney injury. The research question addressed the role of amino acid infusion in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Designed as a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, the study included a population of 3,511 patients (1,057 female and 2,454 male). Eligible participants were adult patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Key exclusion criteria included preoperative treatment or planned treatment with intermittent or continuous renal replacement therapy and Stage IV chronic kidney disease or higher.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 1759 received amino acids through continuous infusion of a balanced mixture [Isopuramin® 10%] at 2 g/kg/day, up to a maximum of 100 g/day, for up to 3 days.
	- n = 1752 received placebo with continuous infusion of Ringer's solution for up to 3 days.

- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease in acute kidney injury was observed (26.9% vs. 31.7%; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.94).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in renal replacement therapy use (1.4% vs. 1.9%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.22).
	- No significant difference in median duration of mechanical ventilation (11 hours vs. 11 hours; MD -0.6, 95% CI -3.7 to 2.49).

### Fatty acid synthase inhibition triggers apoptosis during S phase in human cancer cells [^117RMjvm]. Cancer Research (2003). Low credibility.

C75, an inhibitor of fatty acid synthase (FAS), induces apoptosis in cultured human cancer cells. Its proposed mechanism of action links high levels of malonyl-CoA after FAS inhibition to potential downstream effects, including inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), resulting in fatty acid oxidation inhibition. Recent data show that C75 directly stimulates CPT-1, increasing fatty acid oxidation in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells despite inhibitory concentrations of malonyl-CoA.

In light of these findings, fatty acid metabolism in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells was studied to elucidate the mechanism of action of C75. It was found that:

- **Fatty acid oxidation and synthesis**: In the setting of increased fatty acid oxidation, C75 inhibits fatty acid synthesis.
- **Effects of C273**: C273, a reduced form of C75, is unable to inhibit fatty acid synthesis and is nontoxic to MCF7 cells.
- **Inhibition of phospholipid incorporation**: C75 and 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA), an inhibitor of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, both cause a significant reduction in fatty acid incorporation into phosphatidylcholine, the major membrane phospholipid, within two hours.
- **Decay of labeled lipids**: Pulse chase studies with [(14)C]acetate labeling of membrane lipids show that both C75 and TOFA accelerate the decay of (14)C-labeled lipids from membranes within two hours.
- **Increase in lipid oxidation**: C75 also promotes a 2–3-fold increase in oxidation of membrane lipids within two hours.
- **Apoptosis induction**: Because interference with phospholipid synthesis during the S phase is known to trigger apoptosis in cycling cells, double-labeled terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick end labeling and BrdUrd analysis were performed with both TOFA and C75.

This research underscores the complex interplay between fatty acid metabolism and apoptosis in cancer treatment strategies.

### The current place of aprotinin in the management of bleeding [^112csfm2]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

There is a considerable difference between the mechanism of action of the lysine analogues, tranexamic acid and epsilon-aminocaproic acid, and the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin. Aprotinin acts to inactivate free plasmin, but with little effect on bound plasmin, whereas the lysine analogues are designed to prevent excessive plasmin formation by fitting into plasminogen's lysine-binding site to prevent the binding of plasminogen to fibrin. Aprotinin is associated with a reduction in bleeding and transfusion requirements following major surgery and has a dose-response profile, compared with no dose-response effect in the one study investigating tranexamic acid in cardiac surgical patients. Following its withdrawal in 2007, which is explained in detail in this review, the regulators have now licensed aprotinin for myocardial revascularisation only, which is relatively low-risk for bleeding.

### Orphenadrine citrate [^11781BV7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical pharmacology of orphenadrine citrate reveals that its mode of action has not been clearly identified, but it may be related to its analgesic properties. Additionally, orphenadrine citrate possesses anticholinergic actions.

### Neffy [^113eUa6U]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Epinephrine acts on both alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. Through its action on alpha-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine lessens the vasodilation and increased vascular permeability that occur during anaphylaxis, which can lead to the loss of intravascular fluid volume and hypotension. Through its action on beta-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine causes bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and helps alleviate bronchospasm, wheezing, and dyspnea that may occur during anaphylaxis. Epinephrine alleviates pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema. It may also relieve gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms associated with anaphylaxis because of its relaxer effects on the smooth muscle of the stomach, intestine, uterus, and urinary bladder.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Four clinical pharmacology studies of Neffy in adults and one clinical pharmacology study in pediatric subjects who weigh 30 kg or greater are described below. All doses were administered by study staff unless otherwise stated.

### Aminocaproic acid [^111f51Ns]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Dosage and administration: An identical dosage regimen may be followed by administering aminocaproic acid tablets or aminocaproic acid oral solution as follows. For the treatment of acute bleeding syndromes due to elevated fibrinolytic activity, it is suggested that 5 aminocaproic acid 1000 mg tablets or 10 aminocaproic acid 500 mg tablets (5 g), or 20 milliliters of aminocaproic acid oral solution (5 g), be administered during the first hour of treatment. This should be followed by a continuing rate of 1 aminocaproic acid 1000 mg tablet or 2 aminocaproic acid 500 mg tablets (1 g), or 5 milliliters of aminocaproic acid oral solution (1.25 g) per hour. This method of treatment would ordinarily be continued for about 8 hours or until the bleeding has been controlled.

### Kadcyla [^116nY3pc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Hepatic impairment**: No adjustment to the starting dose is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Kadcyla was not studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Closely monitor patients with hepatic impairment due to known hepatotoxicity observed with Kadcyla [see Warnings and Precautions, Hepatotoxicity (5.1)].

### SPL drug information for valproic acid [^113e97Ee]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of valproic acid administered orally (PO) for the treatment of absence seizures in adults, whether simple or complex, is as follows:

- **Initial dosage**: Start at 15 mg/kg PO daily.
- **Maximum dosage**: 60 mg/kg per day.

### SPL drug information for aminocaproic acid [^117VP4jC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of aminocaproic acid IV for the treatment of fibrinolytic bleeding in adults is 4–5 g IV once.

### Torsemide [^116QDxer]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). High credibility.

**Mechanism of action**: Micropuncture studies in animals have shown that torsemide acts from within the lumen of the thick ascending portion of the loop of Henle, where it inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl–-carrier system. Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed this site of action in humans, and effects in other segments of the nephron have not been demonstrated. Diuretic activity thus correlates better with the rate of drug excretion in the urine than with the concentration in the blood. Torsemide increases the urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, but it does not significantly alter glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or acid-base balance.

### Biomarkers for drug development in propionic and methylmalonic acidemias [^1122ukqf]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Ammonium is a waste product of amino acid catabolism and a potent neurotoxin. Hyperammonemia, which often occurs with episodes of metabolic decompensation in propionic acidemia (PA) or methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), likely results from secondary disruption of substrate balance in other biochemical pathways, including the urea and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycles. Accumulated metabolites, such as propionyl‐CoA and methylmalonyl‐CoA, likely compete with acetyl‐CoA to inhibit the activity of N‐acetylglutamate synthase, thereby diminishing the synthesis of carbamoylphosphate. This secondary impairment of the urea cycle can lead to elevated plasma ammonium levels, with neurotoxic effects during metabolic decompensations. A chronic contributor to hyperammonemia in patients with PA or MMA is the release of ammonia from glutamine to generate glutamic acid in an attempt to replenish alpha‐ketoglutaric acid in the TCA cycle.

Hyperammonemia toxicity in the developing brain is due to multiple mechanisms, including disruption of amino acid and cerebral energy metabolism, and increased oxidative stress. Repeated and frequent episodes of hyperammonemia, alongside metabolic decompensations, can result in impaired growth and intellectual disability, the severity of which increases with longer duration of hyperammonemia. This effect is likely exacerbated by concurrent acidosis.

Hyperammonemia can lead to the identification and diagnosis of PA/MMA, and it might be a useful biomarker to monitor the severity of metabolic crises. However, hyperammonemia is not specific for PA/MMA and is not by itself diagnostic. It is likely also not as useful for monitoring other conditions.

### Metabolism and antiviral activity of ribavirin [^115PEiT9]. Virus Research (2005). Low credibility.

Thirty years after its synthesis, the mechanism of action of ribavirin is still not completely understood. Although much is known about the metabolism and biochemical effects of ribavirin in human cells, there is still much to be learned about its precise mechanism of action with various viruses. New information about its ability to induce mutations in viral genomes has led to new questions about its mechanism of action.

There is considerable evidence that indicates ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) can interact with various viral RNA polymerases, and it seems likely that this interaction is important to the mechanism of action of ribavirin. It seems likely that ribavirin does not have one universal mechanism of action but inhibits different viruses in different ways. In some cases, inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase may be sufficient for antiviral activity, whereas, in other cases, inhibition of viral RNA polymerases by RTP may be more important.

It is also likely that RTP will interact with different viral RNA polymerases in various ways, leading to distinct mechanisms of action. More comprehensive studies are needed to address all aspects of ribavirin metabolism and biochemical actions to gain a thorough understanding of this agent's activity. Finally, the differences in metabolism and biochemical actions of ribavirin, selenazofurin, and tiazofurin indicate that small structural changes can have profound effects on biological activity. This observation is well known by investigators familiar with nucleoside analogs.

### Intravenous tranexamic acid versus topical aminocaproic acid: Which method has the least blood loss and transfusion rates [^111UhQd7]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Blood loss and transfusions in total joint arthroplasty have been revolutionized by the arrival of antifibrinolytics. Before their use, studies had routinely reported transfusion rates of 10% to 24%, with direct and indirect costs up to $1,200. With the addition of these medications, whether topical or intravenous, transfusion rates have decreased and can range from 1% to 10%.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) and epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) belong to the lysine analog class of antifibrinolytic agents. They have similar mechanisms of action, with TXA demonstrating a 6- to 10-fold increased affinity in binding plasminogen compared with EACA. Because of its high affinity, TXA has mostly replaced EACA as the predominant lysine analog used for major orthopaedic procedures.

Few studies have compared different antifibrinolytic types with respect to blood loss and transfusion rates. We sought to compare whether EACA or TXA had the least amount of blood loss and transfusion rates with a control group for comparison. We hypothesized that although there may be a difference in blood loss, there would be no difference with regard to transfusion rates or units of blood given.

All patients will be evaluated at the screening visit followed by baseline, and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months during the study. The baseline visit can be combined with the screening visit or held within 30 days of screening. During each clinic visit, treating physicians will conduct a physical examination and blood tests, and complete a medical history of the patients to collect information on AEs and treatment compliance between the scheduled study visits. Parents or legal guardians of the patients will provide the required information to the treating physician during each clinic visit. The investigators will be asked to use the same laboratory throughout the study period for each individual patient.

- **Figure 1**: The schedule of enrolment, interventions, and assessments. *Indicates only for the key symbol used for the intervention.

All patients will receive a follow-up call 30 ± 7 days after the end of the study to ensure post-treatment safety. Any AEs reported during this period will be noted. In addition to the data collected at each visit, any acute decompensated episodes between scheduled visits will be recorded in a separate section in the electronic case report form (eCRF).

A specialized diet will be chosen for each study participant dependent on their age and residual enzyme activity. All patients will be required to adhere to the low protein diet and the prescribed amino acid supplements. Compliance will be assessed at each visit by a metabolic nutritionist experienced in PA and MMA who is aware of the study protocol.

### Effects of epsilon-aminocaproic acid and aprotinin on leukocyte-platelet adhesion in patients undergoing cardiac surgery [^114HPHm9]. Anesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

The administration of aprotinin during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is hypothesized to decrease the activation of leukocytes and platelets and possibly reduce their adhesion. Although epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) shares the ability of aprotinin to inhibit excessive plasmin activity after CPB, its effect on leukocyte and platelet activation and leukocyte-platelet (heterotypic) adhesion is largely unknown. This study was performed to determine the relative effectiveness of the antifibrinolytics, aprotinin and EACA, at reducing leukocyte and platelet activation and leukocyte-platelet conjugate formation in patients undergoing CPB.

- **Methods**: Thirty-six patients scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery with CPB were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive EACA, aprotinin, or saline (placebo). Markers of plasmin activity (D-dimer concentrations), platelet activation (CD62P), leukocyte activation (CD11b), and leukocyte-platelet adhesion (monocyte- and neutrophil-platelet conjugates) were measured before, during, and after CPB.

- **Results**: Platelet CD62P (P-selectin), monocyte CD11b, and monocyte-platelet conjugates were all significantly increased (compared with baseline) in the saline group during and after CPB. Despite equivalent reductions in D-dimer formation in patients receiving EACA (P < 0.0001) and aprotinin (P < 0.0001), decreases in platelet CD62P and monocyte CD11b expression were incomplete. In contrast, peak monocyte-platelet conjugate formation was significantly reduced by both EACA (P = 0.026) and aprot-

### Zioptan [^115Dy8LY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**:

	- **Mechanism of action**: Tafluprost acid, a prostaglandin analog, is a selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist believed to reduce intraocular pressure by increasing uveoscleral outflow. The exact mechanism of action is unknown at this time.

	- **Pharmacokinetics**:

		- **Absorption**: Following instillation, tafluprost is absorbed through the cornea and is hydrolyzed to the biologically active acid metabolite, tafluprost acid. After instillation of one drop of the 0.0015% solution once daily into each eye of healthy volunteers, the plasma concentrations of tafluprost acid peaked at a median time of 10 minutes on both Days 1 and 8. The mean plasma Cmax of tafluprost acid were 26 pg/mL and 27 pg/mL on Day 1 and Day 8, respectively. The mean plasma AUC estimates of tafluprost acid were 394 pg*min/mL and 432 pg*min/mL on Day 1 and 8, respectively.

		- **Metabolism**: Tafluprost, an ester prodrug, is hydrolyzed to its biologically active acid metabolite in the eye. The acid metabolite is further metabolized via fatty acid β-oxidation and phase II conjugation.

		- **Elimination**: Mean plasma tafluprost acid concentrations were below the limit of quantification of the bioanalytical assay (10 pg/mL) at 30 minutes following topical ocular administration of tafluprost 0.0015% ophthalmic solution.

### Aprotinin but not epsilon-aminocaproic acid decreases interleukin-10 after cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients receiving aprotinin and epsilon-aminocaproic acid [^111EJiMQ]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Extracorporeal circulation induces a systemic inflammatory response, which may adversely affect organ function. One manifestation of this response is increased fibrinolysis. Antifibrinolytic drugs such as aprotinin and epsilon-aminocaproic acid have been effective in reducing fibrinolysis and blood loss after extracorporeal circulation; however, the effects of antifibrinolytic drugs on proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators are not known. This study examined the effects of aprotinin and epsilon-aminocaproic acid on plasma levels of proinflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6) and anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) cytokines during and after extracorporeal circulation.

- **Methods and results**: Seventy-two patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with extracorporeal circulation were randomly assigned in a double-blind study to receive high-dose aprotinin, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, or saline placebo. Plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were measured at five time points before, during, and after extracorporeal circulation. In all three groups, both IL-6 and IL-10 rose significantly after the institution of extracorporeal circulation and remained elevated through the first postoperative day. Compared with saline, aprotinin significantly reduced IL-10 (P = 0.02) and peak IL-6 (P = 0.02) after extracorporeal circulation. In contrast, none of the reductions in IL-6 and IL-10 by epsilon-aminocaproic acid achieved statistical significance. Both aprotinin and epsilon-aminocaproic acid decreased blood loss compared with saline, but there was no significant difference in th

### Vulnerability of mineral-organic associations in the rhizosphere [^114KTPQv]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Can we systematically link MOA characteristics to potential vulnerability? Our proposed vulnerability spectrum strongly suggests that distinct types of MOA have different susceptibilities to specific disruption mechanisms. This observation implies that efforts to study MAOM destabilization in the rhizosphere require pairing conventional quantification of MAOM pools (e.g. by physical fractionation) with a more nuanced analysis of the MOA characteristics that determine potential vulnerability to disruption. Each soil contains a significant diversity of MOA types, with the predominant types varying dramatically by soil ecosystem. Selective dissolution, spectroscopic, and mass spectrometric approaches are increasingly available and high-throughput, making a comprehensive MOA characterization (i.e. mineral type, OM functionality, and their interactions) across soil ecosystems more feasible. At the same time, studies assessing MOA (and, by association, MAOM) vulnerability to specific disruption mechanisms or environmental changes are becoming more common. Combining such detailed information on MOA characteristics and vulnerabilities — as pioneered, for example, by syntheses linking mineralogical data to soil C vulnerability — represents a critical step toward global-scale projections of MOA vulnerability.

Beyond rhizodeposition: what mechanisms disrupt MOAs in the rhizosphere? Our understanding of the potential for MOA disruption in the rhizosphere is limited by the nearly exclusive focus on the effects of simple reactive compounds released by roots or associated microbes.

### Zoledronic acid [^113j6pzC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The principal pharmacologic action of zoledronic acid is the inhibition of bone resorption. Although the antiresorptive mechanism is not completely understood, several factors are thought to contribute to this action. In vitro, zoledronic acid inhibits osteoclastic activity and induces osteoclast apoptosis. Zoledronic acid also blocks the osteoclastic resorption of mineralized bone and cartilage through its binding to bone. Furthermore, zoledronic acid inhibits the increased osteoclastic activity and skeletal calcium release induced by various stimulatory factors released by tumors.

### Postoperatively administered aprotinin or epsilon aminocaproic acid after cardiopulmonary bypass has limited benefit [^115Pw8tq]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Intraoperative antifibrinolytic treatment with aprotinin and epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) has been shown to be effective prophylaxis in the reduction of excessive bleeding after cardiopulmonary bypass operations. This study investigated the effectiveness of both drugs when used as a postoperative treatment for patients showing early signs of increased bleeding.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind, randomized study, 69 patients with chest drainage of 100 mL or more 1 hour after bypass were treated with aprotinin, EACA, or placebo.

- **Results**: In the first 24 hours postoperatively, neither drug significantly reduced chest drainage or blood transfusion requirements compared with placebo. Median (interquartile) cumulative chest drainage volumes for the first 24 hours postoperatively for the aprotinin, EACA, and placebo groups were 525 (340, 750), 575 (450, 762), and 650 (550, 800) mL, respectively. Among the study patients, 4 undergoing valve operation and treated with aprotinin showed a trend toward less bleeding during the first 12 hours postoperatively compared with 5 valve operation patients who received placebo (p = 0.06). Among all patients, the treatment with aprotinin or EACA failed to reduce levels of D-dimer compared with placebo after treatment, indicating that fibrinolysis was not significantly inhibited.

- **Conclusions**: Aprotinin or EACA administered in the early postoperative period was ineffective in reducing postoperative bleeding with the exception of a small group of patients having valve operations, in whom aprotinin treatment may have shown some benefit.

### Dietary long-chain n-3 fatty acids for the prevention of cancer: a review of potential mechanisms [^112VXZQP]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Increasing evidence from animal and in vitro studies indicates that n-3 fatty acids, especially the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, present in fatty fish and fish oils, inhibit carcinogenesis. The epidemiologic data on the association between fish consumption, as a surrogate marker for n-3 fatty acid intake, and cancer risk are, however, somewhat less consistent. This review highlights the potential mechanisms of the anticarcinogenic actions of n-3 fatty acids. Moreover, a possible explanation is provided for why some epidemiologic studies failed to find an association between n-3 fatty acid intake and cancer risk.

Several molecular mechanisms whereby n-3 fatty acids may modify the carcinogenic process have been proposed:

- **Suppression of arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoid biosynthesis**: Influences on the activity of transcription factors, gene expression, and signal transduction pathways.
- **Alteration of estrogen metabolism**: This includes increased or decreased production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species.
- **Mechanisms involving insulin sensitivity and membrane fluidity**.

Further studies are needed to evaluate and verify these mechanisms in humans to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of n-3 fatty acid intake on cancer risk.

### Targeting nucleic acid phase transitions as a mechanism of action for antimicrobial peptides [^114VyuTq]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Most antimicrobial peptides are generally believed to target membranes (Fig. 7 ①), while some peptides can also translocate into cells and target intracellular proteins and nucleic acids (Fig. 7 ②). Although much is known about how AMPs can perturb cell membrane integrity, the mechanisms of action of AMPs interacting with intracellular targets have remained challenging to elucidate. Here, we identify that AMPs share common biophysical properties with biopolymers that undergo phase separation, suggesting that phase separation of a substantial fraction of AMPs is particularly pronounced in the presence of nucleic acids. Indeed, we show that several of these AMPs readily induce compaction and phase separation of nucleic acids in vitro. Moreover, these AMPs interfere with transcription and translation by sequestering nucleic acids. To support this model, we found AMP-rich clusters in *E. coli* that also contained bacterial nucleic acids.

- **Amp-driven compaction/phase separation**: These observations provide evidence of an additional mode of action of DNA/RNA-targeting antimicrobial peptides: AMP-driven compaction/phase separation of nucleic acids (Fig. 7 ③). Other cellular components (e.g. nucleic acid-processing enzymes and RNA-binding proteins) may also partition into these AMP-nucleic acid condensates, further exacerbating the sequestration of important biomolecules required for cell survival.

These findings open exciting possibilities for the development of new antimicrobials via the engineering of AMPs that simultaneously possess high potency to induce nucleic acid compaction/phase separation and display membrane disruption.

### Effectiveness of antiepileptic drug combination therapy for partial-onset seizures based on mechanisms of action [^117SvwfQ]. JAMA Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The study represents the first effort to describe antiepileptic drug (AED) combination therapy patterns according to their mechanism of action (MOA) in a real-world setting. It also evaluates the differences in outcomes by comparing different-MOA combination therapy with same-MOA combination therapy for patients with partial-onset seizures.

- **Objective**: To compare treatment persistence and health care use with AED combinations categorized by MOA in patients with partial-onset seizures.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: The study utilized the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims Database, which contains 96 million covered lives from July 1, 2004, through March 31, 2011. Adults with concomitant use of two different AEDs and a recent partial-onset seizure diagnosis were selected. Antiepileptic drugs were categorized by MOA: sodium channel blockers (SC), gamma-aminobutyric acid analogs (G), synaptic vesicle protein 2A binding (SV2), and multiple mechanisms (M). Patients were assigned a combination category based on their concomitant AED use.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Treatment persistence was measured from the start until the end of AED combination therapy. Health care resource use was assessed during the combination treatment duration. Multivariate analyses evaluated AED discontinuation risk and health care use according to MOA combinations.

- **Results**: The distribution of 8,615 selected patients by combination was as follows: 3.3% for G+G, 7.5% for G+SV2, 8.6% for G+M, 13.9% for SC+SC, 19.0% for G+SC, 21.5% for SC+M, and 26.3% for SC+SV2.

### Treatment of acute intracerebral hemorrhage with epsilon-aminocaproic acid: a pilot study [^112AMzaD]. Neurocritical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Up to 40% of primary intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) expand within the first 24 hours [natural history]. The authors aimed to study the safety and preliminary efficacy of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) in halting ICH enlargement.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with hematoma volumes ranging from 5 to 80 mL were recruited within 12 hours of ICH onset. A total of 5 g EACA was infused during 1 hour and then 1 g/hour for 23 hours. Hematoma volume was compared on baseline and 24–48-hour brain imaging. Consecutive untreated patients underwent the same imaging protocol.

- **Results**: Three of the first five patients treated had hematoma expansion (HE) greater than 33% of their baseline volume. HE occurred in two of the nine untreated patients. The 80% confidence interval for HE in the treated patients was 32–88%. No thrombotic or other serious adverse events were attributed to EACA.

- **Conclusion**: It is unlikely that the rate of HE in patients given EACA within 12 hours of ICH is less than the natural history rate, although this treatment appears to be safe.

### ε-Aminocaproic acid and clinical value in cardiac anesthesia [^1141yQaD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

The primary aim was to compare the "clinical value" of tranexamic acid (TXA) with ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) when used for blood conservation during high-risk cardiac surgery.

- **Design**: Data previously reported by the Blood Conservation Using Antifibrinolytics in a Randomized Trial (BART) study investigators were reanalyzed independently after appropriate statistical adjustment. The authors compared TXA with EACA for important primary and secondary outcomes and applied the "clinical value" equation to this comparison.

- **Setting**: BART, the largest blinded multicenter study on this topic at the time of writing, compared all three commonly used antifibrinolytics head-to-head in a randomized dose-equivalent fashion during high-risk cardiac surgery. Comparisons of TXA with EACA with application of the clinical value equation were not performed specifically by the BART investigators.

- **Participants**: One thousand five hundred fifty patients enrolled in two of the three arms of the BART study were included in the analysis (TXA, n = 770 and EACA, n = 780), with data reported by the investigators in the New England Journal of Medicine.

- **Main results**: The major finding was that there were no significant differences in overall safety and clinically important efficacy between TXA and EACA.

- **Conclusions**: Considering the substantial difference in costs and with the increasing volume of high-risk cardiac surgery, EACA has increased "clinical value" when compared with TXA. EACA should be the antifibrinolytic medication of choice for high-risk cardiac surgery.

Among other possible causes, high anion gap metabolic acidosis can result from several conditions, including metformin-induced lactic acidosis, toluene poisoning, acetaminophen overdose, and alcoholic ketoacidosis. It may also occur due to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, and aspirin overdose. Other causative factors include propylene glycol poisoning, ethylene glycol poisoning, starvation ketosis, multiple myeloma, maple syrup urine disease, lactic acidosis, and methanol poisoning. Furthermore, sepsis, uremia, rhabdomyolysis, cyanide poisoning, isopropyl alcohol poisoning, and pyroglutamic acidosis are known contributors to this condition. Notably, medications such as aspirin can also lead to high anion gap metabolic acidosis.

### Mefenamic acid [^114ntBt6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Mefenamic acid exhibits analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. Its mechanism of action, similar to other NSAIDs, is not fully understood but involves the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes. Mefenamic acid is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro, and concentrations achieved during therapy have demonstrated in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and enhance the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Since prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation, it is suggested that the mode of action of mefenamic acid may involve the reduction of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

Mefenamic acid is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. In two studies involving a single oral dose of 500 mg, the mean extent of absorption was 30.5 mcg/hr/mL with a coefficient of variation of 17%. The bioavailability of the capsule relative to an IV dose or an oral solution has yet to be studied. After a single 1-gram oral dose, reported mean peak plasma levels range from 10 to 20 mcg/mL, achieved within 2 to 4 hours. The elimination half-life is approximately 2 hours. Upon multiple dosing, plasma levels are proportional to the dose with no evidence of drug accumulation. In a study involving normal adult subjects (n = 6) receiving 1-gram doses of mefenamic acid four times daily, steady-state concentrations of 20 mcg/mL were achieved by the second day of administration, consistent with the short half-life.

- **Mechanism of action**: Travoprost free acid, a prostaglandin analog, is a selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist. It is believed to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing uveoscleral outflow. The exact mechanism of action is unknown at this time.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Travoprost, an isopropyl ester prodrug, is hydrolyzed by esterases in the cornea and other intraocular tissues to its biologically active free acid. Systemically, travoprost free acid is metabolized to inactive metabolites via beta-oxidation of the α (carboxylic acid) chain to give the 1,2-dinor and 1,2,3,4-tetranor analogs, via oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl moiety, as well as via reduction of the 13, 14 double bond.

Data from a pharmacokinetic study of 105 subjects evaluating two models of the travoprost intracameral implant with different elution rates have shown that the plasma concentrations of travoprost free acid are below 10 pg/mL (the quantitation limit of the assay, LLOQ) in all subjects at day 10, week 12, and month 12 following administration of Idose TR.

### Targeting nucleic acid phase transitions as a mechanism of action for antimicrobial peptides [^113Z4hLW]. Nature Communications (2023). Low credibility.

The overuse of antibiotics in both medicine and the food industries has led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains, which have become one of the major threats to human health, affecting millions worldwide. This situation has given rise to sustained efforts to find alternative solutions for combating bacterial infections. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising alternative to conventional small molecule drugs, as they have a broad range of antimicrobial activity and can target both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi.

AMPs are typically 10–25 amino acids long and carry a net positive charge. While it is generally thought that AMPs primarily target cell membranes via distinct mechanisms, many AMPs can cross the bacterial membrane without altering its integrity and interact with cytosolic targets such as proteins and nucleic acids. Most cell-penetrating AMPs are highly charged, with inclusions of hydrophobic residues.

- **Mechanism of action**: The mechanism of action that underpins the antimicrobial activity of cell-penetrating AMPs is incompletely known, but specific patterns in sequence space that promote such activity are emerging. For example, arginine-rich AMPs are more prone to penetrate cell membranes compared with lysine-rich equivalents. Moreover, peptides with a propensity to form alpha-helical structures upon binding to the membrane appear to be more cell penetrating compared to those displaying disordered conformations. Similarly, cyclic AMPs are commonly more potent membrane penetrators compared to linear peptides.

### Cyklokapron [^111mB93D]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative that diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers and thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure.

- **Mechanism of action**: The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 μmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 μmol/L). The high-affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high-affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL, prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours. Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time, or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects.

### Antifibrinolytics in orthotopic liver transplantation: Current status and controversies [^116qNTVk]. Liver Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

This article reviews the status and controversies of the three commonly used antifibrinolytics: epsilon-aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, and aprotinin, during liver transplantation. There is no general consensus on how, when, or which antifibrinolytics should be used in liver transplantation. Although these drugs appear to reduce blood loss and decrease transfusion requirements during liver transplantation, their use is not uniformly supported in clinical trials. Aprotinin has been studied more extensively in clinical trials and appears to offer more advantages compared to the other two antifibrinolytics. Because of the diverse population of liver transplant recipients and the potential adverse effects of antifibrinolytics, especially life-threatening thromboembolism, careful patient selection and close monitoring are prudent. Further studies addressing the risks and benefits of antifibrinolytics in the setting of liver transplantation are warranted.

### N-lactoyl amino acids: Emerging biomarkers in metabolism and disease [^116cmGV8]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

The human metabolome is a vast and complex landscape, encompassing a multitude of metabolic pathways and interactions that are not yet fully understood. These interactions and pathways are constantly adapting and evolving in response to both internal and external stimuli. N-lactoyl-amino acids (Lac-AA), a class of metabolites formed by enzymatic conjugation of lactate to an amino acid via a peptide bond, have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their pervasive presence in mammalian systems and their potential implications for various biological processes. Their increasing recognition in recent research underscores their potential roles in metabolism and disease mechanisms. Lac-AA demonstrate a strong positive correlation with one another, suggesting that they act as a cohesive family. N-lactoyl-phenylalanine (Lac-Phe), a conjugate of lactate and phenylalanine, is the most abundant and representative member of the Lac-AA family.

In earlier metabolomic studies, Lac-AA have been reported as unknown compounds with X-identification numbers (ID) or misannotated as 1-carboxyethyl modified amino acids. Therefore, they are often overlooked or incorrectly interpreted in the context of metabolic pathways and disease associations. Recent advancements in metabolomic techniques and improved annotation methods have shed light on the true identity of these compounds. Leading metabolomics companies have now confirmed that the metabolites previously identified as 1-carboxyethyl modified amino acids are, in fact, N-lactoyl modified amino acids.

### Emerging mechanisms of cardiovascular protection for the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid [^114CKuqr]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Omega-3 fatty acids**: These include eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which have multiple biological effects. In the REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial), a prescription EPA-only formulation called icosapent ethyl reduced cardiovascular events by 25% in high-risk patients with either established cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus plus other risk factors.

- **Cardiovascular outcomes trials**: Trials that have evaluated mixed (DHA-containing) omega-3 fatty acids alongside contemporary medical therapy have not shown the benefits of icosapent ethyl observed in REDUCE-IT and the JELIS (Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study). This highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms of action of specific omega-3 fatty acids.

- **Differentiation of EPA and DHA**: EPA and DHA differ markedly, affecting membrane structure, rates of lipid oxidation, inflammatory biomarkers, and endothelial function, as well as tissue distributions. Ongoing scientific efforts to understand the mechanism of action for EPA will help usher in a new era of cardiovascular therapeutics.

### Evaluation of long-term effectiveness of the use of carglumic acid in patients with propionic acidemia (PA) or methylmalonic acidemia (MMA): Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^116xRNuT]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The study is approved by the IRB at the two participating centers: King Abdulaziz Medical City, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center IRB (RC13/116), and King Fahad Medical City IRB (14–165). The trial has been reviewed and approved by the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) (33066) and is registered under the identifier NCT02426775. The study will be conducted in accordance with the laws and regulations of Saudi Arabia and in line with the ICH harmonized tripartite guidelines for Good Clinical Practice 1996 and the Declaration of Helsinki.

- **Study outcomes**: The primary efficacy outcome is the number of ER visits due to hyperammonemia above the age-dependent reference range during the study period. Secondary efficacy outcomes include time to first ER visit due to hyperammonemia after treatment initiation, plasma ammonia levels, biochemical markers (acylcarnitine profile, urine organic acid, and plasma amino acid levels) during the study, and the number of hospitalization days during the 2-year study period.

- **Safety assessment**: Safety will be assessed by monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs during regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs, and physical and neurological examinations.

### The role of dissociation in ketamine's antidepressant effects [^111imQXP]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

An initial summary of ketamine's proposed mechanism of action is necessary prior to exploring larger issues of its dissociative versus antidepressant effects. One hypothesis is that of NMDAR disinhibition. This theory postulates that the antidepressant response to ketamine is initiated by the selective blockade of NMDARs on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibitory interneurons. This, in turn, decreases interneuronal activity, which leads to disinhibition of pyramidal neurons and enhanced glutamatergic firing (a "glutamate burst"). These processes then produce α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) activation, enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release, tropomyosin receptor kinase B receptor activation, and subsequent promotion of protein synthesis via activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 of NMDARs.

Another theory gaining increased support is that ketamine blocks synaptic NMDARs involved in spontaneous synaptic transmission, which deactivates calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase. This results in dephosphorylation of eukaryotic eEF2 and the subsequent de-suppression of BDNF protein synthesis in the hippocampus. This signaling pathway then potentiates synaptic AMPAR responses, resulting in antidepressant efficacy.

Other theories for ketamine's mechanism of action have been offered, but all propose changes in synaptic plasticity that lead to strengthening of excitatory synapses and share several characteristics and molecular mechanisms with well-established pathways.

### Aminocaproic acid [^111J1Cx5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

The fibrinolysis-inhibitory effects of aminocaproic acid appear to be exerted principally via inhibition of plasminogen activators and to a lesser degree through antiplasmin activity.

In adults, oral absorption appears to be a zero-order process with an absorption rate of 5.2 g/hr. The mean lag time in absorption is 10 minutes. After a single oral dose of 5 g, absorption was complete (F = 1). Mean ± SD peak plasma concentrations (164 ± 28 mcg/mL) were reached within 1.2 ± 0.45 hours.

After oral administration, the apparent volume of distribution was estimated to be 23.1 ± 6.6 L (mean ± SD). Correspondingly, the volume of distribution after intravenous administration has been reported to be 30.0 ± 8.2 L. After prolonged administration, aminocaproic acid has been found to distribute throughout extravascular and intravascular compartments of the body, penetrating human red blood cells as well as other tissue cells.

Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination, whether aminocaproic acid is administered orally or intravenously. Sixty-five percent of the dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug and 11% of the dose appears as the metabolite adipic acid. Renal clearance (116 mL/min) approximates endogenous creatinine clearance. The total body clearance is 169 mL/min. The terminal elimination half-life for aminocaproic acid is approximately 2 hours.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^111ZxLF8]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis and timely treatment are essential to improve survival and reduce morbidity in MMA and PA patients. Over time, survival of these patients has improved. Improved survival seems to be due to enhanced treatment strategies and patient monitoring. The effect of single treatment variables on survival, however, is not clear from the present evidence. In MMA patients, survival also depends on age of onset and disease subtype; early-onset MMA patients, particularly mut 0 and cblB patients, have a higher mortality risk.

As soon as the diagnosis of MMA and PA is suspected, specific therapies should be initiated, and the patient should be referred to a specialist centre, as some treatments and specialist knowledge are only available there. Intensive care treatment of patients with metabolic decompensation can be necessary if there is severe metabolic acidosis, with or without hyperammonaemia and hyperlactataemia. The specifics of these acute treatment modalities, including extracorporeal detoxification, have not been systematically studied yet, and the contribution of individual treatments to improved survival over the last decades is unclear.

The panel has intensively discussed the available evidence and has developed principles based on expert opinions on how to approach treatment of an (imminent) acute metabolic decompensation in MMA and PA patients (Figure 3). It seems appropriate to advise against the primary use of sodium phenylbutyrate as an ammonia scavenger in MMA and PA, as it can lead to detrimental effects.

### Antifibrinolytics (lysine analogues) for the prevention of bleeding in people with haematological disorders [^116fy2xH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

People with haematological disorders are frequently at risk of severe or life-threatening bleeding due to thrombocytopenia (a reduced platelet count). This risk persists despite the routine use of prophylactic platelet transfusions once the platelet count falls below a certain threshold. Platelet transfusions are not devoid of risk, and adverse events can be life-threatening. A potential adjunct to these transfusions is the use of antifibrinolytics, specifically the lysine analogues tranexamic acid (TXA) and epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA). This document updates a Cochrane review first published in 2013.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and safety of antifibrinolytics (lysine analogues) in preventing bleeding in people with haematological disorders.

- **Search methods**: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950), and ongoing trial databases up to 7 March 2016.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs involving participants with haematological disorders who would routinely require prophylactic platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding. Trials involving the use of the lysine analogues TXA and EACA were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened all electronically-derived citations and abstracts of papers identified by the review search strategy for relevancy. Two review authors independently conducted the assessment of relevancy.

### Gamma-aminobutyric acid neuropharmacological investigations on narcosis produced by nitrogen, argon, or nitrous oxide [^116oiTz8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). High credibility.

Inhaled anesthetics, including the gaseous anesthetics nitrous oxide and xenon, are thought to act by interacting directly with ion-channel receptors. In contrast, little is known about the mechanism of action of inert gases that show only narcotic potency at high pressures, such as nitrogen or argon. In this study, we investigated the effects of selective gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonists on narcosis produced by nitrogen, argon, and nitrous oxide.

Pretreatment with the competitive GABA(A) receptor antagonist gabazine (0.2 nmol), but not the GABA(B) receptor antagonist 2-hydroxysaclofen (10 nmol), increased the nitrogen and argon threshold pressure for loss-of-righting-reflex (P < 0.005), but it had no effect on nitrous oxide narcosis. Pretreatment with the GABA(A) benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (5 nmol) also increased the narcosis threshold pressure of argon (P < 0.025). Given that neither 2-hydroxysaclofen, gabazine, nor flumazenil at the doses used induced hyperexcitability, our results support a selective antagonism by gabazine and flumazenil of the narcotic action of nitrogen and argon. Some mechanisms of nitrogen and argon narcotic action might be similar to those of clinical inhaled anesthetics.

- **Implications**: We studied the effects in the rat of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonists on narcosis induced by nitrogen and argon that act only at high pressures. Our results show that the GABA(A) receptor may play a significant role, suggesting that some mechanisms might be similar to those of clinical inhaled anesthetics.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116BpV9H]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

It is noteworthy to highlight that bempedoic acid (BA) was associated with an approximately 30% lower incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus compared with standard treatment. Although this needs confirmation in further studies, the finding is supported from a pathophysiological perspective by the mechanism of action of BA. By inhibiting adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase, BA not only suppresses cholesterol synthesis but also triggers the upregulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor expression in the liver, thereby modifying fatty acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis.

BA, by activating AMP-activated protein kinase, leads to inhibitory phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which, in turn, inhibits sterol and fatty acid synthesis, increases mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation, and improves glucose metabolism. This suggests a potential ancillary effect of BA in patients with atherogenic hypercholesterolemia.

- **Differences in study population characteristics**
- Three studies enrolled patients with high cardiovascular risk and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia receiving stable doses of maximally tolerated statin therapy alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies.
- Two studies enrolled patients with statin intolerance receiving no statin, low-dose statin, or maximally tolerated statin therapy.
- Two studies enrolled patients with hypercholesterolemia on maximally tolerated statin therapy.

### Forteo [^111ZnVGM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Endogenous 84-amino acid parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. Physiological actions of PTH include regulation of bone metabolism, renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, and intestinal calcium absorption. The biological actions of PTH and teriparatide are mediated through binding to specific high-affinity cell-surface receptors. Teriparatide and the 34 N-terminal amino acids of PTH bind to these receptors with the same affinity and have the same physiological actions on bone and kidney. Teriparatide is not expected to accumulate in bone or other tissues.

The skeletal effects of teriparatide depend upon the pattern of systemic exposure. Once-daily administration of teriparatide stimulates new bone formation on trabecular and cortical (periosteal and/or endosteal) bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic activity over osteoclastic activity. In monkey studies, teriparatide improved trabecular microarchitecture and increased bone mass and strength by stimulating new bone formation in both cancellous and cortical bone. In humans, the anabolic effects of teriparatide manifest as an increase in skeletal mass, an increase in markers of bone formation and resorption, and an increase in bone strength. By contrast, continuous excess of endogenous PTH, as occurs in hyperparathyroidism, may be detrimental to the skeleton because bone resorption may be stimulated more than bone formation.

### The role of Amicar in same-day anterior and posterior spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis [^115XdeQ8]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of Amicar (epsilon aminocaproic acid) in decreasing perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements in same-day anterior (ASF) and posterior spinal fusion (PSF) with segmental spinal instrumentation (SSI) for idiopathic scoliosis.

- **Background data**: Preliminary prospective and randomized double-blind studies, including fibrinogen studies, have demonstrated Amicar to be effective in decreasing perioperative blood loss in patients with idiopathic scoliosis undergoing PSF with SSI. Increased fibrinogen secretion is a possible explanation.

- **Methods**: Seventy-three consecutive patients were divided into three study groups based on the administration of Amicar: Group 1 (n = 16), no Amicar; Group 2 (n = 18), Amicar for the PSF with SSI only; and Group 3 (n = 39), Amicar for both ASF and PSF with SSI. All patients were managed using the same general anesthesia technique, intraoperative procedure, postoperative care path, and indications for transfusion (hemoglobin < 7 g/dL). Total perioperative blood loss (estimated intraoperative blood loss for both procedures and measured postoperative chest tube and PSF wound suction drainage) and total transfusion requirements between groups were compared using one-way ANOVA.

- **Results**: Statistically significant decreases in mean estimated intraoperative PSF with SSI, total perioperative blood loss, and transfusion requirements were observed in the two Amicar groups. However, Amicar had no significant effect on estimated intraoperative ASF blood loss.

### Treatment of actinic keratosis through inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2: Potential mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium 3% in hyaluronic acid 2.5 [^117WvisE]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Another COX inhibitor that has been used for the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK) is piroxicam, an enolic benzothiazine and potent member of the oxicam series. It has been demonstrated to exert a significant antitumorigenic effect. Piroxicam is a nonspecific COX‐1 and COX‐2 inhibitor, with a 10-fold higher inhibitory activity for COX‐1, which inhibits the early stages of skin carcinogenesis. The mechanism of action of piroxicam includes the downregulation of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, and the inhibition of polyamine production by blocking ornithine decarboxylase induction, which is involved in nonmelanoma skin carcinogenesis. In addition, piroxicam is able to induce tumor cell apoptosis and suppress metalloproteinase 2 activities.

Diclofenac also appears to have multiple mechanisms of action besides its established inhibition of COX. Several putative effects have been described such as the inhibition of leukotriene synthesis and phospholipase A2, modulation of free arachidonic acid levels, and stimulation of peripheral nitric oxide cyclic guanosine monophosphate‐potassium channel pathways, along with centrally mediated and neuropathic effects (elevated plasma β‐endorphin levels and N‐methyl‐D-aspartate pathway inhibition). Emerging mechanisms of action include inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor‐γ, and reduction of levels of inflammatory mediators like substance P and interleukin‐6 in the plasma and synovial fluid.

### Annular scaly plaques with peripheral pustules [^111S9zLN]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: What is the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab?
	- A. Inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor
	- B. Inhibits dihydrofolic acid through competing with para-aminobenzoic acid for the binding site of dihydropteroate synthetase
	- C. Inhibits checkpoint cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4
	- D. Inhibits programmed cell death protein
	- E. Inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin

- **Answers**:
	- A. Inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor – Incorrect. This includes medications such as erlotinib and cetuximab.
	- B. Inhibits dihydrofolic acid through competing with para-aminobenzoic acid for the binding site of dihydropteroate synthetase – Incorrect. This is the mechanism of action of dapsone, a possible treatment for SPD.
	- C. Inhibits checkpoint cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 – Incorrect. This is the mechanism of action of ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4, resulting in a heightened immune response to tumor cells.
	- D. Inhibits programmed cell death protein – Correct. Pembrolizumab, along with nivolumab, is a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for metastatic melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and various solid organ cancers.
	- E. Inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin – Incorrect. This class of medications includes sirolimus and everolimus. These have been used for the treatment of certain solid organ cancers and antirejection mechanisms in solid organ transplant recipients.

### Zelsuvmi [^1171Ygwd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**:
	- **Mechanism of action**: ZELSUVMI is a nitric oxide releasing agent. The mechanism of action for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum is unknown.
	- **Pharmacodynamics**: The pharmacodynamics of ZELSUVMI are unknown.
	- **Pharmacokinetics**: Plasma hydrolyzed MAP3 (hMAP3), a structural marker for berdazimer, and nitrate levels were evaluated in n = 34 subjects aged 2 to 12 years with molluscum contagiosum (MC). Subjects applied ZELSUVMI once daily for two weeks to a total treatment area of 484 cm² (mean lesion count = 34), applying a mean dose of approximately 3 mL/day. No subjects had quantifiable plasma hMAP3 concentrations on day 1; two subjects had quantifiable concentrations on day 15. Mean plasma nitrate levels were similar on days 1 and 15 and remained relatively flat during the pharmacokinetic sampling period (baseline through 1, 3, and 6 hours post-application).

There were no apparent differences in methemoglobin levels throughout the study.

### Antifibrinolytics (lysine analogues) for the prevention of bleeding in patients with haematological disorders [^113tCP2f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with haematological disorders are frequently at risk of severe or life-threatening bleeding as a result of thrombocytopenia. This is despite the routine use of prophylactic platelet transfusions (PlTx) to prevent bleeding once the platelet count falls below a certain threshold. PlTx are not without risk, and adverse events may be life-threatening. A possible adjunct to prophylactic PlTx is the use of antifibrinolytics, specifically the lysine analogues tranexamic acid (TXA) and epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA).

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and safety of antifibrinolytics (lysine analogues) in preventing bleeding in patients with haematological disorders.

- **Search methods**: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 12, 2012), MEDLINE (1948 to 10 January 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 10 January 2013), CINAHL (1982 to 10 January 2013), PubMed (e-publications only), and the Transfusion Evidence Library (1980 to January 2013). We also searched several international and ongoing trial databases up to 10 January 2013 and citation-tracked relevant reference lists.

### Aminocaproic acid [^111A9vfT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Aminocaproic acid is useful in enhancing hemostasis when fibrinolysis contributes to bleeding. In life-threatening situations, transfusion of appropriate blood products and other emergency measures may be required.

- **Surgical and hematological implications**: Fibrinolytic bleeding may frequently be associated with surgical complications following heart surgery (with or without cardiac bypass procedures) and portacaval shunt. It is also linked to hematological disorders such as amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (accompanying aplastic anemia), acute and life-threatening abruptio placentae, hepatic cirrhosis, and neoplastic diseases such as carcinoma of the prostate, lung, stomach, and cervix.

- **Urinary fibrinolysis**: Urinary fibrinolysis, usually a normal physiological phenomenon, may contribute to excessive urinary tract fibrinolytic bleeding associated with surgical hematuria (following prostatectomy and nephrectomy) or nonsurgical hematuria (accompanying polycystic or neoplastic diseases of the genitourinary system) [see Warnings].

### Aminocaproic acid [^115dZFhU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Aminocaproic acid inhibits both the action of plasminogen activators and, to a lesser degree, plasmin activity. The drug should not be administered without a definite diagnosis and/or laboratory finding indicative of hyperfibrinolysis (hyperplasminemia).

Rapid intravenous administration of the drug should be avoided since this may induce hypotension, bradycardia, and/or arrhythmia.

Inhibition of fibrinolysis by aminocaproic acid may theoretically result in clotting or thrombosis. However, there is no definite evidence that administration of aminocaproic acid has been responsible for the few reported cases of intravascular clotting that followed this treatment. Rather, it appears that such intravascular clotting was most likely due to the patient's preexisting clinical condition, such as the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). It has been postulated that extravascular clots formed in vivo may not undergo spontaneous lysis as do normal clots.

Reports have appeared in the literature of an increased incidence of certain neurological deficits, such as hydrocephalus, cerebral ischemia, or cerebral vasospasm, associated with the use of antifibrinolytic agents in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). All of these events have also been described as part of the natural course of SAH or as a consequence of diagnostic procedures such as angiography. Drug relatedness remains unclear.

Thrombophlebitis, a possibility with all intravenous therapy, should be guarded against by strict attention to the proper insertion of the needle and the fixing of its position.
