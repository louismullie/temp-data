## Question

What is neurogenic Claudication

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the definition and explanation of neurogenic claudication, including its pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnostic approach, and treatment options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and synonyms. Then, I should verify the underlying pathophysiology and the mechanical versus ischemic components. Next, I will review the classic clinical phenotype and how it differs from vascular claudication. After that, I need to check the diagnostic strategy, including history, examination, imaging, and when to use epidural testing. Finally, I will examine treatment options across the conservative-to-surgical spectrum and synthesize a concise, clinically useful definition anchored in guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the core definition so I don't overstate anything. Neurogenic claudication is the hallmark symptom complex of lumbar spinal stenosis, characterized by leg pain, heaviness, numbness, tingling, or weakness that is provoked by standing or walking and relieved by sitting or lumbar flexion; it is also called intermittent neurogenic claudication or pseudoclaudication, and it reflects a neurogenic rather than vascular mechanism of exertional leg symptoms [^115tj6Js] [^114dCzf4].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before I jump ahead. The symptoms arise from two interacting mechanisms: mechanical compression of the cauda equina and nerve roots during spinal extension, and ischemia from compromised arterial supply and venous congestion of neural elements. Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy often contributes substantially to central canal narrowing, and symptoms improve with flexion because it increases canal diameter and reduces neural ischemia, which explains the classic "shopping cart sign" [^117KBb3y] [^11177gSD] [^114dCzf4].

> I should confirm the clinical phenotype next. Patients typically report bilateral buttock or leg symptoms that begin after a predictable walking distance, worsen with downhill walking or prolonged standing, and rapidly abate with sitting or forward flexion. The distribution is often non-dermatomal, and the physical examination may be surprisingly normal at rest, which helps distinguish this from a focal radiculopathy. Importantly, pedal pulses are usually normal, unlike vascular claudication [^1158Xt5D] [^114hSbmp] [^114dCzf4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis without anchoring it to likelihoods. The most useful historical discriminators that increase the likelihood of the LSS syndrome include no pain when seated, improvement with bending forward, bilateral buttock or leg pain, and the presence of neurogenic claudication itself; a composite score of history and examination findings can meaningfully shift pretest probability, and absence of pain triggered by standing alone is highly sensitive for ruling out neurogenic claudication in favor of vascular etiologies [^114hSbmp] [^114dCzf4].

> I need to check the imaging strategy and avoid overcalling stenosis. MRI is the preferred modality to confirm anatomic stenosis and to plan interventions, but severity on imaging correlates poorly with symptoms and cannot reliably predict outcomes; dynamic imaging with upright or hyperlordotic positioning and flexion–extension radiographs can unmask instability or dynamic stenosis, and guidelines emphasize integrating imaging with a compatible history rather than relying on imaging alone [^111jnhTr] [^115VUF2H] [^1115HV1s].

> But wait, what if the diagnosis remains uncertain after history and imaging. In selected cases, a positive response to an intralaminar epidural injection of local anesthetic with or without steroid can support the diagnosis and may provide short-term relief; however, evidence for long-term benefit is mixed and modest at best, so this should be framed as diagnostic support and short-term therapy rather than disease-modifying treatment [^114dCzf4] [^114T2iZM].

> Next, I should review conservative management and be careful not to overstate benefits. Initial care should be multimodal and nonpharmacologic, including education, activity modification, and structured exercise emphasizing lumbar flexion, trunk stabilization, and aerobic conditioning. Guidelines also suggest trials of manual therapy or acupuncture, and they advise against routine pharmacotherapy such as NSAIDs, gabapentinoids, or opioids given limited benefit and potential harms. Walking aids like canes have not shown consistent benefit for walking tolerance or posture in NC, so I should not overpromise on assistive devices [^115S6J2T] [^111qWJP1] [^1176W7Pv] [^112ntDiK] [^1152U6T8].

> Let me consider interventional options and verify the strength of evidence. Epidural steroid injections can offer short-term improvement in pain and function for some patients, but benefits beyond a few weeks to months are uncertain; percutaneous lumbar decompression (MILD) has randomized data showing superiority to epidural steroids at 6 to 12 months in carefully selected patients with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, with favorable safety profiles; interspinous process devices can improve symptoms compared with nonoperative care in some trials but have higher reoperation rates than conventional decompression, so shared decision-making is essential [^114T2iZM] [^114P19AR] [^114vJujS] [^117Fxrhu] [^113JqgVZ].

> I should double-check surgical indications and expected outcomes. Decompressive laminectomy without fusion remains the reference standard for persistent, function-limiting neurogenic claudication after a trial of conservative therapy, with randomized and observational data showing faster and greater improvements in pain and function than nonoperative care, though benefits may attenuate over longer horizons; absolute indications include progressive motor deficits or cauda equina syndrome, and patient factors such as depression, comorbidities limiting walking, and smoking portend worse outcomes [^116644bp] [^111yJXC1] [^115vdUJ2].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Neurogenic claudication is a posture-dependent symptom complex caused by lumbar spinal stenosis, driven by mechanical compression and ischemia of the cauda equina, classically provoked by standing or walking and relieved by sitting or flexion. Diagnosis relies on a compatible history plus imaging that explains the syndrome, with dynamic studies and, when needed, epidural testing refining the picture. Management spans education and flexion-based exercise, carefully selected injections, minimally invasive decompression, and, for refractory cases, open decompression, with expectations tailored to the modest and sometimes transient benefits of nonoperative care and the faster but risk-bearing improvements achievable with surgery [^114dCzf4] [^111jnhTr] [^115S6J2T] [^111yJXC1].

Neurogenic claudication is a symptom complex caused by **lumbar spinal stenosis** [^113S6CLD], characterized by **leg pain, heaviness, or weakness** that is provoked by walking or standing and relieved by sitting or forward flexion [^114dCzf4]. It results from **mechanical compression and ischemia** of the cauda equina or nerve roots, worsened by spinal extension and improved by flexion [^11177gSD]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by MRI or CT [^114ADo8K], and must be differentiated from vascular claudication [^1122AtEq]. First-line management is **conservative care** (exercise, physical therapy, epidural steroids) [^115S6J2T]; surgery (decompression) is reserved for refractory cases or neurologic compromise [^113S6CLD].

---

## Pathophysiology

Neurogenic claudication arises from **lumbar spinal stenosis** — narrowing of the central canal, lateral recesses, or foramina — compressing the cauda equina or nerve roots [^114dCzf4]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Mechanical compression**: Extension reduces canal diameter and increases compression; flexion increases it and relieves symptoms [^11177gSD].
- **Ischemia**: Compression impairs perfusion, causing ischemic pain with activity [^117KBb3y].
- **Venous congestion**: Reduced venous outflow contributes to ischemia and edema [^11177gSD].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

- **Pain**: Bilateral buttock/leg pain, heaviness, or cramping; often non-dermatomal [^114hSbmp].
- **Posture dependence**: Worse with standing/walking; better with sitting or forward flexion ("shopping cart sign") [^114dCzf4].
- **Neurologic symptoms**: Numbness, tingling, or weakness, usually bilateral [^114dCzf4].
- **Gait changes**: Wide-based gait, reduced speed, and shorter strides [^114hSbmp].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by imaging and exclusion of vascular causes:

- **History and examination**: Look for posture-dependent leg symptoms, normal peripheral pulses, and a positive "shopping cart sign" [^114hSbmp].
- **Imaging**: MRI is the gold standard to confirm stenosis and guide intervention [^notfound]; CT is an alternative when MRI is contraindicated [^notfound].
- **Differentiation**: Distinguish from vascular claudication (abnormal pulses, calf pain relieved by standing) [^114dCzf4].

---

## Treatment options

Management spans **conservative to surgical** care:

| **Treatment modality** | **Description** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Conservative management | - Exercise therapy <br/> - Physical therapy <br/> - Epidural steroid injections <br/> - Medications (NSAIDs, gabapentinoids) | Moderate [^115S6J2T] [^113St8ca] |
| Minimally invasive procedures | - MILD (minimally invasive lumbar decompression) <br/> - Interspinous process spacers | Moderate [^114vJujS] [^117Fxrhu] |
| Surgical decompression | - Laminectomy <br/> - Foraminotomy <br/> - Fusion (if instability) | High [^111yJXC1] [^116644bp] |

---

Conservative care is **first-line** [^115S6J2T]; surgery is reserved for persistent symptoms or neurologic compromise [^113S6CLD].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies: many patients have **stable symptoms** with conservative care, while others progress and require surgery [^115pRykS]. Surgical decompression generally improves pain and function, but some patients have residual symptoms or require reoperation [^116644bp].

---

Neurogenic claudication is a **posture-dependent symptom complex** from lumbar spinal stenosis, with leg symptoms provoked by standing/walking and relieved by sitting/flexion [^114hSbmp]. Management is **stepwise**, from conservative therapy to surgery for refractory or neurologically significant disease [^115S6J2T].

Objectives

The overall objectives are
to narratively synthesise the existing evidence on exercise intervention components from randomised controlled trials that aim to improve outcomes of symptom severity, disability and walking in people with lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication;
to tabulate the various exercise intervention components of the included trials;
to explore which exercise intervention components may be associated with a successful outcome (i.e. a significant difference in favour of exercise intervention) or unsuccessful outcome (i.e. no significant between-group difference, or significant difference in favour of non-exercise intervention).

Introduction

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) was first described by Sachs and Frankel more than a century ago in work that was published in 1900; however, the clinical description of LSS was not defined until 1954 by Dutch neurosurgeon Henk Verbiest. Soon thereafter, LSS was recognized as a clinical entity contributing to physical impairment. Later on, Porter and colleagues correlated back pain and weakness to narrowing of the spinal canal. Currently, the US Social Security Act recognizes spinal stenosis as a disabling condition. The regulation is written specifically for LSS and states that it results "in pseudoclaudication, established by findings on appropriate medically acceptable imaging, manifested by chronic nonradicular pain and weakness, and resulting in inability to ambulate effectively".

Degenerative LSS is a progressive condition, and it may persist for decades without any symptoms. Case reports from the 1970s and 1980s demonstrated successful surgical treatments based on subjective assessment by surgeons. In the early 1990s, Johnsson, Rosén, and Udén followed 32 untreated patients with spinal stenosis with mean patient age of 60 years for a mean period of 49 months and described the natural course of LSS, prognosis, and treatment. Based on the study, no significant change in symptoms was reported in the majority of patients (70%), and 15% of patients exhibited some deterioration. Concluding that observation is a reasonable treatment for LSS, the investigators found that significant neurologic deterioration is rare.

The first successful spinal fusion surgery was performed in 1911 for prevention of progressive deformity secondary to Pott's disease, that is, tuberculosis of the spine. That was the beginning of understanding of spinal biomechanics and fixation devices for the spinal surgery armamentarium. Despite the sophisticated developments, the incidence of residual or recurrent postoperative back pain remains high. Surgery targets the symptom of pain rather than its root cause and does not retard disc degeneration or stimulate disc regeneration. In contrast, it increases the disc degeneration at adjacent segments. The literature to date has focused primarily on various surgical treatments, although nonsurgical treatments such as epidural steroid injections are commonly considered options based on the clinical presentation of symptomatic LSS. The efficacy of the surgical intervention in the long term has been challenged, and the procedures are linked to increased risks of morbidity, especially in an elderly population. Also, surgical procedures are found to have a larger financial burden, where the costs are estimated to exceed $100 billion per year due to reduced productivity.

Physical Exam Findings in Spinal Stenosis

The physical examination, according to Thomas et al. from 2003, should start with simple observation, beginning with your differential diagnosis in mind. A detailed history and examination are typically distinct from that of a herniated disc. Patients with LSS will most typically have a kyphotic standing posture to minimize symptoms, which is not seen in patients with a herniated disc. This kyphotic standing posture is a result of straightening or reversal of the normal lumbar lordotic curvatures. It occurs when lumbar flexion increases the cross-sectional area of the intervertebral foramen, vertebral canal, and lateral recess.

One of the most important disease states to differentiate is between neurogenic and vascular claudication. Patients with spinal stenosis typically will report pain that is improved with flexion, sitting, or leaning forward. The pain is triggered by standing or extension of the spine and walking. Typically, the pain is above the knees, and walking down stairs is worse than walking up. A patient with vascular claudication will typically have symptoms that are exacerbated by walking but are relieved by standing. Patient symptoms are typically in the calf and lower legs. Evaluation of pedal pulses should be evaluated, as the symptoms of neurogenic vs vascular claudication can be similar, and both disease processes may be present in the same patient. Therefore, a vascular-focused physical examination including peripheral pulses should be performed on each patient with a suspected presentation of spinal stenosis.

### Exercise treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and intervention component analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111qWJP1]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyse the components used in exercise interventions for people with symptoms of neurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis and identify components associated with successful interventions.

Data Sources

Eligible papers published up to April 2023 from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and trial registry websites.

Review Methods

Literature searches were performed by an Information Specialist. We searched for randomised trials evaluating exercise interventions for people with neurogenic claudication symptoms (the primary symptom of lumbar spinal stenosis). Two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, and quality assessments using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool Version 2 and the TIDieR checklist for intervention reporting. Details of intervention components were extracted, tabulated, and synthesised using an intervention component analysis approach.

Results

We found thirteen trials reporting 23 exercise interventions delivered to 1440 participants. These featured 60 different components. Most exercise interventions included supervision and flexion-based exercises. Balance exercises were rarely included. Exercise components featured more frequently in successful interventions included stretches, strength or trunk muscle exercises, fitness exercises, especially cycling, and psychologically informed approaches. Interpretation is limited by low study numbers and heterogeneity. No conclusions could be drawn about exercise supervision or dose.

Discussion

Exercise interventions for people with neurogenic claudication typically feature multiple components. Common features such as supervision, lumbar flexion, and aerobic fitness exercises and also less common features such as stretches, strengthening exercises, and psychologically informed approaches warrant consideration for inclusion when designing and optimising exercise interventions for people with lumbar spinal stenosis.

### Effectiveness of interspinous implant surgery in patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113L81zZ]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The literature has been systematically reviewed to evaluate the outcome for patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication treated with IPD versus bony decompression or conservative non-surgical treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis on this subject. After a literature search, two independent RCTs and eight prospective cohorts, one with a control group, were eligible for validation and data extraction. The methodological quality of the RCTs were 5 (Zucherman) and 6 (Anderson). The methodological quality of the remaining prospective cohort studies was relatively low (only one reached 6 out of 8). In total 563 patients were treated with IPD. All studies showed improvement in validated outcome scores after 6 weeks and 1 year. Pooled data of the RCTs were more in favor of IPD treatment compared with conservative treatment.

The review of the literature showed that very little is known about treatment with IPD. Only one comparative study with good methodological quality fulfilling our selection criteria was found. Different indications are used for these devices, such as described by Richter who used an IPD in combination with surgical decompression. Some studies show beneficial effect of surgical technique compared to conservative treatment for patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic intermittent claudication. More centers, however, perform complex techniques rather than only a decompression technique. Between 2002 and 2007, complex fusion procedures showed a 15-fold increase in the USA. Furthermore, the overall procedure rate slightly decreased with 1.4%. Coflex worldwide implants increased from 1,717 in 2005 to 13,128 in 2009. Even without evidence of implantation of an IPD as a treatment strategy for INC, some centers use it in a combination with other techniques. Despite the fact that no arguments exist in the literature about the effectiveness of treatment with IPD versus bony decompression, many centers throughout the world use IPD for the treatment of INC.

### Objective real-world outcomes of patients suffering from painful neurogenic claudication treated with theProcedure: interim 6-month report of a randomized controlled trial [^113cT2JN]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In the event these first-line CMM therapies do not provide adequate relief for symptoms of neurogenic claudication, LSS patients may choose to undergo more invasive treatments such as interspinous spacers, laminectomy, and spinal fusion that are associated with higher complication rates. These refractory patients represent a significantly different patient profile than those early in the continuum of care. While the clinical superiority of mild to ESIs/CMM has been established by this and two other RCTs, a suggested comparison of mild to open surgery presents several methodological challenges. First, these patient populations are at completely different phases on the treatment algorithm. Early patients are seeking to delay or avoid surgery altogether. Further, the considerable difference in invasiveness would lead to difficulty with enrollment and post randomization withdrawals due to patients opting out to receive their desired therapy. Due to these fundamental barriers, a valid RCT of this comparison is not feasible. Almost one-third of the US population is covered for reimbursement of the mild Procedure. This includes all Medicare carriers, the Veterans Administration, and multiple commercial plans. It is also covered by Walmart's Centers of Excellence program for the treatment of LSS.

Limitations of this study include the lack of blinding which was not possible due to the use of an active comparator that allows for a broad range of both conservative and interventional treatments in both study groups. It is anticipated that patients in both arms may continue to receive CMM therapies throughout the study period. The real-world nature of this study, which allows the use of CMM in both study arms at the full discretion of the investigator, is also a limitation due to use of various standard of care treatment algorithms. All CMM treatments as well as subsequent disallowed procedures are recorded. Patients who receive a disallowed procedure remain in the study and are assessed at all follow-ups.

### Spinal cord stimulation for neurogenic claudication associated with lumbar spinal stenosis [^115aJ7GY]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a debate on the long-term outcomes of surgical decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) as compared to conservative treatment, with even more limited outcomes in repeat surgeries. Hence, other less invasive treatment modalities, such as neuromodulation with a modern spinal cord stimulator (SCS), could be considered in the spectrum of management options for symptoms of neurogenic claudication (NC) related to LSS as an alternative to surgery.

Objective

Assessing the outcomes and efficacy of SCS in neurogenic claudication in patients with or without a prior lumbar surgery.

Study Design

This is a retrospective study of a prospectively collected database.

Setting

The research was conducted at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), an academic medical center, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Methods

This study reviewed all patients who had undergone SCS therapy for symptoms consistent with NC between 2013 through 2020. The data were collected from MCW. Only patients with at least one year of follow-up were included in outcome assessment.

Results

One hundred and eighteen patients with primary symptoms of NC underwent an SCS trial with an 86% pass-rate. A total of 69 of the 93 patients who underwent permanent SCS implantation had at least one year of follow-up. All patients reported initial improvement after permanent implantation. At one-year follow-up, 55 (80%) patients had sustained improvement of their pain levels and claudication symptoms, of whom 52 (75%) continued to experience benefit for an average of at least 27 months. For patients with no prior surgical decompression, 86% continued to experience sustained benefit at the latest follow-up.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. It is of a retrospective nature that includes selection and recall biases. It is a single-center study that limits its generalizability. More limitations are discussed in the main article.

Conclusions

With modern SCS techniques, the majority of patients can achieve sustained improvement of symptoms of NC of at least a 2-year duration regardless of previous history of lumbar decompressive surgery. SCS can be considered as part of the conservative treatment options before committing to surgical decompression.

### Lateral transpsoas approach for lumbar indirect lateral recess decompression: 2-dimensional operative video [^113Jzt6H]. Operative Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Neurogenic claudication is a common symptom of lumbar spinal stenosis; its pathophysiology is thought to be ischemia of the nerve roots secondary to compression from surrounding structures. The stenosis of the lateral recesses and neuroforamen can cause these symptoms and its surgical treatment is decompression. The placement of interbody cages that restore the disc space height may indirectly decompress the neuroforamen and alleviate the nerve impingement symptoms. In case of concomitant low-grade spondylolisthesis, interbody devices might also reduce the slippage. We present a technical surgical video of a minimally invasive lateral transpsoas fusion, relying on indirect decompression to treat a patient with neurogenic claudication secondary to grade 1 spondylolisthesis. The patient signed a written consent to publish a video, recording, photograph, image, illustration, and/or information about him.

### Experiences of recovery and rehabilitation from surgery to treat neurogenic claudication. A qualitative study [^115Y2gYv]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to explore the experiences, expectations, attitudes and beliefs about surgery and recovery in people with neurogenic claudication, and their preferences for rehabilitation.

Methods

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 16 patients (8 female; mean age 70years) following surgery for neurogenic claudication. Data were transcribed verbatim, analysed using reflexive thematic analysis and interpreted using the five constructs of the Integrative Model of Expectations: treatment, timeline, behaviour, outcome, and generalised expectations.

Findings

Three themes were developed: (1) making sense of recovery through a biomedical model of illness; (2) the mismatch between expectation and recovery (subthemes: the unanticipated burden of recovery; hope versus reality: expectations of the ultimate outcome); (3) one size doesn't fit all: the need for tailored rehabilitation. Participants expressed a preference for tailored, supervised rehabilitation commencing 2–6weeks post-surgery. Some participants preferred one-to-one and some group-based rehabilitation. Some participants thought pre-operative rehabilitation would be beneficial.

Conclusions

Patient's experiences and satisfaction with their care and outcome are heavily influenced by their expectations. Tailored rehabilitation should reframe unrealistic expectations regarding care, recovery, and ultimate outcome; educate patients on the biopsychosocial model of pain; and equip patients with the knowledge and skills to optimise their outcome. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONPeople with neurogenic claudication interpret their condition, symptoms, and recovery from surgery through a mechanistic, biomedical lens. The experience and recovery from surgery for neurogenic claudication can be unexpectedly challenging and burdensome. Healthcare professionals should support patients by helping to set realistic expectations of post-operative care, recovery, and outcome from surgery. People undergoing surgery for neurogenic claudication want rehabilitation, personalised to their individual circumstances and requirements.

### Neurogenic intermittent claudication caused by vasculitis in the cauda equina: an autopsy case report [^114JjXv2]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Intermittent claudication (IC) refers to leg pain that is induced by walking and relieved by rest. Neurogenic IC is usually associated with lumbar canal stenosis (LCS). We present rare findings from an autopsied patient who had neurogenic IC caused by vasculitis in the cauda equina.

Methods

We performed antemortem neurological and electrophysiological assessments, sural nerve biopsy, and post-mortem examination of the spinal cord and brain.

Results

A 61-year-old man noted sudden-onset leg pain that was not associated with any traumatic trigger. His leg pain consistently appeared when the patient walked and quickly faded on stopping. Spine surgery and cardiovascular departments both made a diagnosis of IC. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not show LCS, and all ankle-brachial pressure indices were normal. He subsequently developed diffuse muscle weakness of the legs a month after disease onset. Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody was seropositive (140 IU/mL), and a sural nerve biopsy revealed axonal injury and angiitis. MRI showed multiple cerebral infarctions. He was diagnosed with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and underwent corticosteroid therapy. He died from complications two months after the onset. A post-mortem study revealed vasculitis in the subarachnoid space of the cauda equina, spinal cord, and brain parenchyma. The cauda equina showed a combined loss of small and large axonal fibres. The lumbar cord displayed central chromatolysis of the lower motor neurons.

Conclusion

MPA is a rare cause of neurogenic IC when the symptom is acute and multimodal. Small-vessel vasculitis affecting the cauda equina may underlie MPA-associated IC.

### Exercise treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and intervention component analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114oaAsd]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

The fourth key trial that we identifiedhas been published after these systematic reviews were undertaken and adds to the growing evidence of exercise benefits in people with lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication. This is a high-quality randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a personalised and supervised group exercise programme combined with a psychologically informed approach compared to best practice physiotherapy.

The majority of exercise interventions in the trials we reviewed relied on theoretical rationales proposed by earlier authors, and/or on evidence from other populations. These rationales include theory-driven recommendations of flexion-based/lordosis-reducing exercises and trunk muscle control exercises for relieving the posture-related symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication. However, little or no detail was provided to explain the selection of specific exercise intervention parameters and components.

The value of a psychologically informed approach is now recognised in the management of chronic back pain. Whilst only two recent exercise interventions for people with lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication incorporated a psychologically informed approach and education, both were classed as successful interventions, reporting sustained improvements in walking capacity. In a population that is known to have poor activity levelsand high levels of depression, psychologically informed approaches may be another important factor in optimising exercise prescription.

The majority of exercise interventions in the included trials were supervised and performed at least twice weekly over a duration of at least 6 weeks. Whilst no conclusions could be drawn about the impact of exercise dose and supervision on intervention success, these parameters are consistent with the literature in other musculoskeletal conditions that suggests twice-weekly supervised strength and fitness exercises are most likely to provide a meaningful improvement in pain and function.

Treatment Options

Lifestyle Modification

Improvements and alterations in lifestyle such as regular exercise, core strengthening, balanced diet, and maintaining ideal body weight have been often recommended for overall spinal health. There have not yet been any clinical trials that support this, however. The natural progression of LSS begins slowly with minimal symptoms, followed by a steep increase as critical stenosis is reached. Once LSS symptoms are noticed, it is often too late for lifestyle modifications to be significantly effective.

Epidural Injections (with/Without Steroids)

Targeted injection of local anesthetic with or without corticosteroids has been widely utilized in the treatment of neurogenic claudication due to LSS. When conservative treatments have been exhausted, patients are given the option of interventional pain management, often in the form of spinal epidural injections before surgery. Injected local anesthetics are often combined with corticosteroids to provide pain relief by reduction of local inflammation and ischemia, which are caused by the stenosis. This practice has been accepted as an alternative to more invasive surgical decompression or to help delay surgery by providing short- to medium-term pain relief. The North American Spine Society (NASS) has developed a set of evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis from their Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Work Group. There is a Grade B recommendation (with suggestion of a Level I study and additional Level II or III studies) for the application of interlaminar epidural steroid injections to provide short-term (two weeks to six months) relief of neurogenic claudication. The long-term efficacy of interlaminar epidural steroid injections was considered controversial. Transforaminal and caudal approaches obtained a Grade C recommendation in providing medium-term (three to 36 months) pain relief. Additional evidence for spinal epidural injections to treat LSS came from two randomized controlled trials by Manchikanti et al. showing statistically significant pain relief and improvement of disability in patients with LSS undergoing both interlaminar and caudal epidural injections. Conflicting data were later published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggesting minimal benefit of epidural steroids compared with local anesthetics alone. This article was highlighted for its controversial results and was criticized for study design, inclusion criteria, data analysis, and conclusions, which led to confusion among patients and providers regarding epidural injections for spinal stenosis. Additional systematic reviews of the literature have shown modest benefits in both short- and long-term pain relief for epidural injections in treating LSS. A comprehensive review of 10 studies that included 1,010 subjects indicated a minimal difference between the use of injected epidural steroids vs local anesthetic only.

### F wave studies of neurogenic intermittent claudication in lumbar spinal stenosis [^116mSAma]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) may result in neurogenic claudication (NC), which is thought to be a result of transient ischemia during exercise. In this study we evaluated the changes in F wave studies before and immediately after walking stress in patients with NC.

Design

Twenty-six patients with LSS who had signs and symptoms of NC and 20 healthy volunteers were included in this study. Routine motor and sensory nerve conduction studies and tibial F wave studies were performed in both groups. Immediately after walking stress test, tibial F wave studies were repeated. Exercise treadmill protocol was used for ambulation. Time to first symptoms and total ambulation time were recorded.

Results

After completion of the baseline electrophysiological examination, a walking stress test was performed using a treadmill, and 16 patients (61.5%) experienced neurogenic claudication during the trial. The mean time to first symptoms was 2.0 ± 3.5 mins (minimum = 0, maximum = 14). In the control group 18 subjects (90%) completed the trial without any symptoms, and 2 (10%) subjects had to stop at an average of 10 mins because of generalized fatigue. Within 5 mins after the walking stress test, tibial F wave studies were repeated in both groups. There were significant increases in F latency values bilaterally in the patient group (P = 0.001 for both sides) but not in control subjects (P = 0.435 for right side and P = 0.122 for left side).

Conclusion

Our data suggest that F wave studies after walking stress test provide more information for the diagnosis of NC.

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: an evidenced-based approach [^114GkY1G]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with LSS have a history of symptoms that are notable for pain and discomfort that radiate to the lower leg, thigh, and/or buttocks (neurogenic claudication). Patients with more pronounced LSS may develop lower extremity weakness, muscle cramping, numbness, and imbalance in gait. Patients typically report symptoms of neurogenic claudication that abate with sitting down or leaning forward, referred to as the "shopping cart sign". When spinal stenosis predominantly affects the neuroforamen or lateral recess, patients may report radicular pain following a specific dermatomal distribution. As LSS is a slowly progressing condition, rapid onset of these symptoms may refer to a different pathology.

To confirm clinical suspicion of LSS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) myelogram studies are required. MRI remains the most common imaging modality to assess LSS, as physical examination and x-ray imaging do not have a high sensitivity or specificity. There is great variability in the description and assessment of LSS among radiologists, and lack of standardization may contribute to increased heterogeneity of the patient population undergoing surgery for LSS. However, radiographs are low cost and are readily available. Radiological AP and lateral images may show nonspecific degenerative findings such as disc height loss, disc space narrowing, and osteophyte formation, whereas flexion/extension radiographs may show segmental instability and subtle degenerative spondylolisthesis. Causes that are unrelated to back pain, such as sacroiliac joint pathology, renal stones, or calcified aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta, may also be identified. However, soft tissue evaluation using is limited. MRI has high sensitivity in diagnosing stenosis, as it has high soft tissue contrast, and it best depicts cord, nerve roots, and bone marrow abnormalities. Nevertheless, imaging should be correlated with clinical presentation, as many LSS imaging studies may not have a direct correlation with clinical presentation, and treatment options may vary. The physical findings that are most strongly linked to LSS include wide-based gait, normal Romberg test, thigh pain after 30 seconds of lumbar extension, and neuromuscular deficits. An expert consensus was obtained, which demonstrated an 80% certainty of LSS diagnosis based on seven history items, which include "leg/buttock pain while walking", "flex forward to relieve pain", "relief when using a shopping cart or bicycle", "motor/sensory", "disturbance while walking", "normal/symmetric foot pulses", "lower extremity weakness", and "low back pain". Based on physical examination, it is usually sufficient to diagnose for LSS, and MRI/CT diagnosis is often reserved for patients who are being considered for surgery after conservative management has failed.

### The effectiveness of pharmacopuncture in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis: a protocol for a multi-centered, pragmatic, randomized, controlled, parallel group study [^1111xTwY]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a disease that involves narrowing of the spinal cavity due to hyperplasia of the spine and adjacent tissues. LSS is primarily an acquired degenerative stenosis associated with diminished space in the lumbar spinal canal or neural foramen causing neural or vascular compression. It affects over 100 million patients. Degenerative LSS can cause neurogenic claudication and other neurological symptoms, with or without pain, in the lower back and lower extremities. The symptoms of LSS are posture-dependent, exacerbated by walking, and are relieved by rest.

Although the underlying mechanism of LSS remains unclear, the main symptoms affecting the lower extremities include neurogenic claudication, radiating pain, paresthesia, and hypotonia. This chronic degenerative illness is newly diagnosed in five out of 100,000 people each year, and its prevalence increases with age. The anatomical deterioration of LSS and the symptoms experienced by patients are often inconsistent. Although its clinical symptoms improve through conservative care, the difference in efficacy in terms of symptom improvement between surgical and non-surgical treatments is not evident. In addition, considering the economic utility of surgical intervention and the risk of adverse reactions, conservative care is recommended first for the treatment of LSS, and surgery is only conducted if pain persists or neurogenic claudication occurs after conservative care. Despite this, LSS remains one of the most common indications for spinal surgery.

### Interspinous process device versus standard conventional surgical decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis: randomized controlled trial [^117Fxrhu]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We did a prospective, randomized, double blind, multicenter trial among patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis after failed conservative treatment (Foraminal Enlargement Lumbar Interspinosus distraXion: FELIX trial). We compared minimally invasive treatment with interspinous process devices against usual care (conventional bony decompression). The design and study protocol have been published previously.

Eligibility and randomization

Patients aged between 40 and 85 years with at least three months of intermittent neurogenic claudication due to single or two level degenerative lumbar canal stenosis and an indication for surgery were eligible. All patients were diagnosed as having intermittent neurogenic claudication by a neurologist in one of the participating hospitals. If magnetic resonance imaging showed a lumbar spinal canal stenosis, the consulting neurosurgeon could include patients as surgical candidates for the study. At the time of enrollment, an independent research nurse verified the persistence of the symptoms. We excluded patients with a cauda equina syndrome, a herniated disc needing discectomy, history of lumbar surgery, or significant scoliosis (Cobb angle > 25°) or other spinal deformities.

We used a randomized design with variable block sizes, with allocations stratified according to center. Allocations were stored in prepared opaque, coded, and sealed envelopes. The key was accessible only to the ProMISe data management system of the Department of Medical Statistics and BioInformatics of the Leiden University Medical Center. All patients gave informed consent. After induction of anesthesia, the prepared envelope was opened and the patient allocated to one of the treatment arms. Patients, nurses on the hospital wards, and research nurses remained blind to the allocated treatment during the follow-up period of one year. The surgical report was kept separately from the patient's regular clinical forms and was available to the neurosurgeon only in case of complications or reoperations.

### MiDAS ENCORE: randomized controlled clinical trial report of 6-month results [^114P19AR]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Patients suffering from neurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) often experience moderate to severe pain and significant functional disability. Neurogenic claudication results from progressive degenerative changes in the spine, and most often affects the elderly. Both the MILD® procedure and epidural steroid injections (ESIs) offer interventional pain treatment options for LSS patients experiencing neurogenic claudication refractory to more conservative therapies. MILD provides an alternative to ESIs via minimally invasive lumbar decompression.

Study Design

Prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled clinical trial.

Setting

Twenty-six US interventional pain management centers.

Objective

To compare patient outcomes following treatment with either MILD (treatment group) or ESIs (active control group) in LSS patients with neurogenic claudication and verified ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.

Methods

This prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled clinical trial includes 2 study arms with a 1-to-1 randomization ratio. A total of 302 patients were enrolled, with 149 randomized to MILD and 153 to the active control. Six-month follow-up has been completed and is presented in this report. In addition, one year follow-up will be conducted for patients in both study arms, and supplementary 2 year outcome data will be collected for patients in the MILD group only.

Outcome Measures

Outcomes are assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) and Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ). Primary efficacy is the proportion of ODI responders, tested for statistical superiority of the MILD group versus the active control group. ODI responders are defined as patients achieving the validated Minimal Important Change (MIC) of = 10 point improvement in ODI from baseline to follow-up. Similarly, secondary efficacy includes proportion of NPRS and ZCQ responders using validated MIC thresholds. Primary safety is the incidence of device or procedure-related adverse events in each group.

Results

At 6 months, all primary and secondary efficacy results provided statistically significant evidence that MILD is superior to the active control. For primary efficacy, the proportion of ODI responders in the MILD group (62.2%) was statistically significantly higher than for the epidural steroid group (35.7%) (P < 0.001). Further, all secondary efficacy parameters demonstrated statistical superiority of MILD versus the active control. The primary safety endpoint was achieved, demonstrating that there is no difference in safety between MILD and ESIs (P = 1.00).

Limitations

Limitations include lack of patient blinding due to considerable differences in treatment protocols, and a potentially higher non-responder rate for both groups versus standard-of-care due to study restrictions on adjunctive pain therapies.

Conclusions

Six month follow-up data from this trial demonstrate that the MILD procedure is statistically superior to epidural steroids, a known active treatment for LSS patients with neurogenic claudication and verified central stenosis due to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. The results of all primary and secondary efficacy outcome measures achieved statistically superior outcomes in the MILD group versus ESIs. Further, there were no statistically significant differences in the safety profile between study groups. This prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled clinical trial provides strong evidence of the effectiveness of MILD versus epidural steroids in this patient population.

### Does this older adult with lower extremity pain have the clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis? [^114hSbmp]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

The clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common diagnosis in older adults presenting with lower extremity pain.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy of the clinical examination for the diagnosis of the clinical syndrome of LSS.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL searches of articles published from January 1966 to September 2010.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they contained adequate data on the accuracy of the history and physical examination for diagnosing the clinical syndrome of LSS, using a reference standard of expert opinion with radiographic or anatomic confirmation.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, extract data, and appraise levels of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Four studies evaluating 741 patients were identified. Among patients with lower extremity pain, the likelihood of the clinical syndrome of LSS was increased for individuals older than 70 years (likelihood ratio [LR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6–2.5), and was decreased for those younger than 60 years (LR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.29–0.57). The most useful symptoms for increasing the likelihood of the clinical syndrome of LSS were having no pain when seated (LR, 7.4; 95% CI, 1.9–30), improvement of symptoms when bending forward (LR, 6.4; 95% CI, 4.1–9.9), the presence of bilateral buttock or leg pain (LR, 6.3; 95% CI, 3.1–13), and neurogenic claudication (LR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.9–4.8). Absence of neurogenic claudication (LR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.17–0.31) decreased the likelihood of the diagnosis. A wide-based gait (LR, 13; 95% CI, 1.9–95) and abnormal Romberg test result (LR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.4–13) increased the likelihood of the clinical syndrome of LSS. A score of 7 or higher on a diagnostic support tool including history and examination findings increased the likelihood of the clinical syndrome of LSS (LR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.7–4.0), while a score lower than 7 made the diagnosis much less likely (LR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.06–0.16).

Conclusions

The diagnosis of the clinical syndrome of LSS requires the appropriate clinical picture and radiographic findings. Absence of pain when seated and improvement of symptoms when bending forward are the most useful individual findings. Combinations of findings are most useful for identifying patients who are unlikely to have the diagnosis.

### Non-surgical interventions for lumbar spinal stenosis leading to neurogenic claudication: a clinical practice guideline [^115S6J2T]. The Journal of Pain (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for lumbar spinal stenosis, more specifically with respect to general principles, BJC/CCGI 2021 guidelines recommend to consider offering initial multimodal care nonpharmacological therapies with education, advice and lifestyle changes, behavioral change techniques in conjunction with home exercise and/or rehabilitation,
and postoperative rehabilitation - a supervised program of exercises and/or educational materials encouraging activity - with CBT 12 weeks post-surgery in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis causing neurogenic claudication.

### Percutaneous interspinous spacer vs decompression in patients with neurogenic claudication: an alternative in selected patients? [^115cjEis]. Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

Due to the above arguments and in the light of our own results, we would carefully advocate a more balanced view on standalone IPD implantation for the treatment of DLSS with NIC. Progress in clinical science only occurs in small steps. A complete rejection of an innovation because of nonsuperiority would stall this process for almost all technological evolutions. We value and share a very critical attitude toward costly and/or ineffective innovations. However, weighing the evidence available, we see a possible indication in a small subset of patients, ie, those with comorbidities and/or anticoagulation.

### The effectiveness and risks of non-image-guided lumbar interlaminar epidural steroid injections: a systematic review with comprehensive analysis of the published data [^112XBHjP]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness and risks of non-image-guided lumbar interlaminar epidural steroid injections.

Design

Systematic review.

Interventions

Three reviewers with formal training and certification in evidence-based medicine searched the literature on non-image-guided lumbar interlaminar epidural steroid injections. A larger team of seven reviewers independently assessed the methodology of studies found and appraised the quality of the evidence presented.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome assessed was pain relief. Other outcomes such as functional improvement, reduction in surgery rate, decreased use of opioids, and complications were noted, if reported. The evidence was appraised in accordance with the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system of evaluating evidence.

Results

The searches yielded 92 primary publications addressing non-image-guided lumbar interlaminar epidural steroid injections. The evidence supporting the effectiveness of these injections for pain relief and functional improvement in patients with lumbar radicular pain due to disc herniation or neurogenic claudication secondary to lumbar spinal stenosis is limited. This procedure may provide short-term benefit in the first 3–6 weeks. The small number of case reports on significant risks suggests these injections are relatively safe. In accordance with GRADE, the quality of evidence is very low.

Conclusions

In patients with lumbar radicular pain secondary to disc herniation or neurogenic claudication due to spinal stenosis, non-image-guided lumbar interlaminar epidural steroid injections appear to have clinical effectiveness limited to short-term pain relief. Therefore, in a contemporary medical practice, these procedures should be restricted to the rare settings where fluoroscopy is not available.

### Preoperative MRI in patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication: relevance for diagnosis and prognosis [^115VUF2H]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design

We studied baseline magnetic resonance images of 155 patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication and lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and patient data were gathered from participants of a randomized trial.

Objective

It is believed that the narrowness of the lumbar spinal canal correlates to the severity of complaints and that it may be a good predictor of clinical outcome if treated. However, this hypothesis has never been (prospectively) tested.

Summary Of Background Data

MRI is an important tool to confirm the diagnosis of LSS as a cause for intermittent neurogenic claudication.

Methods

Three raters were asked to evaluate the magnetic resonance images (Schizas scale). Symptom severities at baseline and 1-year follow-up were quantified. The radiological scores were correlated with clinical baseline and outcome scores to assess diagnostic and prognostic value of MRI findings at baseline.

Results

There was good agreement on the clinically relevant level of LSS (kappa range 0.57–0.64). MRI assessment of grading of compression (kappa 0.33–0.46) did not correlate with baseline MRDQ nor with outcome based on postoperative change in MRDQ (P = 0.61). However, both absence of epidural fat and presence of tortuous caudal nerves on magnetic resonance images (kappa 0.53–0.72 and 0.67–0.70) in patients with LSS were relatively good predictors for satisfactory recovery after surgery (P = 0.03 and P < 0.01).

Conclusion

The grading of compression on the preoperative MRI is neither ambiguous nor correlating to severity of clinical condition. It does, furthermore, not have the ability to predict the outcome after 1 year if surgically treated.

### Perspective: a proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for management of lumbar spinal stenosis: an integrated team approach [^116Z5Qbt]. Pain Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Newly-introduced minimally invasive interventions have filled a gap between conservative care and open surgical procedures in the treatment and management of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), allowing expanded access to patient care. This spectrum of care involves an important interplay between advanced practice providers, interventional pain physicians, and spine surgeons.

Objectives

Using an integrated team approach starting with history taking; static and dynamic imaging; and conservative care, we developed a simple, understandable clinical algorithm that serves as a foundation for physicians to confidently make objective decisions regarding diagnosing and treating LSS throughout the entire clinical course of the condition. We believe this could potentially lead to more efficient and effective care for patients suffering from LSS with neurogenic claudication.

Methods

A decision tree approach was utilized with "either/or" choices at each branch or node in the algorithm. Activities are divided into examination procedures and corresponding treatment interventions. Symptom and radiographic severity grading as well as assessing clinical status employed published validated standards. Commensurate treatment choices were selected based on published LSS-specific clinical practice guidelines and/or meta-analyses.

Results

This algorithm recommends a systematic rule set for LSS diagnostic and treatment options. Initially, LSS symptom severity is graded based on the patient's pain relief with spinal flexion. This is correlated with radiographic severity assessment graded as mild, moderate, or severe. Radiographic severity combined with dynamic imaging prescribes a choice of treatment options and a risk/benefit discussion with the patient. These options include conservative management, minimally invasive methods such as interspinous process decompression, and more invasive surgical procedures such as laminectomy for increasing grades of radiographic severity.

Limitations

Understanding that each patient with LSS is managed on a case-by-case basis, the treatment options recommended by this algorithm should be considered "soft guidance". As such, integrated team/patient consultation is recommended to ensure maximum clinical benefit. A risk/benefit assessment and discussion should be performed with each individual patient.

Conclusions

Our proposed algorithm offers an easy-to-use clinical tool and general foundation for identifying, evaluating, and treating patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication associated with LSS.

### A comprehensive study of patients with surgically treated lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication [^116C2LPo]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between objective measurements and subjective symptoms of patients with spinal stenosis and the degree of narrowing of the spinal canal is not clear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients undergoing surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis and intermittent neurogenic claudication with functional testing, quantitative imaging, and patient self-assessment.

Methods

Sixty-two patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication were prospectively enrolled in the study. All underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography myelography, and all were treated with decompressive surgery and were followed for a minimum of two years. The evaluation included treadmill and bicycle exercise tests as well as patient self-assessment with use of the Oswestry Disability Index and a visual analog pain scale preoperatively and postoperatively.

Results

Preoperatively fifty-eight (94%) of the patients had a positive result (provocation of symptoms) on the treadmill test and twenty-seven (44%) had a positive result on the bicycle test, whereas postoperatively six and twelve, respectively, had positive results. The mean preoperative scores on the Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog pain scale were 58.4 and 7.1, respectively. Postoperatively, these scores decreased to 21.1 and 2.3, respectively, and both decreases were significant (p < 0.05). Forty-seven (76%) of the patients were seen to have central stenosis on the preoperative imaging studies; forty-one of them had a cross-sectional area of the dural tube of < 100 mm² at at least one level and twelve had a cross-sectional area of < 100 mm² at at least two levels.

Conclusions

A positive treadmill test was consistent with a diagnosis of spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication in > 90% of the patients preoperatively. Following surgical decompression of the lumbar spinal stenosis, more functional improvement was demonstrated by the treadmill test than by the bicycle test. The scores on the Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog pain scale also improved postoperatively. The severity of central canal narrowing at a single level does not appear to limit the postoperative improvement in either functional ability or patient self-assessment. Patients with multilevel central stenosis were, on the average, older and walked a shorter distance preoperatively and postoperatively, although the improvement in their postoperative self-assessment scores was similar to that of patients with single-level stenosis.

### Effectiveness of interspinous implant surgery in patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111qjRGc]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Data synthesis

A meta-analysis was performed if two or more RCTs were available with clinical homogeneous patient groups and statistical homogeneous results. When not possible, due to small amount of studies or heterogeneity, a best-evidence synthesis was used. Best-evidence synthesis was performed stratified for studies meeting 50% or more opposed to those meeting less than 50% of the quality criteria of the Van Tulder list. The study was only included in the best-evidence synthesis if a comparison was made between the groups (IPD placement vs. conservative treatment or IPD placement vs. surgical decompressive treatment). When meta-analysis or best-evidence synthesis based on RCT is not possible, a data extraction based on observational studies (with or without control group) will be performed. Although a high risk of bias is possible, if possible we performed a data extraction from observational studies based on the "best-of-the-rest" principle.

### A review of lumbar spinal stenosis with intermittent neurogenic claudication: disease and diagnosis [^111XNbV9]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

It is clear that LSS presents an economic and medical challenge to both patients and physicians. The disorder can be asymptomatic for an extended period, and once the patient is exhibiting signs of pain, it may be too late for conservative treatment. Effective treatment for LSS is particularly challenging due to the requirement for accurate diagnosis. However, when medical interventions are indicated, the present work demonstrates that there are many techniques at the physician's disposal. As medical imaging improves, with new technological advancements and increasing resolution, it would be the hope that identifying LSS accurately will become easier and that surgical techniques and tools will improve to most effectively reduce the patient's pain and restore function.

### A review of lumbar spinal stenosis with intermittent neurogenic claudication: disease and diagnosis [^113ngcnN]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of the treatment for LSS depends on the accuracy of the diagnosis, which can be challenging. Combining patient history and physical examination with imaging test results and symptoms is at the basis of a proper diagnosis. No universal gold standard for LSS diagnosis has been established, and therefore the impressions of expert clinicians often lie at the basis of a clinical diagnosis.

The chronic symptoms of LSS are often missed or misdiagnosed. An inadequate or normal physical examination that may show no abnormalities coupled with inability to make a proper clinical judgment can contribute to difficulty in making the correct diagnosis. In addition, the appropriate interpretation of patients' symptoms, obtaining the patients' history, and combining this with specific attributes from the physical examination are critical. To prevent misdiagnoses at the level of primary care physicians, a clinical support tool may be of assistance to correctly identify LSS patients. Such a diagnostic tool was reported by Konno et al. where a clinical prediction was made by assigning a risk score to a patient's history, physical examination scores, and imaging results, and then comparing that with the diagnosis of an experienced specialist. In this multicenter prospective study, 468 patients exhibiting pain and numbness of the lower legs were seen by 104 experienced orthopedic physicians in 22 clinics and 50 hospitals. Based on this study, the sensitivity of the tool was estimated at 93%, the specificity at 72%, and the overall prevalence of LSS was 47% in a population consisting of patients with a mean age (range) of 64 (20–96) years, and where 46% were male.

The overall goal of this review is to present a thorough overview of LSS, including prevalence, clinical presentation, accurate diagnosis, and current treatment options.

### A review of lumbar spinal stenosis with intermittent neurogenic claudication: disease and diagnosis [^112gEYah]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a degenerative spinal condition affecting nearly 50% of patients presenting with lower back pain. The goal of this review is to present and summarize the current data on how LSS presents in various populations, how it is diagnosed, and current therapeutic strategies. Properly understanding the prevalence, presentation, and treatment options for individuals suffering from LSS is critical to providing patients the best possible care.

Results

The occurrence of LSS is associated with advanced age. In elderly patients, LSS can be challenging to identify due to the wide variety of presentation subtleties and common comorbidities such as degenerative disc disease. Recent developments in imaging techniques can be useful in accurately identifying the precise location of the spinal compression. Treatment options can range from conservative to surgical, with the latter being reserved for when patients have neurological compromise or conservative measures have failed. Once warranted, there are several surgical techniques at the physician's disposal to best treat each individual case.

RESULTS

Patient Disposition

A total of 215 patients from 19 sites were screened and consented to inclusion in the study. Of these, 163 patients were randomized, from January 2010 to April 2014, to the IPD (82) or SDS (81) group (Figure 1), with 79 patients implanted with the IPD and 76 patients receiving SDS. Twelve patients (9 IPD and 3 SDS) were lost to follow-up after 12 mo, 2 patients withdrew consent (1 patient in each group), and 1 IPD patient died, which resulted in a follow-up rate of 83% and 89% per study group, respectively. Between 12 and 24 mo, 14 patients (7 IPD and 7 SDS) were lost to follow-up, 1 IPD patient withdrew consent, and 1 IPD patient died, which resulted in a follow-up rate of 71% and 81% at 24 mo, respectively. The per-protocol set, used for reporting efficacy results, was made up of 72 IPD patients and 73 SDS patients.

FIGURE 1.

Baseline Characteristics

Baseline characteristics were similar in both treatment arms and showed no statistically significant difference (Table 1). Mean age of included patients was 65 ± 11 (range 26–90) yr. Fifty-one percent of patients were female. Mean leg pain was 7.9 ± 1.3 and 8.0 ± 1.3 in the IPD and SDS groups, respectively. Mean back pain was 4.0 ± 2.3 and 4.4 ± 2.0, respectively.

### Can claudication be improved with medication? [^111b8EdT]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Intermittent claudication is a common disabling condition that affects approximately 5% to 15% of patients with atherosclerotic disease. Recommended treatment involves lifestyle modification and physical conditioning through the adoption of a regular exercise program. These methods of treatment often have been unsuccessful in the past because of noncompliance, in large part related to the relatively minor degree of improvement experienced by the patient. However, some recent trials have resulted in greater relative improvements in both pain-free and maximal walking distances in some patients treated with medication. Surgical and endovascular options offer greater degrees of improvement but also greater morbidity and should be reserved as treatment for severe claudication. The efficacies, as well as common adverse reactions associated with current medications used to treat patients with intermittent claudication are reviewed.

### Superion interspinous process spacer for intermittent neurogenic claudication secondary to moderate lumbar spinal stenosis: two-year results from a randomized controlled FDA-IDE pivotal trial [^114hB2rm]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, investigational device exemption noninferiority trial.

Objective

To determine 2-year outcomes in patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication secondary to moderate lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) who were treated with the Superion interspinous process spacer.

Summary Of Background Data

Interspinous spacers are a less-invasive treatment alternative compared with surgical decompression for patients with LSS unresponsive to conservative care. High-quality comparative data with these devices are lacking.

Methods

Patients presenting with intermittent neurogenic claudication secondary to moderate LSS who failed at least 6 months of nonsurgical management were randomly allocated to treatment with the Superion spacer or a control spacer (X-Stop) and followed for 2 years.

Results

A total of 391 randomized patients were implanted with Superion (n = 190) or control (n = 201) spacers at 29 sites in the United States between August 2008 and December 2011. Implants were successfully implanted in 99.5% of patients with Superion and 99.0% of control patients. The primary composite endpoint of this study was met, which demonstrated that the Superion spacer was noninferior to the X-Stop spacer. Leg pain, the predominant patient complaint, decreased in severity by 70% during 2 years in each group. Most (77%) patients achieved leg pain clinical success (improvement ≥ 20 mm) at 2 years. Back pain clinical success (improvement ≥ 20 mm) was 68%, with no differences between groups. Oswestry Disability Index clinical success (≥ 15% point improvement) was achieved in 65% of patients. The rates of complications and reoperations were similar between groups.

Conclusion

The Superion interspinous process spacer relieves symptoms of intermittent neurogenic claudication secondary to moderate LSS in the majority of patients through 2 years.

### Exercise treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and intervention component analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111sfndi]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common spinal condition in older adults. The cluster of symptoms typically arising from lumbar spinal stenosis is referred to as neurogenic claudication and includes pain, aches, heaviness, and tingling radiating from the spine into the buttocks and legs, made worse by standing and walking and relieved by sitting.

Controversy around the benefits, costs and risks of surgical treatment, has led to a growing interest in non-surgical care including exercise to help people with lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication. Exercise is commonly prescribedbased on the theoretical benefits of increased spinal flexibility, enhanced blood flow to spinal nerves, improvements in physical fitness, strength and balance, and benefits for mental well-being, confidence and self-efficacy. – A number of recent systematic reviews – have synthesised data from clinical trials and concluded that exercise as part of multimodal care improves some outcomes. However, these trials delivered exercise interventions with notably different characteristics and comparators. Conclusions drawn from such heterogeneous data may have limited use for clinicians and policymakers wanting to understand how individual or combined exercise intervention components might impact patient outcomes. Furthermore, there is recognition that decision-makers are interested in research evidence to explain how complex exercise interventions work in different contexts and to support real-world decision-making.

The concept for this systematic review was shaped by the views of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication and by the views of clinicians. Both have highlighted inconsistent guidance and lack of detail on specific components to guide exercise prescription. The aims of this review detailed in our protocol were to estimate exercise treatment effectiveness and to explore the key components of these exercise treatments. The first point has been addressed by others in systematic reviews and meta-analyses published recently. – We, therefore, undertook this review to synthesise the evidence relating to specific components within exercise interventions for lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication. For the purposes of the review, we defined an exercise intervention as, 'A regular, structured and/or supervised exercise regimen'. This includes individual or group exercises, and supervised exercises or home exercises if following a structured programme, or a mixture.

### A multicenter, prospective, randomized trial evaluating the X STOP interspinous process decompression system for the treatment of neurogenic intermittent claudication: two-year follow-up results [^116wHvbE]. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

A randomized, controlled, prospective multicenter trial comparing the outcomes of neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC) patients treated with the interspinous process decompression system (X STOP) with patients treated nonoperatively.

Objective

To determine the safety and efficacy of the X STOP interspinous implant.

Summary Of Background Data

Patients suffering from NIC secondary to lumbar spinal stenosis have been limited to a choice between nonoperative therapies and decompressive surgical procedures, with or without fusion. The X STOP was developed to provide an alternative therapeutic treatment. METHODS.: 191 patients were treated, 100 in the X STOP group and 91 in the control group. The primary outcomes measure was the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire, a patient-completed, validated instrument for NIC.

Results

At every follow-up visit, X STOP patients had significantly better outcomes in each domain of the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire. At 2 years, the X STOP patients improved by 45.4% over the mean baseline Symptom Severity score compared with 7.4% in the control group; the mean improvement in the Physical Function domain was 44.3% in the X STOP group and -0.4% in the control group. In the X STOP group, 73.1% patients were satisfied with their treatment compared with 35.9% of control patients.

Conclusions

The X STOP provides a conservative yet effective treatment for patients suffering from lumbar spinal stenosis. In the continuum of treatment options, the X STOP offers an attractive alternative to both conservative care and decompressive surgery.

Clinical Presentation

To describe the diagnosis and treatment options for LSS, description of the clinical presentation is warranted. LSS is defined by any type of narrowing of the spinal canal, nerve root canals, or intervertebral foramina. LSS can be classified based on the cause of the stenosis, (i.e. congenital or acquired) or based on the anatomic location (i.e. central, foraminal, or lateral). Central stenosis occurs when the spinal canal and dural sac are affected, foraminal stenosis occurs when the spinal foramina is affected, and lateral stenosis occurs when the lateral recess is affected. It is thought that the changes due to central stenosis can lead to some degree of lateral stenosis, whereas lateral stenosis can occur autonomously. Acquired LSS is commonly associated with aging and progressive degenerative processes of the spine. Intermittent neurogenic claudication (INC), also referred to as pseudoclaudication, is the most common clinical presentation of LSS, manifested as back pain, leg pain, and weakness that significantly compromises the ability to ambulate. Patients with INC have normal peripheral pulses and vascular studies, whereas patients with peripheral vascular claudication present the following: abnormal peripheral pulses and vascular studies, leg pain that is more severe than back pain after walking some distance, and pain relief quickly with rest.

### Characterising patients undergoing surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis associated neurogenic claudication in the UK: what does the British spinal registry tell us? [^111N71sm]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) has a variable outcome with many not returning to pre-condition activity levels. We aimed to explore the (1) baseline characteristics of UK patients undergoing surgery, and (2) association of patient characteristics with a clinically important improvement in the 6-month Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) in a population defined by previously developed LSS criteria.

Methods

We used data from the British Spinal Registry (BSR) (2012–2023). Anonymised data included demographics, patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) (ODI; visual analogue scale (VAS) for back and leg pain); quality of life (EQ-5D)) at baseline, and 6-weeks and 6-months post-surgery, surgical procedure, surgery duration and intra-operative blood loss. We used descriptive and multivariate analyses to estimate the association between variables and the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) (30% improvement from baseline) in 6-month disability (ODI). MCIDs define the smallest benefit of value to patients. We explored differences in baseline values between 6-month responders and the total database, and between primary and revision surgery.

Results

In 6801 patients sampled from the BSR the mean age was 70.5 (SD 9.1), 51% (3452/6794) were female, and most were from higher socioeconomic areas (mean Index of Multiple Deprivation rank 84.3, SD 38.8). Preoperatively most had severe disability (ODI 48.7, SD 17.5), moderate leg (VAS 7.0, SD 2.4) and back pain (VAS 6.3, SD 2.5). Proportionally 58% (1160/2008) of the 6-month responders achieved the MCID in ODI. Higher baseline back pain intensity (odds ratio (OR) 0.9, 95%CI 0.9, 0.9), revision surgery (OR 0.5 95%CI 0.3, 0.8), higher 6-week leg pain intensity (OR 0.9, 95%CI 0.8, 1.0) and severe 6-week disability (OR 0.3, 95%CI 0.2, 0.5) reduced the odds of achieving the MCID in 6-month ODI.

Conclusions

Patients undergoing surgery in the UK are severely disabled prior to surgery. The available data suggests that 42% of UK patients do not achieve a clinically important improvement in 6-month disability.

### Effectiveness of interspinous implant surgery in patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113dK5gb]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Data extraction

In Tables 3, 4 and 5, relevant data on the selected studies is shown with the baseline and postoperative follow-up scores at 6 weeks and 1 year. Two RCTs with different patients samples (the two RCTs of Zucherman were conducted on the same patient sample), Anderson et al. and Zucherman et al. could be used for best evidence synthesis. Both RCTs compared conservative treatment with IPD placement (Fig. 2, meta-analysis). Both studies measured follow-up data on the ZCQ. In the study by Zucherman et al. however, overall success rates and standard deviation (SD) values were not shown. A calculation was made, based on the ZCQ values of symptom severity and physical function ZCQ. SD values were calculated estimated from the SD values of Anderson et al. Both studies favored treatment with IPD placement, pooled ZCQ improvement by 23.2 (SD 18.5–27.8). Statistical heterogeneity after pooled data was low (I-squared 0.0, p = 0.930). According to the statistical heterogeneity, baseline criteria in both studies showed a good clinical homogeneity. Richter et al. compared two surgical decompression cohorts: one group with surgical decompression and no IPD placement, one group with surgical decompression with IPD placement. Both groups showed clinical improvement in the ODI, MRDQ and VAS. At 6 weeks and at 1 year follow-up there were no statistical significantly differences between both groups. The remaining seven prospective cohort studies showed improvement from baseline after treatment with IPD. However, these groups did not compare other treatment modalities (such as conservative treatment) with IPD follow-up results. Due to the use of multiple follow-up scales, pooling of data was not possible (Tables 4, 5, prospective cohort studies).

Medication Therapy

Medication therapy for spinal stenosis symptoms has primarily fallen under the same guidelines as those for treating chronic low back pain. Although the pathophysiology of neurogenic claudication is distinctly different from spondylosis or lumbar radiculopathy, the medications used to treat include systemic corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anticonvulsants, antidepressants, muscle relaxers, and opioids. Short-term use of systemic corticosteroids for acute radiculopathy has been studied, and their role in chronic neurogenic claudication has not been established. Long-term use of NSAIDs has been noted to cause gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events. Furthermore, for chronic back pain with radicular symptoms, there was no significant difference between NSAIDs and placebo. In the same systematic review by Chou, only a few trials showed small improvements in pain scores with the use of gabapentin and topiramate. The off-label use of gabapentinoids for chronic neuropathic pain has steadily increased since the introduction of gabapentin in 1993, followed by pregabalin in 2004. Both drugs are analogs of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) molecule and share pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties. By targeting the alpha-2-delta subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel, they can alter the downstream neurotransmitter release, which gives them the proposed antinociceptive properties. Pregabalin is currently listed as a Schedule V drug by the Drug Enforcement Agency; there is an ominous global trend of misuse and abuse of gabapentinoids. In the midst of the prescription opioid epidemic, misuse and abuse of noncontrolled substances such as gabapentin and less controlled substances such as pregabalin have surged, leading to significant risk to patients. Gabapentinoids can be used to potentiate the effects of opioids, and the supratherapeutic use of gabapentin among patients with substance use disorder (SUD) can lead to a 60% increase in the odds of opioid-related death compared with opioids alone. Currently there is insufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacological treatment for spinal stenosis based on the NASS guidelines.

### Intermittent claudication of neurospinal origin… [^115yz8Fc]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Lower extremity pain produced by exercise and relieved by rest is regularly a symptom of arterial occlusive disease. Patients with such pain are evaluated by surgeons interested in treating vascular conditions. Sometimes the presence of a normal vascular examination and normal arteriography will exclude an arterial occlusion as the cause of the symptom complex. This then may leave the true cause of the symptoms in doubt. In such cases lumbar spine abnormalities causing neural compression should be considered as a cause of the intermittent claudication. Neurogenic intermittent claudication has been thought to be rare. However, this condition of exercise pain relieved by rest and due to lumbar spine abnormality is not uncommon. The purpose of the present report is to emphasize this fact, clarify the symptom complex, and call attention to the neural etiology of such peripheral leg pain produced by exercise. Report of Cases Case 1.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of minimally invasive lumbar decompression procedure for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication: 2-year results of MiDAS ENCORE [^112K3tcp]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Two-year follow-up results of this study demonstrate excellent durability of the MILD procedure for LSS patients suffering from neurogenic claudication symptoms and hypertrophic ligamentum flavum. All outcome measures demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement from baseline through 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year follow-ups. MILD patients experienced a mean ODI improvement of 22.7 points from baseline to 2 years postprocedure. This is markedly higher than the 10-point improvement that has been validated to be the threshold for clinically significant improvement for ODI. Further, 72.4% of MILD patients at 2 years achieved at least a 10-point improvement in ODI. All other validated efficacy measures also showed clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement, including NPRS, ZCQ physical function, and ZCQ symptom severity (Table 2). Zurich Claudication Questionnaire patient satisfaction also exceeded the clinically meaningful threshold.

### Nonoperative treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication [^113St8ca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated pathological spinal conditions. It frequently afflicts the elderly population.

Objectives

To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of nonoperative treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication.

Search Methods

CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Index to Chiropractic Literature (ICL) databases were searched up to June 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials published in English, in which at least one arm provided data on nonoperative treatments

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Risk of bias in each study was independently assessed by two review authors using the 12 criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (Furlan 2009). Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as relative risk, continuous outcomes as mean difference or standardized mean difference; uncertainty was expressed with 95% confidence intervals. If possible a meta-analysis was performed, otherwise results were described qualitatively. GRADE was used to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

From the 8635 citations screened, 56 full-text articles were assessed and 21 trials (1851 participants) were included. There was very low-quality evidence from six trials that calcitonin is no better than placebo or paracetamol, regardless of mode of administration or outcome assessed. From single small trials, there was low-quality evidence for prostaglandins, and very low-quality evidence for gabapentin or methylcobalamin that they improved walking distance. There was very low-quality evidence from a single trial that epidural steroid injections improved pain, function, and quality of life, up to two weeks, compared with home exercise or inpatient physical therapy. There was low-quality evidence from a single trial that exercise is of short-term benefit for leg pain and function compared with no treatment. There was low and very low-quality evidence from six trials that multimodal nonoperative treatment is less effective than indirect or direct surgical decompression with or without fusion. A meta-analysis of two trials comparing direct decompression with or without fusion to multimodal nonoperative care found no significant difference in function at six months (mean difference (MD) -3.66, 95% CI -10.12 to 2.80) and one year (MD -6.18, 95% CI -15.03 to 2.66), but at 24 months a significant difference was found favouring decompression (MD -4.43, 95% CI -7.91 to -0.96).

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate and high-quality evidence for nonoperative treatment is lacking and thus prohibits recommendations for guiding clinical practice. Given the expected exponential rise in the prevalence of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication, large high-quality trials are urgently needed.

### Study of percutaneous lumbar decompression and treatment algorithm for patients suffering from neurogenic claudication [^115rF6Z5]. Pain Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) patients often suffer from multiple etiologies, and patient symptoms must be differentiated and identified as either neurogenic claudication, radicular pain, or both. The most common symptom associated with LSS is neurogenic claudication, which has been reported to occur in 91% to 100% of the LSS patient population. Neurogenic claudication symptoms are described as pain radiating to the lower extremities that begins and worsens as the patient ambulates. Neurogenic claudication symptoms worsen over time and can eventually result in significant life-altering functional limitations. Symptomatic LSS patients may also suffer from radicular pain, which is a persistent pain transmitted through neural pathways, and is associated with inflammation of the exiting nerve root.

Objective

To assess patient safety, pain reduction, and functional status of patients treated with percutaneous lumbar decompression.

Study Design

Single-center, prospective clinical study of 46 consecutive patients with neurogenic claudication symptoms related to lumbar spinal stenosis.

Setting

US interventional pain management practice.

Methods

From March 2010 to January 2011, 46 LSS patients suffering from neurogenic claudication underwent mild percutaneous lumbar decompression. Of these, 12-week, 6-month and one-year follow-up was available for 35 patients.

Outcome Assessment

Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 12-week, 6-month and one-year follow-ups.

Results

One-year follow-up patients in this study experienced statistically and clinically significant improvement in physical function, as well as reduction of pain intensity. The initial improvement in these patients, which was significant, was sustained through one year, with no significant differences among the interim follow-up visit periods. These results demonstrate early improvement following treatment with a high degree of durability over time. There were no serious device or procedure-related complications reported in this study.

Limitations

Single-center study with no control group.

Conclusions

In this study, the mild procedure was shown to be safe. In addition, patients experienced significant improvement in mobility and reduction of pain one year after the procedure. One-year outcomes were not significantly different from interim results, indicating that the significant improvement following treatment, occurring as early as 12 weeks, was maintained through one year. This high degree of consistency over time indicates the durability of percutaneous lumbar decompression in the treatment of neurogenic claudication in symptomatic LSS.

### Effectiveness of interspinous implant surgery in patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Nsdnv]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

This review of the literature shows that surgical decompression with interspinous process devices is superior to conservative non-surgical treatment in patients with lumbar degenerative spinal stenosis with INC. However, the level of evidence for this conclusion is debatable due to the low quality of some of the included studies. Furthermore, no data is presently available comparing interspinous process decompression with standard bony decompression. We suggest that more studies will be done on this subject comparing the surgical treatment with IPD versus bony decompression. Despite the fact that we could give a Grade A recommendation, according to the Oxford-Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, we suggest that further studies have to be performed before a thorough recommendation can be given regarding the treatment of INC with IPDs. These studies should also include analysis on complication rate and device failure rate. As the evidence is relatively low and the costs are high, more thorough cost-effectiveness studies should be performed before worldwide implementation is introduced. Because the golden standard for surgical decompression seems to be absent, patients with lumbar spinal stenosis should be guarded against instrumented surgery or the use of IPD on the basis of the current evidence.

Oswestry Disability Index

The Oswestry Disability Index Questionnaire is utilized to evaluate, as a self-assessment, the degree of disability the patient feels due to their issues. Evaluations of the degree of spinal canal stenosis and the relationship between the patient's perceived disability level have been studied as well. Sirvanci et al. concluded that lumbar spinal stenosis remains a clinical radiologic syndrome. The clinical picture and MRI findings should be evaluated before making a decision to perform surgery. The patient's MRI should be used to determine the levels of decompression. However, Sirvanci et al. showed no correlation of central lateral recess stenosis vs Oswestry Disability Index.

Zurich Claudication Questionnaire

The Zurich Claudication Questionnaire was developed by Stucki et al. The claudication questionnaire is a disease-specific self-reported outcome instrument that was utilized for further treatment, which quantifies severity of symptoms, physical functioning characteristics, and the patient's satisfaction after treatment. It was designed to complement existing generic measures of lumbar spinal disability and health status specifically for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. An increased score shows worsening disability.

The Japanese Orthopedic Association Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire

The Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) updated the previous JOA score from 1986 and provided new outcome measures in 2007. The evaluation criteria for the evaluation were based on psychological, biological, and anatomical outcome measures resulting from the original Japanese Orthopedic Association score for low back pain. It was based on assessing the limitations of the original JOA scoring system developed in 1986. The new JOA scoring system contains a self-administered questionnaire and is a more accurate outcome measure for evaluating patients with low back pain.

### Gait analysis of patients with neurogenic intermittent claudication [^114J8ggX]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

The gait of patients with neurogenic intermittent claudication was analyzed before and after surgery using a ground reaction force plate.

Objectives

To analyze the gait characteristics of patients with neurogenic intermittent claudication, to evaluate quantitatively their gait improvement after surgical treatment, and to examine the differences in gait characteristics and postoperative improvement among different types of neuropathy.

Summary Of Background Data

A number of reports have been published on the pathophysiology or treatment of neurogenic intermittent claudication. However, almost no detailed reports exist on the gait abnormalities associated with this condition.

Methods

The subjects were 60 lumbar canal stenosis patients with intermittent claudication who underwent surgery at the authors' hospital. A ground reaction force plate was used for the analysis, and factors related to time and distance (speed, stride, interval, and pitch) were analyzed, as well as factors related to the style of walking (symmetry, reappearance, smoothness, sway, rhythm, and impact).

Results

Before surgery, there were abnormalities of various factors related to the style of walking soon after the patients began to walk. Gait analysis also showed that the pattern of gait abnormality and its improvement after surgery varied depending on the type of neuropathy.

Conclusions

Gait analysis permits objective and quantitative evaluation of the gait characteristics of patients with lumbar canal stenosis and is useful for evaluating responses to surgical treatment in these patients.

### The effectiveness of walking stick use for neurogenic claudication: results from a randomized trial and the effects on walking tolerance and posture [^1152U6T8]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Comer CM, Johnson MI, Marchant PR, Redmond AC, Bird HA, Conaghan PG. The effectiveness of walking stick use for neurogenic claudication: results from a randomized trial and the effects on walking tolerance and posture.

Objectives

To determine the immediate effects of using a stick on walking tolerance and on the potential explanatory variable of posture, and to provide a preliminary evaluation of the effects of daily walking stick use on symptoms and function for people with neurogenic claudication.

Design

A 2-phase study of neurogenic claudication patients comprising a randomized trial of 2 weeks of home use of a walking stick and a crossover study comparing walking tolerance and posture with and without a walking stick.

Setting

A primary care-based musculoskeletal service.

Participants

Patients aged 50 years or older with neurogenic claudication symptoms (N = 46; 24 women, 22 men, mean age = 71.26y) were recruited.

Intervention

Walking stick.

Main Outcome Measures

Phase 1 of the trial used the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire symptom severity and physical function scores to measure outcome. The total walking distance during a shuttle walking test and the mean lumbar spinal posture (measured by using electronic goniometry) were used as the primary outcome measurements in the second phase.

Results

Forty of the participants completed phase 1 of the trial, and 40 completed phase 2. No significant differences in symptom severity or physical function were shown in score improvements for walking stick users (stick user scores - control scores) in the 2-week trial (95% confidence interval [CI] -.24 to .28 and -.10 to .26, respectively). In the second phase of the trial, the ratio of the shuttle walking distance with a stick to without a stick showed no significance (95% CI, .959–1.096) between the groups. Furthermore, the use of a walking stick did not systematically promote spinal flexion; no significant difference was shown for mean lumbar spinal flexion for stick use versus no stick (95% CI, .351 degrees -.836 degrees).

Conclusions

The prescription of a walking stick does not improve walking tolerance or systematically alter the postural mechanisms associated with symptoms in neurogenic claudication.

Decompressive Laminectomy Without Fusion

Decompressive laminectomy without fusion is considered the gold standard surgical procedure for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis in the absence of other complicating spine pathology that is refractive to conservative treatment. With the patient in a prone position, imaging is used to guide the exposure and partial removal of the lamina, spinous process, facet joints, and soft tissue. Preservation of at least 50% of each facet joint and sufficient pars is necessary to avoid iatrogenic instability.

An updated, evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis found sufficient evidence to recommend surgical intervention for moderate to severe lumbar stenosis following failure of nonsurgical treatment. The SPORT, a multicenter randomized controlled trial (N = 289) with an observational cohort (N = 365) that evaluated surgical vs nonoperative treatment of stenosis, reported similar results at up to four years of follow-up. Patients who were treated surgically had significantly greater improvement in pain and function than did patients who were treated more conservatively. However, long-term analysis of patients in the randomized trial suggested diminishing benefits of surgery between four and eight years of follow-up, whereas outcomes for the observational cohort remained stable.

Although a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis of nine randomized clinical trials that studied the effectiveness of conservative vs surgical treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis found that the latter group had better clinical outcomes at one year, they also had a higher complication rate throughout the follow-up period. Further, there was a wide range of surgical and conservative methods used among the studies, and the authors were unable to conclusively recommend one approach over another.

Another challenge regarding the surgical treatment of spinal stenosis relates to whether single-level or multilevel laminectomy is more appropriate for multilevel disease. Two recent studies have suggested that single-level surgery is the preferred procedure for such patients. More specifically, in a prospective, multicenter cohort study of 141 patients, 23% of whom underwent single-level laminotomy and 77% of whom underwent multilevel decompression, the latter group was associated with significantly less favorable stenosis symptoms and function score, with no significant difference with respect to all other outcomes of interest between the two groups. Similarly, a retrospective study of 114 patients by Adilay and Guclu found that those undergoing single-level laminectomy (N = 48) experienced better recovery, in terms of disability score, pain score, and walking duration, than did those undergoing multilevel laminectomy (N = 64). The authors also reported that complications and postoperative spondylolisthesis were higher in the latter group.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of oxymorphone hydrochloride and propoxyphene / acetaminophen combination for the treatment of neurogenic claudication associated with lumbar spinal stenosis [^116QgpAA]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose crossover study.

Objective

To test the analgesic efficacy of oxymorphone hydrochloride (OH) and propoxyphene/acetaminophen (PA) for patients with neurogenic claudication associated with lumbar spinal stenosis.

Summary Of Background Data

Although opioids are often prescribed for neurogenic claudication, no randomized controlled studies support their efficacy for this condition. Patients with neurogenic claudication are generally excluded from clinical trials or included with patients who have nonspecific chronic low back pain, yielding a heterogeneous study population with very different pathophysiologies and clinical presentations.

Methods

Participants received a single dose of each of the 3 treatments in random order. Treatments were separated by at least 3-day washout periods. The primary outcome variable was the time to first treadmill walking-induced moderate pain (≥ 4 out of 10 on a Numeric Rating Scale) (Tfirst) assessed 90 minutes after treatment administration. Secondary outcome measures included patient global assessment of low back pain, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, Modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, Oswestry Disability Index, and Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire.

Results

The study was prematurely terminated because of the removal of PA from the US market. Twenty-four patients were randomized; 21 completed all 3 treatment periods. There were no significant differences among the treatment groups with respect to the median Tfirst (OH-placebo: median [98.3% confidence limits] = -0.25 min [-6.54, 5.00]; PA-placebo: 0.02 min [-7.65, 4.90]; OH-PA: -0.27 min [-5.56, 6.66]).

Conclusion

This trial failed to demonstrate a benefit of OH or PA in patients experiencing neurogenic claudication. Considering the potential negative side effects of chronic opioid use, additional research is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of sustained opioid treatment specifically for neurogenic claudication.

### Evaluation of outcome measures for neurogenic claudication: a patient-centered approach [^113rbS2A]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether patients with neurogenic claudication associated with lumbar spinal stenosis would prefer a treatment that makes it possible for them to walk farther or walk with less pain; to examine associations between this treatment preference and patient-reported and in-clinic treadmill testing measures of walking ability and walking-associated pain.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, 269 patients with neurogenic claudication were asked to report their pain intensity when walking, complete the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire, rank their outcome preferences for treatment, and undergo standardized treadmill testing, including measures of final pain rating and time to first pain of moderate intensity (Tfirst). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize patient preferences for treatment outcome. Associations between self-report questionnaires and standardized treadmill testing outcomes were evaluated using Spearman correlations.

Results

Seventy-nine percent of patients expressed a preference for treatment that allowed them to walk with less pain. Preference for reduced pain was associated with higher pain during daily walking, along with a shorter Tfirst and higher final pain severity on treadmill testing. In contrast, patient preference for treatment outcome was not associated with self-reported measures of daily walking capacity or walking distance on the treadmill.

Conclusions

A majority of patients with neurogenic claudication prioritized walking with reduced pain over walking farther. Reduction in pain while walking may therefore constitute a sufficient patient-focused treatment outcome for the majority of these patients. These results have implications for clinical trial design and assessment of treatment efficacy in neurogenic claudication.

### A retrospective, single-center, quantitative analysis of adverse events in patients undergoing spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication using a novel percutaneous direct lumbar decompression strategy [^111KWHrf]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low-back pain with accompanying neurogenic claudication is a common diagnosis in pain and spine centers around the world, with an evolving algorithm of treatment. In the interventional pain community, one option for the treatment of neurogenic claudication by decompressive strategies centers on percutaneous direct decompressive techniques. Up to 85% of spinal canal narrowing is attributed to some contribution of a hypertrophic ligamentum flavum, leading to central stenosis, and minimally invasive direct decompressive treatment debulks hypertrophic ligamentum flavum–relieving pressure caused by stenosis, while leaving no implants behind. Thirteen clinical studies and > 25 published papers have established the safety and long-term efficacy of percutaneous direct decompression, and a level 1 randomized controlled trial demonstrated similar safety for percutaneous direct decompression and epidural steroid injections. Although these data exist, patient selection for treatment candidacy and the procedure itself are evolving. Percutaneous direct decompression procedurally has evolved from a dedicated ipsilateral incision and epidurogram to a midline incision with or without the need for an epidurogram. Although this has been employed in clinical practice, there has been no formal investigation of the safety of percutaneous direct decompression without the use of an epidurogram and relying on osteal landmarks. The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety of percutaneous direct decompression performed without the use of an epidurogram, representing the first publication investigating the safety of the direct decompressive strategy without the use of contrast and placement of an epidural for an epidurogram.

### Interspinous process spacers [^112QnvEk]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

The patient with neurogenic claudication resulting from lumbar spinal stenosis who fails to experience satisfactory relief from nonsurgical measures has limited treatment options. Lumbar epidural steroid injections and surgical laminectomy are generally accepted alternatives for the patient with moderate to severe symptoms. Interspinous process spacers, a relatively new class of technology, are proposed for use in the patient who prefers less invasive surgery or in whom medical comorbidities preclude a major surgical procedure. Early data from biomechanical and clinical studies support the short-term efficacy of interspinous process spacers in treating claudication related to spinal stenosis. Sufficient medium- and long-term data are lacking, however, particularly with respect to durability of symptomatic relief and the risk of device migration or dislocation. Although interspinous process spacers are a promising new technology, the results of longer-term clinical follow-up studies are needed to more clearly define their role in the management of lumbar spinal stenosis.

Neurogenic Claudication

Claudication refers to intermittent pain in the lower extremities that is exacerbated by activity and relieved with rest. Neurogenic claudication must be differentiated from other mimickers, most significantly VC. NC is a pain syndrome whose etiology is LSS, which is a reduction in the cross-sectional area of the lumbar spinal canal. The symptoms of NC are thought to arise from a combination of mechanical compression and circulatory dysfunction within the cauda equina nerve roots. In addition to pain, patients with NC may complain of leg heaviness, numbness, tingling, and weakness. The pain from NC is classically worsened by lumbar extension and alleviated with lumbar flexion. The improvement in pain and facilitating of ambulation with forward flexion is sometimes called the positive shopping cart sign. The diagnosis of NC is made from the history and involves pain in the low back, buttocks, thighs, and/or legs that develops with prolonged standing and walking and is relieved when the patient sits down. The symptoms of NC are generally bilateral.

CT and MRI images of LSS have been shown to sometimes correlate poorly with lower extremity symptoms, and therefore, the history and examination remain important. A study of the reliability of differentiating NC from VC based on symptomatology has shown that the most sensitive symptom (sensitivity 0.97) to rule out NC was the absence of "triggering of pain with standing alone". This same study found that there was a strong likelihood of NC if patients showed a constellation of positive "shopping cart sign", symptoms above the knees, symptoms triggered with standing alone and symptoms relieved with sitting. Patients with symptoms in the calf relieved with standing alone had a strong likelihood of VC.

There is no gold standard diagnostic tool for NC and patients with radiographically severe LSS may be asymptomatic. In some settings, the diagnosis of NC is supported by a positive response to intralaminar lumbar epidural injection with steroid and local anesthetic or with local anesthetic alone. The published evidence has shown that such epidural injections provide both short- and long-term relief for patients with NC and can improve gait function. Thus, it is the opinion of the authors that a response to such injections can be helpful in making a diagnosis of NC.

### Effectiveness of calcitonin in intermittent claudication treatment of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review [^116T7fdz]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

Analyze the level of evidence in the effectiveness of calcitonin on the treatment of neurogenic claudication in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.

Summary Of Background Data

One of the most disabling features of lumbar spinal stenosis is neurogenic claudication. There have been proposed different drug therapies for it. The recommendation for calcitonin use in these patients has been sustained on autocontrolled clinical trial (Streifler et al, Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 1989;52:543–4), which only included 6 patients.

Material and Method

We performed a search on electronic databases that included Medline and Embase; we recovered 10 original articles, of which only 4 fulfilled the RCT criteria. These articles were reviewed independent and blinded way by 6 previously capacitated reviewers to extract data and score a quality of them by the criteria of Cochrane Handbook (1996) with maximum score of 1.00 and minimum score of 0.33.

Results

Score quality vary in the 4 articles: Porter and Millar, Spine 1988;13:1061–4 (score, 0.68), Eskola et al, Calcif Tissue Int 1992;50:400–3 (score, 0.88), Podichetty et al, Spine 2004;29:2343–9 (score, 0.88), and Tafazal et al, Eur Spine J 2007;16:207–12 (score, 0.92). Due to the great heterogenicity observed (sample sizes, selection criteria, doses, frequency, and duration of calcitonin, and outcome measurements), we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. Only one of these studies (Porter and Millar, Spine 1988;13:1061–4; score, 0.68) found favorable results for the use of calcitonin compared with placebo; of the 3 remaining trials none found significative evidence between drug therapy and placebo.

Conclusion

The present data suggest that calcitonin administration in the treatment for neurogenic claudication has no benefit in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.

### Objective real-world outcomes of patients suffering from painful neurogenic claudication treated with theProcedure: interim 6-month report of a randomized controlled trial [^114KMg56]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a serious degenerative condition of the spine that can cause significant functional disability. Therapies for these patients generally begin with conservative management, since more invasive interventions such as open surgery and spinal implants are associated with higher complication rates. Early in the treatment algorithm for LSS patients, multiple conventional medical management (CMM) therapies are often combined as an initial low-risk treatment strategy. This composite first-line treatment plan may include conservative care together with early interventional treatment options such as epidural steroid injections, radiofrequency ablation and the mild ® Procedure.

Methods

This prospective randomized controlled trial evaluates patients aged 50 to 80 years treated with mild plus CMM, compared to those treated with CMM alone, as the active control. Walking tolerance test outcomes and incidence of subsequent disallowed procedures provided objective real-world outcome data. The incidence of device or procedure-related adverse events was analyzed. Follow-up includes 6-month, 1-year and 2-year assessments, with 1-year being primary. Patients in the mild +CMM group are followed at 3, 4, and 5 years. This is a report of interim 6-month outcomes.

Results

Of 155 patients enrolled at 19 US interventional pain management centers, 78 were allocated to CMM-Alone, and 77 to mild +CMM. At 6-months, the validated walking tolerance test demonstrated statistical superiority of mild +CMM versus CMM-Alone (p < 0.001). The incidence of patients receiving a subsequent disallowed procedure, and thereby considered treatment failures in their study group, was statistically significantly higher in CMM-Alone versus mild +CMM (p < 0.001). There were no device or procedure-related adverse events in either group.

Conclusion

At 6-months, the mild Procedure combined with CMM provided statistically superior objective real-world outcomes versus CMM-Alone. There were no device or procedure-related adverse events reported in either study group. With its excellent safety profile and superior efficacy, mild is uniquely positioned as early first-line therapy.

Objective 2 - To explore the associations of patient and surgical characteristics with those achieving a minimum clinically important difference on the ODI

In the first, primary analysis (n = 1957), we found that more severe baseline back pain reduced the odds of reaching the MCID post-surgery (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.9, 0.9) (see Table 5).

In the second analysis (n = 718), we found that undergoing revision surgery (OR 0.5 (95% CI 0.3, 0.7) and more severe baseline back pain (OR 0.9, 95%CI 0.8, 0.9) reduced the odds of achieving the MCID at 6-months post-surgery, whereas undergoing a fusion resulted in a 90% increase in the likelihood of reaching the MCID in ODI (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3, 2.7).

Finally, when including 6-week post-surgery outcome measures (n = 573), severe disability at baseline (ODI > 41/100) (OR 1.9, 95%CI 1.2, 3.0) increased the odds of achieving the MCID in ODI, whereas worse back pain at 6-weeks (OR 0.7, 95%CI 0.6, 0.8), worse leg pain (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.8, 1.0) and severe (ODI > 41/100) disability at 6-weeks (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2, 0.5) reduced the odds of achieving the MCID in ODI at 6-months post-surgery.

### Managing claudication in the community setting [^116qXNxp]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Advances made in medical management and treatment options in addressing lower extremity claudication and vascular disease have skyrocketed during the last decade. Given the recent advances in treatment options, there is often the perception within the medical community and general community that to get the most "cutting edge" treatment, one must go to an academic center or practitioner. The goal of this portion of the discussion is to explore the question of what differences in treatment options there are between a community practice and an academic practice within those members of the vascular surgery specialty. Are there really any differences in the types of treatments offered or availability of the different modalities, and what drives us as practitioners to one over the other?

Minimally Invasive Lumbar Decompression

Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy causing compression and stenosis and resulting intermittent neurogenic claudication can be treated by a minimally invasive method of removal of a small amount of laminae and thinning of the ligament. To be a candidate for this procedure, the ligament should be > 2.5 mm and should be a major contributing factor to the stenosis. It should be noted that comorbidities can be present, and the use of this technique is not limited to solitary disease states of the ligament. Guidance for using this technique including patient selection and outcomes, is outlined in the Minimally Invasive Spine Treatment protocol guidelines paper.

Outcome measurements

There are various classifications to describe neurological and functional outcome of patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication. Articles were filtered on presence of one of the four mostly used outcome scales. Firstly, articles were included on the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ), also known as the Brigham Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire and Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire. The ZCQ scale consists of three subscales: symptom severity, physical function and patient satisfaction. Domain scores ranges from 1 to 5, 1 to 4, and 1 to 4, respectively. Like in the study of Tuli in 2006, we chose threshold scores for each scale based on prior work. In the symptom severity scale and in the physical function scale the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is 0.5. A mean patient satisfaction score of less than 2.5 has been shown previously to represent a satisfied patient. Secondly, articles were used on the Modified Roland Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica (MRDQ). The 23-points MRDQ is the most widely used patient-assessed measure of health for low back pain and leg pain. This questionnaire consists of 23 questions with higher scores indicating increased disability. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is one of the most used follow-up measurement tools for back pain and leg pain. This parameter will measure the experienced back and leg pain intensity in the week before visiting the research nurse. Pain will be assessed on a horizontal 100 mm scale varying from 0 mm, "no pain", to 100 mm, "the worst pain imaginable". This parameter has a MCID of two points on a scale of 0 to 10. Finally, the Oswestry disability index (ODI), where 0 indicates no disability and 100 indicates worst possible disability, was included for our analysis. This parameter has a MCID of 10.0–12.4 points.

### Objective real-world outcomes of patients suffering from painful neurogenic claudication treated with theProcedure: interim 6-month report of a randomized controlled trial [^111p9287]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), a serious degenerative condition of the spine, is associated with significant functional disability and chronic pain. LSS is caused by structural narrowing of the spinal canal and resulting ischemic compression of neural elements leading to symptomatic neurogenic claudication. Intervertebral disc degeneration, hypertrophic ligamentum flavum (HLF), and bony pathology are consistently present in patients with neurogenic claudication. This range of pathologies can lead to central canal stenosis as well as foraminal and lateral recess stenosis. HLF is a major cause of neurogenic claudication for LSS patients, and contributes up to 85% of spinal canal narrowing.LSS patients suffering from neurogenic claudication commonly present with multiple types of stenosis and numerous spinal comorbidities. Therapies for these patients generally begin with conservative management, since more invasive interventions such as interspinous spacers, surgical decompression and spinal fusion are associated with higher complication rates. Early in the treatment algorithm for LSS patients, multiple conventional medical management (CMM) therapies are often combined as an initial low-risk treatment strategy. This composite first-line treatment plan may include physical therapy, home exercise programs, and pain medication, together with early interventional procedures such as epidural steroid injections, radiofrequency ablation and the mild ® Procedure (Vertos Medical, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA).

The MOTION study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating functional improvement in LSS patients aged 50–80 years with neurogenic claudication who are treated with the mild Procedure plus CMM (mild +CMM), compared to those treated with CMM alone (CMM-Alone), as the active control. Patients in the control group are able to crossover and receive mild after completion of 1-year follow-up and prior to 2-years. The goal of the MOTION study is to provide Level 1 evidence of the safety and effectiveness of mild +CMM versus CMM-Alone in managing neurogenic claudication symptoms in patients with verified HLF as a contributing factor. Validated functional improvement measures provide objective outcome data for patients treated with the mild Procedure as first-line therapy in a real-world setting that does not restrict the use of adjunctive conventional medical management measures in either study group. The MOTION study is registered with the US Clinical Trial Registry (NCT03610737). Interim 6-month objective real-world outcomes for patients enrolled in this study are reported.

### Nonoperative treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication: a systematic review [^1156N31a]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of nonoperative treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication.

Summary Of Background Data

Neurogenic claudication can significantly impact functional ability, quality of life, and independence in the elderly. METHODS.: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ICL databases up to January 2011 for randomized controlled trials published in English, in which at least 1 arm provided data on nonoperative treatments. Risk of bias in each study was independently assessed by 2 reviewers using 12 criteria. Quality of the evidence was evaluated using Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).

Results

From the 8635 citations screened, 56 were assessed and 21 trials with 1851 participants were selected. There is very low-quality evidence from 6 trials that calcitonin is no better than placebo or paracetamol, regardless of mode of administration or outcome. From single small trials, there is low-quality evidence that prostaglandins, and very low-quality evidence that gabapentin or methylcobalamin, improve walking distance. There is very low-quality evidence from a single trial that epidural steroid injections improve pain, function, and quality of life up to 2 weeks compared with home exercise or inpatient physical therapy. There is low-quality evidence from a single trial that exercise is of short-term benefit for leg pain and function compared with no treatment. There is low- and very low-quality evidence from 6 trials that multimodal nonoperative treatment is less effective than indirect or direct surgical decompression with or without fusion.

Conclusion

Moderate- and high-GRADE evidence for nonoperative treatment is lacking and thus prohibiting recommendations to guide clinical practice. Given the expected exponential rise in the prevalence of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication, large high-quality trials are urgently needed.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of minimally invasive lumbar decompression procedure for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication: 2-year results of MiDAS ENCORE [^117KBb3y]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Neurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is associated with debilitating pain in the lower back and extremities and is the cause of significant functional limitation, especially in the elderly population. Neurogenic claudication symptoms are precipitated by walking and relieved by sitting. It is believed that spinal extension (walking and standing) produces neurogenic claudication symptoms by reducing the cross-sectional area of the central canal, resulting in nerve root compression and painful nerve root ischemia. This compression is relieved with spinal flexion, which causes the central canal to expand, leading to pain relief and resolution of neurogenic claudication symptoms. Unlike symptoms of radicular pain, the distribution of symptoms related to neurogenic claudication is not usually dermatomal. Radicular pain is related to inflammation of an affected nerve root and generally radiates from the back and buttock into the leg in a dermatomal pattern.

Patients suffering from neurogenic claudication almost always present with degenerative soft tissue and bony pathology related to a combination of disc protrusion, thickened or ossified ligamentum flavum, facet joint hypertrophy, or osteophytes. – In 1 report by Hansson and colleagues, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy (LFH) contributed to between 50% and 85% of central canal narrowing, leading the authors to conclude that the ligamentum flavum plays a dominant role in the load-induced narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal. Further, one of the common characteristics of neurogenic claudication is the high frequency of multiple-level stenosis.

The MiDAS ENCORE study was approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as a Coverage with Evidence Development study for the purpose of providing level I evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of the MILD procedure. This randomized controlled trial assessed outcomes of the MILD procedure compared with epidural steroid injections (ESIs) in subjects with LSS and neurogenic claudication symptoms, with verified LFH as a contributing factor. Study follow-up intervals occurred at 6 months and 1 year for the randomized phase of the study, and subjects in the MILD treatment group were followed at 2 years. Study design and 6-month and 1-year follow-up comparative results between MILD and ESI were previously reported. – This is a report of 2-year clinical outcomes of patients treated with the MILD procedure in the MiDAS ENCORE study.

### Aortic flap valve presenting as neurogenic claudication: a case report [^117X3GTv]. Spine (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case report of a patient who presented with pain in both lower limbs related with walking and standing as a result of an unusual vascular etiology.

Objectives

To describe the pathology and treatment of an unusual case of vascular claudication.

Summary Of Background Data

Symptoms of neurogenic claudication may be mimicked by intermittent vascular claudication. Not infrequently, arterial disease coexists with spinal canal stenosis. Determination of correct diagnosis is the prerequisite for effective treatment.

Methods

The patient was a 64-year-old woman who presented with bilateral buttock pain spreading to the calves. The symptom was related to walking and climbing stairs and relieved by sitting down. MRI of the lumbosacral spine corroborated severe spinal stenosis at L3-L4 and L4-L5. Based on findings on physical examination of the peripheral pulses, an aortogram revealed a flap in the lumen functioning like a valve as the cause of her lower limb ischemic pain.

Results

The patient was managed by insertion of a self-expandable metallic stent with complete resolution of her symptoms.

Conclusions

We report a case that was diagnosed as neurogenic claudication on clinical features and MRI evidence. However, subsequent to an aortogram the diagnosis was revised. Intermittent claudication is often difficult to distinguish from neurogenic claudication. There are no sensitive discriminators based on history alone. In the presence of poor or absent peripheral pulses, an arteriogram is necessary to ascertain the relative importance of the peripheral arterial circulation.

### Degenerative spondylolisthesis in patients with neurogenic claudication effects functional performance and self-reported quality of life [^116z6zhK]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

The effect of degenerative spondylolisthesis on functional performance and self reported quality of life in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis was compared to patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and no degenerative spondylolisthesis.

Objective

To define the relationship degenerative spondylolisthesis shares with functional performance and self reported quality of life in patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis.

Summary Of Background Data

Neurogenic claudication is a clinical syndrome that reflects symptoms caused by anatomic spinal stenosis. This condition limits functional status and impacts overall health satisfaction. Degenerative spondylolisthesis is one cause of spinal stenosis and is present to different degrees in patients with neurogenic claudication.

Methods

Thirty-eight women and 39 men diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication were prospectively enrolled in the study. All underwent routine, screening side-lying, lateral flexion and extension radiographs. The evaluation included a shuttle walking test, as well as patient self-assessment using the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire, and Short Form 36.

Results

The overall walking distance did not differ based on the presence of degenerative spondylolisthesis. No correlation between magnitude of deformity and decreased walking distance was identified. Men walked on average 231.3 m (SD: 159.2) and women walked 251.3 m (SD: 138.4). No statistical difference was noted between men and women and their walking ability (P < 0.56). The Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire and the Short Form 36 were both strongly correlated with decreased walking ability (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

The presence and magnitude of degenerative spondylolisthesis does not correlate with decreased functional capacity. The Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire and Short Form 36 are accurate in defining the functional status of a patient. Comprehensive evaluation of patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis using functional assessment and self-assessment questionnaires are helpful in determining the severity of a patient's disability. Plain radiographs may be valuable adjuncts for surgical decision-making, but are not useful in quantifying the degree to which a patient is impaired.

### Interspinous process device versus standard conventional surgical decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis: randomised controlled trial [^112gYU4Y]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Question

Is interspinous process device implantation more effective in the short term (eight weeks) than conventional surgical decompression for patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis?

Summary Answer

The use of interspinous implants did not result in a better outcome than conventional decompression, but the reoperation rate was significantly higher.

What Is Known and What This Paper Adds

Bony decompression and treatment with interspinous process devices are superior to conservative and non-surgical treatment for intermittent neurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis. Interspinous implants surgery is not superior to bony decompression, and the reoperation rate is significantly higher.

### A review of lumbar spinal stenosis with intermittent neurogenic claudication: disease and diagnosis [^116gJNrs]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a degenerative spinal condition affecting nearly 50% of patients presenting with lower back pain. The goal of this review is to present and summarize the current data on how LSS presents in various populations, how it is diagnosed, and current therapeutic strategies. Properly understanding the prevalence, presentation, and treatment options for individuals suffering from LSS is critical to providing patients the best possible care.

Results

The occurrence of LSS is associated with advanced age. In elderly patients, LSS can be challenging to identify due to the wide variety of presentation subtleties and common comorbidities such as degenerative disc disease. Recent developments in imaging techniques can be useful in accurately identifying the precise location of the spinal compression. Treatment options can range from conservative to surgical, with the latter being reserved for when patients have neurological compromise or conservative measures have failed. Once warranted, there are several surgical techniques at the physician's disposal to best treat each individual case.

Interventions

The mild Procedure

The mild Procedure is used to treat LSS patients suffering from neurogenic claudication by selectively removing small portions of lamina and HLF, and thereby relieving pressure on nerve roots. mild devices are designed to percutaneously access the interlaminar space through a 5.1mm port positioned in the patient's posterior lumbar spine. Generally, only moderate sedation and local anesthetic are required, and the small access port minimizes trauma to tissue and bony structures of the spine. mild treatment can be performed unilaterally or bilaterally, and at multiple levels. mild leaves no implants behind, and patients typically resume normal activity within 24 hours with no restrictions. The mild Procedure has been previously described. All study mild Procedures were conducted in accordance with the product labeling and indications for use.

Conventional Medical Management

Conventional Medical Management involves treatment with one or more conservative or interventional therapies that are commonly used for early treatment of LSS with neurogenic claudication. The study investigators at each site determine what CMM is optimal for each patient. CMM therapies may include physical therapy, home exercise programs, pain medication, epidural steroid injections (ESIs), nerve blocks, facet joint injections, medial branch injections, trigger point injections, sacroiliac joint injections, radiofrequency ablation and other conservative therapies such as back brace, walking aid, and chiropractic care. All CMM therapies performed are documented and reported throughout the course of the study.

### The evaluation of four non-operative treatments for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis… [^113ZqEF6]. ClinicalTrials (2015). Low credibility.

the Evaluation of Four Non-operative Treatments for Degenerative Lumbar Spinal StenosisClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis or osteoarthritis of the spine is a leading cause of pain, disability, and loss of independence in older adults. It is a chronic disease caused by age related degenerative narrowing of the spinal canal that can lead to compression and ischemia of the spinal nerves. The clinical syndrome of DLSS is known as neurogenic claudication. It is characterized by bilateral or unilateral buttock and/or lower extremity pain, heaviness, numbness, tingling or weakness, precipitated by walking and standing and relieved by sitting and bending forward. Limited walking ability is the dominant functional impairment caused by DLSS.

The investigators have conducted two systematic reviews of the literature, one assessing the effectiveness of non-surgical treatments for neurogenic claudication which included randomized controlled trials assessing improvements in pain, disability, quality of life or global improvement; the other evaluated the effectiveness of surgical or non-surgical interventions and included only RCTs that assessed improved walking ability. the investigators learned from these reviews that the evidence for interventions that improve outcomes including walking ability in neurogenic claudication due to DLSS is lacking. In addition to the structural arthritic changes causing narrowing of the spinal canal, DLSS has an important dynamic component. The volume of the spinal canal and degree of epidural pressure and ischemia of the spinal nerves can change depending on spinal posture.

Both lumbar flexion, and sitting increase the diameter of the canal and reduce spinal nerve ischemia, and correspond with a reduction or elimination of lower extremity symptoms. There are numerous human studies demonstrating significant reduction in laboratory induced ischemic pain in the lower and upper extremities with paraspinal TENS compared to placebo TENS. Moreover, there is low quality evidence from one case series suggesting that electrical stimulation may be effective for the management of neurogenic claudication. Higher quality studies are needed to assess whether paraspinal TENS applied while walking improves walking ability, as this could be an innovative, convenient, and inexpensive self-management strategy for DLSS patients.

- Severe osteoarthrosis or arthritis of lower extremities causing limited walking ability
- Neurologic disease causing impaired function of the lower limbs, including diabetes
- Psychiatric disorders and /or cognitively impaired.

### Exercise treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and intervention component analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115VQea5]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyse the components used in exercise interventions for people with symptoms of neurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis and identify components associated with successful interventions.

Data sources

Eligible papers published up to April 2023 from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and trial registry websites.

Review methods

Literature searches were performed by an Information Specialist. We searched for randomised trials evaluating exercise interventions for people with neurogenic claudication symptoms (the primary symptom of lumbar spinal stenosis). Two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, and quality assessments using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool Version 2 and the TIDieR checklist for intervention reporting. Details of intervention components were extracted, tabulated, and synthesised using an intervention component analysis approach.

Results

We found thirteen trials reporting 23 exercise interventions delivered to 1440 participants. These featured 60 different components. Most exercise interventions included supervision and flexion-based exercises. Balance exercises were rarely included. Exercise components featured more frequently in successful interventions included stretches, strength or trunk muscle exercises, fitness exercises, especially cycling, and psychologically informed approaches. Interpretation is limited by low study numbers and heterogeneity. No conclusions could be drawn about exercise supervision or dose.

Discussion

Exercise interventions for people with neurogenic claudication typically feature multiple components. Common features such as supervision, lumbar flexion, and aerobic fitness exercises and also less common features such as stretches, strengthening exercises, and psychologically informed approaches warrant consideration for inclusion when designing and optimising exercise interventions for people with lumbar spinal stenosis.

### Imaging of spinal stenosis: neurogenic intermittent claudication and cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^1115HV1s]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Spinal stenosis in either the cervical or lumbar spinal segments is one of the most common indications for spine imaging and intervention, particularly among the elderly. This article examines the pathophysiology and imaging of the corresponding clinical syndromes, cervical spondylotic myelopathy or neurogenic intermittent claudication. The specificity fault of spine imaging is readily evident in evaluation of spinal stenosis, as many patients with anatomic cervical or lumbar central canal narrowing are asymptomatic. Imaging also may be insensitive to dynamic lesions. Those imaging features that identify symptomatic patients, or predict response to interventions, are emphasized.

### Interspinous process devices for the treatment of neurogenic intermittent claudication: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^113JqgVZ]. Neurosurgical Review (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to compare interspinous process device (IPD) implantation to other methods for the treatment of neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC). PubMed and Cochrane library were searched in December 2014. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IPD implantation and nonoperative therapy or laminectomy with/without spinal fusion for the treatment of NIC due to spinal stenosis or low-grade degenerative spondylolisthesis were included. Meta-analysis and qualitative analysis were conducted as appropriate. Eleven articles (eight RCTs) were included, with two having high risk of bias. These RCTs were divided into three groups according to control cohort interventions: IPD implantation was compared with nonoperative treatment (group 1, n = 3), laminectomy (group 2, n = 3), and laminectomy associated with instrumented spinal fusion (group 3, n = 2). Group 1 studies reported better Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) scores for the IPD group. In group 2, two studies reported comparable ZCQ scores and one revealed comparable visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores; pooled analysis showed a higher reoperation rate in patients treated with IPD. In group 3, one study found that more patients in IPD group gained more than 25% improvement in VAS and ODI, with lower complication rate; the other reported better ZCQ scores in the IPD group and comparable complication and reoperation rates. IPD implantation is more effective than the other methods, but not superior to laminectomy in treating NIC.

### A retrospective, single-center, quantitative analysis of adverse events in patients undergoing spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication using a novel percutaneous direct lumbar decompression strategy [^114f9SPE]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low-back pain with accompanying neurogenic claudication is a common diagnosis in pain and spine centers around the world, with an evolving algorithm of treatment. One option for the treatment of neurogenic claudication by decompressive strategies centers on percutaneous direct decompressive techniques. Although commonly employed in clinical practice, there have been no formal investigations looking at safety of percutaneous direct decompression without the use of an epidurogram and relying on osteal landmarks. The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety of percutaneous direct decompression performed without the use of the epidurogram.

Methods

After an IRB exemption had been obtained from the Western Investigational Review Board, data were retrospectively analyzed from July 2018 to August 2020 on patients that had undergone percutaneous direct decompression using the Mild procedure in a single center by a single physician. Data were analyzed quantitatively for reported complications within 3 months of the procedure, including nerve injury, hematoma, infection, death, or allergic reaction to contrast use.

Results

Chart review yielded 147 individual patients who had undergone percutaneous direct decompression from July 2018 to August 2020. In this data set, women outnumbered men, with an average age of 76 years, with L4-L5 followed by L3-L4 being the most common levels decompressed. Of the 147 patients was performed, utilizing an epidurogram versus no epidurogram for decompression, with no complications. These data are the first to describe the safety of percutaneous direct lumbar decompression without the use of contrast.

Conclusion

This study strongly suggests the use of an epidurogram is not necessary for the safe decompression of a patient with symptomatic spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication utilizing percutaneous direct decompression.

### Objective real-world outcomes of patients suffering from painful neurogenic claudication treated with theProcedure: interim 6-month report of a randomized controlled trial [^114VtGBy]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Six-month results of this RCT demonstrate that the mild Procedure combined with CMM provides statistically superior objective real-world outcomes versus CMM-Alone for LSS patients with neurogenic claudication and verified ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. There were no device or procedure-related adverse events reported in either MOTION study group. This strong overall level of safety supports the positioning of these conservative and interventional therapies early in the treatment algorithm due to their established low risk. With its excellent safety profile and superior efficacy, mild is uniquely positioned as early first-line therapy.

### A review of lumbar spinal stenosis with intermittent neurogenic claudication: disease and diagnosis [^115vdUJ2]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgical Treatment

Surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis is typically performed when nonsurgical treatment, such as those listed previously, does not sufficiently relieve a patient's symptoms. It is the most common reason for spinal surgery among patients aged 65 years or older. The objective of the surgery is to increase the cross-sectional area of the spinal canal at the level of the stenosis, in an effort to decrease the pressure on the affected nerves. In most cases, the surgery is considered elective, as its purpose is to alleviate symptoms and improve function, rather than prevent neurologic impairment. Exceptions include patients who are myelopathic or have symptoms of cauda equina and therefore require surgery to prevent neurologic decline.

In a study of patients with lumber spinal stenosis who originally opted for nonsurgical treatment, approximately 30% subsequently requested surgery. However, a recent systematic review of 26 published studies, including five randomized controlled trials, was unable to conclude whether lumbar spinal stenosis is best treated using a surgical or a more conservative approach, primarily due to a lack of well-designed research.

Patient characteristics predictive of a good clinical outcome following surgery for spinal stenosis vary significantly between studies. However, a systematic review of 21 studies reported that negative predictors included depression, a concomitant disorder influencing walking capacity, cardiovascular comorbidity, and scoliosis. Smoking also seems to be associated with negative surgical outcomes. In contrast, positive predictors were male gender, younger age, better walking ability, better self-rated health, less comorbidity, and more pronounced canal stenosis.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guideline on the management of intermittent claudication: focused update [^114SRZtM]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Intermittent claudication — combining revascularization with exercise (PICO question background): The guideline frames the question, "In patients with IC, what are the outcomes of vascular intervention combined with exercise vs exercise without intervention?" It states that guidelines "recommend exercise therapy for appropriate patients prior to consideration of revascularization interventions, with selective use of the latter when symptomatic response to exercise therapy is inadequate". It emphasizes that "Limited evidence exists, however, regarding the additive or complementary effects of exercise therapy and revascularization used either sequentially or combined", that "available evidence related to these additional questions was inadequate at the time of this update", and that "The evidence summary within the current update is therefore limited to interval updates from studies comparing revascularization plus exercise therapy vs exercise therapy alone".

### Effectiveness of interspinous implant surgery in patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113fyFg7]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intermittent neurogenic claudication (INC) is a complex of symptoms, the most important being leg pain and numbness (frequently in both legs) with possibly associated back pain. The symptoms can be diminished by flexion of the lumbar spine. Lumbar spinal arthrosis inducing arthrosis of the facet is associated with INC. Traditionally, bony decompression of the canal and the lateral recessus seems to be the golden standard in the treatment of INC. There is some evidence that bony decompression is a proven superior therapy compared with non-surgical therapy, such as steroid injections or physiotherapy. Less invasive strategies have been developed to minimize the perioperative damage, such as unilateral laminotomy or endoscopic procedures. Although surgery is frequently offered, detailed outcome results are not available and spine surgeons try to develop innovative less invasive surgical approaches to gain better outcome than the results observed in daily practice.

Parallel to these developments, interspinous implants for interspinous process distraction devices (IPD) have been developed to achieve indirect decompression. The design of the implants aims at limitation of lumbar extension and increasing the interlaminar space of the affected level. Nowadays, the technique is widely used. Kyphon Inc. had a worldwide X-STOP ™ net sale, in the first quarter of 2007, of 18.1 million USD. Paradigm Spine Inc. reported in May 2010 a worldwide sale of 13,128 Coflex ™ devices in 2009. The existing evidence seems to be poor; almost no comparative studies between conventional surgical decompression and surgery with IPD are done. Some claim, performing IPD placement in day surgery and with local anesthesia will lower the costs. However, a thorough cost-analysis has never been performed.

The main objective of this systematic review was to evaluate if surgery with IPD is more effective compared with bony decompression in the treatment of patients with INC or at least more effective compared with conservative (e.g. steroid injections) treatment.

Diagnosis and Evaluation of Lumbar Spinal Stenosis

There are no widely accepted gold standard diagnosis criteria for LSS, but the presence of imaging showing narrowing of the spinal neural structure is a necessary finding. Confirmatory diagnosis typically consists of assessing history, physical examination, and radiographic images. History should be consistent with pain while standing or walking that is relieved by forward flexion or sitting. Typical clinical features include lower extremity pain with equivocal straight leg raise testing and softs signs of radiculopathy. In many cases, the physical examination is normal while sitting, including reflexes, strength, and sensation. Imaging showing disc bulging, loss of disc height, facet joint arthropathy, osteophyte formation, and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy can lead to narrowing of the spinal canal. With the extension of the spine, the laminar edges of adjacent vertebral bodies overlap with relaxation and inward buckling of the ligamentum flavum, along with the movement of the superior facets in a rostral-anterior direction. Neurogenic claudication occurs as a result of ischemia (due to venous congestion and diminished arterial blood flow) or mechanical compression of nerve roots and is defined by pain or radiculopathy in the buttocks and/or lower extremities that worsens with walking and improves with forward bending or sitting. Walking may additionally exacerbate symptoms, as the demand for increase in oxygen in the spinal nerve roots may exceed the available blood flow.

Spinal canal narrowing might also be exacerbated by the shifting of one vertebral body anteriorly or posteriorly, relative to the adjacent vertebral body. This condition is known as spondylolisthesis. The lumbosacral joint is exposed to extensive anterior-directed shear forces. The paired facet joints, pars interarticularis, and intervertebral discs are the main anatomical structures that are subjected to these forces. Degenerative spondylolisthesis occurs due to the aging process. It is associated with the occurrence of marked facet joint arthritis with rotatory vertebral slip and occurs most frequently at L4–5, although it can be seen at other levels. Isthmic spondylolisthesis occurs due to a defect in the pars interarticularis (whether congenital or acquired) and occurs most often at L5-S1. In isthmic spondylolisthesis, the intervertebral disc preserves the stability of the spinal segment. Once disc degeneration occurs, the main source of stability is lost and the vertebral slip increases. This is an important differentiating factor when determining treatment options for lumbar spinal stenosis.

Anterior Spine vs Posterior Elements

The biomechanics of the spine depend on the pattern of stress on the vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs, and ligamentous structures during flexion, extension, rotations, and bending. Each vertebra consists of three columns: the anterior column, middle column, and posterior column. The anterior column carries the axial load and resists extension. It consists of the anterior longitudinal ligament, anterior two-thirds of the vertebral body, and annulus fibrosus. The middle column ensures resistance to flexion and carries a part of the axial load. It consists of the posterior longitudinal ligament, posterior third of the vertebral bodies, annulus fibrosis, and nucleus pulposus. The posterior column ensures resistance to flexion and provides stability during rotation and lateral bending. It consists of the pedicles, facet joints, ligamentum flavum, interspinous ligaments, and supraspinous ligaments.

The anterior spine consists of the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs protected by strong annulus fibrosus and cartilaginous endplates above and below. The intervertebral discs (IVDs) are the largest avascular structures in the body, and the nutrition of the discs is by diffusion from endplates. Progressive degenerative process may involve endplates, further decreasing nutrition and enhancing dehydrogenation of discs, and eventually triggering the most common progressive disability, degenerative disc disease. Even though the etiology of DDD is poorly understood, it is widely accepted that the aging process promotes dehydration by decreasing the water content of the IVDs. Genetic factors based on twin studies and mice knockout studies, along with environmental factors including overuse injuries, falls, smoking, and obesity, have been identified as contributing factors to DDD.

The presence of a stenotic spinal canal on MRI is not diagnostic of LSS due to poor correlation to symptomatology. There is no significant correlation between the area of the dural sac and clinical symptoms of spinal stenosis. Clinical diagnosis becomes more challenging due to overlapping symptomatology in degenerative LSS, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and peripheral neuropathy. Leg pain and back pain seem to be the primary symptoms of LSS; however, pain and numbness in the leg are also reported as primary symptoms of LSS. Weakness of the lower extremities, sensory changes, areflexia, and bladder or bowel incontinence are symptoms of advanced LSS. Therefore, difficulties in walking and deformity of the lower extremities can be results of the neurological abnormality effects of LSS.

### A review of emerging evidence for utilization of a percutaneous interspinous process decompression device to treat symptomatic lumbar adjacent-segment degeneration [^1123Sp53]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The spine is vulnerable to progressive disease. Furthermore, mechanical changes associated with spinal instrumentation can lead to additional disease at adjacent levels. Many individuals will present with symptomatic neurogenic claudication recalcitrant to multimodal management strategies, including even the most sophisticated neuromodulation technologies. This has led to extension of the instrumentation in many cases. The possibility of less invasive therapies should be considered in this patient group. Indirect lumbar decompression via interspinous spacer is an emerging minimally invasive technique for patients with a history of implanted spinal cord stimulators or spinal instrumentation who continue to experience symptoms due to progressive neurogenic claudication.

### Double-blind, randomized, controlled, crossover trial of pregabalin for neurogenic claudication [^111pa2ai]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To test the effects of pregabalin on the induction of neurogenic claudication.

Methods

This study was a randomized, double-blind, active placebo-controlled, 2-period, crossover trial. Twenty-nine subjects were randomized to receive pregabalin followed by active placebo (i.e., diphenhydramine) or active placebo followed by pregabalin. Each treatment period lasted 10 days, including a 2-step titration. Periods were separated by a 10-day washout period, including a 3-day taper phase after the first period. The primary outcome variable was the time to first moderate pain symptom (Numeric Rating Scale score ≥ 4) during a 15-minute treadmill test (Tfirst). Secondary outcome measures included pain intensity at rest, pain intensity at the end of the treadmill test, distance walked, and validated self-report measures of pain and functional limitation including the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, Oswestry Disability Index, and Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire.

Results

No significant difference was found between pregabalin and active placebo for the time to first moderate pain symptom (difference in median Tfirst = -1.08 [95% confidence interval -2.25 to 0.08], p = 0.61). In addition, none of the secondary outcome measures of pain or functional limitation were significantly improved by pregabalin compared with active placebo.

Conclusions

Pregabalin was not more effective than active placebo in reducing painful symptoms or functional limitations in patients with neurogenic claudication associated with lumbar spinal stenosis.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class I evidence that for patients with neurogenic claudication, compared with diphenhydramine, pregabalin does not increase the time to moderate pain during a treadmill test.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of spinal stenosis… [^111VVzaB]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Spinal stenosis is a narrowing or stricture of the lower part of the spinal canal that results in neurogenic claudication. Symptoms begin with progressive degenerative changes and compression, although the severity is not necessarily associated with the degree of compression seen on imaging studies. The etiology can be congenital or acquired. Congenital stenosis typically causes symptoms earlier in life. Biomechanical and biochemical changes lead to decreased disc height with annular bulging, disc herniation and early osteophyte formation. The foraminal space narrows, resulting in nerve entrapment. A gradual shift in spinal alignment exacerbates the stenosis, exerting additional pressure on the neural elements. Decreased rotational accommodation coupled with altered motion cause inflammation of the cauda equina and, ultimately, pain. Compression combined with inflammation and irritation of the nerve root causes symptoms in the lower extremities.

Decreased blood flow can be another factor related to symptoms. Early symptoms are often insidious in onset, with vague complaints of lower back pain and stiffness. Symptoms are exacerbated by activity and relieved by rest. The classic symptoms of spinal stenosis, or acute neurogenic claudication, involve the lower extremities and include pain, numbness and tingling in the posterior or posterolateral aspect of the extremity. Patients may report that the pain or numbness starts distally and progresses proximally. Symptoms can be asymmetric or vary from side to side. A sudden onset of pain in the lower extremities or a worsening of pre-existing pain may signal concomitant disc herniation or a more acute decrease in vascular supply. Pain is usually exacerbated with spinal extension and decreased with flexion. Urinary dysfunction is uncommon, but many patients report a feeling of urgency.

Computed tomography without contrast material does not visualize neural elements well and is not recommended. Magnetic resonance imaging should be reserved for surgical planning because the diagnosis can be made on the basis of the history, physical examination and radiographs. Nonoperative treatment includes education, reassurance, analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotics, if necessary. Aerobic conditioning is useful, and intermittent use of a corset-type brace can be of limited use. Epidural injection of steroids also seems to provide some relief. Operative treatment is indicated when pain is no longer tolerable and affects the patient's quality of life and when MRI reveals stenosis.

### Lumbar spinal stenosis: syndrome, diagnostics and treatment [^113S6CLD]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) comprises narrowing of the spinal canal with subsequent neural compression, and is frequently associated with symptoms of neurogenic claudication. To establish a diagnosis of LSS, clinical history, physical examination results and radiological changes all need to be considered. Patients who exhibit mild to moderate symptoms of LSS should undergo multimodal conservative treatment, such as patient education, pain medication, delordosing physiotherapy and epidural injections. In patients with severe symptoms, surgery is indicated if conservative treatment proves ineffective after 3–6 months. Clinically relevant motor deficits or symptoms of cauda equina syndrome remain absolute indications for surgery. The first randomized, prospective studies have provided class I-II evidence that supports a more rapid and profound decline of LSS symptoms after decompressive surgery than with conservative therapy. In the absence of a valid paraclinical diagnostic marker, however, more evidence-based data are needed to identify those patients for whom the benefit of surgery would outweigh the risk of developing complications. In this Review, we briefly survey the underlying pathophysiology and clinical appearance of LSS, and explore the available diagnostic and therapeutic options, with particular emphasis on neuroradiological findings and outcome predictors.

### MILD® is an effective treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication: MiDAS ENCORE randomized controlled trial [^114vJujS]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common degenerative condition of the spine, which is a major cause of pain and functional disability for the elderly. Neurogenic claudication symptoms are a hallmark of LSS, where patients develop low back or leg pain when walking or standing that is relieved by sitting or lumbar flexion. The treatment of LSS generally begins with conservative management such as physical therapy, home exercise programs, and oral analgesics. Once these therapies fail, patients commonly move forward with interventional pain treatment options such as epidural steroid injections (ESIs) or MILD® as the next step.

Objective

To assess improvement of function and reduction in pain for Medicare beneficiaries following treatment with MILD (treatment group) in LSS patients with neurogenic claudication and verified ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and to compare to a control group receiving ESIs.

Study Design

Prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled clinical trial.

Setting

Twenty-six US interventional pain management centers.

Methods

Patients in this trial were randomized one to one into 2 study arms. A total of 302 patients were enrolled, with 149 randomized to MILD and 153 to the active control. Outcomes are assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ). Primary efficacy is the proportion of ODI responders, tested for statistical superiority of the MILD group versus the ESI group. ODI responders are defined as patients achieving the validated Minimal Important Change (MIC) of = 10 point improvement in ODI from baseline to follow-up. Similarly, secondary efficacy is the proportion of NPRS and ZCQ responders using validated MIC thresholds. Primary safety is the incidence of device- or procedure-related adverse events in each group. This report presents safety and efficacy results at 1-year follow-up. Outcomes at 2 years will be collected and reported for patients in the MILD group only.

Results

At 1-year follow-up, ODI, NPRS, and all 3 ZCQ domains (Symptom Severity, Physical Function and Patient Satisfaction) demonstrated statistically significant superiority of MILD versus the active control. For primary efficacy, the 58.0% ODI responder rate in the MILD group was higher than the 27.1% responder rate in the epidural steroid group (P < 0.001). The primary safety endpoint was achieved, demonstrating that there is no difference in safety between MILD and ESIs (P = 1.00).

Limitations

There was a lack of patient blinding due to considerable differences in treatment protocols, and a potentially higher non-responder rate for both groups versus standard-of-care due to adjunctive pain therapy study restrictions. Study enrollment was not limited to patients that had never received ESI therapy.

Conclusions

One-year results of this randomized controlled clinical trial demonstrate that MILD is statistically superior to ESIs in the treatment of LSS patients with neurogenic claudication and verified central stenosis due to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. Primary and secondary efficacy outcome measures achieved statistical superiority in the MILD group compared to the control group. With 95% of patients in this study presenting with 5 or more LSS co-factors, it is important to note that patients with spinal co-morbidities also experienced statistically significant improved function that was durable through 1 year.
