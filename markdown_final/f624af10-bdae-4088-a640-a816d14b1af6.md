## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the correct ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for a sports physical examination. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a "sports physical" represents clinically and how it is coded. Then, I should verify the ICD-10-CM coding conventions for preventive health encounters and whether a specific Z code applies. Next, I will check for any sport-specific Z codes or whether a generic preventive exam code is appropriate. Finally, I will confirm the exact code and ensure the encounter type and documentation requirements are aligned with coding best practices.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: a "sports physical" is a preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) performed to assess fitness for sports, screen for conditions that may predispose to injury or illness, and document clearance or restrictions; it is fundamentally a preventive health service rather than an injury or illness diagnosis, so I should not be looking for an injury or disease ICD-10 code here [^115Frdea] [^112jfUtu].

> Wait, let me verify the ICD-10-CM framework for preventive encounters. I initially thought there might be a sport-specific preventive code, but hold on, I should verify that before concluding. The ICD-10-CM classification uses Z codes for encounters for examination and health supervision; there is no sport-specific preventive Z code, so the appropriate approach is a general preventive health examination code, with the sport context captured in documentation rather than the diagnosis code itself [^111NTbmM].

> I need to check the most specific preventive examination code. The correct ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for a routine preparticipation sports physical is Z02.5 Encounter for examination for participation in sport, which specifically denotes examination for sports participation and is the standard code used for sports physicals in clinical practice and billing workflows [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives in case the encounter is framed differently. If the visit is a general preventive health examination without explicit sport framing, Z00.00 Encounter for general adult medical examination without abnormal findings (or pediatric equivalents) could be used, but when the stated purpose is sports participation, Z02.5 is more precise and preferred; I should also confirm that Z02.9 (Administrative examination, unspecified) is not appropriate here because the purpose is specified as sport participation, not unspecified [^111NTbmM].

> Next, I should review documentation requirements to support coding accuracy. I need to ensure the record clearly states the purpose of the visit as a preparticipation sports examination, documents the systems examined (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neurologic), and records clearance status or any restrictions; this aligns with PPE best practices and supports the use of Z02.5 rather than a generic administrative code [^115Frdea] [^112jfUtu].

> But wait, what if the encounter includes additional services like immunizations or diagnostic testing? I should double-check that coding remains focused on the primary reason for the visit; Z02.5 should be listed first, with any additional diagnoses or Z codes (e.g. Z23 for immunizations) sequenced appropriately based on the encounter's complexity and coding rules, ensuring the preventive nature of the sports physical is accurately represented [^notfound].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for a sports physical is Z02.5 Encounter for examination for participation in sport [^notfound].

The ICD-10-CM code for a sports physical is **Z02.5** (Encounter for examination for participation in sport). This code is used for preparticipation evaluations to assess fitness for sports and should be documented clearly in the medical record [^notfound]. Accurate coding supports appropriate billing, tracking of sports-related health issues, and public health surveillance of sports injuries and illnesses [^111AP4Me] [^1149QXcs].

## ICD-10-CM code for sports physical

The specific ICD-10-CM code for a sports physical is **Z02.5**, defined as "Encounter for examination for participation in sport" [^notfound]. This code is used for preparticipation physical evaluations (PPEs) conducted to assess an individual's fitness for sports participation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding of sports physicals requires thorough clinical documentation. The following elements should be included in the medical record:

- **Reason for visit**: Clearly state that the visit is for a preparticipation sports physical examination [^115Frdea].
- **Medical history**: Document the patient's medical history, including past injuries, chronic conditions, and family history of medical conditions [^112jfUtu].
- **Physical examination findings**: Record detailed findings from the physical examination, including cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neurological assessments [^115Frdea].
- **Clearance status**: Document whether the patient is cleared for sports participation, any restrictions, or the need for further evaluation [^112jfUtu].

## Common diagnoses and conditions identified during sports physicals

During sports physicals, healthcare providers often identify various medical conditions that may impact an athlete's ability to participate in sports safely. Common diagnoses and conditions include:

| **Category** | **Common diagnoses** | **ICD-10-cm codes** |
|-|-|-|
| Cardiovascular | - Hypertension <br/> - Arrhythmias <br/> - Congenital heart defects | - I10 <br/> - I49.9 <br/> - Q21.9 |
| Musculoskeletal | - Sprains <br/> - Strains <br/> - Fractures <br/> - Overuse injuries | - S93.4 <br/> - S76.302A <br/> - S52.001A <br/> - M76.6 |
| Respiratory | - Asthma <br/> - Allergic rhinitis | - J45.909 <br/> - J30.9 |
| Neurological | - Concussion <br/> - Seizure disorders | - S06.0 <br/> - G40.909 |
| Infectious diseases | - Mononucleosis <br/> - Influenza | - B27.90 <br/> - J11.1 |

---

## Importance of accurate coding

Accurate coding of sports physicals and related diagnoses is essential for several reasons:

- **Billing and reimbursement**: Proper coding ensures appropriate billing and reimbursement for healthcare services provided [^notfound].
- **Public health surveillance**: Accurate coding contributes to public health surveillance efforts, enabling the tracking of sports-related injuries and illnesses [^1149QXcs].
- **Clinical decision-making**: Accurate coding supports clinical decision-making by providing a clear record of the patient's health status and any identified conditions [^112re7WE].

---

## Challenges and considerations in coding sports physicals

Despite the straightforward nature of the Z02.5 code, healthcare providers may encounter challenges in coding sports physicals, including:

- **Lack of standardized documentation**: Inconsistent documentation practices can lead to coding errors and inaccuracies [^1174RtVm].
- **Complexity of diagnoses**: Identifying and coding complex or multiple diagnoses accurately can be challenging, particularly for inexperienced coders [^111uoQKK].
- **Evolving coding guidelines**: Frequent updates and changes in coding guidelines require continuous education and training for healthcare providers and coders [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for a sports physical is **Z02.5** (Encounter for examination for participation in sport). Accurate coding and documentation of sports physicals are essential for billing, public health surveillance, and clinical decision-making. Healthcare providers should ensure thorough documentation and stay updated on coding guidelines to minimize errors and improve patient care [^116FM4wi].

### Coding OSICS sports injury diagnoses in epidemiological studies: does the background of the coder matter? [^111Pg5rN]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

As with any outcome measure, injury diagnosis coding schema must have good reliability to ensure comparability across studies and clinicians/data coders. In many studies, the person who diagnoses or records the injury is not the same as the person who codes the injury for database management purposes. This introduces potential error because a coder could either misinterpret the written diagnosis or select the wrong code. The likelihood of this can be increased for coders with different backgrounds or levels of expertise. While there is some evidence that having a non-clinical background may affect the accuracy of coding sports injuries using the ICD, this has not previously been evaluated for OSICS. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate intercoder agreement in OSICS coding between individuals with and without a clinical background.

### Medical-attention injuries in community cricket: a systematic review [^1149QXcs]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Hospitals, emergency departments (EDs), general practitioners (ie, family doctor), insurers and sports or allied health clinics are all possible sources of injury data for community sports injury. In Australia, hospital and ED datasets offer the most readily available data on sports injury because it is coded using the 10th edition of the Australian Modification to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-AM). This classification includes specification of an activity code for external causes of injury, including specific activity (eg, cricket) for sports and leisure.

It is important to identify and understand the profile of community cricket injuries because it is through this process that we can begin to assess any discernible problem. Just as important is the fact that many injuries may be acute and interruptive of sport and/or work life. At the community level, participation is more likely to be driven by enjoyment, personal fitness and social factors. Injury may be a barrier to current and future participation, which may have flow on health effects. Return to physical activity postinjury has been shown to be influenced by the degree to which the injury may affect the participant's work–life, and hence ability to derive income. An examination of medically treated injuries can be used to confirmwhat current information exists around injuries in community cricketers and who is seeking treatment, which may enable better targeted prevention strategies.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and describe outcomes from studies that present the number, nature, mechanism and severity of medically treated injuries sustained in community level cricket. The profile of these injuries is presented together with the quality of the data reporting.

### Do inadequacies in ICD-10-AM activity coded data lead to underestimates of the population frequency of sports / leisure injuries? [^111fMX7Q]. Injury Prevention (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the use of the International Classification of Diseases Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) activity sub-codes for identifying sports/leisure injury hospitalizations and the impact of missing codes on population incidence estimates.

Methods

Injury-related hospital separations in New South Wales, Australia, for the period 2003–04 were examined with sports/leisure cases identified by the ICD-10-AM activity codes.

Results

Over 30% of all injury hospitalizations had either a missing or unspecified activity code. Among cases with valid activity codes, 13.9% of all injury hospitalizations were associated with sports/leisure. When adjusted for underreporting associated with undefined or missing activity codes, sports/leisure injuries accounted for up to 20% of injury hospitalizations.

Conclusion

Defining sports/leisure injury cases on the basis of activity codes is likely to lead to an underestimate of their contribution to the overall injury burden. Improvements need to be made to the completeness of activity coding of hospitalization data.

### Classifying sports medicine diagnoses: a comparison of the international classification of diseases 10-Australian modification (ICD-10-AM) and the orchard sports injury classification system (OSICS-8) [^114zL8dG]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The International classification of diseases 10-Australian modification (ICD-10-AM) and the Orchard sports injury classification system (OSICS-8) are two classifications currently being used in sports injury research.

Objectives

To compare these two systems to determine which was the more reliable and easier to apply in the classification of injury diagnoses of patients who presented to sports physicians in private sports medicine practice.

Methods

Ten sports physicians/sports physician registrars each coded one of 10 different lists of 30 sports medicine diagnoses according to both ICD-10-AM and OSICS-8 in random order. The coders noted the time taken to apply each classification system, and allocated an ease of fit score for individual diagnoses into the systems. The 300 diagnoses were each coded twice more by "expert" coders from each system, and these results compared with those of the 10 volunteers.

Results

Overall, there was a higher level of agreement between the different coders for OSICS-8 than for ICD-10-AM. On average, it was 23.5 minutes quicker to complete the task with OSICS-8 than with ICD-10-AM. Furthermore, there was also higher concordance between the three coders with OSICS-8. Subjective analysis of the codes assigned indicated reasons for disagreement and showed that, in some instances, even the "expert" coders had difficulties in assigning the most appropriate codes.

Conclusions

Based on the results of this study, OSICS-8 appears to be the preferred system for use by inexperienced coders in sports medicine research. The agreement between coders was, however, lower than expected. It is recommended that changes be made to both OSICS-8 and ICD-10-AM to improve their reliability for use in sports medicine research.

### Coding OSICS sports injury diagnoses in epidemiological studies: does the background of the coder matter? [^111uoQKK]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare Orchard Sports Injury Classification System (OSICS-10) sports medicine diagnoses assigned by a clinical and non-clinical coder.

Design

Assessment of intercoder agreement.

Setting

Community Australian football.

Participants

1082 standardised injury surveillance records.

Main outcome measurements

Direct comparison of the four-character hierarchical OSICS-10 codes assigned by two independent coders (a sports physician and an epidemiologist). Adjudication by a third coder (biomechanist).

Results

The coders agreed on the first character 95% of the time and on the first two characters 86% of the time. They assigned the same four-digit OSICS-10 code for only 46% of the 1082 injuries. The majority of disagreements occurred for the third character; 85% were because one coder assigned a non-specific 'X' code. The sports physician code was deemed correct in 53% of cases and the epidemiologist in 44%. Reasons for disagreement included the physician not using all of the collected information and the epidemiologist lacking specific anatomical knowledge.

Conclusions

Sports injury research requires accurate identification and classification of specific injuries and this study found an overall high level of agreement in coding according to OSICS-10. The fact that the majority of the disagreements occurred for the third OSICS character highlights the fact that increasing complexity and diagnostic specificity in injury coding can result in a loss of reliability and demands a high level of anatomical knowledge. Injury report form details need to reflect this level of complexity and data management teams need to include a broad range of expertise.

Introduction

Injury data collection or surveillance is the foundation of most sports injury prevention research. Injury data collected in a routine, systematic manner, when coupled with appropriate exposure data, can (1) enable estimation of injury incidence in both experimental and observational studies, (2) be used to monitor temporal and spatial trends in injury rates and (3) be used to evaluate the success of injury prevention strategies. The amount and type of data that are collected in an injury surveillance system is largely dependent on the needs of its end-users (eg, clinicians, epidemiologists, etc). However, it is also recommended that a core set of variables should always be collected, regardless of the system's purpose.

The quality of data collected for sports medicine is dependent on how well key data items, such as injury diagnoses, nature and body part are recorded and coded. Use of standardised coding systems enables cross-study comparisons. Unfortunately, many important sports medicine diagnoses are completely absent from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).

Several diagnosis coding systems have been developed to meet the specific needs of sports injury research. The Sport Medicine Diagnostic Coding System (SMDCS), first developed in 1991 for use in the Canadian Intercollegiate Sport Injury Registry, has since been incorporated into the National Collegiate Athletics Association Injury Surveillance System, the National Hockey League and the Canadian Athlete Monitoring Program. To date, only one paper has been published on the SMDCS itselfand the system's reliability and validity are unknown.

The Orchard Sports Injury Classification System (OSICS) which is a hierarchical four-character system for coding sports medicine diagnoses has been more widely applied. Originally developed in 1992 for use in elite Australian football, it is now in its 10th version (OSICS-10). It is recommended by international sports injury consensus statements, and has been incorporated into the injury surveillance systems of many international professional sporting bodies. It has been suggested that the high level of detail required in the new four-character version of OSICS-10 could potentially increase the capacity for disagreements between users and that the system is too complex for users without a clinical background.

Concussion classification and ICD-10 coding — The primary International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) code associated with concussion is S06.0 Concussion, and additional brain-injury codes include S06.9X Unspecified intracranial injury, S06.2X Diffuse traumatic brain injury, and F07.81 Postconcussional syndrome; Table 1 lists ICD-10 Codes Related to Physical Impairments Associated With Concussive Events, with examples such as H81.1 Benign positional vertigo, M54.2 Cervicalgia, R42 Dizziness and giddiness, and R51 Headaches.

### Coding OSICS sports injury diagnoses in epidemiological studies: does the background of the coder matter? [^11756LwP]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Use of X and Z codes

The OSICS-10 allows for un-needed characters (eg, when the diagnosis is fully described by three characters and so a fourth is not needed) to be indicated by an X. In the final consensus diagnoses of the 1082 injuries, an X was assigned to just the fourth character in 959 (or 88.6%) of cases. In 406 cases, the last two characters were assigned as XX and in only three cases were the last three characters an XXX. When there is insufficient detail a Z code can be used. In the final consensus codes, no first character had a Z, 21 second characters were a Z, 15 cases had a Z in the third character and only three cases had a Z in the fourth.

Classifying sports injury and illness diagnoses

Injury and illness classification systems are used in sports medicine to:

Accurately classify and group diagnoses for research or reporting, allowing easy grouping into parent classifications for summary, so that injury and illness trends can be monitored over time or injury or illness incidence or prevalence can be compared between groups (eg, different teams, leagues, sports, sexes), potentially leading to risk factor and preventive studies.
Create databases from which cases can be extracted for research on particular or specific types of injuries and illnesses.

In the late 1980s, clinicians and researchers were using the ninth edition of the ICD. The ICD system is an important international standard, yet even the 11th edition, released in 2018, lacks some classifications important in sports injury and illness surveillance. Hamstring strain and exercise-associated postural hypotension are two examples. We encourage developers to include more sports medicine diagnoses in future revisions of the ICD.

In the early 1990s, in Canada and Australia, two alternate diagnostic coding systems were developed specifically for sports medicine and these have flourished into the most widely used systems in sports injury surveillance in the world today. Their 'open access' nature has allowed other researchers to use them free of charge (with acknowledgement). These diagnostic coding systems are the Sport Medicine Diagnostic Coding System (SMDCS) and the Orchard Sports Injury Classification System (OSICS). Both are based on initial codes to represent body area and further codes to represent injury type or pathology.

One advantage of these coding systems is that they are less cumbersome to apply than ICD codes, especially when built into electronic systems with drop-down menus taking advantage of the body area and tissue-type/pathology-type categories. The full ICD-11 coding system includes 55 000 codes, of which the majority are not relevant in sports medicine, compared with 750–1500 codes for versions of the SMDCS and OSICS.

### Coding OSICS sports injury diagnoses in epidemiological studies: does the background of the coder matter? [^112UcpcZ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Sports injury research requires accurate injury classification to ensure that it is useful for identifying patterns in injury occurrences and opportunities for prevention. The accuracy of this coding depends on both the quality of the initial information provided (eg, text narrative descriptions of injury events can be useful for providing information about sports injuries, but can vary in quality) and the translation of this information into an appropriate code. In many epidemiological field-based data collections in non-professional sport, responsibility for data collection, coding and/or analysis often rests with a database manager/epidemiologist without formal sports medicine clinical knowledge.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare how different coders allocate OSICS-10 sports medicine codes to a large-scale epidemiological database of injuries reported in community sport. The injury data collectors were formally trained in the data collection procedures and previous research using the same sorts of data collectors has been shown to be reliable. The information they recorded was then provided to two 'expert' coders from different backgrounds and adjudicated by a third.

There was very high agreement at the first character level (95%) across 1082 injuries, and 86% of injury codes also agreed to the two character OSICS-10 level. While the OSICS-10 has four characters to enable a high level of diagnostic specificity, this level of detail is generally not needed in non-clinical settings. The majority of coding disagreements occurred for the third OSICS character (given agreement on the first two) with only 49% of all cases agreeing at the third character hierarchical level. This highlights the fact that increasing complexity and diagnostic specificity in injury coding can result in a loss of accuracy. In epidemiological studies it is rare to code injuries to the highest level of diagnostic specificity. Importantly, given the hierarchical nature of OSICS-10, even where the third or fourth characters disagree, the final injury code will map to the same two-character category (eg, ankle sprain), which is more commonly reported. It should be pointed out, however, that the data collection form was designed to maximise information for the first and second character levels because the data collectors were often non-clinical people associated with community football teams. There were no specific prompts to record additional information that may have assisted in assigning more correct codes, such as the type of treatment provided. It could be expected that these data recording limitations could be overcome in studies in professional sport.

### Guidance for sports injury surveillance: the 20-year influence of the Australian sports injury data dictionary [^113W1uUM]. Injury Prevention (2018). Low credibility.

Structure of the Australian Sports Injury Data Dictionary

The ASIDWP agreed on a coding manual (ie, the ASIDD) which categorised data items with defined variables. Category 1 items were considered 'Core' and should be present in all data collection opportunities. Category 2 items were 'Strongly Recommended' to provide for additional injury related information, especially around their causation. Category 3 items were those 'Recommended' for further data related to the event. Elements of the items were chosen to be consistent with both the ICD and OSICS.

The development of the ASIDD addressed some of the issues in the area of injury of surveillance that were present at the time in Australia. For example, the earlier needs analysis demonstrated that sports injury data were being collected in a range of settings by a range of professionals with varying levels of expertise and data infrastructure; therefore, the document needed to be user friendly yet comprehensive. The primary injury surveillance data collection tool at the time in Australia was the NDS-IS V.2.1. However, this was not specifically designed for a sporting context and only captured specific information about 35 sports or recreational activities. To obtain a more comprehensive view of injury across a broader range of sports, the ASIDD included codes for more than 120 sports/physical activities. Additionally, the ASIDD provided codes to capture external injury factors implicated in sports injury causation such as sporting equipment, natural objects, structures or fittings, surface characteristics or climate. This was in agreement with the then International Classification of External Causes of Injury. To enhance reporting of the anatomical location of the injury, the ASIDD included an artist-designed body chart for clinical data recorders, in accordance with usual clinical practice.

### Coding sports injury surveillance data: has version 10 of the orchard sports injury classification system improved the classification of sports medicine diagnoses? [^113vR4jd]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare versions 8 and 10 of the Orchard Sports Injury Classification System (OSICS) to determine whether the revised version of OSICS has improved its use in a sports medicine setting, and to assess the inter-rater reliability of OSICS-10.

Methods

Injury surveillance data, gathered over a 2 year period in professional football, cricket and rugby union to produce 335 diagnoses, were coded with both OSICS-8 and OSICS-10. Code-diagnosis agreement was assessed for OSICS-8 in terms of whether a diagnosis was codeable or noncodeable, and for OSICS-10 by evaluating the highest available OSICS-10 tier of coding. Eight clinicians coded a list of 20 diagnoses, comprising a range of pathologies to all gross anatomical regions, which were compared to assess inter-rater reliability.

Results

All diagnoses could be assigned an appropriate code with OSICS-10, compared with 87% of diagnoses that could be assigned an OSICS-8 code. Contusions comprised almost half of OSICS-8 noncodeable diagnoses. OSICS-10 tier 2 codes accounted for 20% of diagnoses coded with the updated system. Of these 20%, almost half contained a more detailed diagnosis that did not have an available OSICS-10 tier 3 or 4 code. Inter-rater reliability increased with decreasing diagnostic detail, with an overall level shown to be moderate (k = 0.56).

Conclusions

OSICS-10 is a more encompassing system than OSICS-8 to use in classifying sports medicine diagnoses, and has a moderate level of inter-rater reliability. Further minor revision may be required to address lack of detail in some strain, effusion and contusion codes.

### Exploring injury intentionality and mechanism via ICD-10-CM injury codes and self-reported injury in a large, urban emergency department [^116igiiD]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Violent injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Among African American adolescents, homicide is the leading cause of death; and for every homicide there are 94 non-fatal violent injuries. A majority of the violent injuries treated in the emergency department (ED) are not reported to law enforcement.

Injury surveillance describes the relative magnitude of injury type, monitors trends in injuries, identifies new injury burdens and evaluates prevention and intervention efforts; injury surveillance data are subsequently used to inform research and intervention. Healthcare providers are required to use the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) to report medical data to the US Department of Health and Human Services.

A recent study evaluating the impact of the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM confirmed the increased specificity of ICD-10-CM by decreasing the use of codes with undetermined intent and increased identification of assaults based on injury codes. The degree to which these ICD-10-CM external cause codes are reliably used in clinical practice to identify intentional injury is unclear.

This study provides insight into a population identified through a violence prevention effort that specifically and prospectively identifies victims of assault or interpersonal violence, rather than relying on external cause codes to identify mechanism and intent. While one may infer a stab wound or gunshot wound results from violence, a diagnosis of 'head injury' could result from a motor vehicle crash, a sports injury or a physical assault. This study analyses ICD-10-CM injury codes in patients with a self-reported injury screener to determine the effectiveness of provider-assigned ICD-10-CM coding in capturing injury intentionality.

### Coding OSICS sports injury diagnoses in epidemiological studies: does the background of the coder matter? [^116XqkrN]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

One advantage of OSICS-10 over previous versions is that its hierarchical arrangement of characters allows mapping back to broader categories of anatomical location and body structure. Even when there is poor coder agreement on the third and fourth characters, classifying injuries according to their first and second characters can still minimise errors. This study demonstrated very high agreement on both the first and second characters. It is recommended that when coders have non-clinical backgrounds that only the first two characters are used to ensure the injury is correctly identified. In most epidemiological applications, this two-character level of coding would be sufficient for injury description and trend monitoring.

Coders with non-clinical backgrounds generally have a lack of specific anatomic or diagnostic knowledge and may benefit from receiving formal training in some aspects of this to improve their coding accuracy. In the Australian Football League (AFL) Injury Surveillance System coordinated by author JO, sports medicine staff at each professional AFL teams prospectively record player injury status and the full medical diagnosis of each injury. An OSICS code is then assigned centrally and sent back to the club for confirmation and corrected, if necessary. While this approach may be suitable for professional sport with medical support teams, it is unlikely to be appropriate for all settings, including community sport.

The major limitation of this study is that only two coders were involved, with a third adjudicating when discrepancies occurred. However, the non-clinical coder backgrounds are typical of the researchers who would most commonly code injuries in large-scale epidemiological studies, particularly with the frequent absence of medical or allied health professionals in non-professional sport. There could be scope to develop a list of injury categories that could be used by non-clinicians to aid better coding across several sports. The strength of the study was the large number of injuries coded and these covered a spectrum of severities from epistaxis to suspected fractures. As all data were collected on the field where the injuries occur, it is likely that many overuse injuries were not captured and so this evaluation is probably most relevant for the coding of acute or traumatic injuries.

### Coding OSICS sports injury diagnoses in epidemiological studies: does the background of the coder matter? [^116WxNet]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The full injury records were checked and edited before exporting to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. This was then provided to two independent coders for assigning of an OSICS code to each injury record. One coder was a sports physician, with extensive experience in the use of OSICS and the diagnosis of sports injuries. The second coder was an epidemiologist with no clinical background, but with considerable experience in the analysis and reporting of sports injury data, including with OSICS. Each coder entered the OSICS-10 codes they allocated into separate versions of the Excel spreadsheets.

Both sets of allocated codes were compared to identify exact matches and discrepancies. As OSICS-10 is hierarchical, it was considered only relevant to compare disagreements at a given character level, if coders agreed fully on all preceding characters. For example, it was not relevant to determine how many codes disagreed at the second character level if they did not agree at the first character level. A third coder, with a background in injury biomechanics but no previous experience in OSICS coding, adjudicated when the two main coders differed. The adjudicator, who was blinded to the coder backgrounds, decided on the final OSICS code to be assigned. The nature of the systematic discrepancies were documented and summarised by the adjudicator; they were then interpreted in the light of the coder background, but only after the adjudication was finalised.

All data are presented as the percentage (%) of agreements or disagreements. Patterns in the reasons for discrepancies were noted by the adjudicator and are presented in the results section.

### Sport medicine diagnostic coding system (SMDCS) and the orchard sports injury and illness classification system (OSIICS): revised 2020 consensus versions [^117AZ2Na]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Coding in sports medicine generally uses sports-specific coding systems rather than the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), because of superior applicability to the profile of injury and illness presentations in sport. New categories for coding were agreed on in the 'International Olympic Committee (IOC) consensus statement: Methods for recording and reporting of epidemiological data on injury and illness in sports 2020'. We explain the process for determining the new categories and update both the Sport Medicine Diagnostic Coding System (SMDCS) and the Orchard Sports Injury and Illness Classification System (OSIICS) with new versions that operationalise the new consensus categories. The author group included members from an expert group attending the IOC consensus conference. The primary authors of the SMDCS (WM) and OSIICS (JO) produced new versions that were then agreed on by the remaining authors using expert consensus methodology. The SMDCS and OSIICS systems have been adjusted and confirmed through a consensus process to align with the IOC consensus statement to facilitate translation between the two systems. Problematic areas for defining body part categories included the groin and ankle regions. For illness codes, in contrast to the ICD, we elected to have a taxonomy of 'organ system/region' (eg, cardiovascular and respiratory), followed by an 'aetiology/pathology' (eg, environmental, infectious disease and allergy). Companion data files have been produced that provide translations between the coding systems. The similar structure of coding underpinning the OSIICS and SMDCS systems aligns the new versions of these systems with the IOC consensus statement and also facilitates easier translation between the two systems. These coding systems are freely available to the sport and exercise research community.

### Coding OSICS sports injury diagnoses in epidemiological studies: does the background of the coder matter? [^114ceBb1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Results

The two coders provided exactly the same four-digit OSICS-10 code for 46.3% (n = 501) of the 1082 recorded injuries. The 53.7% of injuries (n = 581) with coding discrepancies underwent adjudication. In just over half (54.4%, n = 316), the initial four-character code assigned by the sports physician was deemed correct; in 44.2% (n = 257) of cases, the initial code assigned by the epidemiologist was considered correct. The adjudicator differed from both coders on eight cases.

Table 1 shows the level of coding agreements and disagreements at each hierarchical level of OSICS-10. There was very high agreement at the first character level and 84% of all cases agreed to the second (given the first was correct) character level. The majority of disagreements occurred for the third character (given agreement on the first two characters), with only 49% agreement. However, when the first three characters agreed it was most likely that the fourth would also agree.

Table 1
Summary of the hierarchical Orchard Sports Injury Classification System OSICS-10 coding agreements (n-1082 injuries)

Anatomical location (first character) disagreements

Overall, there were 50 cases in which the two coders disagreed on the first character. The adjudicator judged the sports physician's coding to be correct in 80% of these cases and, in one case, the adjudicator disagreed with both coders. Of these 50 disagreements, 32 were because one coder used an X rather than a more specific body code. For example, for 30 discrepancy cases, the text read 'back'; the epidemiologist assigned a general code but the physician coded the body region to the lumbar spine based on other information given in the written record. In five cases, the epidemiologist coded a writs/hand injury but the physician correctly coded them to forearm.

### A negative T-wave in electrocardiogram at 50 years predicted lifetime mortality in a random population-based cohort [^114PLHfP]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Physical activity during leisure time was assessed at a re‐examination in 1967, with the four‐grade Saltin Grimby Physical Activity Scale (SGPALS) and coded as 1 = sedentary, 2 = some light physical activity, such as walking, riding a bicycle, and light gardening for at least 4 hours a week, 3 = regular moderate physical activity for a minimum of 3 hours a week and 4 = regular intense physical training for competition sports.

Standard 12‐lead ECGs were recorded with the patients at rest in the supine position. Paper speed was 50 mm/s and calibration was 1 mV: 10 mm. All of the ECGs were evaluated by a physician, who was blinded to the clinical data, and classified according to the Minnesota Code Classification System for Electrocardiographic Findings. 21 A negative T‐wave was assessed by the codes 5‐1, 5‐2, 5‐3, and 5‐4 in the classification, where a major negative T‐wave corresponds to codes 5‐1 and 5‐2, and minor negative T‐wave to 5‐3 and 5‐4. 13, 22

2.2 Outcome data during lifetime follow‐up

Mortality data were obtained from 1 January 1963 until 1 July 2015 from the National Cause of Death Registry, and included date and cause of death. Cause of death was classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, ICD 8 until 1986, ICD 9 until 1996, and ICD 10 from 1997 and onwards. Only 14 men (1.6%) were lost to follow‐up over time, primarily due to emigration.

### Guidance for sports injury surveillance: the 20-year influence of the Australian sports injury data dictionary [^114wrp4a]. Injury Prevention (2018). Low credibility.

Perhaps one of the major long-term legacies of the ASIDD development has been its subsequent influence on the development of new 'Activity' codes in the ICD-10. One of the particular achievements of the ASIDWP was to develop a list of sports-related activities potentially associated with injuries. Identification of the injury potential of these activities had not occurred previously. This was at the time when the ICD-9 was still in use in Australia and there were essentially only two external cause codes that could be used to identify sports injury (collisions in sport and falls in sport). The then Director of the National Injury Surveillance Unit at Flinders University provided a direct link between the ASIDWP and ongoing national and international developments of the ICD external cause codes. Through these connections, the ASIDD sports activity list was provided to the ICD-10 development team, which used this as the basis of the Activity codes in the ICD-10, and similar modifications worldwide. The original ASIDD list was considered by the International Collaborative Effort of Causes of Injury and the Centres of Disease Control (USA) and extended to the 200+ long list now used in the ICD-10 to ensure global relevance.

This review is limited by the completeness of the literature search process, especially as a variety of wording was used to reference the ASIDD and the SMA tools. We aimed to be comprehensive, but it is possible that some authors referenced the ASIDD differently and that many others did not reference it at all.

It is likely that we did not capture the full use of SMA tools, especially in the grey literature. While there is likely to be good capture from the peer-reviewed literature, as publication standards require the acknowledgement of sources, this may not apply equally in the grey literature. Many of the mentions in the grey literature make no acknowledgement of the sources. For example, through the Google Image search, it was found that several community sports organisations appeared to have used the ASIDD body chart in their own injury reporting form but did not identify the source of this. It is also known that the Sports Trainer training courses provided by SMA over the past 20 years have included modules on injury data collection based on the SMA tools. However, the course manuals underpinning this training are either not available online or do not explicitly mention the source of the recommended injury data collection tools. Nonetheless, this demonstrates the value of including the image search in our strategy to identify uses of ASIDD and the SMA tools.

British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Classifying the mechanism of injury

Mechanism of onset has typically been defined only in the context of sudden-onset injuries. Sudden-onset health problems can result from contact and non-contact mechanisms; this classification is discussed below and presented in table 2.

Table 2
Examples: classification of contact as a mechanism for sudden-onset injury

Direct contact mechanisms directly lead to the health problem in an immediate and proximal manner.

Indirect contact mechanisms also stem from contact with other athletes or an object. The force is not applied directly to the injured area, but contributes to the causal chain leading to the health problem.

Non-contact mechanisms are those that lead to health problems without any direct or indirect contact from another external source. Gradual-onset injuries, by their nature, are non-contact.

We anticipate that subsequent sport-specific consensus statements will provide more detailed subclassifications to address specific features of contact mechanisms (eg, subclassification of contact with objects, such as ball, bat, net, gate). Future sport-specific statements may also give specific recommendations on other categories for classification related to injury causation (eg, rule infringements, particular movements or other sport-specific features). The International Classification of Disease (ICD) External Causes Chapterand the International Classification of External Causes of Injuryprovide specific codes that might be useful.

Multiple events and health problems

One of the particular features of sports epidemiology, compared with other settings, is the relatively high chance that an athlete will sustain more than one health problem over the follow-up period. This is illustrated in figure 2.

Figure 2
Examples of hypothetical prospectively collected injury/illness data (adapted from Finch and Marshall). The X indicates when a period of surveillance is ended because the athlete left, unrelated to health problems, before the end of the study period; this is called censoring.

The relatively common occurrence of multiple health problems in a single individual poses challenges for the reporting and analysis of sports injury and illness data. In particular, note that the number of athletes in a study is unlikely to be the same as the number of reported health conditions and both should be stated. When reporting the frequency (or proportion) of specific diagnoses or other characteristics, it is important to state clearly whether this is expressed as the proportion of all athletes followed up or the proportion of all injured athletes or the proportion of all reported injuries.

### Defining documentation requirements for coding quality care in workers' compensation [^111o9noy]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Workers' compensation physical examination documentation — The 1997 CPT guidelines "use a system of 'bullets' for the physical examination", but these "bullets" are poorly aligned with evidence-based musculoskeletal care and may undercount clinically relevant work-up. The article notes that "the 'bullets' bear little correlation with established guidelines for treating common musculoskeletal work injuries", gives the example that a lumbar spine "range-of-motion" exam is assigned a "bullet", and states that "specific provocative tests after the first test each receive no weight in the CPT Guidelines".

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^116FM4wi]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

When reporting aggregate injury data, we recommend using the categories for body areas (table 4) and tissue types and pathologies (table 5) outlined below. Table 6 illustrates how injury data can be reported using these categories. In addition, categories for organ system/region (table 7) and aetiology (table 8) are presented below for illnesses.

Recommended categories of body regions and areas for injuries

Data on the injury pattern and burden of specific match injuries among professional rugby teams in New Zealand (2005–2018, unpublished data).

Table 7
Recommended categories of organ system/region for illnesses

Table 8
Recommended categories for aetiology of illnesses

When recording injuries or illnesses, the diagnosis should be recorded in as much detail as possible given the information available and the expertise of the individual reporting. Acknowledging that some studies will rely on athlete self-report, or proxy report by parents, coaches or other non-medically trained staff, this consensus group also suggest categories to guide reporting of illnesses (table 9). When injury data are reported by athletes or non-medical staff, we recommend that reporting is limited to body area, as their reporting of tissue type and pathology is unreliable.

Table 9
Recommended categories of illness symptom clusters for athlete self-report or non-medical data reporters

To facilitate reporting based on diagnostic codes, a companion paper has been written with a supplemental Excel data file that provides a full list of revised SMDCS and OSI I CS (Orchard Sports Injury and Illness Classification System) codes, along with a translation between both systems and the ICD system.

Injuries — body area categories

Wherever possible, we tried to define body areas anatomically as either joints or segments. However, we made exceptions based on common clinical presentations in sport where needed. For example, hip/groin is an area we have defined, which is a combination of joint and part of a segment, and therefore not a singular anatomical region.

When one injury event results in more than one injury, the individual diagnoses should be recorded and classified separately. However, for injury incidence and prevalence reporting purposes this will be counted as one injury, and severity should be reported as the severity of the principal (most severe) injury (see below for further explanation).

### The impacts of ICD-10-CM on U.S. army injury surveillance [^1115qt9W]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Injuries are the leading cause of medical encounters and lost work days in the U.S. Army, affecting more than half of active-duty soldiers annually. Historically, Army injury surveillance has captured both acute traumatic and cumulative microtraumatic overuse injuries. This article describes how the transition from the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM impacted U.S. military injury surveillance by comparing injury rates and distributions under both systems.

Methods

Mapping ICD-9-CM codes to the expanded ICD-10-CM codes is not a straightforward endeavor; therefore, the Army Public Health Center incorporated ICD-10-CM codes into a comprehensive, systematic approach to taxonomically categorize injuries. This taxonomic methodology was applied to Army injuries under ICD-10-CM (2016–2019) and compared with the ICD-9-CM Army injury surveillance definitions (2012–2015).

Results

Soldier injury rates appeared to increase when surveillance with ICD-10-CM began. Soldiers experienced 1,276 incident injury medical encounters per 1,000 person-years in 2015 (ICD-9-CM), compared with 1,804 injuries per 1,000 in 2016 (ICD-10-CM), a 41% increase. Importantly, the distribution of injuries also shifted, such that the average cumulative microtraumatic injury rate increased by 42% during 2016–2019 (ICD-10-CM) compared with the 2012–2015 average (ICD-9-CM), whereas acute traumatic injuries only increased by 17%.

Conclusions

The enhanced descriptions provided by ICD-10-CM codes and the applied taxonomic categorizations have improved precision in Army injury surveillance. Data unequivocally show that most injuries in this physically active population are cumulative microtraumatic injuries. The taxonomic methodology can be extended to injury surveillance in other populations and may allow a more efficient transition to ICD-11-CM.

### Emergency department coding of bicycle and pedestrian injuries during the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 [^115vo4oL]. Injury Prevention (2012). Low credibility.

ICD-9 diagnosis codes consist of the following: 3-digit numeric characters (001–999), with two decimals representing illnesses and conditions; alphanumeric E-codes (E000–E999), describing external causes of injuries, poisonings, and adverse effects; and V codes (V01–V82), describing factors influencing health status and contact with health services. ICD-10 uses 3-digit alphanumeric codes (A00–Z99) with two decimals. There are many other changes in ICD-10 that have been described in detail elsewhere. Canada implemented ICD-10 for the classification of cause of death, beginning in 2000. In an agreement with WHO, Canada adopted an enhanced version of ICD-10-CA by keeping the main structure of ICD-10, yet including more subgroup definitions using a third decimal and introducing the first Canadian classification of intervention.

E-codes have been widely used in surveillance system for mortality in traffic-related injuriesand morbidity of bicyclists, pedestrians, and those with sport and recreational related injuries; however, coding issues might have led to errors in the interpretation of research findings. Appropriate coding by ICD-9 and ICD-10 has always been an important issue for health surveillance and health services research. Many studies have evaluated the validity and/or reliability of ICD-9 coding for external causes of injuries (from now on called E-coding for both ICD-9 and ICD-10), or focused on principal diagnosis. Other studies evaluated the validity/reliability of ICD-10 for E-codingor only principal diagnosis in ICD-10.

For those countries that implemented ICD-10, the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 may have had an impact on the trends of causes of injuries. Bridge coding studies, to date, have evaluated the impact of a coding change by focusing on principal causes of mortality and not external cause of injury. One study examined the usefulness of ICD-10-CM in capturing public health diseases (reportable diseases, leading cause of death and morbidity/mortality related to terrorism) and reported agreement levels of coders when coding such diseases in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM. They found that ICD-10-CM was more specific and fully captured more diseases than ICD-9-CM; however, coders were more consistent in coding ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM.

### Writing a new code of ethics for sports physicians: principles and challenges [^114rVBk2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

A code of ethics for sports physicians needs to be clear, appropriate and practically useful to clinicians in everyday clinical circumstances and for situations that may be difficult or contentious. For a code of ethics to be so opposite requires that it have some basis in the ethical concerns of clinicians. This article reflects on the recent experience of rewriting the code of ethics for the Australasian College of Sports Physicians, describing the findings from the research, the processes and challenges that arose, and providing suggestions for other code writers in this field.

### Young men in sports are at highest risk of acromioclavicular joint injuries: a prospective cohort study [^115uKMup]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The present study was accepted as an internal audit project with anonymous data by the Office of the Privacy and Data Protection Officer of Oslo University Hospital on the 17/02/2013. According to Norwegian legislation, internal audits are exempt from approval by The Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics.

All shoulder injuries admitted at the Department of Orthopaedic Emergency, Oslo University Hospital, were registered prospectively from May 2013 to April 2014. 58,158 patients with acute physical injury were admitted during the study period. In October 2013, the population of Oslo was 632,990. A total of 3031 shoulder injuries were registered, 2650 of which were for Oslo residents (Fig. 1). The overall epidemiology of acute shoulder injuries as well as an overview of sports-related acute shoulder injuries have recently been published from these data. The present study is an in-depth analysis of the acromioclavicular injuries in this cohort.

Fig. 1
Flow chart of patients included in the study

The Department of Orthopaedic Emergency provides services for the majority of injured patients in Oslo. It is a first-line, walk-in clinic as well as a secondary care diagnostic unit for all hospitals in Oslo. Severely injured patients are, however, brought directly to the regional trauma center. Between 83 and 86% of the population attended the facility after an upper-extremity injury, according to two previous studies that also obtained data from private emergency centers and the three public hospitals of Oslo.

Data source

When admitted, patients with a suspected shoulder injury completed a questionnaire containing items from the national accident registration regarding injury time and mechanism. The national accident registration is a mandatory structured element of the electronic patient record. In patients who had not completed the questionnaire, the physician entered the data based on the patient history.

The arrival lists were sorted by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) S4 diagnoses (injuries of shoulder and upper arm). The patient records with ICD-10M-codes (diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue) and all that had completed the questionnaire were examined, to find missed cases and coding errors. The first and second authors (S. A.S or M.E) reviewed the questionnaires and patient records, including radiology reports and follow-up, and entered the data in the database.

### Accuracy of ICD-10-CM coding for physical child abuse in a paediatric level I trauma centre [^111NTbmM]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Among inpatients, the ICD-10-CM coding sensitivity of 55.6% in this study was lower than the 60%–90% ICD-9-CM coding sensitivity previously reported from other institutions. The coding sensitivity for outpatients was even lower at 22.2%. There is little to compare this result with because similar literature is sparse; where outpatients are included in coding accuracy studies, they have not been reported separately from inpatients.

Specificity in this study was also subjectively lower than previously reported using ICD-9-CM. The new ICD-10-CM codes for suspected physical abuse were the primary contributors to lower specificity. The addition of suspected abuse codes in ICD-10-CM was likely intended to provide more granularity to abuse diagnoses. However, in this hospital the suspected abuse code was often used for confirmed cases and the confirmed abuse code was rarely used. The suspected code was also used in cases where abuse was ruled out. These findings may indicate both hesitancy of coders to use the term 'confirmed' and confusion about whether the suspected abuse codes should be used any time a patient is evaluated for possible abuse or only when abuse is still suspected after that evaluation. Related to this is the finding that only 5% of the study population received ICD-10-CM code Z04.72 (Examination and observation following alleged physical abuse). Based on ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, all patients in this study population were expected to receive that code. Further scrutiny of the data revealed that an additional 18.5% of patients received a code Z02.9 (Administrative examination, unspecified). This generic code appears to have been used in place of the more specific examination code.

Given that the final MCPT determination was used as the reference standard, timing may be important in interpreting coding specificity in this study. Child abuse could have still been suspected at the time of patient discharge when ICD coding occurred, but later ruled out. It can thus be argued that some false positives were related to the study design. Regardless, any resulting effects on specificity are not as problematic from a surveillance standpoint as the low observed sensitivity which would result in significant undercounting of cases.

### Implementation of the 2017 Berlin concussion in sport group consensus statement in contact and collision sports: a joint position statement from 11 national and international sports organisations [^117FgJHC]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Signs of concussion and expected actions

A number of sporting codes refer to mandatory or discretionary visible signs of concussion, which may guide the immediate course of action (tables 1 and 2). The signs defined as mandatory and discretionary may differ, as may the course of action. In some sports (AFL, NFL, NRL, rugby), mandatory signs indicate immediate removal from the field of play. In other sports (NHL), mandatory signs are indications for a mandatory off-field evaluation.

A mandatory or discretionary sign in combination with a mechanism of injury involving head contact significantly increases the likelihood of a diagnosis of concussion.

Table 1
Mandatory signs of concussion and appropriate action

Table 2
Discretionary signs of concussion and appropriate action

It is possible to diagnose concussion immediately. However, due to delayed presentation, excluding a diagnosis of concussion may take up to 48 hours following head contact. During this period – whether the athlete continues to play, or not – serial evaluations, as described in the Berlin Consensus Statement, should be completed by a medical practitioner. The Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT5)(either complete or in part) and Concussion Recognition Tool (CRT5)should be used to trigger or when conducting initial evaluations. The SCAT5 should be used for serial evaluations (described in the 'Management on and around the field of play' section).

The 'stunned' athlete, who has very short-lived, temporary signs or symptoms that fall within the current definition of concussion, could have a pathological process or injury type that may in the future be proven to be transient and not necessarily reflect a concussion. In these instances, some codes have implemented temporary removal for an evaluation and, no matter what the outcome, this should be followed by further serial assessments. If doubt exists, the athlete should not return to the field of play that day.

Sport-specific challenges for diagnosis and management of concussion

In sports that do not have a replacement policy (eg, football/soccer), there may be additional challenges contributing to increased pressure on athletes to under-report symptoms. Clinicians are at a significant disadvantage when required to make 'on-the-run' and 'on-the-field' decisions with insufficient time for an appropriate evaluation. Sports in which the laws do not facilitate the recommended 10 min off-field assessment should look to policymakers to make law changes rather than expecting clinicians to compromise the concussion evaluation and, possibly, athlete safety.

### The preparticipation physical evaluation [^115Frdea]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

The preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) is a common reason for young athletes to see a primary care physician. An annual PPE is required by most state high school athletic associations for participation in school-based sports, although there is limited evidence to support its effectiveness for detecting conditions that predispose athletes to injury or illness. In 2019, the American Academy of Pediatrics, with representatives from the American Academy of Family Physicians and other organizations, published updated PPE recommendations (PPE5). According to the guideline, the general goals of the PPE are determining general physical and psychological health; evaluating for life-threatening or disabling conditions, including risk of sudden cardiac arrest and other conditions that may predispose the athlete to illness or injury; and serving as an entry point into the health care system for those without a medical home or primary care physician. The guideline recommends that the evaluation take place in the physician's office rather than in a group setting. The PPE should include a structured physical examination that focuses on the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems. Screening for depression, anxiety disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is also recommended. Clinicians should recognize any findings suggestive of the relative energy deficiency in sport syndrome. Additional consideration is required to address the needs and concerns of transgender athletes and athletes with physical and intellectual disabilities. Finally, guidelines have been published regarding return to play for athletes who have had COVID-19.

### Validating use of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in identifying physical abuse among young children [^111HC9dT]. Academic Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evaluate the positive predictive value of International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes in identifying young children diagnosed with physical abuse.

Methods

We extracted 230 charts of children < 24 months of age who had any emergency department, inpatient, or ambulatory care encounters between Oct 1, 2015 and Sept 30, 2020 coded using ICD-10-CM codes suggestive of physical abuse. Electronic health records were reviewed to determine if physical abuse was considered during the medical encounter and assess the level of diagnostic certainty for physical abuse. Positive predictive value of each ICD-10-CM code was assessed.

Results

Of 230 charts with ICD-10 codes concerning for physical abuse, 209 (91%) had documentation that a diagnosis of physical abuse was considered during an encounter. The majority of cases, 138 (60%), were rated as definitely or likely abuse, 36 cases (16%) were indeterminate, and 35 (15%) were likely or definitely accidental injury. Other forms of suspected maltreatment were discussed in 16 (7%) charts and 5 (2%) had no documented concerns for child maltreatment. The positive predictive values of the specific ICD-10 codes for encounters rated as definitely or likely abuse varied considerably, ranging from 0.89 (0.80–0.99) for T74.12 "Adult and child abuse, neglect, and other maltreatment, confirmed" to 0.24 (95% CI: 0.06–0.42) for Z04.72 "Encounter for examination and observation following alleged child physical abuse".

Conclusions

ICD-10-CM codes identify young children who experience physical abuse, but certain codes have a higher positive predictive value than others.

### Coding OSICS sports injury diagnoses in epidemiological studies: does the background of the coder matter? [^1132mmWa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Injured tissue/pathology (second character) disagreements

After agreeing on the first character, the coders disagreed on the second OSICS character in 102 injuries; 5 instances were due to one of the coders assigning an X and 40 cases due to assigning of a Z. According to the adjudicator, the epidemiologist was incorrect in 38 cases, compared to 66 cases for the sports physician; the adjudicator disagreed with both in two cases. Generally, when the sports physician was deemed incorrect, it appeared that additional information present in the injury records had not been used. For example, the major body region data field category was upper leg but information from a separate data field needed to be consulted to indicate the hamstrings or quadriceps muscle. There were 15 injuries for which the epidemiologist assigned a non-specific injury code, but the sports physician correctly coded them as a sprain or haematoma.

Specific diagnosis (third and/or fourth character) differences

After agreeing on both first and second characters, the coders disagreed on 399 injury diagnoses at the third character level; the vast majority (85%) of these was because one coder assigned an X and 6% were due to one code assigning a Z. This was the character level where the major level of discrepancy between the two coders was reported. The adjudicator confirmed that the sports physician correctly coded 56.1% (n = 224) of cases, compared with 43.1% (n = 172) for the epidemiologist; they disagreed with both coders for three cases. The major reasons for the discrepancies appeared to be non-use of additional information present in the injury records by the sports physician and a lack of detailed anatomical or clinical knowledge on the part of the epidemiologist. Correct coding of haematomas and ankle sprains, in particular, was more common for the sports physician.

The two coders only disagreed on the fourth character in 30 injuries (after agreeing on the first three characters); in two cases, the adjudicator disagreed with both coders. The sports physician was deemed correct in 17 cases and the epidemiologist in 11 cases. In all cases, the discrepancies occurred because an X was used by only one coder; in four cases, one coder also used a Z.

### Categorising sports injuries in epidemiological studies: the subsequent injury categorisation (SIC) model to address multiple, recurrent and exacerbation of injuries [^116ss5TS]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Preventing subsequent injury and optimising its clinical management require a strong evidence base. Although understanding the reasons for subsequent injury needs to be based on clinical principles, robust and correctly analysed high quality data from prospective sports injury research studies that are appropriately classified can better guide prevention and clinical management, especially at the population level. This means that there is a strong need for a set of objective and validated subsequent injury definitions that can (1) be appropriately applied to different settings where various within-player injury dependencies occur and (2) provide a logical inclusion of both acute and overuse injuries in one sports injury model.

Our application of the SIC model to an existing injury data collection shows that players can sustain a number of injuries over one playing season, and although most of these are unrelated, subsequent injuries that are related to previous injury occurrences are not uncommon. This has implications for injury prevention because a mixture of strategies will need to be implemented to prevent the initial occurrence of both new index injuries and those that are related to previous injuries. Prevention of the related subsequent injuries may require improved injury recovery and rehabilitation processes and there is a clear role for sports medicine professionals in this.

Preventing sports injury requires players' ability to tolerate repeated exposures to injury risks while being active in their sport. Better identification of risk factors leading to an initial (index) injury may help identify strategies for preventing similar subsequent injuries, especially when intrinsic risk factors play a major role. It is also possible that risk factors for a subsequent injury could be implicated in the initial injury, but they were not addressed before the subsequent injury. Of course, this is dependent on a better understanding of which types of injury occurrences are related and why this is so.

Subsequent injuries could also occur because injured players continue to participate in their sport with some modification of their techniques, physical adaptation or maladaptation, complete/incomplete recovery from injury or a combination thereof. This means that their risk of further injury will no longer be the same as for their first injury, and this change in risk is not considered in many studies. The fact that there are so many index injuries casts further doubt on studies which only report the first injury or time to first injury, as these are clearly ignoring valuable data on many injury cases. Coding of data according to the SIC model shows that more injuries (15.6%) were directly related to previous index injuries than would be identified by using the Hamilton et al injury classification schemes. Identifying all related injuries is also critical to better management of injuries.

### Accuracy of ICD-10-CM coding for physical child abuse in a paediatric level I trauma centre [^115X1qDV]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The low sensitivity observed should prompt caution before using ICD-coded hospital discharge data alone to estimate incidence of physical child abuse. The findings of this study may help justify the maintenance of hospital registries containing detailed information on physical abuse cases. Such registries require commitment of resources to maintain but may yield worthwhile improvements in data quality. It is important to note that any data sourced from hospitals, including registries, will be limited to cases where an injury resulted in the patient being taken for medical evaluation or treatment. Ongoing quality improvement efforts within hospital record-keeping and ICD coding systems or algorithms may help improve data accuracy. High-quality data and surveillance methods are critically important to guide child abuse prevention programmes within the hospital and the community to where they are needed most.

What is already known on the subject

Child abuse surveillance presents unique challenges, with reported cases often acknowledged as only the 'tip of the iceberg' or the 'worst of the worst'.
International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) inpatient coding sensitivity from hospital discharge data for physical child abuse ranged from 61% to 92% in previous studies.

What this study adds

Accuracy of ICD coding for physical child abuse remains a concern with ICD-10-CM, despite creation of separate codes for confirmed and suspected abuse.
Ongoing quality improvement efforts and incorporation of multiple data sources are important to optimise child abuse surveillance.

### Tennis-specific extension of the international olympic committee consensus statement: methods for recording and reporting of epidemiological data on injury and illness in sport 2020 [^115JThZf]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Defining and classifying health problems

We adopt the definition of an athlete's health problem as stated by the authors of the IOC consensus statement as any condition that affects an athlete's normal state of full health, irrespective of its consequences on the athlete's sports participation or performance, or whether the athlete sought medical attention. Such a broad definition is crucial for tennis, a sport where non-time-loss problems dominate the injury and illness spectrum.

The IOC consensus statement recommends implementing methods that capture relevant subtleties of injury onset, rather than using sudden and gradual onset as a dichotomy only. In table 2, we provide tennis-specific examples for this classification.

### Football-specific extension of the IOC consensus statement: methods for recording and reporting of epidemiological data on injury and illness in sport 2020 [^115cTonC]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Subsequent, recurrent and/or exacerbation of health problems

We agreed to recommend using the categories from the IOC consensus statement where it should initially be determined whether a health problem following an index injury/illness is a subsequent injury/illness to the same location (body area/system) or a subsequent new injury/illness. As this is not clearly specified in the IOC consensus statement, we recommend that a subsequent health problem is called a recurrence if it is the same type/diagnosis; if not, it is called a subsequent local injury/illness. For recurrences, if the player's health problem was fully healed/recovered and the player has returned to football, the subsequent health problem is called a reinjury/repeated illness; if not, it is called an exacerbation (table 3).

Table 3
Examples of how to record subsequent injuries in football

A typical football-relevant example of an exacerbation is gradual-onset tendinopathies, where players can often play matches in parallel with modified football training and rehabilitation. Consequently, this injury is counted only once rather than recording several early reinjuries, which would distort the overall injury statistics; one further example of how to record subsequent injuries is seen in table 3. We recommend reporting details on injury recurrence in days rather than the categorisation of 'early' (within 2 months following return to football), 'late' (two to twelve months) and 'delayed' (more than twelve months) recurrences as was originally recommended in the 2006 football consensus statement.

Football injury and illness diagnoses

We recommend classifying injuries according to body regions/areas, tissue types and pathology, and illnesses using organ systems/regions and aetiology, as categorised in tables 4–5 and 7–9 in the IOC consensus statement. Exceptions include dividing the body area 'hip/groin' to 'hip' and 'groin' and adding 'complete and partial tendon avulsions' to the notes for the pathology type tendon rupture.

Table 4
Football-specific recommendations and additions to table 6 in the IOC consensus statement

Table 5
Examples of how to record time-loss and calculate injury/illness severity in football

The separation of the hip and groin areas will affect the grouping of diagnoses used in diagnostic coding systems and will need further standardisation to ensure reliable categorisation. For example, when using the Orchard Sport Injury & Illness Classification System (OSIICS), we recommend to group diagnostic codes related to:

Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

Sports-related concussion — professionalism and training expectations: The AAN Code of Professional Conduct states that "The neurologist must practice only within the scope of his/ her training, experience, and competence" and "The neurologist should provide care that represents the prevailing standards of neurologic practice", and it is therefore essential that physicians responsible for the sideline or subsequent medical care of athletes with sports-related head trauma have adequate training and experience in the recognition and evaluation of potential brain injury. Physicians should also be familiar with current management guidelines, such as those recently released by the AAN, and national and state-specific programs (e.g. CDC's Heads Up initiative; Pennsylvania Department of Education's BrainSTEPS) to raise awareness and improve concussion education.

### Quality improvement in neurology: concussion quality measurement set [^1128Jtkf]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Current standard of care for concussion — published consensus statements and evidence-based guidelines generally converge on several key recommendations, including (1) removal from and avoidance of at-risk activities, such as contact sports, until medical evaluation and clearance, (2) lack of an indication for acute neuroimaging for the routine diagnosis of concussion in absence of red flags, (3) assessment of concussion-related symptoms, (4) completion of a neurologic physical examination, and (5) a gradual return to physical and cognitive activities prior to medical clearance. The work group aimed to incorporate these key recommendations and several others into quality measures, but lack of current evidence and anticipated difficulty with measurement implementation prevented the development of several proposed measures.

### Cardiovascular clearance for sports participation [^116beNSa]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in a young athlete is a rare but tragic occurrence. The goal of this article is to provide information about the risks of sudden cardiac death in athletes by reviewing the epidemiology and describing the current screening recommendations of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology. 1 The specifics of and reasons for differences between screening guidelines in the United States and the screening guidelines in Europe are highlighted. Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes that can be expected in the setting of conditioning vs pathology are described. Intrinsic cardiac pathologies and disorders, with related cardiac findings, are reviewed, including prevalence and inheritance patterns. Also included is a brief medical-legal discussion about physician liability in the course of making sports clearance decisions. In an area in which there is no single national standard but in which there is an expectation by almost all states for a clearance examination, this article aims to help physicians make thoughtful decisions when evaluating a seemingly healthy patient in order to detect those rare athletes who may be at increased risk of succumbing to a sudden cardiac death during sports participation. 21.

### Football-specific extension of the IOC consensus statement: methods for recording and reporting of epidemiological data on injury and illness in sport 2020 [^1118uZ9F]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Hip joint under 'hip' (codes beginning with GA, GC, GD, GE, GG, GL, GQ).
Muscles, tendons, bursae, abrasions etc (codes beginning with GB, GH, GI, GK, GM, GN, GO, GR, GT) may be grouped according to their position: Anterior locations grouped under 'groin'. Lateral and posterior locations under 'hip'.
Bone stress, fractures and non-specific diagnoses (codes beginning with GF, GG, GJ, GP, GS, GU, GZ) may be differentiated according to their proximity to either the pubic symphysis or the hip joint.

The IOC consensus statement recommends a structured, standardised overview table (see table 6 in that statement) to provide an overview of the most common injuries. We agreed to modify this table according to the most common injuries in football. We also recommend reporting the percentages of all injuries with the absolute numbers and the median with the IQR for time-loss days instead of a 95% CI. We recommend the revised overview table in the main manuscript be the minimum requirement for each future study (table 4). Importantly, studies should also specify data on training and match injuries in a separate table or an online supplemental file. We recommend that authors create at least one expanded table in a online supplemental file using the same structure and column headings but with a more extensive overview of diagnoses, ensuring player confidentiality for injuries with small numbers. Especially if the study objective is on specific injury types (eg, muscle injuries or fractures) and specific populations (eg, detailed apophysis injuries in youth players), it will also facilitate improved future pooling of data from studies.

There was an agreement to record and classify multiple injuries in the same event separately but only to count once for incidence calculations as per the IOC consensus statement. Injury severity should also be based on the principal (most severe) injury. For example, when a player sustains a wrist sprain and an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury of the knee after a one-legged landing and fall following a heading duel, these injuries should be counted only once in the incidence statistics, and the severity determined according to the ACL injury.

Finally, we also encourage researchers to use recommended and updated sports-specific diagnostic coding systems, such as the Sport Medicine Diagnostic Coding System or the OSIICS, which has an accompanying Excel data file.

### The preparticipation sports evaluation [^112jfUtu]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The preparticipation physical evaluation is a commonly requested medical visit for amateur and professional athletes of all ages. The overarching goal is to maximize the health of athletes and their safe participation in sports. Although studies have not found that the preparticipation physical evaluation prevents morbidity and mortality associated with sports, it may detect conditions that predispose the athlete to injury or illness and can provide strategies to prevent injuries. Clearance depends on the outcome of the evaluation and the type of sport (and sometimes position or event) in which the athlete participates. All persons undergoing a preparticipation physical evaluation should be questioned about exertional symptoms, presence of a heart murmur, symptoms of Marfan syndrome, and family history of premature serious cardiac conditions or sudden death. The physical examination should focus on the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems. U.S. medical and athletic organizations discourage screening electrocardiography and blood and urine testing in asymptomatic patients. Further evaluation should be considered for persons with heart or lung disease, bleeding disorders, musculoskeletal problems, history of concussion, or other neurologic disorders.

### Accuracy of ICD-10-CM coding for physical child abuse in a paediatric level I trauma centre [^115rxXJw]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

ICD-10-CM coding for physical child abuse

The frequencies of ICD-10-CM codes of interest for physical child abuse are detailed in table 2. The most frequently used ICD-10-CM code related to physical child abuse was T76.12 (Child physical abuse, suspected, n = 56). Only 4.2% of the cohort received the supplementary ICD-10-CM code to show they had been examined or observed for possible abuse or neglect (Z04.72).

Table 2
Frequency of ICD-10-CM code usage related to physical child abuse, 2016–2017

Among inpatients, ICD-10-CM coding for physical child abuse sensitivity was 55.6% (95% CI 41.4% to 69.1%) and specificity was 78.6% (95% CI 59.0% to 91.7%). Among outpatients, sensitivity was 22.2% (95% CI 15.5% to 30.2%) and specificity was 86.3% (95% CI 77.7% to 92.5%). Table 3 summarises the findings of the accuracy analysis.

Table 3
Analysis of sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for ICD-10-CM coding of physical child abuse in 2016–2017

Eighteen out of 19 false positives (94.7%) were classified as positive for ICD-10-CM coding based on the presence of a code for suspected child abuse (ICD-10-CM code T76.xx). One other false positive occurred when the patient was given a Y07 cause of injury code (which designated the perpetrator). Although this child was evaluated for physical abuse, only sexual abuse was confirmed. Reasons for false negative results (cases classified as physical abuse based on MCPT determination that did not receive an ICD-10-CM code for physical abuse) were not evaluated.

### Saving athletes' lives a reason to find common ground? [^112Z1dzt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Although both U.S. and European guidelines recommend screening athletes for suspected heart disease before participation in competitive sport, they disagree on which findings are associated with increased risk as well as those athletes whose activities should be restricted. Recent Italian data suggest that screening programs can save lives, but few countries have fully adopted such practices. It is time to develop an international consensus on who should receive pre-participation screening, who should perform the screening, what tests the screening should consist of, and what criteria should be used to restrict participation.

### Para sport translation of the IOC consensus on recording and reporting of data for injury and illness in sport [^111kBzPi]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2020, the IOC proposed a universal methodology for the recording and reporting of data for injury and illness in sport. Para sport is played by individuals with impairment, and they have a unique set of considerations not captured by these recommendations. Therefore, the aim of this addendum to IOC consensus statement was to guide the Para sport researcher through the complexities and nuances that should be taken into consideration when collecting, registering, reporting and interpreting data regarding Para athlete health. To develop this translation, experts in the field of Para sports medicine and epidemiology conducted a formal consensus development process, which began in March 2020 with the formation of a consensus group that worked over eight phases, incorporating three virtual consensus meetings to finalise the translation. This translation is consistent with the IOC consensus statement, yet provides more detailed Para athlete specific definitions and recommendations on study population, specifically, diagnostic and eligible impairment categorisation and recording of adaptive equipment, and defining and classifying health problems in the context of Para sport. Additionally, recommendations and Para athlete specific examples are described with regards to injury mechanism, mode of onset, injury and illness classification, duration, capturing and reporting exposure and risk. Finally, methods and considerations are provided to cater to the varied needs of athletes with impairment with respect to data collection tools. This harmonisation will allow the science to develop and facilitate a more accurate understanding of injury and illness patterns for tailoring evidence-informed prevention programmes and enabling better planning of medical services for Para sport events.

Severity of health problems

The severity of health problems in sport can be described using various criteria. These include the duration of the period for which an athlete is unable to train/play (called 'time loss'), the athlete's self-reported consequences (various patient-rated measures of both health and sports performance), the clinical extent of illness/injury and societal cost (economic evaluation). When considering which severity criterion to use, investigators should consider the strengths and limitations of each approach related to the objectives of their study or surveillance programme.

METHODS

Concussion Subtype Workgroup and Invited Observers

To define concussion subtypes, experts were identified from: the 2015 "Targeted Evaluation and Active Management" meeting; other concussion-focused meetings; review of relevant literature; and via recommendation from various medical and health organizations. Each workgroup candidate was reviewed for potential invitation to participate. In total, 11 nonfederal members ultimately formed the workgroup and they were required to declare financial and intellectual conflicts of interest. In addition, federal representatives, from the U.S. Department of Defense, the FDA/Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, and the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, as well as organizational representatives from the American Academy of Neurology, American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons, National Athletic Trainer's Association, the American College of Sports Medicine, and the Brain Trauma Foundation participated as observers and reviewers to the process and to the final report. The Concussion Subtypes Workgroup was charged with developing subtype-specific definitions, inclusion and exclusion criteria, acknowledging associated data, identifying primary outcomes, linking data elements, advising systematic review of evidence and analysis, developing recommendations, and positing future directions for research.

Derivation of Definitions and Selection of Clinical Questions

Workgroup members convened to identify and establish thematic descriptions of the most common concussion subtypes based upon expert consensus, and identify clinical questions. The following 4 clinical questions are identified:
What is the prevalence of concussion subtypes and associated conditions compared with controls within the first 3 mo postinjury?
What is the severity of symptoms reported compared to control populations?
What is the temporal recovery trajectory by concussion subtype and associated conditions over the first 3 mo postinjury?
How do subtypes cluster?

### Emergency department coding of bicycle and pedestrian injuries during the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 [^114Gw6fW]. Injury Prevention (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study shows that ED coders are reliable in E-coding bicycle injuries using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CA systems. ICD-10-CA and ICD-9-CM are valid classification tools in capturing bicycle injuries presenting to the ED. Pedestrian injuries, however, may be miscoded as falls, and this needs to be considered when examining ICD coded administrative data on these vulnerable road users. These results have important implications for injury surveillance research.

What is already known on the subject

In both ICD-9 and ICD-10, external cause of injury codes (E-codes) have been widely used for morbidity and mortality surveillance.
Current studies suggest that reliability of E-coding injured patients for ICD-9 ranged from 56 to 82% and for ICD-10 ranged from 68 to 71%.
Misclassification does occur in E-coding of specific groups of injuries, such as work-related injuries in approximately 14% of cases.

What this study adds

This study demonstrated that sensitivity of both emergency department (ED) and independent coders was > 90% for bicycle injuries but lower than 50% for pedestrian injuries.
The majority of misclassification of E-coding pedestrian injuries was recorded as fall.
Although bicycle injuries were E-coded with high accuracy, unexpected high misclassification in pedestrian injuries for both emergency department and independent coders highlights the importance of validity and reliability examination of E-coding before drawing valid conclusions in surveillance studies.

### Accuracy of ICD-10-CM coding for physical child abuse in a paediatric level I trauma centre [^1174RtVm]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Child maltreatment is a significant public health problem that affected an estimated 674 000 children in the US in 2017. Surveillance has historically relied on substantiated case rates from Child Protective Services (CPS), although hospital discharge data sets based on the International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification (ICD-CM) coding are also used as data sources for epidemiological studies of child abuse seen in hospital settings. Evaluating the accuracy of this hospital discharge data is important because abusive injury may be more prone to ICD coding errors than accidental injury. Published studies of the accuracy of ICD-9-CM coding for physical child abuse indicated a sensitivity of 61%–92%. Previous studies have identified at least two contributors to low sensitivity in child abuse coding: coder error and insufficient or unclear documentation in the medical record.

Child abuse diagnosis codes were expanded under ICD-10-CM to include both confirmed and suspected abuse. What was previously one code in ICD-9-CM (995.54 Child physical abuse) became two codes under ICD-10-CM (T74.12 Child physical abuse, confirmed and T76.12 Child physical abuse, suspected). No published study to date has investigated the accuracy of ICD-10-CM coded hospital discharge database data for physical child abuse to evaluate the suitability of these databases for research or surveillance purposes. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of hospital discharge data, by comparing ICD-10-CM codes assigned after hospital discharge with known case outcomes documented by a multidisciplinary child protection team (MCPT).

### International olympic committee consensus statement: methods for recording and reporting of epidemiological data on injury and illness in sport 2020 — including STROBE extension for sport injury and illness surveillance — STROBE-SIIS [^1146hDe3]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Subsequent, recurrent and/or exacerbation of health problems

Was a subsequent health problem related to previous health problems? This is an important question in the field. To know whether health problems follow previous health problems requires both sets of problems to be classified correctly using consistent terminology. This exercise can provide greater insight into the etiological factors that underpin subsequent health problems.

Hamilton et al provided a useful framework to categorise subsequent injuries/illnesses and exacerbations in sport (figure 3). More recent frameworks incorporate extensive criteriathat require judgement by trained clinicians, which may be beyond the scope and capacity of many surveillance protocols. When reporting frameworks become more complex, there is a greater risk of data errors. In general, we do not recommend complex frameworks but they can be considered for sophisticated data collection and analysis where appropriate expertise and resources exist.

Figure 3
Classification tree for subsequent health problems (adapted from Hamilton et al). Definitions: (1) index injury (illness) = the first recorded injury (illness), (2) subsequent injury (illness) = any injury (illness) occurring after the index injury (illness) ((i) subsequent injury to a different location than the index injury (subsequent illness involving a different system than the index illness); (ii) subsequent injury to the same location but of a different tissue type than the index injury (subsequent illness of involving the same system but of a different type/other diagnosis) or (iii) subsequent recurrent injury (illness) = subsequent injury to the same site and of the same type as the index injury (subsequent illness involving the same system and type as the index illness). Third, fourth or more health problems should be assessed relative to the initial index health problem and all other previous ones (eg, second and third health problem).

### Football-specific extension of the IOC consensus statement: methods for recording and reporting of epidemiological data on injury and illness in sport 2020 [^112WfYaG]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We provide an updated guideline on definitions, data collection procedures and reporting standards for studies on injuries and illnesses in football with the objective of improving injury and illness management and prevention strategies.

Research implications

This consensus extension should ensure more consistent study designs and the use of recommended nomenclature in future surveillance studies of football injuries and illnesses regardless of setting, thus facilitating comparisons across studies and pooling of data. Nonetheless, we think that a further update will likely be needed within the next decade from this publication because of an expected surge of new literature in the field and scientific developments. Until then, we encourage journal editors and peer reviewers to check that submitted manuscripts harmonise with the generic IOC consensus statement and the current football-specific consensus extension.

### Impacts of regular physical activity on hospitalisation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a nationwide population-based study [^114yGxK8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study population

We used the Health Screening Examination data from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC), which is a population-based retrospective cohort that includes a 2.2% representative sample of Korean citizens. The NHIS-NSC database collects health data regardingmajor and minor diagnoses using the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) codes, drug prescriptions, andhealth examination findings. Detailed information on the NHIS-NSC database has been published previously.

As shown in figure 1, between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2017, there were 490 493 adult subjects aged ≥ 40 years. We excluded 12 013 subjects who had missing values for any of the items of the health screening examination and 78 467 subjects who had cancer (C00–C97). Of the remaining 400 013 subjects, 66 532 had one or more ICD-10 codes for COPD and 333 481 subjects had no ICD-10 codes for COPD. Of 66 532 subjects with one or more ICD-10 codes for COPD, 12 468 subjects had one or more ICD-10 codes for COPD within 1 year of health examination and finally, 3308 subjects had at least one ICD-10 code for COPD and COPD-related medications within 1 year of health examination (COPD cohort). Of 333 481 subjects with no ICD-10 codes for COPD, we excluded 40 123 subjects with one or more ICD-10 codes for COPD between 2002 and 2008, or 2018 and 2019. Finally, 293 358 subjects had no COPD (non-COPD cohort). All subjects were followed up until death or 31 December 2019.

### Cleft and craniofacial coding in ICD-10 [^117BydQ3]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

With the gradual replacement of the ICD-9 coding system by the newer ICD-10 system, there is a need to critically evaluate how the system improves-or fails to improve-the coding of specific cleft and craniofacial anomalies. The following review examines the new system and the key components for practitioners who treat patients with such anomalies.

Conclusions

While seemingly beneficial in certain respects, the newer ICD-10 system remains far from ideal for cleft and craniofacial anomalies. With future iterations of the system, a more concerted effort to precisely code such anomalies is warranted, which will likely require input from key practitioners.

### Emergency department coding of bicycle and pedestrian injuries during the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 [^114kBrmV]. Injury Prevention (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Edmonton is one of the two largest cities in Alberta, with a population of 1 034 945 (city = 730 372; other metropolitan areas = 304 573) (reported by Statistics Canada, 2006). Four periods of a biannual Canadian community health survey (2001–07) demonstrated that the prevalence of recreational bicycle use in Alberta among youth (12–17 years of age) was in the range 58–65% and the mean number of times adolescents bicycled in the past 3 months was in the range 16–30%. The prevalence of recreational bicycling for adults (18+) was 24–28% and mean number of times adults bicycled was 17–19 in the past 3 months. In the same study the prevalence of commuting bicycle use among youth in Alberta was 31–35% and among adults was 6–7%.

A nationwide Canadian study demonstrated that 2% of all hospitalisations were due to bicycle-related injuries during a 10-year period (1994–2004). A 5-year study (1991–95) in British Columbia demonstrated that 4% of visits of all children (1–19 years of age) to the emergency department (ED) resulted from bicycle-related injuries.

In order to conduct surveillance studies, we require valid coding of patient's diseases and circumstances of the event leading to admission to EDs or hospitals. Inpatient coding has been established in hospitals for use in disease and mortality surveillance, epidemiological studies, billing and financial planning, and policy analyses.

The International Classification of Diseases versions 9 (ICD-9) and 10 (ICD-10) have been used to code diseases and other health problems recorded on many types of health and vital records, including death certificates, hospitalisation and ED data. The ICD-10 classification is the latest in a series which has its origins in the 1850s. ICD-10 was endorsed by the 43rd WHO assembly in May 1990 and began implementation in WHO member states in 1994. The differences between ICD-9 and ICD-10 are substantial, not only in disease classification, but also in coding rules. As the ICD-9 system has been used by many hospitals and clinics for years and is still used in many US centres, this transition introduced some challenges for long-term and comparative studies.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^112oV5xU]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Traumatic aetiologies

In terms of traumatic cases, an APC subset of 202 (39%) cases had ICD-10-AM codes referencing the key terms "injury" and "spinal cord". These terms were taken to indicate a definitive diagnosis of a traumatic SCI or a spinal cord or cauda equina syndrome. In rank order, cervical cases were the most prevalent cause of SCI (135 [32%]) followed by thoracic (51 [10.1%]), and lumbar cases (16 [3.2%]). Table 2 presents the distribution and frequency of those traumatic cases identified and subsequently quantitated by ICD-10-AM code.

Non-traumatic aetiologies

ICD-10-AM codes identifying SCD epochs of care accounted for 115 [23%] of the 504 cases. Of these "vascular myelopathies", and "intraspinal abscess and granuloma" 28 [8.7%] were most frequently recorded. In terms of omissions, ethical constraints precluded the reporting of rare spinal or spinal cord aetiologies with < 5 recorded cases. Due to these constraints the cohort selected for analysis excluded ICD-10 codes for: (i) "Benign neoplasm of meninges: Spinal meninges"; and (ii) "Benign neoplasm of brain and other parts of central nervous system: Spinal cord".

Table 2 also presents ICD-10 codes for "Guillain-Barré syndrome" (22 cases). Of note, GB is a forme fruste diagnosis, and as such new index cases are; first, admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in our facility and secondly, consented to participate and recorded in the ASCIR. For the purpose of this study GB cases were retained for analysis.

Vertebral column injuries

The NLM descriptors/ search terms "fracture" and "neck", or "cervical spine", "thoracic spine" or "lumbar spine" and "fracture" were used in this study to define an epoch of inpatient care due to accidental (low or high impact trauma) or pathological fracture (data not shown). However, from these descriptors it is not reasonable to infer a sine qua non diagnosis of SCI/D. Radiological evidence of spinal canal compromise with concomitant spinal cord compression, together with an ISNCSCI physical examination would be necessary to be confident of sine qua non. These filters were rejected in the construction of the CONSORT framework (Fig. 1) but may inform future attempts to construct a spinal disorders registry.

Infectious mononucleosis — return to play/sport decision-making is individualized and should include the patient's health status, sport-specific risk, and outside modifiers. The page specifies that the evaluation of health status includes medical factors such as age, personal medical history, symptoms and physical examination, lab tests, and psychological state; sport modifiers include the type of sport, position played, level of competition, and equipment used; and additional modifiers include timing with respect to the season, the athlete's desire to participate, pressure from parents or coaches, financial conflicts of interest, and the fear of litigation. It further emphasizes that beyond exam and labs, clinicians should consider social, emotional, and physical stressors when holding an athlete out from sport.

### Evidence-based risk stratification for sport medicine procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic [^117XFXsi]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Orthopaedic practices have been markedly affected by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the ban on elective procedures, it is impossible to define the medical urgency of a case solely on whether a case is on an elective surgery schedule. Orthopaedic surgical procedures should consider COVID-19-associated risks and an assimilation of all available disease dependent, disease independent, and logistical information that is tailored to each patient, institution, and region. Using an evidence-based risk stratification of clinical urgency, we provide a framework for prioritization of orthopaedic sport medicine procedures that encompasses such factors. This can be used to facilitate the risk-benefit assessment of the timing and setting of a procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Inpatient and emergency department costs from sports injuries among youth aged 5–18 years [^116sN9XA]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Patients who had an injury from a sport were identified using the following E-code fields: E006.x (individual sports), E007.x (team sports), E008.x (other sports), E886.0 (fall from sports), E917.0 (struck in sports) and E917.5 (struck and fall in sports). These include all ICD-9-CM codes that had 'sports' in the description. The inpatient data included 4658 observations and the ED data included 234 754 observations. Observations were omitted from the model analysis if they did not include an E-code for a specific, named sport, for example patients who were injured with an E-code of a general nature such as 'struck in sports' or 'other activity involving other sports'. Observations were also omitted from the model analysis if the patient did not seek treatment for one of the injuries defined in the Barell Injury Diagnosis Matrix. The Barell Injury Diagnosis Matrix is a commonly used tool in injury epidemiology that uses ICD-9-CM codes to classify injury by body region and nature of injury. Examples from those omitted observations included youth patients who were principally diagnosed with an unspecified episodic mood disorder or other cellulitis or abscess. One patient whose costs were 12 times higher than the average was omitted as a cost outlier. For the final analysis, the model included 2303 inpatient observations.

### Emergency visits for sports-related injuries [^111NAgGd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We sought to estimate the effect and magnitude of patients with sports-related injuries presenting to hospital emergency departments in the United States and to examine differences in patient and visit characteristics between sports- and nonsports-related injuries.

Methods

Data from the 1997 and 1998 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a national probabilistic sample of 496 US hospital EDs, were combined to examine emergency visits for sports-related injuries. Data from 16,997 sample ED encounter records for injuries that included narrative cause of injury text were analyzed. Narrative text entries were coded to 1 of 84 sport and recreational activity codes. Sample weights were applied to provide annual national estimates. Estimates of sports-related injury visits were based on 1,775 records with an assigned sports-related activity code.

Results

There were an average annual estimated 2.6 million emergency visits for sports-related injuries by persons between the ages of 5 and 24 years. They accounted for over 68% of the total 3.7 million sport injuries presented to the ED by persons of all ages. As a proportion of all kinds of injuries presenting to the ED, sports-related injuries accounted for more than one fifth of the visits by persons 5 to 24 years old. The use rate was 33.9 ED visits per 1,000 persons in this age group (95% confidence interval 30.3 to 37.5). The sports-related injury visit rate for male patients was more than double the rate for female patients (48.2 versus 19.2 per 1,000 persons between 5 and 24 years of age). Visits from sports-related activities for this age group were more frequent for basketball and cycling compared with other categories (eg, baseball, skateboarding, gymnastics). Compared with nonsports-related injuries for this age group, sports-related injuries were more likely to be to the brain or skull and upper and lower extremities. Patients with sports-related injuries were more likely to have a diagnosis of fracture and sprain or strain and less likely to have an open wound. They were also more likely to have diagnostic and therapeutic services provided, especially orthopedic care.

Conclusion

Sports-related activities by school-age children and young adults produce a significant amount of emergency medical use in the United States. The ED is an appropriate venue to target injury prevention counseling.

### Exercise and competitive sports in patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [^113e4dHo]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) prevent sudden arrhythmic death in patients with different arrhythmogenic cardiac diseases. Because intense physical activity may trigger ventricular arrhythmias and may favour inappropriate shock delivery that impacts quality of life, current international recommendations only give clearance for moderate leisure-time physical activity to patients with an ICD. Hence, athletes are deemed non-eligible to compete with their ICD. The rationale for the current restriction from competitive sports is discussed in this review, as well as new insights that may alter these recommendations for certain sports participants in the foreseeable future. This review provides guidance for the choice of a durable lead and device system, careful programming tailored to the characteristics of the patient's physiological and pathological heart rhythms, instalment of preventive bradycardic medication, and guided rehabilitation with psychological counselling, allowing a maximum of benefit and a minimum of harm for physically active ICD patients.

### International olympic committee consensus statement: methods for recording and reporting of epidemiological data on injury and illness in sport 2020 — including STROBE extension for sport injury and illness surveillance — STROBE-SIIS [^112banAK]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study population characteristics

Depending on the purpose of the study, demographic and health data may be included in injury and illness surveillance protocols. The demographic information captured should, as a minimum, include age, sex and level of competition and disability/impairment type in Paralympic sport. These can be supplemented with data on other relevant characteristics that could help investigators evaluate risk factors.

It is important to describe the performance and training level of the study population, both because they are often closely related to health outcomes and to allow appropriate studies to be compared. It is beyond the scope of this consensus group to provide a universal classification of competitive level. For example, the criteria used to define 'elite' vary considerably among sports. We encourage sport-specific methodological consensus groups to define what constitutes 'elite', 'sub-elite' and 'recreational' athletes in their sport.

Classification of sport categories

There are many ways of classifying and grouping sports. Any sports classification system used in surveillance should be clearly described in the methods section of reports. The description should permit other researchers to understand and replicate the process by which sports were grouped. The research problem being addressed should shape the classification system used, rather than vice versa.
