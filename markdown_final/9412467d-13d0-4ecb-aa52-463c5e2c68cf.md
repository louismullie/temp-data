## Question

so i see a genital lesion, how should it be tested blood or swab

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which tests to prioritize for an active genital lesion — swabbing the lesion versus blood tests — and how to structure the diagnostic approach accordingly. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely differential diagnoses for a genital lesion. Then, I should verify which test modalities best detect active infection at the lesion site versus those that reflect systemic immune response. Next, I will review guideline-backed evidence for lesion swab PCR/NAAT across pathogens. After that, I need to assess the role and timing of blood serology. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with exceptions and follow-up plans [^11257c3A] [^116WcRNP] [^116zd5PJ] [^114EkGwY] [^112dRLSz].

> Let me first confirm the key differential for a genital lesion so I do not miss high-consequence infections. The common infectious etiologies that must be considered are syphilis, genital herpes (HSV-1/2), mpox, and chancroid, with HPV-related genital warts as a nonulcerative comparator, and the clinical morphology often guides pretest probability and test selection [^11257c3A] [^116zd5PJ] [^114EkGwY] [^114CHrs2] [^112XFLft].

> Now, I need to distinguish the fundamental difference between sampling the lesion directly versus obtaining blood tests, because conflating these can lead to misdiagnosis. Wait, let me verify this: lesion swabs enable molecular detection of pathogen DNA/RNA at the site of active disease, whereas blood-based serology reflects host antibody responses and may not confirm the pathogen causing the current lesion, particularly early in infection or in previously infected individuals [^114zB7Pg] [^116zd5PJ] [^112Ba4FA] [^112dRLSz].

> For syphilis, I should confirm that direct detection from the lesion is guideline-endorsed. The BASHH 2024 guideline specifically recommends obtaining molecular testing for Treponema pallidum from lesions where the organism is expected to be found, and to use dark ground microscopy where available, which aligns with direct lesion-based diagnosis in primary disease [^116WcRNP] [^117WW5ap]. Let me double-check performance data: lesion swab PCR for T. pallidum shows materially higher sensitivity than blood PCR, with swab sensitivity about 82% and blood fractions only 14–29% in a 2012 cohort, underscoring that blood is unsuitable for diagnosing a lesion etiology in early syphilis [^117E4Pms].

> For HSV, hold on, I should verify the preferred test at the lesion. The AAFP 2024 rapid review recommends type-specific viral PCR as the preferred confirmatory test for clinically apparent lesions, with serology reserved for selected contexts when PCR is negative or lesions are atypical or recurrent, which again emphasizes lesion-based diagnosis during active disease [^116zd5PJ] [^116D33iw] [^115NZFPM]. I should also remember that molecular assays for HSV on lesion swabs demonstrate high sensitivity compared with culture, supporting this approach in routine care [^117K7Udo].

> For suspected mpox, let me check specimen guidance so I do not miss the optimal window. WHO's interim guidance directs vigorous lesion swabbing as the specimen of choice because viremia is typically transient and early, with EDTA blood being less sensitive once lesions appear; sampling additional specimen types can be considered in research contexts, but diagnostic priority remains the lesion swab [^114EkGwY] [^115Ayfi2].

> For chancroid, I need to ensure that ulcer-based testing and exclusion of syphilis and HSV are done correctly. CDC 2021 advises that a probable chancroid diagnosis requires at least one painful genital ulcer with typical features, negative testing for T. pallidum and HSV from ulcer exudate or fluid, and appropriate serology timing, again highlighting that lesion sampling is central to evaluation of an active ulcer [^11257c3A] [^116gVNFj].

> Next, I should review the role of blood testing so I do not over-order or under-use it. For syphilis, serology is essential for screening, staging, and follow-up, not for primary lesion confirmation; IUSTI/European guidelines and BASHH recommend quantitative non-treponemal titers and repeat algorithms for discordant results, as well as scheduled follow-up titers to assess response, which complements — but does not replace — direct lesion testing in early disease [^112Ba4FA] [^111mVdU3] [^113ALSqd] [^112dRLSz]. For HSV, selective serology is appropriate when PCR is negative but suspicion remains high, in recurrent or atypical disease, or for epidemiologic counseling contexts such as partner with HSV or high-risk sexual history [^116zd5PJ] [^1157fx7U].

> Wait, I initially considered whether blood PCR might help for syphilis in the acute setting, but I should correct that assumption. The diagnostic study demonstrates poor sensitivity for blood PCR across blood fractions, reinforcing that lesion swab PCR is the efficient method for detecting T. pallidum in patients with active ulcers and that reliance on blood PCR risks false negatives and delayed treatment decisions [^117E4Pms].

> I will now examine practical implementation so quality of sampling does not undermine accuracy. For mpox, WHO emphasizes vigorous lesion swabbing to maximize DNA yield; for syphilis, adequate sampling of the ulcer base improves molecular detection; and, broadly, molecular diagnostics are preferred when available for symptomatic STI presentations, with self-collection strategies increasing uptake without major performance losses when programs are designed appropriately [^114EkGwY] [^114zB7Pg] [^1159CjLA].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final, guideline-concordant testing sequence. Primary recommendation: swab the active genital lesion for pathogen-specific molecular testing as first line — HSV PCR with typing, syphilis direct detection by NAAT or dark ground microscopy when available, mpox PCR if compatible epidemiology and morphology, and consideration of H. ducreyi testing in chancroid-suspected settings — because lesion-based testing provides superior sensitivity for diagnosing the cause of the current lesion and guides immediate management and public health actions [^116zd5PJ] [^116WcRNP] [^117WW5ap] [^114EkGwY] [^11257c3A].

> Concurrently or subsequently, I need to ensure blood testing covers staging and co-infection screening rather than primary lesion diagnosis. Obtain syphilis serology with both a treponemal assay and a quantitative non-treponemal test, follow reflex/discordance algorithms per IUSTI/BASHH, repeat if early infection is suspected with initial negative serology, and schedule follow-up titers to monitor response; add HIV and other STI screens per risk and guidelines, and reserve HSV serology for select indications when lesion PCR is negative or suspicion remains high [^112Ba4FA] [^111mVdU3] [^113ALSqd] [^112dRLSz] [^1157fx7U].

> But wait, what if lesions are already healed or sampling is not feasible. In that circumstance, I should reconsider and lean more heavily on serologic pathways — repeat syphilis serology after a short interval if primary syphilis is suspected but initial tests are negative, and consider HSV serology to aid counseling and risk stratification when direct virologic confirmation is no longer possible — recognizing the limitations of serology in attributing the cause of a past lesion [^113ALSqd] [^116D33iw] [^116zd5PJ].

---

For a genital lesion, **swab the lesion for PCR** to detect HSV [^116zd5PJ], syphilis [^116WcRNP], or mpox [^114EkGwY], as this is the most sensitive and specific method for active infection [^114zB7Pg]. Blood testing is not for acute lesions but is used for **serologic confirmation** [^111msfK7], staging [^116WcRNP], and follow-up [^1179fBnf], especially in syphilis. Use lesion swabs for chlamydia/gonorrhea NAAT if discharge is present; reserve blood for HIV, hepatitis B/C, and syphilis serology as part of comprehensive STI screening. Swab first for acute lesions, then add blood tests for confirmation and broader STI assessment [^114zB7Pg].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Initial evaluation

During the initial evaluation, **clinical assessment** should include a thorough history and physical examination to characterize the lesion (e.g. ulcer, vesicle, papule, wart) and assess systemic symptoms and risk factors [^11257c3A]. Additionally, collect a **lesion swab** for PCR testing [^117E4Pms] — the most sensitive and specific method for detecting active infections such as HSV [^116zd5PJ], syphilis [^116WcRNP], and mpox [^114EkGwY].

---

### Specific pathogens and recommended tests

| **Pathogen** | **Recommended test** | **Specimen type** | **Clinical indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| HSV | PCR (preferred) | Lesion swab | Vesicular or ulcerative lesions [^116zd5PJ] |
| Syphilis | PCR (preferred) | Lesion swab | Ulcerative lesions (chancre) [^116WcRNP] |
| Mpox | PCR | Lesion swab | Vesicular or pustular lesions [^114EkGwY] |
| Chlamydia/Gonorrhea | NAAT | Lesion swab or discharge | Purulent discharge or urethritis |
| HIV, Hepatitis B/C, Syphilis | Serology | Blood | Comprehensive STI screening |

---

### Role of blood testing

Blood testing is **not the primary diagnostic method** for acute genital lesions but is essential for:

- **Serologic confirmation** of infections such as syphilis [^111msfK7], HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C [^11257c3A].
- **Staging and follow-up** [^112Ba4FA], particularly for syphilis, to monitor treatment response and disease progression [^1179fBnf].

---

### Situations requiring both swab and blood testing

Situations requiring both swab and blood testing include **syphilis**, for which a lesion swab PCR provides direct detection [^116WcRNP], while serologic testing (treponemal and non-treponemal) [^111msfK7] supports confirmation, staging, and follow-up [^112Ba4FA]. They also include **comprehensive STI screening**, which combines blood tests for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis serology with lesion swabs for direct pathogen detection [^11257c3A].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Primary diagnostic method**: Swab the lesion for PCR testing to detect active infections (HSV [^116zd5PJ], syphilis [^116WcRNP], mpox [^114EkGwY]).

- **Secondary diagnostic method**: Use blood testing for serologic confirmation, staging, and follow-up [^1179fBnf], particularly in syphilis and comprehensive STI screening [^11257c3A].

- **Comprehensive approach**: Combine swab and blood testing when multiple pathogens are suspected or for complete STI evaluation [^114zB7Pg].

---

Swab the lesion for **PCR** [^116zd5PJ] as the primary diagnostic method for acute genital lesions, while blood testing is used for **serologic confirmation, staging, and follow-up** [^111msfK7].

### The traditional or reverse algorithm for diagnosis of syphilis: Pros and cons [^112gTG3m]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We reviewed relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question "What diagnostic considerations should be taken into account when screening for syphilis using the traditional or reverse algorithm?" Improved laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is an important element of the effort to reduce syphilis rates. Screening for syphilis is performed using either a nontreponemal or treponemal test (part of the traditional or reverse algorithm, respectively). Both syphilis algorithms are used by laboratories; however, there are limited data on the performance and cost-effectiveness of the algorithms.

An expert panel generated "key questions" in the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis. This paper pertains to the key factors that should be considered when deciding whether to screen for syphilis using either the traditional or the reverse algorithm. A systematic literature review was performed, and tables of evidence were created to address this question.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common infections throughout the developed and developing world. It is estimated that worldwide there are 1 million new cases per day of curable bacterial STIs. As part of the World Health Organization 2001 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Diagnostics Initiative, the organization explored the need for simple, affordable, point-of-care STI testing for curable bacterial STIs. This article reviews the evidence supporting the implementation of currently available rapid tests for five common STIs: syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, and herpes.

### Advances in diagnostics of sexually transmitted infections [^114zB7Pg]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). High credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are caused by various pathogens, many of which share common symptoms. Diagnostic tests are critical in supporting clinical evaluations and making patient management decisions. Molecular diagnostics are the preferred test type when available, especially in asymptomatic patients for many STIs. However, for some infections, serology offers the best insight into infectious status. Clinicians should be aware of the performance characteristics of the available STI diagnostic tests and understand how to use them effectively. Point-of-care tests are helpful to implement rapid and accurate treatment responses, which are particularly beneficial in certain at-risk populations.

### USPSTF recommendations for STI screening [^111rDgcU]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Since 2000, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has issued eight clinical recommendation statements on screening for sexually transmitted infections. This article, written on behalf of the USPSTF, provides an overview of these recommendations.

The USPSTF recommends the following:

- **Screening for increased risk**: Women at increased risk of infection should be screened for chlamydia, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis. Men at increased risk should be screened for human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis.
- **Screening for pregnant women**: All pregnant women should be screened for hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis. Pregnant women at increased risk should also be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea.
- **Routine screening exclusions**: Nonpregnant women and men not at increased risk do not require routine screening for sexually transmitted infections.

Engaging in high-risk sexual behavior increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections. The USPSTF recommends that all sexually active women younger than 25 years be considered at increased risk for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Because not all communities present equal risks of sexually transmitted infections, the USPSTF encourages physicians to consider expanding or limiting the routine sexually transmitted infection screening they provide, based on the communities and populations they serve.

### State of the art for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis [^112iwPBi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge among reproductive-age women. It is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes, including an increased risk of acquiring HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), in addition to adverse birth outcomes. While it is known that BV is a vaginal dysbiosis characterized by a shift in the vaginal microbiota from protective Lactobacillus species to an increase in facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria, its exact etiology remains unknown. The purpose of this minireview is to provide an updated overview of the range of tests currently used for the diagnosis of BV in both clinical and research settings.

- **Traditional BV diagnostics**: This article is divided into two primary sections: traditional BV diagnostics and molecular diagnostics.
- **Molecular diagnostics**: Molecular diagnostic assays, particularly 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are specifically highlighted, in addition to multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), given their increasing use in clinical practice (NAATs) and research studies (16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and FISH) regarding the vaginal microbiota and BV pathogenesis. We also provide a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of BV diagnostic tests and discuss future challenges in this field of research.

### Evaluation of a PCR test for detection of Treponema pallidum in swabs and blood [^117E4Pms]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Syphilis diagnosis is based on clinical observation, serological analysis, and dark-field microscopy (DFM) detection of *Treponema pallidum* subsp. pallidum, the etiological agent of syphilis, in skin ulcers. We performed a nested PCR (nPCR) assay specifically amplifying the tpp47 gene of *T. pallidum* from swab and blood specimens. We studied a cohort of 294 patients with suspected syphilis and 35 healthy volunteers. Eighty-seven of the 294 patients had primary syphilis, 103 had secondary syphilis, 40 had latent syphilis, and 64 were found not to have syphilis.

- **Swab specimens**: The *T. pallidum* nPCR results for swab specimens were highly concordant with syphilis diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 95%. Reasonable agreement was observed between the results obtained with the nPCR and DFM methods (kappa = 0.53).

- **Blood specimens**: No agreement was found between the nPCR detection of *T. pallidum* in blood and the diagnosis of syphilis, with sensitivities of 29, 18, 14.7, and 24% and specificities of 96, 92, 93, and 97% for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), plasma, serum, and whole-blood fractions, respectively.

HIV status did not affect the frequency of *T. pallidum* detection in any of the specimens tested. Swab specimens from mucosal or skin lesions seemed to be more useful than blood for the efficient detection of the *T. pallidum* genome and, thus, for the diagnosis of syphilis.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: a retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^113Qnqn5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by *Treponema pallidum* subsp. *pallidum*. In 2019, the estimated global prevalence of syphilis was 49.7 million, with a 61% increase from 1990. Rates of syphilis have risen significantly in many high- and middle-income countries over the past decade. In England, notifications more than doubled between 2013 and 2022 (6.2–15.4 per 100,000), while they more than tripled in Australia and the United States (US) (7.6–24.3 per 100,000 and 5.5–17.7 per 100,000, respectively). Rates of congenital syphilis have also surged, with a 755% increase reported in the US between 2012 and 2021. Syphilis can present with numerous symptoms and lead to severe conditions, including neurosyphilis. In pregnancy, syphilis infection can be transmitted vertically, causing neonatal morbidity and mortality.

Serological testing is the primary method for diagnosing syphilis, involving multiple tests to screen, confirm, and stage the infection. The reverse screening algorithm is commonly used in high-volume laboratories. This algorithm begins with a sensitive treponemal antibody immunoassay. If this assay is positive, it is followed by non-treponemal antibody tests. If the treponemal and non-treponemal results are discordant, a second confirmatory treponemal test is performed. In the United Kingdom and Australia, if the screening treponemal antibody result is positive, national guidelines recommend confirmation with non-treponemal and treponemal tests. The Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay is considered the preferred method for confirmation.

### Self-collection of samples as an additional approach to deliver testing services for sexually transmitted infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UPhTB]. BMJ Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

We searched PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and Embase through the search date of July 18, 2018, with no limits on publication year, study location, or language. We also conducted secondary reference searching on all studies included in the review and three relevant systematic reviews. Selected experts in the field were contacted to identify additional articles not identified through other search methods. We searched for ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on clinicaltrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, and the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. Search terms were developed for STIs and self-sampling; the full search strategy is available in online supplementary file 1.

After initial screening of titles, abstracts, citation information, and descriptor terms, records were screened independently and in duplicate by two reviewers, with differences resolved through consensus. Full-text articles were obtained for all selected records. Three reviewers independently assessed all full-text articles for eligibility to determine final study selection, with differences resolved through consensus.

For each study, the following information was compiled via independent double-data extraction: study citation, objectives, location, population characteristics, description of the type of STI sampling, and description of any additional relevant information.

### Managing patients with genital herpes and their sexual partners [^115B7f2x]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

There is increasing recognition of the growing size and significance of the genital herpes epidemic. Recent developments in the wide-scale availability of type-specific herpes simplex virus (HSV) serologic assays have meant that many previously undiagnosed mild, atypical, and subclinical infections may now be diagnosed with some degree of confidence without the use of Western blots. The value of such diagnostics is controversial. However, the importance of HSV with its facilitation of HIV transmission and acquisition, the availability of various preventative strategies for limiting vertical HSV transmission, and the growing evidence that condoms, some educational and counseling interventions, and antiviral therapies may limit sexual transmission have challenged many of the arguments against wider testing of the population.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^11257c3A]. MMWR. Recommendations and reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chancroid, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend making a probable diagnosis of chancroid if all of the following four criteria are met:

- **≥ 1 painful genital ulcers**: A minimum of one painful genital ulcer is present.

- **Typical clinical presentation**: This includes the appearance of genital ulcers and regional lymphadenopathy (if present).

- **No evidence of Treponema pallidum infection**: This is confirmed by darkfield examination or NAAT (ulcer exudate or serous fluid) or by serologic tests for syphilis performed at least 7–14 days after the onset of ulcers.

- **Negative HSV-1 or HSV-2 NAAT or HSV culture**: Results are obtained on the ulcer exudate or fluid.

### Recommendations for the selective use of herpes simplex virus type 2 serological tests [^11595pSj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-specific serological tests are now widely available, but indications for their use have not been well defined. The California Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Controllers Association convened a committee of clinicians and researchers to make recommendations for the use of type-specific HSV type 2 (HSV-2) serological tests.

- **Methods**: By means of a systematic review of the literature, evidence to support screening in selected high-risk groups was compiled. Screening recommendations were developed by applying standard screening criteria to each specific population.

- **Results**: The committee concluded that, in addition to serological testing for the diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms, screening of asymptomatic patients is likely to be beneficial among the following groups: those at high risk for STDs and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are motivated to reduce their sexual risk behavior, HIV-infected patients, and patients with sex partners with genital herpes. In contrast, universal screening for HSV-2 infection in pregnant women is unlikely to be beneficial.

- **Conclusions**: The targeted use of HSV-2 serological tests for specific diagnostic situations and selected populations should benefit patients, providers, and the community. Until more data become available, these recommendations provide justification for selective diagnostic and screening uses of HSV-2 serological tests.

### Self-collection of samples as an additional approach to deliver testing services for sexually transmitted infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1117NVJm]. BMJ Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

We assessed self-collection of samples for *Chlamydia trachomatis* (CT), *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (NG), *Treponema pallidum* (syphilis), and *Trichomonas vaginalis* (TV). This aligns with ongoing multicountry evaluations of promising point-of-care testing (POCT) interventions to detect these four curable STIs, as well as the goal of the WHO STI POCT initiative to achieve universal access to reliable and affordable STI testing. There are numerous types of self-collected samples for different STIs, including:

- **Urine samples**: Mainly among men, but also women and youth, for NG, CT, and TV.
- **Vulvovaginal swabs**: For NG, CT, and TV.
- **Pharyngeal and anorectal swabs**: For NG and CT.

Rapid dual tests for HIV/syphilis have been developed and evaluated, but only one so far has been prequalified by the WHO, though others are in the process.

### Improving global estimates of syphilis in pregnancy by diagnostic test type: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129weuA]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

**Statistical analysis**: For each study identified from the literature review, based on the reported data, we manually retrieved or calculated the crude percent estimates of subjects with both reactive treponemal and reactive non-treponemal tests among subjects with reactive treponemal (Category 2) and among subjects with reactive non-treponemal (Category 3) tests, along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the assessed outcomes. We summarized the percent estimates using random-effects models, which take into account the presence of between-study heterogeneity in the calculations. This approach was chosen over a fixed-effects model since the underlying syphilis prevalence and other factors were different in each population studied.

### Which algorithm should be used to screen for syphilis [^116KA5EF]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

A growing number of laboratories have implemented a reverse screening algorithm for syphilis testing, creating confusion among many healthcare providers. This review focuses on recent data addressing the clinical and economical impact of reverse screening and discusses the advantages and limitations of traditional and contemporary algorithms.

- **Recent findings**: Screening for syphilis using a treponemal assay detects a higher number of patients with reactive results compared to traditional screening by rapid plasma reagin (RPR). Furthermore, a significant percentage of patients who are reactive by a treponemal screening assay are nonreactive by RPR. These discordant results may occur in patients with past, treated or untreated syphilis; early syphilis; or no syphilis. Recent reports suggest that the reverse screening algorithm may result in increased patient follow-ups, overtreatment, and potentially higher cost. However, other data suggest that reverse screening facilitates the detection of latent and early syphilis while offering an objective and automated screening approach.

- **Summary**: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends syphilis screening with a nontreponemal test. However, as laboratories continue to implement the reverse screening algorithm, it is important that samples with discordant screen-reactive, RPR-nonreactive results be tested by a second treponemal assay to assist in the interpretation of results.

### Molecular-based testing for sexually transmitted infections using samples previously collected for vaginitis diagnosis [^116G6uaa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

It is crucial for clinicians to recognize that women presenting with vaginitis symptoms may have an elevated risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI). There is a significant association between some STIs and conditions like bacterial vaginosis (BV) or Candida spp, which underscores the need for comprehensive STI testing. By integrating molecular testing for both vaginitis and STIs, consistent, objective, and sensitive methods can be employed across various clinical settings, ensuring accurate diagnosis and effective treatment for these conditions.

### Testing for human papillomaviruses in urine, blood, and oral specimens: an update for the laboratory [^112D9f1S]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

- **Process and rationale for the detection of cell-free DNA (including HPV DNA)**: Abnormal lesions and cancers with a vascular component contain nuclear material that can be shed into the blood through various pathways, including necrosis, apoptosis, and secretion. This material, referred to as cell-free DNA (cfDNA), can be double or single stranded, and the concentration and stability depend on several factors, including lesion size, extent of proliferation, and extent of vascularization. cfDNA can be host or viral in origin, and it is feasible for a lesion to exude both.

	- After a blood draw and centrifugation, nucleic acid that contains cfDNA can be extracted from the plasma component. Given the short half-life of some cfDNA targets, efficient sample transfer to the laboratory for processing and extraction is important. cfDNA can be used to detect viral and/or host sequences, specific mutations, integration hallmarks, methylation targets, and microsatellite alterations. Although a range of amplification technologies, such as quantitative PCR (qPCR), have been used for detecting cfDNA, methods that offer high analytical sensitivity, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), are valuable.

	- The translation of cfDNA into routine diagnostic laboratory practice is at a relatively early stage for HPV-associated disease, but it holds promise for various applications, including diagnosis/prognostication and monitoring treatment response. In addition, cfDNA determination is valuable in natural history studies and epidemiological surveys.

### Detection of COVID-19 in a vulvar lesion [^115prUd6]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Low credibility.

As new information about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly discovered, clinicians are better equipped to make informed decisions for their patients. Research suggests COVID-19 viral antigen is not found in vaginal secretions; however, its detectability in the female lower genital tract may have clinical implications for obstetric and gynecologic care for women. We present a case of a woman at 31 weeks' gestation with simultaneous upper respiratory symptoms and vulvovaginitis. She was found to have a vulvar lesion positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-COVID by viral swab. This case shows that COVID-19 is detectable in the vulva, which may have implications for healthcare workers' exposure and personal protective equipment needs. While vertical transmission has largely not been reported, the presence of detectable virus in the female lower genital tract makes this a continued possibility and area of study.

- **Key points**:
	- COVID-19 is detectable in the female lower genital tract.
	- The detection of COVID-19 in the vulva may have implications for personal protective equipment use.
	- The detection of COVID-19 in vulvovaginal lesions makes vertical transmission a continued possibility.

### Accuracy of human papillomavirus testing on self-collected versus clinician-collected samples: A meta-analysis [^117SigRC]. The Lancet Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Screening for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is more effective in reducing the incidence of cervical cancer than screening using Pap smears. Moreover, HPV testing can be done on a vaginal sample self-taken by a woman, which offers an opportunity to improve screening coverage. However, the clinical accuracy of HPV testing on self-samples is not well-known. We assessed whether HPV testing on self-collected samples is equivalent to HPV testing on samples collected by clinicians.

- **Methods**: We identified relevant studies through a search of PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they fulfilled all of the following selection criteria: a cervical cell sample was self-collected by a woman followed by a sample taken by a clinician; a high-risk HPV test was done on the self-sample (index test), and HPV testing or cytological interpretation was done on the specimen collected by the clinician (comparator tests); and the presence or absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) or worse was verified by colposcopy and biopsy in all enrolled women or in women with one or more positive tests. The absolute accuracy for finding CIN2 or worse, or CIN grade 3 (CIN3) or worse of the index and comparator tests, as well as the relative accuracy of the index versus the comparator tests, were pooled using bivariate normal models and random effect models.

- **Findings**: We included data from 36 studies, which altogether enrolled 154,556 women. The absolute accuracy varied by clinical setting. In the context of screening, HPV testing on self-sampl

### Genital herpes: Insights into sexually transmitted infectious disease [^111dH5pm]. Microbial Cell (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on genital herpes:

- **Definition**: Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted viral infection characterized by primary and recurrent inflammation and lesions.

- **Pathophysiology**: Genital herpes is mostly caused by HSV-2 and HSV-1 transmitted through sexual contact.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of genital herpes in North America is estimated to range from 5,000 to 24,000 per 100,000 people per year.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include lesions of mucous membrane presenting as bilateral clusters of macules, papules, followed by vesicles, pustules, and ulcers on the external genitalia with symptoms of pain, itching, burning, dysuria, lymphadenopathy, fever, cervicitis (in women), and proctitis (in homosexual men). Complications in women include aseptic meningitis and urinary retention. Recurrent episodes may show prodromal symptoms of paresthesia and pains in the area of lumbosacral dermatomes. Asymptomatic genital shedding without any clinical symptoms is quite frequent. The disease increases psychological stress with frequent recurrences.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Untreated pregnancy-related genital herpes is associated with a mortality of 0.062 per 1,000 births in neonates.

### Light microscopy, culture, molecular, and serologic methods for detection of herpes simplex virus [^11569rZ7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) cause a variety of human diseases, ranging from acute to chronic and mild to severe. The absence of curative therapy results in lifelong carriage marked by recurrent outbreaks and allows transmission of the virus to uninfected individuals. Nonspecific lesions, variable presentation, and chronic carriage necessitate the use of different laboratory testing methods appropriate for each presentation. A thorough understanding of the performance characteristics and limitations of available tests is critical for the selection of the appropriate test and interpretation of results. Clinical sensitivity, specificity, and the selection of the appropriate methodology are paramount to avoid misdiagnosis and guide therapy.

In this article, we review the different methods for detection and typing of HSV, including light microscopy, culture, serology, and nucleic acid-based tests. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each method for diagnosing HSV infection, cite performance characteristics, and review appropriate clinical uses.

### Fingerprick versus oral swab: Acceptability of blood-based testing increases if other STIs can be detected [^114kLu9h]. AIDS and Behavior (2017). Low credibility.

Self-testing presents untapped potential as a strategy to improve access to HIV testing and increase testing frequency. User acceptability of self-administered oral swab HIV tests is consistently high in both hypothetical and actual-use studies. We explored preferences for oral versus fingerprick HIV self-tests among men who have sex with men with a high-risk profile. Participants indicated a greater likelihood of using an oral swab over a blood-based test, notwithstanding a lower price or quicker results from the latter. However, the likelihood of using an HIV fingerprick test substantially increased if it also offered information on other sexually transmitted infections.

### Syphilis [^112dRLSz]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

What about follow-up? Because syphilis has no test-of-cure, conversion to a non-reactive RPR is the best evidence of successful treatment. Patients should be tested at the start of treatment and monitored at six and 12 months. No clinical data guide the interpretation of RPR titres after treatment, and guidelines are based on expert opinion. Recommendations from European, UK, US, Canadian, and WHO guidelines are taken into account for assessment of treatment of syphilis.

### Genital shedding of herpes simplex virus among symptomatic and asymptomatic persons with HSV-2 infection [^113XbwAr]. JAMA (2011). Low credibility.

Since herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) antibody tests have become commercially available, an increasing number of persons have learned that they have genital herpes through serologic testing. The course of the natural history of HSV-2 in asymptomatic, seropositive persons is uncertain.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the virologic and clinical course of HSV genital shedding among individuals with symptomatic and asymptomatic HSV-2 infection.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Cohort of 498 immunocompetent HSV-2-seropositive persons enrolled in prospective studies of genital HSV shedding at the University of Washington Virology Research Clinic, Seattle, and Westover Heights Clinic, Portland, Oregon, between March 1992 and April 2008. Each participant obtained daily self-collected swabs of genital secretions for at least 30 days.

- **Main outcome measure**: The rate of viral shedding measured by quantitative real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction for HSV DNA from genital swabs.

- **Results**: Herpes simplex virus type 2 was detected on 4753 of 23,683 days (20.1%; 95% confidence interval, 18.3%-22.0%) in 410 persons with symptomatic genital HSV-2 infection compared with 519 of 5070 days (10.2%; 95% CI, 7.7%-13.6%) in 88 persons with asymptomatic infection (P < .001). Subclinical shedding rates were higher in persons with symptomatic infection compared with asymptomatic infection (2708 of 20,735 days [13.1%; 95% CI, 11.5%-14.6%]) vs 434 of 4929 days [8.8%; 95% CI, 6.3%-11.5%]) (P < .001). However, the amount of HSV detected during subclinical shedding episodes was similar.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112166oi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

To further examine automated HSV serology assay performance, we utilized a unique cohort of 1,017 persons with genital HSV infection confirmed by PCR or culture through genital herpes studies at the UW VRC from 1981 to 2019. For this study, we included samples from individuals with genital herpes with PCR- or culture-confirmed HSV infection who had serological testing using the WB at least 6 months (median 5.8 years, range 6 months to 50 years) after the initial episode of genital herpes. Given the focus on genital herpes, 886 (87%) people in this cohort had PCR- or culture-confirmed HSV-2 infections, and 131 (13%) people had PCR- or culture-confirmed genital HSV-1 infections. WB results were 100% concordant with the PCR or culture results. Of the 886 people with confirmed HSV-2 genital infections, 320 (36%) also had HSV-1 antibodies detected on the WB, most likely from prior HSV-1 infection.

The VRC cohort was composed of 669 women (65.8%) and 348 men (34.2%) who provided samples between 1981 and 2019 (median 1989). Most people were white (86.3%), and the overall median age was 34.3 (range: 16–88 years, Table S2; Fig. S2).

### Diagnostic accuracy of pooling urine, anorectal, and oropharyngeal specimens for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Y554W]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

There are several potential limitations to multisite pooled testing. The lack of anatomic-site-specific results is a common concern in the studies reviewed and suggests the need to retest individuals with positive results. Although some guidelines vary in the treatment recommended for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) depending on the site of infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines indicate that the first therapeutic line can be the same regardless of the anatomic site. Using pooled testing may hinder epidemiological data collection for reporting CT/NG infections, as the specific site of infection would not be identified without testing individual sites.

While demonstrating potential cost savings, pooled testing may remain unaffordable in resource-constrained settings lacking established STI testing infrastructure or not adopting molecular point-of-care testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or other infections like tuberculosis or to measure HIV viral load. Pooled testing requires not only access to nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) but also laboratory processes for sample combination prior to testing. Important considerations include the transport and handling of samples, mixing of samples, the amount of diluent used, potential sample contamination, laboratory staff training, and the storage of individual samples for re-testing if needed.

Finally, due to lower bacterial loads in the oropharynx compared to genital and anorectal sites, there is a potential for pooled testing to miss oropharyngeal infections. Future studies should investigate methods to further optimize the detection of oropharyngeal infections.

### Laboratory testing for the monkeypox virus: Interim guidance [^115Ayfi2]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for mpox, particularly concerning specimen collection, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend considering sampling additional specimen types such as urine, semen, rectal, and/or genital swabs based on clinical presentation, including the location of lesions. This should be for research purposes and not for routine diagnostic purposes. Such sampling should only occur if allowed by the appropriate ethical review board and if there is sufficient laboratory and medical expertise for the safe collection, handling, and storage of specimens, as the outbreak is still under investigation.

- **EDTA blood**: Consider using EDTA blood to support the detection of monkeypox virus. It is important to recognize that EDTA blood may not contain the high level of virus found in lesion samples, as any viremia occurs early in the course of infection, usually in the prodromal period and before skin lesions become manifest.

- **Lesion biopsy**: Consider performing a lesion biopsy during the macular stage only if clinically indicated and only by personnel with appropriate training.

### Testing for human papillomaviruses in urine, blood, and oral specimens: An update for the laboratory [^111Gm1bj]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Low credibility.

Twelve high-risk alpha human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes cause approximately 690,000 cancer cases annually, with cervical and oropharyngeal cancer being the two most prominent types. HPV testing is performed in laboratory settings for various clinical, epidemiological, and research applications using a range of clinical specimens collected by clinicians or by individuals (self-collected specimens).

Here, we reflect on the importance and justification of using the right test for the right application and provide practical updates for laboratories either participating in or anticipating involvement in HPV testing in three specimen types, namely, urine, blood, and oral specimens, which are considered "alternative" specimens by many. In addition to clinician-collected cervical samples and self-collected cervicovaginal samples, first-void urine is emerging as a credible specimen for HPV-based cervical cancer screening, triage of HPV screen-positive women, monitoring HPV vaccine impact, and HPV testing in groups for which a less invasive sample is preferred. Detection of cell-free DNA (including HPV DNA) in blood holds great promise for the early detection of HPV-attributable oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-AOC) and potentially other HPV-driven cancers and as an adjunct prognostic marker in long-term tumor surveillance, including treatment response.

The moderate sensitivity of HPV testing in oral rinses or swabs at HPV-AOC diagnosis prevents its use in HPV-AOC secondary prevention but represents a promising prognostic tool in HPV-AOC tertiary prevention, where the HPV persists.

### Performance of point-of-care tests for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111BE3YA]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 127.2 million new cases of CT occur annually worldwide, with most cases arising in resource-limited countries. Untreated CT infection in women can lead to serious complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, tubal infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. In men, CT infection is associated with non-gonococcal urethritis and epididymitis. CT infection in pregnant women can contribute to adverse obstetric outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight. Additionally, genital CT infection significantly increases the risk of HIV transmission and the development of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical carcinoma.

Over 70% of CT infections in women and 50% in men are asymptomatic. Thus, effective control of the infection often relies on screening and subsequent treatment of infected cases. The benefits of CT screening in women have been demonstrated through a reduction in PID rates and the prevention of adverse obstetric outcomes among pregnant women.

Screening for CT is largely dependent on the tests available and accessible to the targeted populations. Laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) provide a highly accurate diagnosis. However, they are typically neither affordable nor accessible in developing countries due to the requirement for laboratory infrastructure, trained personnel, and high costs. Additionally, there is often a delay in the report of test results.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^1114fkEy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL from 1960 to 30 June 2017. Following the consultation in November 2017, we subsequently updated the literature search from July 2017 to September 2018 using the following search terms: (Treponema pallidum OR Neurosyphilis OR Syphilis) AND (sero-diagnos* OR serodiagnos* OR (serolog* AND (test* OR exam* OR assay* OR screen* OR lab* OR diagnos* OR nontreponemal OR treponemal OR algorithm* OR antibody titer) OR serofast)). The search was limited to human studies published in English.

The initial search yielded n = 4851 nonduplicated abstracts. We excluded n = 4504 abstracts that were not relevant to the key question: studies of nontreponemal testing only, animal studies, direct detection studies, review articles, guidelines, letters to the editor, and other publications that were not primary research studies.

We reviewed 347 abstracts and further excluded n = 230 studies that described obsolete tests only, tests not approved by the FDA, those that used a gold standard based exclusively on non-FDA approved tests, studies of prevalence or laboratory technique only (no test performance), any duplicate publications, and abstracts without a full manuscript.

After exclusions, 117 full papers were reviewed for potential inclusion. A total of 81 studies with either descriptive data on use of treponemal tests or actual test performance data were abstracted into Tables of Evidence (Supplementary Table). Studies with test performance data were prioritized according to their relevance to the key question (Supplementary Table).

### The traditional or reverse algorithm for diagnosis of syphilis: Pros and cons [^113yZW16]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We reviewed relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question, "What diagnostic considerations should be taken into account when screening for syphilis using the traditional or reverse algorithm?" Improved laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is an important element of the effort to reduce syphilis rates. Screening for syphilis is performed using either a nontreponemal or treponemal test, which are part of the traditional or reverse algorithm, respectively. Both syphilis algorithms are used by laboratories; however, there are limited data on their performance and cost-effectiveness. An expert panel generated key questions in the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis. This paper pertains to the key factors that should be considered when deciding whether to screen for syphilis using either the traditional or the reverse algorithm. A systematic literature review was performed, and tables of evidence were created to address this question.

### Performance of point-of-care tests for the detection of chlamydia trachomatis infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112V4TYS]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is one of the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) globally but has been inadequately detected for intervention. The introduction of point-of-care tests (POCTs) for CT is critical for addressing the intervention gaps. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the diagnostic performance of POCTs for CT to guide the application of these assays in CT screening and detection.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed/Medline and Embase databases, from January 2004 to May 2021, for studies reporting the performance of POCTs for identifying CT using specimens collected from urethral, vaginal, cervical, anorectal, or pharyngeal sites or urine. Two investigators independently screened and extracted data to control the quality of data extraction. Any discrepancies in study selection and data extraction were resolved by consensus. We included only studies with sufficient data to estimate sensitivity and specificity, using laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) as the reference standard. The main outcomes were pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Summary estimates were calculated using a random-effects model, and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROCs) were generated using the Moses-Littenberg method. STATA 14.0 and Meta-DiSc 1.4 were used for statistical analysis. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019140544.

- **Findings**: Of 3,038 records identified, 39 studies (42,336 specimens) were included.

### Treponema pallidum detection in lesion and non-lesion sites in men who have sex with men with early syphilis: a prospective, cross-sectional study [^112QcnWU]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Syphilis transmission is increasing, and precisely how Treponema pallidum is transmitted sexually from person to person is unclear. We aimed to determine the frequency of T. pallidum shedding from potentially asymptomatic sites and the stage of infection at which shedding is most frequent in men who have sex with men (MSM), who have been disproportionately affected by syphilis.

We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study in MSM recruited from Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Men were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, reported sex with men during the past 12 months, and had laboratory-confirmed primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis, consistent with Australian definitions. Primary and secondary syphilis lesions were swabbed, and non-lesion samples were collected via oral rinse, oral cavity swab, anal canal swab, urine, and semen. Samples were tested for T. pallidum using PCR assays targeting polA (lesion and non-lesion samples) and 47 kDa (non-lesion samples only) gene targets. The primary outcome was the proportion of men with T. pallidum detected from potentially asymptomatic sites, namely, the mouth, anus, urethra, and semen.

Between Nov 30, 2015, and May 23, 2019, 246 MSM were screened for inclusion, of whom 200 had serologically confirmed early syphilis and were included in the study. Of these, 54 (27%) had primary syphilis, 93 (47%) had secondary syphilis, and 53 (27%) had early latent syphilis. T. pallidum DNA was detected in 48 (24%; 95% CI 18.3–30.5) of 200 men by oral rinse or oral lesion swab, or…

### Serological testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HSV-2 infection [^116izgFD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Serological tests for herpes simplex virus (HSV) that can accurately distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 are now commercially available. These tests detect antibodies to HSV glycoproteins G-1 and G-2, which evoke a type-specific antibody response. Focus Technologies produces the HerpeSelect-1 and HerpeSelect-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests, as well as the HSV-1 and HSV-2 HerpeSelect1/2 Immunoblot. Diagnology has marketed POCkit-HSV-2, a point-of-care test for HSV-2 that allows blood from a finger stick to be tested in a clinic.

These tests can be used to confirm a genital herpes diagnosis, establish diagnosis of HSV infection in patients with atypical complaints, identify asymptomatic carriers, and identify persons at risk for acquiring HSV. Potential settings for use of these tests include sexually transmitted disease clinics, prenatal clinics, and clinics that care for patients with human immunodeficiency virus. Patient interest in HSV serological tests appears high.

### Type-specific identification of anogenital herpes simplex virus infections by use of a commercially available nucleic acid amplification test [^117K7Udo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Herpes infections are among the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but diagnostic methods for genital herpes have not kept pace with the movement toward molecular testing. Here, we describe an FDA-approved molecular assay that identifies and types herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections for use in routine clinical settings. Paired samples from anogenital lesions were tested using the BD ProbeTec HSV Q(x) (HSVQ(x)) system, HSV culture, and a laboratory-developed PCR assay. Family planning, obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN), or sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in the United States served as recruitment sites. Sensitivity and specificity estimates, head-to-head comparisons, measures of agreement, and latent-class analyses were performed to provide robust estimates of performance.

A total of 508 participants (174 men and 334 women) with anogenital lesions were included; 260 HSV-2 and 73 HSV-1 infections were identified. No differences in test performance based on gender, clinic type, location of the lesion, or type of lesion were observed. The sensitivity of HSV-2 detection ranged from 98.4 to 100% depending on the analytical approach, while the specificity ranged from 80.6%, compared to the less sensitive culture method, to 97.0%, compared to PCR. For HSV-1, the sensitivity and specificity ranges were 96.7 to 100% and 95.1 to 99.4%, respectively. This assay may improve our ability to accurately diagnose anogenital lesions due to herpes infection.

### Concordance of human papillomavirus types detected on the surface and in the tissue of genital lesions in men [^111wCaXS]. Journal of Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

Swabbing the surface of a genital lesion to obtain a sample for HPV DNA testing is less invasive than a biopsy but may not represent HPV types present in the lesion tissue. The objective of this study was to examine the concordance of HPV types detected in swab and biopsy samples from 165 genital lesions in men aged 18–70. Lesions included 90 condyloma, 10 penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PeIN), 23 non-condyloma with a known histology, and 42 lesions with an undetermined histology. All lesions were sampled by swabbing the surface of the lesion with a pre-wetted Dacron swab and taking a shave biopsy. HPV genotyping was performed using Linear Array for swab samples and INNO-LiPA for biopsy samples.

The kappa and McNemar statistics were used to compare the concordance of detecting HPV types in swab and biopsy samples. Both sampling methods had high agreement for detection of HPV DNA in condyloma (87.8% agreement) and PeIN (100% agreement). There was also high concordance for detection of HPV16 (kappa = 1.00) and HPV18 (kappa = 1.00) in PeIN; however, agreement was low to moderate for detecting HPV6 (kappa = 0.31) and HPV11 (kappa = 0.56) in condyloma. Low to moderate agreement was also observed between sampling methods for detecting individual HPV types in the non-condyloma and lesions with indefinite histology.

The results suggest that obtaining a biopsy in addition to swabbing the surface of a lesion may provide additional information about specific HPV types associated with male genital lesions.

### Testing for human papillomaviruses in urine, blood, and oral specimens: an update for the laboratory [^115HaYXR]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Low credibility.

While HPV testing is relevant for population-based screening of the healthy population, increasing evidence suggests it may be relevant for individual prognostication in the patient population. To serve both healthy and patient populations, a range of biological specimens (biospecimens) and HPV tests with different performance characteristics are required. The characteristics of HPV tests used and the required specimen types differ considerably depending on whether the application for use serves a screening, diagnostic, epidemiological, or research objective.

In routine clinical laboratory settings, testing for hrHPV is used most frequently as a screening tool in HPV-based primary cervical cancer screening programs. For this purpose, HPV testing must be performed using validated molecular tests with clinical sensitivity and specificity calibrated to the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions rather than minute quantities of virus. Until recently, this testing was performed almost exclusively using cervical samples collected by a trained healthcare worker.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^111JhmdE]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). High credibility.

A test-of-cure is unnecessary for persons with uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with any of the recommended or alternative regimens; however, for persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea, a test-of-cure is recommended. This should be done using culture or nucleic acid amplification tests 7–14 days after initial treatment, regardless of the treatment regimen. Because reinfection within 12 months ranges from 7% to 12% among persons previously treated for gonorrhea, persons who have been treated should be retested 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest within 12 months after initial treatment.

### Testing for human papillomaviruses in urine, blood, and oral specimens: an update for the laboratory [^114gA4cc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Low credibility.

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) possess a remarkably stable DNA genome and are classified by the homology of their genome into five genera: Alphapapillomavirus, Betapapillomavirus, Gammapapillomavirus, Mupapillomavirus, and Nupapillomavirus. These are further divided into several species and numerous genotypes, which are numbered chronologically in order of characterization. As of the end of June 2023, 223 distinct HPV genotypes have been officially recognized. The high-risk HPV genotypes (hrHPVs) from the Alphapapillomavirus genus, known for their highest oncogenic potential, include HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58, and -59.

Most hrHPV infections follow a subclinical course; however, some persistent infections are etiologically linked with both benign and malignant lesions of the epithelia. Human cancers attributable to hrHPVs account for 4.5% of all cancers worldwide, which breaks down into 8.8% of all cancers in women and 0.9% in men, with approximately 690,000 new cancer cases identified each year. hrHPVs are responsible for virtually all cervical and anal cancers, a significant proportion of vaginal cancers, and have a role in oropharyngeal, penile, and vulvar cancers. Therefore, laboratory detection of HPV to support screening and management of associated diseases has been a research and development focus since the 1980s, some of which has transitioned into large-scale screening practice. Moreover, general improvements in molecular testing precision and in understanding the natural history of HPV infection have continued to ensure the critical role of laboratory detection of HPV.

### Point-of-care testing for sexually transmitted infections: Recent advances and implications for disease control [^11766PzQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain a major global public health issue, with more than 448 million incident bacterial infections each year. Recent advances in STI point-of-care (POC) testing have significant implications for STI prevention and control.

- **Recent findings**: Accurate immunochromatographic assays to detect HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and syphilis antibodies have made home or supervised self-testing possible. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility and excellent test characteristics for HIV, HCV, and syphilis POC tests. Rapid oral HIV tests are now available for purchase at retail sites across the United States. Combined HIV and syphilis tests using a single finger prick blood sample are under evaluation.

- **Summary**: Oral POC STI tests with performance comparable to blood-based POC tests are available for self-testing. POC tests can expand screening, improve syndromic management, and reduce loss to follow-up. POC STI tests have the potential to facilitate prompt treatment and partner services. They create opportunities for new social and financial models of community-based testing services. Increasing equity and access to testing will present challenges in linkage to care, quality assurance, partner services, and surveillance. These developments warrant research to understand appropriate contexts for implementation.

### Syphilis [^112XFLft]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Incidence rates of syphilis have increased substantially around the world, mostly affecting men who have sex with men and people infected with HIV. Have a high index of suspicion for syphilis in any sexually active patient with genital lesions or rashes. Primary syphilis classically presents as a single, painless, indurated genital ulcer (chancre), but this presentation is only 31% sensitive; lesions can be painful, multiple, and extra-genital. Diagnosis is usually based on serology, using a combination of treponemal and non-treponemal tests. Syphilis remains sensitive to benzathine penicillin G. Staging syphilis is important because it is the basis of management (treatment, expected treatment response, follow-up periods, and partner follow-up). Patients with syphilis should be screened for HIV, gonorrhoea, and chlamydia.

Caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum, syphilis is transmitted through direct (usually sexual) contact with infected mucosal lesions. Other bodily fluids are also infectious when patients are bacteraemic. With infectivity up to 10–30% per sexual contact or 60% per relationship, syphilis rates have risen 300% since 2000 in many Western countries. While most infections involve men who have sex with men, infections among people with opposite-sex partners also occur. In addition to increasing rates, syphilis can cause early complications such as irreversible loss of vision, so awareness of the infection is important for primary care clinicians.

### Genome-wide surveillance of genital herpes simplex virus type 1 from multiple anatomic sites over time [^111WQvTK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Participant and sample collection**: The participant had positive results of a type-specific HSV immunoblot assay. Swab specimens were collected every weekday for four weeks using a spatial grid of the female genital tract, as previously described. An aliquot of each swab specimen was used for column-based DNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis to detect HSV-1 genomes. The participant also experienced symptomatic genital HSV-1 recurrences before and after the swabbing study; specimens from associated lesions were collected for HSV-1 culture. This individual's virus is referred to hereafter as "v.29". The University of Washington Human Subjects Division approved the study, and the participant provided informed consent.

### Laboratory investigation: Sexually transmitted diseases [^1176Y6Jr]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are among the most common infectious diseases and pose a major public health concern globally. Unfortunately, these diseases are often asymptomatic and left untreated for extended periods, resulting in significant healthcare costs and increased morbidity rates. In recent years, advances in diagnostic testing have been tremendous, especially at the molecular level. This paper aims to examine traditional diagnostic techniques, such as microscopic examination and culture, used to identify STDs and compare them to newly introduced techniques. These new methods, including DNA amplification and hybridization, offer higher sensitivity and specificity, as well as shorter result reporting times.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^115FgtVo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

A second cohort consisted of serum specimens from persons with genital lesions that were PCR- or culture-positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2, followed by the UW Virology Research Clinic. These participants provided written informed consent, approved by the UW Institutional Review Board (IRB). We selected one serum specimen from each of 1,074 HIV-negative persons who tested positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 via PCR and/or culture. These cases were confirmed seropositive for the corresponding HSV type by WB. Samples were collected at least 6 months following a person's initial episode of genital herpes. Some individuals with HSV-2 positive genital lesions had antibodies for both HSV-2 and HSV-1 when tested with the WB. This resulted in 131 samples positive for HSV-1 only with both viral and WB testing, 566 samples positive for HSV-2 only with both viral and WB testing, and 320 samples positive for HSV-2 with viral testing and both HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies on WB. Virological data on shedding rates in genital herpes infections (measured as the percentage of swabs positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 by non-type-specific PCR over the total number of swabs) were also available from 315 of 1,017 persons in the Virology Research Clinic (VRC) cohort. Shedding rates are available in the Supplemental Data file.

### Screening for syphilis: Updated evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^1171hMYF]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Screening for syphilis infection is currently recommended for high-risk individuals, including those with previous syphilis infection, an infected sexual partner, HIV infection, or more than four sex partners in the preceding year.

- **Objective**: To update a 2004 systematic review of studies on syphilis screening effectiveness, test accuracy, and screening harms in nonpregnant adults and adolescents.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through October 2015, and Ovid MEDLINE (January 2004 to October 2015), with an updated search through March 2016.

- **Study selection**: English-language trials and observational studies of screening effectiveness, test accuracy, and screening harms in nonpregnant adults and adolescents were included.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: One investigator abstracted data, a second checked the data for accuracy, and two investigators independently assessed study quality using predefined criteria.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Transmission of disease, including HIV; complications of syphilis; diagnostic accuracy; and harms of screening.

- **Results**: No evidence was identified regarding the effectiveness of screening on clinical outcomes or the effectiveness of risk assessment instruments; the harms of screening; or the effectiveness of screening in average-risk, nonpregnant adolescents or adults or high-risk individuals other than men who have sex with men (MSM) or men who are HIV positive. Four non-US studies indicated higher rates of syphilis detection with screening every three months versus six or twelve months for each group.

### Assessment of best single sample for finding chlamydia in women with and without symptoms: a diagnostic test study [^114DvkNs]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

At least one symptom suggestive of a bacterial sexually transmitted infection was reported by 1,634 (42%) of the participants with complete paired results. Of these, 213 (13%) women were infected with chlamydia. The sensitivities of clinician-taken endocervical swabs and self-taken vulvovaginal swabs were 88% (187/213) and 97% (206/213), respectively (P = 0.0008).

There were 2,233 (58%) women who did not have symptoms suggestive of a bacterial sexually transmitted infection, 183 (8%) of whom were infected with chlamydia. The sensitivities of clinician-taken endocervical swabs and self-taken vulvovaginal swabs were 89% (163/183) and 97% (178/183), respectively (P = 0.0025).

There were 1,347 women (35%) who would have been suitable for an "asymptomatic screen" — that is, they did not have any symptoms suggestive of a bacterial sexually transmitted infection and did not require examination for any other reason (such as symptoms of genital skin pathology). Of these, 76 (5.6%) had chlamydia infection. The sensitivities of clinician-taken endocervical swabs and self-taken vulvovaginal swabs were 89% (68/76) and 95% (72/76), respectively (P = 0.27).

### Diagnosis and management of genital herpes: Key questions and review of the evidence for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^115NZFPM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Genital herpes, caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or type 2, is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI). Given that HSV is an incurable infection, there are important concerns about appropriate use of diagnostic tools, management of infection, prevention of transmission to sexual partners, and appropriate counseling. A panel of experts developed key questions for the management of genital herpes infection in preparation for updating the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) STI treatment guidelines. To address these questions, a systematic literature review was conducted, and tables of evidence, including articles that could alter guidance, were compiled. These data were instrumental in shaping the recommendations in the 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines.

### Screening recommendations for chlamydia and gonorrhea [^113Rnb2r]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Dermatologists diagnose and treat sexually transmitted infections with varying frequency and have an opportunity to monitor at-risk individuals for chlamydia and gonorrhea. What are the recommended screening guidelines for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men and women in the United States?

While the evidence for screening men for chlamydia and gonorrhea remains insufficient at this time, all sexually active females younger than 25 years and all older women at risk for infection should be screened for both chlamydia and gonorrhea.

### Screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infections: Updated evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^117UiPzo]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

The 2014 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement supported the effectiveness of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in asymptomatic, sexually active women aged 24 years or younger and in older women at increased risk for infection, although evidence for screening in men was insufficient.

The objective of this updated review is to assess screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infection in adults and adolescents, including those who are pregnant. Data were gathered from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Ovid MEDLINE for the period from January 1, 2014, through May 28, 2020, with surveillance extending to May 21, 2021.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials and observational studies evaluating the effectiveness of screening, accuracy of risk stratification and alternative screening methods, the accuracy of tests, and screening harms were selected.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: One investigator abstracted data, while a second investigator checked for accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed the quality of the studies.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The study examined complications of infection; infection transmission or acquisition; diagnostic accuracy of anatomical site-specific testing and collection methods; and screening harms.

Results from 27 studies (N = 179,515) indicated that chlamydia screening compared with no screening was significantly associated with a reduced risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in 2 of 4 trials. Additionally, there was a reduced risk of hospital-diagnosed PID (0.24% vs. 0.38%) with a relative risk of 0.6 (95% CI, 0.4–1.0). However, no significant association was found with clinic-diagnosed PID or epididymitis in the largest trial.

### Testing for human papillomaviruses in urine, blood, and oral specimens: an update for the laboratory [^11582aK9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Low credibility.

To improve equitable access to screening, women in many cervical cancer screening programs or projects are now given the option of providing a self-collected sample. Self-taken samples for HPV testing have a similar accuracy to that of clinician-collected samples for the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions when a validated PCR-based assay is used. In most self-sampling scenarios, women collect the self-sample by inserting a swab, brush, or more complicated collection device into the vagina to collect cervicovaginal secretions (containing exfoliated epithelial cells and debris of disintegrated cells) by turning or rubbing or through washing or lavage. However, urine as the least invasive self-collected sample has strong potential for use in self-sampling exercises for screening and epidemiological applications.

Our understanding regarding the use of urine as a valid specimen for testing for HPV has evolved substantially in the last decade. In the early days of investigation, major technical and interpretational challenges were identified, and suboptimal analytical and clinical sensitivity were observed, particularly when urine was compared with clinician-collected cervical samples. The mechanism through which HPV DNA "contaminated" urine was poorly understood and was a major limitation for advancing the field. An initial review on the performance of urine as a biospecimen for HPV testing demonstrated that the conflicting results obtained in early studies were largely a consequence of a lack.

### Identifying a consensus sample type to test for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis and human papillomavirus [^117HQSQo]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a global cause of acute illness. Early detection plays a crucial role in interrupting transmission and preventing complications. However, the accessibility of STI testing is hindered by the lack of an overall preferred sample type. Through a prospective study involving female sex workers (FSW), we compared the sensitivity of samples from different anatomical sites for detecting Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and human papillomavirus. Additionally, we documented the prevalence of each STI in this high-risk population.

- **Methods**: We selected 303 FSW and tested them for each STI using nucleic acid amplification testing on two vaginal and cervical swabs from different manufacturers, cervical smear, and first-void urine. The sensitivity of each sample type was compared for each infectious agent to identify a consensus sample type.

- **Results**: Vaginal swabs were superior to all other sample types, with an overall sensitivity of 86%. The sensitivity was the lowest for first-void urine, detecting only 63% of positive cases. The prevalence was 3.3% (10/299) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 9.0% (27/299) for Chlamydia trachomatis, 7.4% (22/298) for Trichomonas vaginalis, 10.8% (32/296) for Mycoplasma genitalium, and 55.6% (158/284) for human papillomavirus.

- **Conclusions**: When testing for STIs, vaginal swabs are the sample of choice, and first-void urine should be avoided. Designating (self-sampled) vaginal swabs as a consensus sample type enables harmonization of STI testing.

### Self-collection of samples as an additional approach to deliver testing services for sexually transmitted infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1159CjLA]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Self-collection of samples for diagnostic testing offers the advantages of patient autonomy, confidentiality, and convenience. Despite data showing their feasibility and accuracy, there is a need to better understand how to implement such interventions for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To support WHO guidelines on self-care interventions, we conducted a systematic review to investigate whether self-collection of samples should be made available as an additional approach to deliver STI testing services.

- **Methods**: Peer-reviewed studies were included if they compared individuals who self-collected samples for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and/or trichomonas testing to individuals who had samples collected by clinicians on the following outcomes: uptake/frequency of STI testing, social harms/adverse events, positive yield (case finding), linkage to clinical assessment/treatment, and reported sexual risk behaviour. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS, and EMBASE for articles published through July 2018. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and the Evidence Project tool for non-RCTs. Meta-analysis was conducted using random effects models to generate pooled estimates of relative risk (RR).

- **Results**: Eleven studies, including five RCTs and six observational studies with a total of 202,745 participants, met inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted in Australia, Denmark, and the United States. Meta-analysis found that programmes offering self-collection of samples increased overall uptake of STI testing services (RR: 2.9).
