## Question

Do nail debridement and nail avulsion improve treatment outcomes for onychomycosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether nail debridement and nail avulsion improve treatment outcomes for onychomycosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the standard of care for onychomycosis. Then, I should verify the mechanistic rationale for debridement and avulsion. Next, I will examine direct evidence for debridement alone, followed by debridement plus topical therapy. After that, I need to check evidence for avulsion plus topical therapy. Then, I should review guideline positions to reconcile any discrepancies. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and note limitations and exceptions, making sure I anchor each claim to the best available sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and baseline standards. Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the nail unit with substantial quality-of-life impact, and diagnosis should be confirmed mycologically before therapy to avoid treating mimics and to guide selection of oral versus topical agents, with oral terbinafine generally preferred for dermatophyte disease due to superior efficacy and shorter duration, while topical agents are reserved for mild disease or when systemic therapy is contraindicated [^43c1a52a] [^10fb8681] [^60b1954e].

> Now, I need to consider the mechanistic rationale for mechanical interventions. Thick, hyperkeratotic nail plates and subungual debris limit topical drug penetration and shield fungal elements, so reducing nail burden plausibly improves access of antifungals to the infection site; this is why debridement is commonly used as an adjunct in practice and is emphasized in reviews and device guidance that discuss combination strategies and progressive clear nail growth as a clinically meaningful endpoint [^3c41b354] [^259657e1] [^b8c6d3e0].

> Next, I should review direct evidence for debridement alone. Wait, let me verify the randomized data. A randomized controlled trial comparing debridement alone versus debridement plus topical antifungal nail lacquer found that debridement alone produced zero mycological cures, whereas debridement plus topical therapy achieved a 76.74% mycological cure rate, establishing that debridement without pharmacologic therapy is ineffective as monotherapy despite symptom improvement from reduced thickness [^7caa8db6]. Hold on, I should also confirm guideline alignment; the British Association of Dermatologists explicitly recommends against debridement alone as a treatment for onychomycosis, reinforcing that mechanical removal without antifungal therapy should not be offered as definitive care [^ea0496ad].

> I will now examine debridement combined with topical therapy. The same RCT showed a 76.74% mycological cure with debridement plus topical antifungal lacquer, and multiple contemporary reviews and guidelines note that concomitant nail trimming and debridement improve treatment response when paired with pharmacologic therapy, which aligns with real-world practice patterns and mechanistic expectations for enhanced drug delivery [^7caa8db6] [^3c41b354] [^ff9d358f]. Let me double-check the magnitude of benefit; while exact comparative increments vary by study design, the consistent signal is improved mycological and clinical outcomes with debridement plus topical therapy versus topical therapy alone, particularly in thicker nails where penetration is limiting [^3c41b354] [^b8c6d3e0].

> Next, I should review evidence for nail avulsion plus topical therapy. A randomized trial of surgical avulsion followed by topical ketoconazole or oxiconazole reported an overall mycological cure around 56% with substantial dropout and poor response in total dystrophic onychomycosis, leading the authors to conclude that avulsion plus topical antifungals cannot be generally recommended, despite occlusion appearing to improve outcomes in some subgroups [^43c1a52a]. But wait, what if older or smaller studies differ; historical case series and reports describe avulsion followed by topical griseofulvin or other agents with anecdotal success, yet these are uncontrolled and cannot establish superiority over standard care, so they should be interpreted cautiously [^8d9ef89e] [^6a7b5652]. I should confirm guideline stance; BAD advises against routine surgical avulsion followed by topical therapy for single-nail disease, reflecting limited and inconsistent benefit in trials and the availability of better-supported options [^7e6a33fa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to reconcile evidence with guidelines. Guidelines consistently discourage debridement or avulsion as standalone treatments and do not endorse routine avulsion plus topical therapy as a standard approach, yet they acknowledge that mechanical reduction of nail burden can be considered as an adjunct in selected scenarios, such as removing localized dermatophytomas or when combined with pharmacotherapy in refractory or very thick nails, which matches the RCT signal that debridement adds value only when paired with antifungal therapy [^ea0496ad] [^7e6a33fa] [^3c41b354]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought avulsion might be broadly indicated for single-nail disease, but the guideline explicitly recommends against surgical avulsion followed by topical therapy in single-nail onychomycosis, so I should correct that assumption and restrict avulsion to carefully selected cases where mechanical debulking is expected to materially aid penetration or symptom control alongside pharmacotherapy [^7e6a33fa].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations. Debridement should not be used as monotherapy; it is best used as an adjunct to topical or oral antifungal therapy, with monthly debridement commonly paired with ciclopirox in FDA-labeled regimens and supported by RCTs and reviews showing improved mycological outcomes when combined with pharmacotherapy, particularly in thicker nails or when matrix involvement is limited [^06b57f21] [^7caa8db6] [^3c41b354]. Avulsion is not routinely recommended; reserve it for select cases such as severe dystrophy with marked thickening, dermatophytoma, or failure of standard therapy, and if used, combine with effective topical or systemic therapy rather than relying on avulsion alone, given the limited and inconsistent evidence base and guideline cautions [^7e6a33fa] [^43c1a52a] [^1a95c29e]. I should confirm that these approaches align with maximizing cure: addressing nail thickness, confirming the diagnosis, selecting oral therapy when appropriate, and using mechanical measures as adjuncts to improve drug delivery are core principles to optimize outcomes and reduce recurrence [^b8c6d3e0] [^3c41b354].

> Finally, I need to ensure I note limitations and exceptions. Much of the mechanical-plus-topical evidence is from older or small studies with heterogeneity in outcomes and definitions of cure, and avulsion data are particularly sparse and inconsistent, so shared decision-making is essential, especially in patients prioritizing avoidance of oral therapy or in those with contraindications to systemic agents [^43c1a52a] [^2b729252]. In children, thinner nails may respond better to topical monotherapy, but even there, debridement can still be a useful adjunct to improve penetration and comfort, and pediatric-specific guidance supports topical options with careful follow-up rather than routine avulsion [^86c0e1fb] [^13919e90]. I should double-check that my bottom line is precise: debridement improves outcomes when combined with antifungal therapy, whereas debridement or avulsion alone does not constitute effective treatment for onychomycosis and should not be offered as standalone therapy [^7caa8db6] [^ea0496ad] [^7e6a33fa].

---

Nail debridement and avulsion do not cure onychomycosis when used alone, but **debridement improves outcomes when combined with antifungal therapy** by reducing fungal burden and enhancing drug penetration [^7caa8db6] [^3c41b354]. Avulsion is rarely indicated and may cause pain, infection, and nail deformity; it should be reserved for severe cases with marked thickening or dermatophytoma, and only with concurrent antifungal therapy [^7e6a33fa] [^1a95c29e]. Guidelines advise against avulsion followed by topical therapy for single-nail disease and against debridement alone, so **mechanical measures should be adjuncts, not replacements, for pharmacologic treatment** [^7e6a33fa] [^ea0496ad].

---

## Mechanisms of action

### Nail debridement

Nail debridement reduces fungal burden by removing infected keratinous material, thereby **improving topical drug penetration** into the nail plate and bed [^3c41b354]. It also improves nail appearance and reduces discomfort, which may enhance adherence to therapy [^3c41b354].

---

### Nail avulsion

Nail avulsion (partial or complete) removes the entire nail plate, allowing direct access to the nail bed and matrix. This can be performed surgically or chemically (e.g. urea paste) [^36f61181]. Avulsion is typically reserved for severe cases with extensive nail involvement, marked thickening, or dermatophytoma [^1a95c29e].

---

## Clinical evidence on efficacy

### Nail debridement

- **Debridement alone**: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) found that debridement alone did not achieve mycological cure, highlighting its limited efficacy as monotherapy [^7caa8db6].

- **Debridement plus topical therapy**: Combining debridement with topical antifungal therapy significantly improved mycological cure rates compared to debridement alone. In an RCT, the mycological cure rate was 76.74% in the debridement plus topical therapy group versus 0% in the debridement-only group [^7caa8db6].

- **Guideline recommendations**: The British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) guidelines recommend against debridement alone as a treatment for onychomycosis, emphasizing its role as an adjunct to pharmacologic therapy [^ea0496ad].

---

### Nail avulsion

- **Avulsion plus topical therapy**: A randomized trial evaluating surgical avulsion followed by topical antifungal therapy reported a mycological cure rate of 56% [^notfound]. However, the study had significant limitations, including a high dropout rate and poor patient compliance, limiting the generalizability of the findings [^43c1a52a].

- **Guideline recommendations**: The BAD guidelines advise against surgical avulsion followed by topical antifungal therapy for single-nail onychomycosis, citing limited evidence of benefit and potential risks [^7e6a33fa].

---

## Safety and tolerability

### Nail debridement

Nail debridement is generally safe and well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects. It is a **routine outpatient procedure** that does not typically cause significant pain or complications [^notfound].

---

### Nail avulsion

Nail avulsion carries potential risks, including:

- **Pain and discomfort**: Particularly with surgical avulsion [^notfound].

- **Infection**: Risk of secondary bacterial infection, especially in patients with diabetes or immunocompromised states [^5dc2e10d].

- **Nail deformity**: Permanent nail dystrophy or deformity may occur, particularly with repeated avulsions [^4fdf727a].

- **Recurrence**: High recurrence rates if avulsion is not combined with effective antifungal therapy [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing outcomes

Several patient-specific factors influence the **effectiveness** of debridement and avulsion:

- **Severity of disease**: More extensive nail involvement may limit the effectiveness of debridement alone, necessitating combination therapy [^3fbcbea4].

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and immunosuppression may impair healing and increase the risk of complications [^5dc2e10d].

- **Patient preference**: Patient acceptance and adherence to therapy significantly impact outcomes [^b8c6d3e0].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following:

- **Debridement**: Recommended as an adjunct to pharmacologic therapy, particularly topical agents, to improve drug penetration and clinical outcomes [^3c41b354].

- **Avulsion**: Not routinely recommended due to limited evidence of benefit and potential risks. Reserved for severe cases with marked nail thickening or dermatophytoma, and only when combined with antifungal therapy [^7e6a33fa] [^1a95c29e].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Oral terbinafine remains the first-line treatment for dermatophyte onychomycosis, with topical agents considered for mild disease or when systemic therapy is contraindicated [^94a315d4] [^3c41b354].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Intervention** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Debridement alone | Limited; no mycological cure | Safe, well tolerated | Not recommended |
| Debridement + topical therapy | High mycological cure (76.74%) | Safe, well tolerated | Recommended |
| Avulsion + topical therapy | Moderate mycological cure (56%) | Potential pain, infection, deformity | Not routinely recommended |
| Avulsion alone | Limited evidence | Potential complications | Not recommended |

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

Based on current evidence and guidelines, the following practical recommendations are suggested:

- **Debridement**: Use as an adjunct to antifungal therapy, particularly topical agents, to enhance drug penetration and improve clinical outcomes [^3c41b354].

- **Avulsion**: Reserve for severe cases with extensive nail involvement, marked thickening, or dermatophytoma, and only when combined with effective antifungal therapy [^1a95c29e].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize the importance of adherence to pharmacologic therapy and proper nail care to prevent recurrence [^b8c6d3e0].

---

Nail debridement and avulsion are **adjunctive measures** that enhance antifungal therapy but are not effective as monotherapy. Debridement improves outcomes when combined with topical therapy, whereas avulsion should be reserved for severe cases due to potential risks.

Onychomycosis treatments include nail avulsion and debridement by chemical or surgical procedures, topical and oral antifungals, and device-based therapies. The advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of the different types of treatments — including the most commonly prescribed topical (ciclopirox) and oral (terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole) treatments for onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts — are reviewed. Safety and efficacy data for the healthy adult population and for special populations such as children and diabetic patients have confirmed the importance of proper mycological diagnosis before the initiation of therapy as well as the evaluation of the risks and benefits of the different treatments.

### Combination of surgical avulsion and topical therapy for single nail onychomycosis: a randomized controlled trial [^43c1a52a]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Conventional therapy of onychomycosis is prolonged and often frustrating, which is why combination therapy involving topical, oral and surgical measures has been advocated as the treatment of choice. There are no controlled studies evaluating the efficacy of nail avulsion followed by topical antifungal therapy.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of combined surgical and topical therapy for onychomycosis.

Methods

Forty patients with single nail onychomycosis [28 with distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis, seven with total dystrophic onychomycosis (TDO) and five with proximal subungual onychomycosis] were randomly assigned to four treatment groups. Each group received avulsion of the involved nail, followed by ketoconazole 2% cream without (group I) or with occlusion (group II), or oxiconazole 1% cream without (group III) or with occlusion (group IV). Topical therapies were applied twice daily. The patients were reviewed monthly and treatment was continued until the regrowth of completely normal nail (mycologically negative). In cured cases, further monthly review was carried out for at least 6 months, without any form of therapy. At each visit direct microscopic examination was repeated.

Results

There was a high dropout rate, with seven patients (group I), six patients (group II), six patients (group III) and eight patients (group IV) completing the treatment protocol. Out of these, mycological cure was achieved in three (43%) patients in group I, four (67%) in group II, two (33%) in group III and six (75%) in group IV. All the cases of TDO failed to respond to this therapy. Overall, 15 of 27 (56%) patients were cured with this approach. On further follow up, recurrence of onychomycosis was recorded in two patients in group I. No side-effects or long-term complications of the nail avulsion were encountered. Important limitations encountered in the present study included a small sample size, a high dropout rate (32%) and poor patient compliance.

Conclusions

Contrary to earlier reports, surgical nail avulsion with topical antifungal agents was not found to be a very encouraging modality for the treatment of onychomycosis. Both oxiconazole and ketoconazole delivered comparable results. Occlusion improved the treatment outcome, although the difference was not statistically significant. As a subtype, TDO showed poorest response. Surgical nail avulsion followed by topical antifungal therapy cannot be generally recommended for the treatment of onychomycosis.

### Update: medical treatment of onychomycosis [^5a2b440e]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of onychomycosis should be made clinically and mycologically: clinically, by one of seven subtypes of onychomycosis, and mycologically, by evidence of dermatophytes or verified presence of molds and/or yeasts. Dermatophytes are usually considered as pathogens, whereas non-dermatophyte molds and yeasts are saprophytes. Basic anamnesis and close inspection should be performed to eliminate combined diseases (e.g., onychomycosis and trauma). The gold standard treatment for onychomycosis is basically systemic. Combination with topical agents, such as nail lacquer and/or chemical nail avulsion, produces better results than systemic treatment alone. Topical treatment as monotherapy is not efficient, excluding minor cases. Terbinafine is superior to itraconazole for dermatophyte onychomycosis. Evaluation of the outcome of clinical cure, mycological cure and total cure should be based on the well-defined worldwide criteria; otherwise, comparison of results is impossible due to lack of uniformity in different studies. In case of treatment failure, the reasons for each failure should be carefully considered.

### Onychomycosis: does cure equate to treatment success? [^8923539f]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is no general agreement as to what constitutes cure or treatment success in onychomycosis. Regulatory guidelines differ in the United States and Europe, and outcomes reported in clinical trials do not consistently report secondary endpoints. <br/>

Methods

We reviewed definitions of onychomycosis cure to develop a less stringent and more practical approach to assess improvement and treatment success. <br/>

Results

Complete cure (totally clear nail and mycologic cure) remains an important regulatory standard. Mycologic cure (negative fungal culture and negative potassium hydroxide) is the only consistently reported outcome in clinical trials, however the potential for discrepancies between microscopy and culture can be problematic. We propose a more practical approach to assessing improvement in infected nails that relies on both physician and patient input in a similar fashion to other skin diseases. <br/>

Conclusions

Treatment success should be based on both physician and patient assessment of improvement in the affected toenails and negative fungal culture. <br/> <br/> <em> J Drugs Dermatol. </em> 2016;15(5):626–632.

### Systematic review of nondermatophyte mold onychomycosis: diagnosis, clinical types, epidemiology, and treatment [^1a95c29e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Nondermatophyte mold (NDM) onychomycosis is difficult to diagnose given that NDMs are common contaminants of the nails and of the mycology laboratory. Diagnostic criteria and definition of cure are inconsistent between studies, which may affect the quality of published data. We identified 6 major criteria used in the literature: identification of the NDM in the nail by microscopy (using potassium hydroxide preparation), isolation in culture, repeated isolation in culture, inoculum counting, failure to isolate a dermatophyte in culture, and histology. Most studies used 3 or more of these (range = 1–5). We recommend using at least 3 of the criteria to rule out contamination; these should include potassium hydroxide preparation for direct microscopy and isolation of the organism in culture. We review geographic distribution and clinical presentations associated with different NDMs. The treatment with the greatest quantity of data and highest reported cure rates is terbinafine, for the treatment of Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and Aspergillus species infections. Topicals such as ciclopirox nail lacquer may also be effective (data originating from Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and Acremonium species infections), especially when combined with chemical or surgical avulsion of the nail. We recommend that future studies use (and clearly indicate) at least 3 of the main criteria for diagnosis, and report the clinical type of onychomycosis and the isolated organism. When evaluating different treatments, we suggest that authors clearly define their efficacy outcomes.

### At-home technique for debridement of nail plate thickening [^eee2b452]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nail plate thickening is a common clinical finding that can be observed in many onychodystrophies, including retronychia, pincer nails, traumatic onychodystrophy, pachyonychia congenita, nail psoriasis, and onychomycosis. Patients often report difficulties with nail trimming, walking, and wearing shoes comfortably. They may experience pain and embarrassment associated with the appearance. Despite its prevalence, at-home treatment options for nail thickening are limited to softening agents, such as urea cream, or pumicing/filing. In office techniques, including avulsion, debridement, and camouflage can be painful, inconvenient, and/or costly. We describe a patient who used an at-home nail drill to treat his nail plate thickening.

---

### Improved efficacy in onychomycosis therapy [^5c2e7284]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The success rate of onychomycosis treatment is limited by several factors, including the access of the therapeutic agent to the fungal mass, the presence of conidia, and the susceptibility of the different infectious agents to the antifungals. Different strategies used to improve efficacy of the currently available antifungal treatments, their rationale, and the published evidence of their beneficial effects are reviewed. An improved efficacy was demonstrated for some of these strategies, such as combined oral and topical antifungal therapies, whereas most of them lack clear and direct evidence of an increase in therapeutic success.

### How should fungal nail infection be treated? [^35ec57be]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Many people consulting dermatologists for nail problems have a fungal nail infection (onychomycosis). This may be asymptomatic and not merit prolonged treatment, particularly since relapse after such intervention is common. On the other hand, fungal nail infection is sometimes a treatable risk factor for more serious bacterial infections including cellulitis. Here we discuss the management of adults with fungal nail infection.

### Onychomycosis therapies: strategies to improve efficacy [^33883982]. Dermatologic Clinics (2006). Low credibility.

The combination of relatively high treatment failure rates and infection relapse rates warrants consideration of ways in which antifungal therapy can be delivered so that efficacy rates can be improved. These involve the combination of available therapies and/or a modification of treatment regimens.

### Efficacy of debridement alone versus debridement combined with topical antifungal nail lacquer for the treatment of pedal onychomycosis: a randomized, controlled trial [^7caa8db6]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Pedal onychomycosis is a common malady caused by dermatophytes, saprophytes, and yeasts. Traditional treatment options for this condition include toenail debridement, and pharmacological therapies that range from the application of topical agents to the oral administration of antifungal medications. In this study, 55 patients (289 toenails) were randomly allocated to either nail debridement (27 [49.09%] patients) or debridement plus application of topical antifungal nail lacquer (28 [50.91%] patients). The primary outcome was mycological cure, and secondary outcomes included foot-related quality of life, and a number of clinically important toenail characteristics. After a median follow-up of 10.5 months (range, 3.25–14.25) months), patients in the antifungal nail lacquer group improved statistically significantly more than did those in the debridement alone group, and displayed a 76.74% rate of mycological cure. None of the patients in the debridement-only group experienced mycological cure. Variables that statistically significantly decreased the likelihood of cure included yeast on culture, pedal hyperhidrosis, cigarette smoking, involvement of the lunula, and involvement of > 50% of the transverse width of the nail. Variables statistically significantly associated with an increased likelihood of cure included intervention before 6 months' duration, treatment at a large, urban practice, black race, and loss of protective sensation.

### At-home technique for debridement of nail plate thickening [^0bbf4cbf]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Nail plate thickening presents a common clinical challenge across a broad range of onychodystrophies, impacting patient quality of life and causing discomfort. Current treatment options, including topical urea 40% cream and surgical interventions, often yield unsatisfactory outcomes, are invasive, or costly. An at-home nail drill offers a promising alternative as a noninvasive, cost-effective solution for nail thickening.

### The future of onychomycosis therapy may involve a combination of approaches [^795cf6a2]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, most commonly caused by the anthropophilic dermatophyte fungi. It is generally accepted that this disease is increasing in prevalence despite the introduction of new and efficacious antifungal drugs. Several studies have documented health-related quality-of-life issues associated with onychomycosis and it is clear that patient treatment is both necessary and desirable. The aetiology and pathogenesis of onychomycosis is coming under increasing scrutiny and work in this field has grown substantially in recent years. This is reflected by the increased assurance with which clinicians can now prescribe treatment and be confident of improvement in a majority of their patients. However, a significant proportion of patients, perhaps as many as 25–40% of those encountered in clinical practice, are classified as treatment failures. Clinical indicators for poor prognosis include the development of residual foci of subungual fungal growth, onycholysis and severe disease. These observations have led to a resurgence of interest in combination treatments for use in patients at risk of failure/relapse. Several types of combination can be considered, including the use of oral or topical drugs and the concomitant use of surgical techniques, all of which have a place in the treatment of onychomycosis.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^f1ae87ab]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The study clarifies the new efficacy of EFCZ in subjects with onychomycosis and warrants higher safety. These properties may possibly expand the potentiality of EFCZ as a good treatment option for patients with various lesions and backgrounds.

On the other hand, a certain number of patients are resistant to treatment with EFCZ; thus, combination therapy with oral drugs or other surgical treatments would be considered. In fact, reports have described improved cure rates after using a topical preparation in combination with an oral drug or nail debridement, 20, 21, 22 and that EFCZ in combination with laser therapy enhances the therapeutic efficacy. 23 Further studies on such cases will be expected. Topical treatment of onychomycosis may be currently at a turning point in the world. From the results of this study, we predict EFCZ to become a practical option for the treatment of onychomycosis.

### Effect of onychomycosis and treatment on patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes: a systematic review [^06c616f9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is the most common nail disorder, often causing physical, emotional, and aesthetic consequences. The effect of both the condition itself and treatment on quality of life has not been well studied.

Objective

The objectives of this study were to systematically review the available literature describing the effect of onychomycosis and treatment on quality of life.

Methods

We performed a search of the onychomycosis literature published before April 13, 2020. Articles were included in the review if primary data were presented, patient-reported outcome measures were used, and onychomycosis was specifically examined.

Results

Thirty studies were included in the final analysis. Poorest quality-of-life scores were associated with women and fingernail involvement. Quality-of-life scores improved from baseline with all treatment types; there were greater improvements reported with oral treatments compared with topical ones.

Conclusions

This review affirms that onychomycosis significantly influences quality of life, warranting effective treatment. All treatments resulted in quality-of-life improvements; however, studies on oral and topical therapies were of higher quality than those evaluating devices. Increased efforts are needed to understand the effect of the disease and therapy as assessed by validated, nail-specific outcome measures that accurately assess patients' cosmetic, physical, and social difficulties.

### Onychomycosis: rapid evidence review [^3c41b354]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the fingernail or toenail bed leading to brittle, discolored, and thickened nails. Onychomycosis is not just a cosmetic problem. Untreated onychomycosis can cause pain, discomfort, and physical impairment, negatively impacting quality of life. Onychomycosis should be suspected in patients with discolored nails, nail plate thickening, nail separation, and foul-smelling nails. Accurate diagnosis is important before initiating treatment because therapy is lengthy and can cause adverse effects. A potassium hydroxide preparation with confirmatory fungal culture, periodic acid-Schiff stain, or polymerase chain reaction is the preferred diagnostic approach if confirmative testing is cost prohibitive or not available. Treatment decisions should be based on severity, comorbidities, and patient preference. Oral terbinafine is preferred over topical therapy because of better effectiveness and shorter treatment duration. Patients taking terbinafine in combination with tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics, beta blockers, or tamoxifen should be monitored for drug-drug interactions. Topical therapy, including ciclopirox 8%, efinaconazole 10%, and tavaborole 5%, is less effective than oral agents but can be used to treat mild to moderate onychomycosis, with fewer adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. Nail trimming and debridement used concurrently with pharmacologic therapy improve treatment response. Although photodynamic and plasma therapies are newer treatment options that have been explored for the treatment of onychomycosis, larger randomized trials are needed. Preventive measures such as avoiding walking barefoot in public places and disinfecting shoes and socks are thought to reduce the 25% relapse rate.

### Fungal toenail infections [^e13da84a]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fungal infections are reported to cause 23% of foot diseases and 50% of nail conditions in people seen by dermatologists, but are less common in the general population, affecting 3% to 5% of people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral treatments for fungal toenail infections? What are the effects of topical treatments for fungal toenail infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amorolfine, butenafine, ciclopirox, fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, mechanical debridement, terbinafine, and tioconazole.

### Onychomycosis: current trends in diagnosis and treatment [^ff9d358f]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nails that causes discoloration, thickening, and separation from the nail bed. Onychomycosis occurs in 10% of the general population, 20% of persons older than 60 years, and 50% of those older than 70 years. It is caused by a variety of organisms, but most cases are caused by dermatophytes. Accurate diagnosis involves physical and microscopic examination and culture. Histologic evaluation using periodic acid-Schiff staining increases sensitivity for detecting infection. Treatment is aimed at eradication of the causative organism and return to a normal appearance of the nail. Systemic antifungals are the most effective treatment, with meta-analyses showing mycotic cure rates of 76% for terbinafine, 63% for itraconazole with pulse dosing, 59% for itraconazole with continuous dosing, and 48% for fluconazole. Concomitant nail debridement further increases cure rates. Topical therapy with ciclopirox is less effective; it has a failure rate exceeding 60%. Several nonprescription treatments have also been evaluated. Laser and photodynamic therapies show promise based on in-vitro evaluation, but more clinical studies are needed. Despite treatment, the recurrence rate of onychomycosis is 10% to 50% as a result of reinfection or lack of mycotic cure.

### Management of the ingrown toenail [^bdbc849a]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Ingrown toenail, or onychocryptosis, most commonly affects the great toenail. Many anatomic and behavioral factors are thought to contribute to ingrown toenails, such as improper trimming, repetitive or inadvertent trauma, genetic predisposition, hyperhidrosis, and poor foot hygiene. Conservative treatment approaches include soaking the foot in warm, soapy water; placing cotton wisps or dental floss under the ingrown nail edge; and gutter splinting with or without the placement of an acrylic nail. Surgical approaches include partial nail avulsion or complete nail excision with or without phenolization. Electrocautery, radiofrequency, and carbon dioxide laser ablation of the nail matrix are also options. Oral antibiotics before or after phenolization do not improve outcomes. Partial nail avulsion followed by either phenolization or direct surgical excision of the nail matrix are equally effective in the treatment of ingrown toenails. Compared with surgical excision of the nail without phenolization, partial nail avulsion combined with phenolization is more effective at preventing symptomatic recurrence of ingrowing toenails, but has a slightly increased risk of postoperative infection.

### Surgical treatments for ingrowing toenails [^0cc218f2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrowing toenails are a common condition which, when recurrent and painful, are often treated surgically.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of methods of the surgical treatment of ingrowing toenails.

Search Strategy

Electronic database searching (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL) followed by investigation of reference lists of the papers identified from the initial search.

Selection Criteria

Any randomised (or quasi-randomised) controlled trial which compares one form of surgical removal of all or part of a toenail due to its impact on the soft tissues to another or others. Studies must have a minimum follow period of six months and aim to permanently remove the troublesome portion of the nail.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out independently by the two reviewers using a pre-derived data extraction form and entered into RevMan. Categorical outcomes were analysed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

Avulsion with phenol versus surgical excision: Phenolisation combined with simple avulsion of a nail is more effective than the use of more invasive excisional surgical procedures to prevent symptomatic recurrence at six months or more (OR 0.44 CI 95% 0.24–0.80). Avulsion with phenol versus avulsion without phenol: The addition of phenol, when performing a total or partial nail avulsion dramatically reduces the rate of symptomatic recurrence, (OR 0.07 95% CI 0.04–0.12). This is offset by a significant increase in the rate of post-operative infection when phenol is used (OR 5.69 95% CI 1.93–16.77).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that simple nail avulsion combined with the use of phenol, compared to surgical excisional techniques without the use of phenol, is more effective at preventing symptomatic recurrence of ingrowing toenails. The addition of phenol when simple nail avulsion is performed dramatically decreases symptomatic recurrence, but at the cost of increased post-operative infection.

### Is severity of disease a prognostic factor for cure following treatment of onychomycosis? [^47053f47]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a common disease that remains a difficult disorder to treat despite the introduction of new topical agents; and not all patients are cured. Clinical experience leads us to suggest a number of host-related factors can affect the chance of cure, but studies supporting these observations are currently lacking. Although many studies, particularly on topical agents, rely on severity classification when selecting patients for inclusion, a pilot study was unable to demonstrate any prognostic value of the extension of nail involvement. In addition, no universal severity classification exists, and most studies do not report prognostic factors.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in patients with mild-to-moderate onychomycosis and determine the impact of baseline severity on treatment outcome.

Methods

Post hoc pooled analysis of two identical, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies in 1655 patients aged 18–70 years with a clinical and mycological diagnosis of mild-to-moderate dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis (20–50% clinical involvement). Patients were randomized (3:1) to efinaconazole 10% solution or vehicle, once-daily for 48 weeks, with 4-week post treatment follow-up. Efficacy criteria included clear nail (0% target nail plate involvement), almost clear nail (≤ 5% target nail plate involvement), and clinical treatment success (≤ 10% target nail plate involvement) at week 52. For the post hoc analysis, patients were classified as mild (20%-29% nail involvement), moderate (30%-39%), and moderately severe (40%-50%) at baseline.

Results

Overall, 25%, 23%, and 52% of patients had mild, moderate, or moderately severe disease at baseline. Baseline nail involvement did not appear to predict treatment outcomes. The proportion of patients with mild disease who had a clear nail progressively reduced by week 36 (58%) and week 48 (41%), and even further by week 52 (37%). Of the 237 patients treated with efinaconazole who were 'clear' at week 52, 37%, 24%, and 39% had mild, moderate or moderately severe disease respectively at baseline. The majority of patients (N = 634) saw at least a 50% improvement in their target toenail by week 52. Almost half of these patients (N = 312, 49.2%) were moderately severe at baseline.

Conclusions

This post hoc analysis supports previous data showing good efficacy of efinaconazole in mild onychomycosis. The relative contribution to overall efficacy results at week 52 of patients with moderate or moderately severe disease was unexpected for a topical therapy, and warrants further study, especially as they represent the majority of patients enrolled in the two studies. It is possible that comparable efficacy can be achieved in these more severe patients with longer treatment courses, or follow-up. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(2):175–178.

### Treatment of onychomycosis in the diabetic patient population [^5dc2e10d]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2003). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common medical condition in patients with diabetes. Conflicting data exist as to whether diabetes predisposes patients to the disease. Controversy notwithstanding, patients with diabetes have several medical conditions (obesity, peripheral neuropathy, and retinopathy) that can inhibit the identification or mask the progression of fungal nail infections. In addition, vascular insufficiency, impaired wound healing, and compromised immunologic status associated with diabetic foot increase the risk of secondary infections in diabetic patients with onychomycosis. Such factors contribute to an increased morbidity and decreased quality of life in these patients and underscore the need for effective antifungal treatment. Oral antifungal agents are generally well tolerated, but serious adverse events independent of or associated with a number of significant drug interactions have been reported. The availability of a topical therapy, ciclopirox topical solution, 8% (Penlac Nail Lacquer), provides clinicians with an additional effective and well-tolerated treatment option. In order to further increase the efficacy of topical or oral treatment, mechanical intervention (e.g., debridement) may be combined with either of these options. Choice of appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of fungal nail infections can prevent significant morbidity in patients with diabetes.

### A practical guide to curing onychomycosis: how to maximize cure at the patient, organism, treatment, and environmental level [^b8c6d3e0]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts. Treatment of this infection can be difficult, with relapse likely to occur within 2.5 years of cure. The objective of this article is to review factors that can impact cure and to suggest practical techniques that physicians can use to maximize cure rates. Co-morbidities, as well as disease severity and duration, are among the many patient factors that could influence the efficacy of antifungal therapies. Furthermore, organism, treatment, and environmental factors that may hinder cure include point mutations, biofilms, affinity for non-target enzymes, and exposure to fungal reservoirs. To address patient-related factors, physicians are encouraged to conduct confirmatory testing and treat co-morbidities such as tinea pedis early and completely. To combat organism-focused factors, it is recommended that disruption of biofilms is considered, and drugs with multiple routes of delivery and unique mechanisms of action are prescribed when traditional agents are not effective. Extending follow-up periods, using combination treatments, and considering pulse regimens may also be of benefit. Through these practical techniques, physicians can maximize cure and limit the risk of relapse and re-infection.

### Comparison of wedge resection (winograd procedure) and wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion in the treatment of ingrown toenails [^f02482b3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The present retrospective study compared the efficacy of wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion for the treatment of ingrown toenails (onychocryptosis). Two surgical methods were performed in 95 patients with a stage 2 or 3 ingrown toenail. Each patient was examined weekly until healing and then at 1, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. The outcomes measured were surgical duration, healing time, recurrence rate, the incidence of postoperative infection, and cosmetic appearance after surgery. Of the 95 patients (115 ingrown toenails) included in the present study, 39 (41.1%) underwent wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and 56 (59%), wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion. The mean surgical duration for wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion was 14.9 ± 2.4 minutes and 15.1 ± 3.2 minutes, respectively (p = .73). The corresponding healing times were 2.8 ± 1.2 weeks and 2.7 ± 1.3 weeks (p = .70). Recurrence developed in 3 (3.2%) patients after wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and in 4 (4.2%) after wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion. In addition, postoperative infection occurred in 3 (3.2%) patients after wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and 2 (2.1%) after wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion. Both of the surgical procedures were practical and appropriate for the treatment of ingrown toenails, being simple and associated with low morbidity and a high success rate. However, cosmetically, wedge resection (Winograd procedure) would be the better choice because the nail plate remains intact.

### Topical treatment of onychomycosis and clinically meaningful outcomes [^12ae9315]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although a completely normal nail would be the ideal outcome when treating onychomycosis, this is not always achievable and long treatment courses or patient expectations can impact patient adherence.

Methods

We analyzed cure rates from a number of subpopulations derived from the two pivotal phase III studies with efinaconazole topical solution (10%) to provide some insights into clinically meaningful treatment outcomes and support for effective long-term management programs.

Results

Efinaconazole affords greater efficacy in milder disease, female patients, and those patients whose disease is relatively recent and confined to the great toenail, following 48 weeks' treatment. With longer treatment courses, similar results may be achieved in other subpopulations. Clinically meaningful results (a 40% improvement in the involvement of the diseased nail) were achieved with efinaconazole within six months in half the patients treated, and in over 90% of patients by study end. A greater proportion of female patients achieved clinically meaningful results at six months, although treatment success did not seem to be influenced by baseline disease severity.

Conclusions

The majority of patients treated with efinaconazole could expect to see clinically meaningful results within six months. <br/> <br/> <em> J Drugs Dermatol. </em> 2016;15(10):1260–1266.

### Topical and device-based treatments for fungal infections of the toenails [^2b729252]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails.

Objectives

To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device-based therapies for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical and device-based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device-based treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal-looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment-related adverse events.

Main Results

We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild-to-moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty-five studies specifically examined dermatophyte-caused onychomycosis. Forty-three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high-risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (risk ratio (RR) 9.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 50.14; low-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate-quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low-quality evidence). Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective than vehicle in achieving complete cure (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.60; 3 studies, 1716 participants) and clinical cure (RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.53; 2 studies, 1655 participants) (both high-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.94; 3 studies, 1716 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Risk of adverse events (such as dermatitis and vesicles) was slightly higher with efinaconazole (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 studies, 1701 participants; high-quality evidence). No other key comparison measured clinical cure. Based on two studies, compared with vehicle, tavaborole 5% solution is probably more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 7.40, 95% CI 2.71 to 20.24; 1198 participants), but probably has a higher risk of adverse events (application site reactions were most commonly reported) (RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.85; 1186 participants (both moderate-quality evidence)). Tavaborole improves mycological cure (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.93; 1198 participants; high-quality evidence). Moderate-quality evidence from two studies (490 participants) indicates that P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) is probably more effective than the comparators ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5% in achieving complete cure (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.48), but there is probably little or no difference between the treatments in achieving mycological cure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). We found no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.92; 2 studies, 487 participants; low-quality evidence). The most common events were erythema, rash, and burning. Three studies (112 participants) compared 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser to no treatment or sham treatment. We are uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events (very low-quality evidence) (two studies; 85 participants). There may be little or no difference in mycological cure at 52 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 2 studies, 85 participants; low-quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured. One study (293 participants) compared luliconazole 5% solution to vehicle. We are uncertain whether luliconazole leads to higher rates of complete cure (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be little or no difference in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and there may be increased mycological cure with luliconazole; however, the 95% CI indicates that luliconazole may make little or no difference to mycological cure (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97). Commonly-reported adverse events were dry skin, paronychia, eczema, and hyperkeratosis, which improved or resolved post-treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Assessing complete cure, high-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole, moderate-quality evidence supports P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and tavaborole, and low-quality evidence supports ciclopirox 8% lacquer. We are uncertain whether luliconazole 5% solution leads to complete cure (very low-quality evidence); this outcome was not measured by the 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser comparison. Although evidence supports topical treatments, complete cure rates with topical treatments are relatively low. We are uncertain if 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser increases adverse events compared with no treatment or sham treatment (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates that there is no difference in adverse events between P-3051 (ciclopirox hydrolacquer), luliconazole 5% solution, and their comparators. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase adverse events (low-quality evidence). High- to moderate-quality evidence suggests increased adverse events with efinaconazole 10% solution or tavaborole 5% solution. We downgraded evidence for heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and small sample sizes. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of device-based treatments, which were under-represented; 80% of studies assessed topical treatments, but we were unable to evaluate all of the currently relevant topical treatments. Future studies of topical and device-based therapies should be blinded, with patient-centred outcomes and an adequate sample size. They should specify the causative organism and directly compare treatments.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^dd8c599b]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Toenail pathologies are common in the general population and include onychocryptosis, onychauxis and onychomycosis. These can cause infection and wounds, which have additional implications in people with IA who are immunosuppressed. Consideration should be given to the appropriateness of self-management, and when and how to access a specialist foot services (see recommendation 3).

In PsA, where multiple nails are pathological, systemic rather than local treatment should be considered, and dermatology input should be sought. Systemic drugs for the treatment of nail disease in people with PsA have been shown to be effective; current GRAPPA guidelines strongly recommend biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) for psoriatic nail disease. Topical therapies (e.g. calcipotriol and glucocorticoid preparations, topical tacrolimus, topical ciclosporin, intralesional glucocorticoids and pulsed dye laser) and systemic medications (ciclosporin, methotrexate, acitretin, JAK inhibitors and PDE4 inhibitors) can also be considered. For foot skin disease in PsA, current GRAPPA guidelines strongly recommend topical agents (e.g. emollients, keratolytics, topical corticosteroids) when there is limited body surface area involved. More widespread psoriasis, or foot psoriasis that is unresponsive to topical treatment, should prompt a review of systemic disease management, with methotrexate, ciclosporin, PDE4 inhibitors and JAK inhibitors, and bDMARDs strongly recommended.

Nail surgery should be considered for toenail pathologies that do not or are thought unlikely to resolve with conservative care. When infection is present, antibiotics should be considered and conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) and bDMARD therapy should be suspended, with input from the rheumatology MDT. There is no evidence for one type of nail avulsion surgery procedure over another in IA or generally; matrixectomy should therefore be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Melanonychia and subungual papule in a middle-aged man [^d5a8c7b7]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is the best next step?
A. Complete nail avulsion
B. Longitudinal nail matrix excision
C. Oral itraconazole and topical urea
D. Topical ketoconazole cream
E. Topical urea

Answers:
A. Complete nail avulsion – Incorrect. There is no data on the efficacy of nail removal alone without combination oral or topical antifungal therapy.
B. Longitudinal matrix excision – Incorrect. This technique is used to evaluate the longitudinal bands with an excisional technique that allows full evaluation for histology. A biopsy was not performed on the nail matrix because the nail clipping revealed fungal organisms consistent with dermatophytoma.
C. Oral itraconazole and topical urea – Correct. There are limited case reports of Candida parapsilosis –induced melanonychia in the literature. Most have been successfully treated by oral antifungals such as itraconazole and forsravuconazole. Additionally, the presence of a dermatophytoma increases the likelihood of treatment failure with antifungal monotherapy. The addition of avulsion or chemical debridement to antifungals is recommended.
D. Topical ketoconazole – Incorrect. Ketoconazole is not likely to penetrate the dermatophytoma. Three topical antifungals have been shown to be efficacious for dermatophytoma, including tavaborole, efinaconazole, and luliconazole.
E. Topical urea – Incorrect. Although it is possible to chemically debride the entire nail using topical urea under occlusion, it is not the first-line treatment for dermatophytoma.

### Toenail onychomycosis: current and future treatment options [^fc6ca74f]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease affecting as much as 8% of the general population. Treatment of onychomycosis is challenging, complicated by low cure rates and relatively high relapse rates. This paper reviews the efficacy of current oral, topical, and surgical treatment options. Currently, the treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis is oral terbinafine because of its high efficacy, low relapse rates, and cost-effectiveness. Oral itraconazole or fluconazole could be considered for infections caused by Candida. Topical therapies may be a useful adjunct to these systemic therapies, but are less effective when used alone. More research is needed to determine the best measures for preventing reinfection.

### Onychomycosis: treatment and prevention of recurrence [^068e245b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, nondermatophytes, and yeast, and is the most common nail disorder seen in clinical practice. It is an important problem because it may cause local pain, paresthesias, difficulties performing activities of daily living, and impair social interactions. The epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation and diagnosis of onychomycosis were discussed in the first article in this continuing medical education series. In this article, we review the prognosis and response to onychomycosis treatment, medications for onychomycosis that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and off-label therapies and devices. Methods to prevent onychomycosis recurrences and emerging therapies are also described.

### Interventions for ingrowing toenails [^42f30dbf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrowing toenails are a common problem in which part of the nail penetrates the skinfold alongside the nail, creating a painful area. Different non-surgical and surgical interventions for ingrowing toenails are available, but there is no consensus about a standard first-choice treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of non-surgical and surgical interventions in a medical setting for ingrowing toenails, with the aim of relieving symptoms and preventing regrowth of the nail edge or recurrence of the ingrowing toenail.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also updated our searches of CINAHL, WEB of SCIENCE, ongoing trials databases, and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of non-surgical and surgical interventions for ingrowing toenails, which are also known by the terms 'unguis incarnatus' and 'onychocryptosis', and those comparing postoperative treatment options. Studies must have had a follow-up period of at least one month.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data from selected studies. We analysed outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This is an update of the Cochrane review 'Surgical treatments for ingrowing toenails'. In this update we included 24 studies, with a total of 2826 participants (of which 7 were also included in the previous review). Five studies were on non-surgical interventions, and 19 were on surgical interventions. The risk of bias of each included study was assessed; this is a measure of the methodological quality of several characteristics in these studies. It was found to be unclear for several items, due to incomplete reporting. Participants were not blinded to the treatment they received because of the nature of the interventions, e.g. surgery or wearing a brace on the toe. Outcome assessors were reported to be blinded in only 9 of the 24 studies. None of the included studies addressed our primary outcomes of 'relief of symptoms' or 'regrowth', but 16 did address 'recurrence'. Not all of the included studies addressed all of our secondary outcomes (healing time, postoperative complications - infection and haemorrhage, pain of operation/postoperative pain, participant satisfaction), and two studies did not address any of the secondary outcomes. Surgical interventions were better at preventing recurrence than non-surgical interventions with gutter treatment (or gutter removal), and they were probably better than non-surgical treatments with orthonyxia (brace treatment). In 4 of the 12 studies in which a surgical intervention with chemical ablation (e.g. phenol) was compared with a surgical intervention without chemical ablation, a significant reduction of recurrence was found. The surgical interventions on both sides in these comparisons were not equal, so it is not clear if the reduction was caused by the addition of the chemical ablation. In only one study, a comparison was made of a surgical intervention known as partial nail avulsion with matrix excision compared to the same surgical intervention with phenol. In this study of 117 participants, the surgical intervention with phenol was significantly more effective in preventing recurrence than the surgical intervention alone (14% compared to 41% respectively, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.69). None of the postoperative interventions described, such as the use of antibiotics or manuka honey; povidone-iodine with paraffin; hydrogel with paraffin; or paraffin gauze, showed any significant difference when looking at infection rates, pain, or healing time.

Authors' Conclusions

Surgical interventions are more effective than non-surgical interventions in preventing the recurrence of an ingrowing toenail. In the studies comparing a surgical intervention to a surgical intervention with the application of phenol, the addition of phenol is probably more effective in preventing recurrence and regrowth of the ingrowing toenail. Because there is only one study in which the surgical interventions in both study arms were equal, more studies have to be done to confirm these outcomes. Postoperative interventions do not decrease the risk of postoperative infection, postoperative pain, or healing time.

### How to improve cure rates for the management of onychomycosis [^5558bd94]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

To improve the treatment of onychomycosis clinicians need to identify correctly the causative organism, choose a therapy that is effective against the pathogen, and take into consideration the pharmacokinetics (eg, bioavailability, drug interactions) of the oral agent. In addition, variations of the standard regimens may need to be considered (ie, booster or supplemental therapy). To reduce the recurrence of onychomycosis, once mycologic cure has been achieved, clinicians should educate their patients about proper foot care. Familiarity with the symptoms and signs of tinea pedis and onychomycosis may enable patients to seek appropriate care when the disease is at an early stage.

### Treatment of distal onychomycosis with avulsion and topical antifungal agents under occlusion… [^6a7b5652]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

REPORT OF CASES A 28-year-old man presented with a history of progressive thickening and fragmentation of the left thumbnail over a period of about 1. 5 years. Scaling of his left hand previously had been treated successfully with 1% ciclopirox olamine cream applied twice a day for 1 month, but the thumbnail showed no evidence of improvement. He had tried several over-the-counter products for fungus infections of the nail for varying periods of time without success. On physical examination, he showed dystrophic changes of the left thumbnail with subungual hyperkeratosis. The remainder of his skin examination was unremarkable. Hyphae were observed in scales removed from under the left thumbnail, and a culture yielded Trichophyton rubrum. He was unwilling to take oral medication but agreed to be treated with nail plate removal followed by the topical application of an antifungal agent under an occlusive dressing.

### Assessing treatment outcomes in toenail onychomycosis clinical trials [^b140d99a]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Several oral and topical medications are available for the treatment of onychomycosis, a widespread fungal infection of the nail. Since efficacy criteria vary greatly among clinical trials for onychomycosis treatment, it is difficult for physicians to compare outcomes and determine the appropriate therapy for a given patient. The present analysis evaluates the efficacy criteria used in intention-to-treat clinical trials of itraconazole, terbinafine, and 8% ciclopirox nail lacquer, drugs approved by the US FDA for the treatment of onychomycosis. Efficacy parameters often appear to use subjective assessment tools and may not include the actual size measurement of the affected target nail as an efficacy variable. Parameters, which assess both mycologic and clinical cure, are frequently omitted from clinical trials. Not surprisingly, clinical trials with stringent efficacy criteria, which assess both mycologic and clinical response/cure without use of subjective methods, appear to have the lowest rates for both therapeutic response and complete cure. Thus, an evaluation of treatment options for onychomycosis cannot solely compare success/failure rates in clinical trials, but requires a critical appraisal of the efficacy criteria utilized in those trials.

### At-home technique for debridement of nail plate thickening [^e2a8ecd3]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with traumatic onychodystrophy present with hyperkeratotic and discolored nails, typically accompanied by a reduction in nail plate translucency. Diagnosis requires exclusion of other conditions that can present similarly, including onychomycosis or nail psoriasis, and a nail plate clipping with histopathologic confirmation can be used to rule out these entities. When conducting a clinical evaluation, it is important to ask about any past nail trauma, types of footwear, exposure to occupational risks, or relevant medical conditions such as hemiplegia or neurologic issues. During the physical examination, it is important to inspect the foot for structural irregularities, including overlapping toes, Morton toe, and hallux varus, which could influence the development of nail plate thickening.

Treatment of traumatic onychodystrophy is challenging. Filing or pumicing may be attempted, but is often difficult to perform and ineffective for very thick nails. Topical urea 40% is the primary medical treatment for this condition, and the mechanism of action is to promote unfolding, solubilization, and dissociation of protein molecules in the nail plate, which facilitates the cleavage of disulfide linkages. Topical urea promotes nail plate softening and may also enhance transungual drug permeation. Urea 40% cream is applied directly to the nail plate nightly with occlusion, and may be used alone, or in conjunction with nail drilling twice monthly. In office nail plate debridement with drilling is not typically performed by dermatologists, although in podiatry, drilling is routinely used to manage thickened nails, onychomycosis, corns, and calluses, providing pain relief, improved treatment outcomes, and enhanced mobility. Surgical treatments for nail plate thickening are limited to case reports. Baran et alreported successfully surgically removing one-third of the distal nail matrix in a case report of a 47-year-old with Darier disease. Another case report describes application of phenol to the proximal nail matrix to permanently ablate the matrix. A prospective study demonstrating prosthetic nail resin application for 15 patients with retronychia reported improvement in nail appearance in 87% of patients.

### Ingrown toenail management [^c829dad7]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Ingrown toenails account for approximately 20% of foot problems in primary care. The great toe is most often affected. Ingrown toenails occur most commonly in young men, and nail care habits and footwear are most often contributory factors. No consensus has been reached for the best treatment approach, but ingrown nails may be nonsurgically or surgically treated. Nonsurgical treatments are typically used for mild to moderate ingrown nails, whereas surgical approaches are used in moderate and severe cases. Simple nonsurgical palliative measures include correcting inappropriate footwear, managing hyperhidrosis and onychomycosis, soaking the affected toe followed by applying a mid- to high-potency topical steroid, and placing wisps of cotton or dental floss under the ingrown lateral nail edge. Application of a gutter splint to the ingrown nail edge to separate it from the lateral fold provides immediate pain relief. A cotton nail cast made from cotton and cyanoacrylate adhesive, taping the lateral nail fold, or orthonyxia may also alleviate mild to moderate ingrown toenail. Surgical approaches seek to remove the interaction between the nail plate and the nail fold to eliminate local trauma and inflammatory reaction. These approaches are superior to nonsurgical ones for preventing recurrence. The most common surgical approach is partial avulsion of the lateral edge of the nail plate. Matrixectomy further prevents recurrence and can be performed through surgical, chemical, or electrosurgical means.

### Onychomycosis in clinical practice: factors contributing to recurrence [^3fbcbea4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The treatment of onychomycosis has improved in recent years and many patients can now expect a complete and lasting cure. However, for up to 25% of patients, persistent disease remains a problem, thus presenting a particular challenge to the clinician. For these patients, it is obviously important to ensure that a correct diagnosis of onychomycosis has been made, as misdiagnosis will inevitably jeopardize the perception of therapeutic effectiveness. Although onychomycosis accounts for about 50% of all nail diseases seen by physicians, nonfungal causes of similar symptoms include repeated trauma, psoriasis, lichen planus, local tumours vascular disorders and inflammatory diseases. Predisposing factors that contribute to a poor response to topical and/or oral therapy include the presence of a very thick nail, extensive involvement of the entire nail unit, lateral nail disease and yellow spikes. However, poor penetration of systemic agents to the centre of infection, or the inability of topical agents to diffuse between the surface of the nail plate and the active disease below, probably contributes to this. Other factors contributing to recurrence may be related to the patient's family history, occupation, lifestyle or underlying physiology. In addition, patients with concomitant disease (e.g. peripheral vascular disease, diabetes) or patients who are immunosuppressed (e.g. those with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) are more susceptible to onychomycosis. In the elderly, the prevalence of onychomycosis may be as high as 60%, and increases with age; in this population, physical trauma plays a major role in precipitating recurrence, especially in patients with faulty biomechanics due to underlying arthritis and bone abnormalities. It is also possible that recurrence in some cases is due to early termination of treatment or use of an inappropriate dose, and these possibilities should be eliminated before further investigations are undertaken. There is good evidence to suggest that a combination of oral and topical therapies, when given at the same time, yield excellent clinical outcomes, although there remains a need for more effective topical agents with greater nail penetration and more effective oral antifungal agents.

### A second look at efficacy criteria for onychomycosis: clinical and mycological cure [^23e0ab4e]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Approval of topical onychomycosis drugs by regulatory agencies may be negatively impacted by an overly stringent definition of complete cure, which includes nail clearing plus mycological cure.

Objectives

In this position paper, we discuss interpretation of mycological outcome and clinical trial length.

Methods

We reviewed data from seven international onychomycosis trials that enrolled subjects with positive KOH and dermatophyte-positive culture at screening followed by 48 weeks of treatment. Further, we examined 94 KOH-positive/culture-negative week 52 follow-up samples for morphological hyphal damage.

Results

From 3054 samples collected at week 52 follow-up visits, 2360 were culture-negative. However, a significant percentage (78.7%) of these subungual samples (n = 1857) remained KOH-positive. From the subset of follow-up samples examined for morphological changes, we identified hyphal breakage or distortion in 56 direct smears (60%), which may indicate nonviability.

Conclusions

Reassessment of the definition of onychomycosis cure is critical. For clinical trials of topical agents, length of treatment should be re-examined. Further, in our experience, a high rate of subungual debris samples remained direct smear-positive while converting to negative culture. Evidence of morphological hyphal damage suggests that late-visit microscopic results may be false-positives. Therefore, the absence of clinical signs following an adequate washout period, coupled with a negative culture, with or without negative microscopy, should be considered the definition of onychomycosis cure.

### Efinaconazole 10% solution in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis: two phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies [^2e923b77]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a common nail infection, often resulting in nail plate damage and deformity. Topical lacquer treatments have negligible efficacy. Oral treatments, although more efficacious, are limited by drug interactions and potential hepatotoxicity.

Objective

We investigated the safety and efficacy of efinaconazole 10% solution (efinaconazole), the first triazole antifungal developed for distal lateral subungual onychomycosis.

Methods

Two identical, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies were conducted in patients with toenail distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (20%-50% clinical involvement [study 1: N = 870, study 2: N = 785]). Patients were randomized (3:1) to efinaconazole or vehicle, once daily for 48 weeks, with 4-week posttreatment follow-up. Debridement was not performed. The primary end point was complete cure rate (0% clinical involvement of target toenail, and both negative potassium hydroxide examination and fungal culture) at week 52.

Results

Mycologic cure rates were significantly greater with efinaconazole (study 1: 55.2%, study 2: 53.4%) compared with vehicle (P < .001). The primary end point, complete cure, was also significantly greater for efinaconazole (study 1: 17.8% vs 3.3%, study 2: 15.2% vs 5.5%, P < .001). Treatment success (percent affected target toenail [0%- ≤ 10%]) for efinaconazole ranged from 21.3% to 44.8% in study 1 and from 17.9% to 40.2% in study 2, compared with 5.6% to 16.8% and 7.0% to 15.4%, respectively, with vehicle. Adverse events associated with efinaconazole were local site reactions (2%) and clinically similar to vehicle.

Limitations

A period of 52 weeks may be too brief to evaluate a clinical cure in onychomycosis.

Conclusions

Once daily topical efinaconazole appears to be a viable alternative to oral treatment options for onychomycosis.

### Isolated single or pauci-nail lichen planus, three cases [^010462c3]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case 1

An 83-year-old male presented with right third finger (R3) nail dystrophy. Nail dystrophy had been present for 1 year. The lesion was treated in the past with topical econazole and oral terbinafine without improvement. On exam, R3 fingernail dystrophy was noted (Fig 1, A). The nail demonstrated longitudinal and horizontal ridging, splitting, onychoschizia, onycholysis, and subungual debris. The proximal nail fold was pink, mildly edematous, and exhibited loss of eponychial attachment to the nail plate. There was no purulence or bleeding. Given the monodactylous involvement, malignancy was suspected. To assist in diagnosis and to rule out other causes such as irritant-induced paronychia, onychomycosis, or inflammatory nail disease a 4 mm punch biopsy was performed of the distal nail matrix after partial nail avulsion. Histopathology showed band-like lymphocytic infiltrate in the upper dermis supporting a diagnosis of nail lichen planus given the clinical context. Periodic acid-Schiff-stained sections failed to reveal fungi.

Fig 1
Progressive nail dystrophy of right third (R3) fingernail in case 1. A, Examination findings at initial presentation. B, Presentation after 1 year demonstrating onycholysis, onychorrhexis, and nail hypoplasia despite intramatrical steroid therapy.

The patient was subsequently treated with three injections of intramatrical triamcinolone (between 0.3 and 0.4 mL of 20 to 30 mg/mL triamcinolone) every 6 weeks. The patient continued to present with persistent and stable distal onycholysis, nail yellowing, nail hypoplasia, subungual debris, and longitudinal ridging along the nail (Fig 1, B). A periodic acid-Schiff stain of a clipping from the distal nail showed evidence of fungal infection and the patient completed a course of oral terbinafine and topical efinaconazole nail solution. However, given an overall lack of response to antifungal and anti-inflammatory therapy, a nail avulsion was eventually performed to debride the onychomycotic nail plate and provide temporary symptom relief. Despite this procedure, hyperkeratosis, scaling, and hemorrhagic crusting of the nail bed persisted. Further treatment was deferred by the patient as the patient reported that the nail dystrophy at this point was not particularly bothersome.

### The use of topical therapies to treat onychomycosis [^a2c05d9b]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

The management of onychomycosis using topical agents has improved with the introduction of ciclopirox and amorolfine nail lacquers; other topical agents may be less effective. The combination of a nail lacquer with an oral antifungal agent may further improve efficacy rates in certain clinical presentations (eg, among those individuals with severe onychomycosis). Topical agents have a favorable adverse events profile. Further studies are required on the treatment of onychomycosis with nail lacquers.

### Treatment of retronychia: a systematic review and suggested treatment algorithm [^4fdf727a]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Retronychia is an inflammatory disorder typical of the great toes characterized by arrested nail growth, ingrowth of the nail plate into the proximal nail fold and paronychia. There is no standardized treatment for retronychia, and its management should be weighed based on the severity stage, treatment modality, and clinical outcome. In this paper, a systematic review of the literature was performed to assess all published data regarding the treatment of retronychia. A total of 231 patients from 24 studies were included in the analysis. Conservative management was adopted in mild-intermediate forms, consisting of medical (topical or intralesional high-potency corticosteroids) and podiatric treatment (taping, clipping back the onycholytic plate, orthosis), leading to a global cure rate of 41.2%, with no reported side effects. Non-conservative management, that is, chemical or surgical avulsion of the nail plate, proved resolutive in 71.2% of cases. Surgical avulsion of the nail plate produced the highest cure rate (78.2%), but was burdened by 9.6% of long-term sequelae, mainly nail dystrophies. A decision-making algorithm was designed to give clinicians treatment indications based on the severity stage of retronychia, treatment invasiveness, and possible clinical outcomes.

### En bloc excision of proximal nail fold for treatment of chronic paronychia [^789140a0]. Dermatologic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic paronychia is a very recalcitrant dermatosis, which is particularly prevalent in housewives. Medical treatment for this condition is unsatisfactory in a significant number of cases. Surgical approach forms an important part of management, however, this area has received little attention. Various surgical approaches have been tried in the past but a comparative analysis has not been attempted.

Objectives

The present study aims at assessing the efficacy of en bloc excision of proximal nail fold (PNF). Moreover, a comparative analysis has been undertaken to assess whether or not simultaneous nail plate avulsion improves the treatment outcome.

Methods

Thirty patients of chronic paronychia with nail plate irregularities were randomly divided into two treatment groups (15 patients each). After a detailed evaluation, en bloc excision of PNF with or without nail plate removal was performed. Postoperative measures were advised and the patients were kept under regular follow-up thereafter. Assessment of postoperative complications was also performed.

Results

Twelve patients in group I and 13 patients in group II completed the treatment protocol. Of these, 70% of patients were cured in group II (en bloc excision with nail avulsion) whereas only 41% were cured in group I (en bloc excision without nail avulsion).

Conclusion

En bloc excision of the PNF is a useful method in recalcitrant chronic paronychia. Simultaneous avulsion of the nail plate improves the surgical outcome. Strict avoidance of irritant exposure is necessary to ensure complete treatment and prevent recurrence.

### Randomized clinical trial of surgical technique and local antibiotics for ingrowing toenail [^7c51118e]. The British Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to investigate different surgical techniques for treating ingrowing toenails (IGTNs) and to determine the value of a locally applied antibiotic after intervention.

Methods

One hundred and twenty-three patients with IGTN were assigned randomly to one of four groups. All patients had partial nail avulsion. This was combined with excision of the matrix or application of phenol, with or without local application of gentamicin afterwards. All procedures were performed by one physician. The primary outcome measure was symptomatic recurrence of IGTN.

Results

One hundred and seventeen patients were available for follow-up. Phenol gave significantly better results than matrix excision with respect to recurrence (including regrowth and spike formation) after 1 year (P < 0.001). In terms of signs of infection, there was no significant difference between phenol and matrix excision after 2 days (P = 0.224) or 1 week (P = 0.501). Antibiotics had no effect in reducing the risk of infection after 2 days (P = 0.989) or 1 week (P = 0.676), or in reducing the rate of recurrent IGTN at 1 year (P = 0.187). If regrowth or spike formation is included, the effect is even less significant (P = 0.876).

Conclusion

Partial nail avulsion with phenolization gave better results than partial avulsion with matrix excision. Local antibiotics did not reduce signs of infection or recurrence. Use of phenol did not produce more signs of infection than matrix excision.

### Prediction of outcome in the treatment of onychomycosis [^94266c0f]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with toenail onychomycosis remain a therapeutic challenge despite the introduction of new systemic therapies. Around 20% of patients remain uncured even with optimal oral therapy, but the reasons for treatment failure are unclear. Thus far there are no data to suggest that treatment failures can be identified on the basis of their presenting features or progress during treatment. In a series of patients, we have attempted to identify clinical parameters that determine the patient response to 12 weeks of oral terbinafine for confirmed dermatophyte onychomycosis. As part of a dose-defining randomized multicentre study, 35 patients were followed for 48 weeks. The unaffected nail length, growth rate, hyperkeratosis, onycholysis and presence of a dermatophytoma were assessed prospectively. To confirm our findings, at the end of the study period we analysed retrospectively photographs that had been taken regularly throughout the trial. The average degree of hyperkeratosis was less severe in the group achieving a disease-free nail, meaning clinical and mycological cure. For mycological cure alone, no predictive factors could be identified.

In our study, the treatment success rate in terms of the primary end‐point (≤ 10% clinical involvement) was 56.6% in the eligible patients after applying EFCZ for up to 72 weeks. In the multinational phase III study for EFCZ in subjects with onychomycosis who had 20–50% area of nail involvement, the treatment success rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with less than 10% area of nail involvement. Treatment success rate was 31.0%, and in the subgroup analysis in the Japanese population, this rate was 46.7% (48 weeks of application and assessed at week 52). 4, 5 Considering that the definitions of treatment success are slightly different in a precise sense and that our study included not only patients with DLSO but also those with SWO, an equable comparison is not possible. However, when comparing only with the population with an affected area of 20–50%, a similar trend of 57.6% (at week 48) was obtained in our study.

### Monotherapy for toenail onychomycosis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^a1bacf7c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and nondermatophyte moulds that accounts for approximately 50% of all nail-related disease.

Objectives

This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of monotherapy and combination treatments for toenail onychomycosis using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

Methods

Quality of evidence was assessed using Cochrane-compliant rules and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Efficacy and safety outcomes were compared using a random-effects NMA to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) of direct and indirect comparisons among oral and topical treatments (PROSPERO 2015: CRD42018086912). There were not enough eligible combination and device-based therapy trials to include in the NMA.

Results

Of 77 randomized controlled trials, 26 were included in the ORs (8136 patients). There were no significant inconsistencies between the direct and indirect evidence. Relative effects show that the odds of mycological cure with continuous terbinafine 250 mg or continuous itraconazole 200 mg are significantly greater than topical treatments. Fluconazole, pulse regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, and topical treatments did not differ significantly in the odds of achieving mycological cure. The ORs of adverse events occurring with oral or topical treatments were not significantly different from each other. For mycological cure, evidence was of moderate or high quality while evidence ranged from very low to high quality for adverse events.

Conclusions

Our review suggests that oral and topical treatments for toenail onychomycosis are safe and effective in producing mycological cure. What's already known about this topic? Topical treatments traditionally have lower success rates than oral treatments. Oral treatments have the advantage of shorter treatment durations, but also present challenges in cases of drug-drug interactions or immunosuppression. A network meta-analysis (NMA) gathers data from indirect evidence to gain confidence about all treatment comparisons and allows for estimation of comparative effects that have not been investigated in head-to-head randomized clinical trials (RCTs). What does this study add? This NMA of efficacy and safety includes all RCTs of oral, topical, combination and device-based treatments for toenail onychomycosis, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for NMA. The odds of achieving mycological cure with continuous terbinafine 250 mg or continuous itraconazole 200 mg were significantly greater than topical treatments. Fluconazole, pulse regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, and topical treatments did not differ significantly in the odds of achieving mycological cure.

### Topical therapy for toenail onychomycosis: an evidence-based review [^bfbcd004]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Managing toenail onychomycosis with topical treatments is challenging. It is difficult for topical medication to penetrate the nail plate, and this is reflected in lower cure rates with topical treatment than with oral treatment. However, oral medications may not be suitable for some patients, because of drug interactions; therefore, topical treatments are critical in managing the disease in certain patient populations.

Objective

This paper reviews the quality and content of the scientific literature on topical treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Methods

PubMed, Ovid (Medline and Embase), Scopus, Cochrane library, and clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched for original clinical reports of topical monotherapy for microscopy and/or culture-confirmed toenail onychomycosis in adults. Studies were evaluated using an onychomycosis study quality scale, which was based on the CONSORT guidelines.

Results

Twenty-five publications (28 studies) were identified and met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies scored high ratings on the quality scale. These were randomized controlled trials or randomized comparative trials. Low-quality studies were nonrandomized, open studies that prevented statistical analysis. Most studies reported clinical and mycological cure. The most variation was observed with reporting outcomes of clinical improvement. Amorolfine, ciclopirox, tavaborole, and efinaconazole produced clinical and mycological cure in patients with mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis (< 50–65% nail involvement), with efinaconazole showing the highest rates. Treatments were generally applied daily for 24–48 weeks, with longer treatment and follow-up showing better outcomes.

Conclusion

Topical treatment with amorolfine, ciclopirox, tavaborole, or efinaconazole is appropriate for cases of mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis due to dermatophyte or mixed dermatophyte/Candida infection.

### Onychomycosis [^2874e250]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a frequent nail disease caused by dermatophytes, yeasts, and nondermatophyte molds. Trichophyton rubrum, T mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floccosum are the most common etiologic agents worldwide. Candida spp are the most frequent among the yeasts. Diagnosis is corroborated by direct microscopic examination, culture, and histomycology with periodic acid-Schiff stain. Other new methods of diagnosis are discussed. Treatment is based on oral antifungals: terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole, including other emerging triazole drugs. Therapeutic outcome with ciclopirox and amorolfine lacquers alone and combined with systemic therapy are also reviewed, as well as the new nail enhancers and physical and chemical removal of the diseased nails.

### Oral treatments for toenail onychomycosis… [^851a83e6]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

to produce clinically significant improvements in the length of the unaffected nail in great toenails. Two studies compared different regimens of itraconazole with terbinafine. 17, 38 Tosti et al38 compared intermittent treatment with itraconazole with intermittent treatment with terbinafine and continuous treatment with terbinafine. Only Ling et al, 24 Evans and Sigurgeirsson, 17 and Gupta et al11 presented data in absolute numbers for clinical cures they defined a priori. These authors evaluated different drugs. Ling et al24 found that people who took fluconazole, 450 mg once weekly for 9 months, had the highest percentage of clinically normal nail with complete regrowth of healthy tissue at 6-month follow-up.

Evans and Sigurgeirsson17 found that a higher proportion of people who took terbinafine, 250 mg/d for 16 weeks, had 100% clear toenail and at least 5 mm of unaffected nail growth compared with people randomized to either 250 mg/d of terbinafine for 12 weeks or a 1 week in 3- or 4-intermittent cycle of itraconazole. In both these trials the clinical cure rates were consistent with the mycological cure rates. Gupta et al11 compared intermittent itraconazole treatment with placebo and found that the proportion of patients who were clear of all signs of infection or markedly improved reflected the rates determined by mycological investigation. However, the proportion deemed clinically cured in the placebo arm was much lower than the proportion found to be cured using the mycological outcome criteria. There is no evidence that intermittent regimens of itraconazole produce statistically different cure rates from continuous schedules.

Nor is there evidence that intermittent regimens or shorter treatment times result in fewer reported adverse events. Based on the mycological cure rates in our systematic review, it appears that a continuous regimen of terbinafine is the most effective oral therapy for the long-term management of fungally infected toenails. A standardization of methods regarding the collection and presentation of data regarding complete clinical cure is required to allow future researchers to compare the effect of oral antifungal agents on clinical outcomes in the treatment of onychomycosis. A consensus between clinicians and researchers regarding the best way to collect and present those secondary outcomes is needed.

### Treatment of ingrown toenails in the pediatric population [^8ed27c33]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Nail avulsion plus chemical matrixectomy (CM) using NaOH as an alternative to surgical matrixectomy (SM) has recently been used in the treatment of ingrown toenails (IGTNs) in adults. No studies exist to dictate the most effective and safe treatment method in the pediatric population.

Methods

A retrospective review of pediatric IGTNs treated at 2 institutions for 6 years was done, looking at presentation, treatment modality, SM vs CM, and outcomes.

Results

Eight hundred forty-eight IGTNs in 518 patients were reviewed with an average age of 12.5 years. Twenty-three percent were felt to be infected at the time of presentation, and 34% were being treated with antibiotics within the preceding week of surgery. Seventy-nine percent of toenails underwent surgical management with the most common procedure being avulsion plus SM (65%), followed by avulsion plus CM (17%), and avulsion alone (14%). The overall recurrence rate after initial surgery was 19.5%. After adjusting for covariates, recurrence was associated with treatment by avulsion alone (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–4.7), avulsion plus CM (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.7), and treatment with antibiotics within the week before surgery (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.9; P = 0.017). The overall postoperative infection rate was 6% and was unrelated to presence of preoperative infection, use of antibiotics, or surgical treatment method.

Conclusions

Ingrown toenails present a significant problem to youth and should be addressed in a diligent fashion. Chemical matrixectomy using NaOH is a safe and effective alternative to SM and maybe associated with a lower rate of recurrence, especially when use in conjunction with preoperative antibiotics.

### Pilot study to evaluate a plasma device for the treatment of onychomycosis [^d28ab57e]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, and is the most common of the nail disorders. Current therapies for onychomycosis have less than ideal efficacy and have the potential for adverse effects. As previous studies have shown that nonthermal plasma inhibits the in vitro growth of Trichophyton rubrum, we conducted a pilot study on 19 participants with toenail onychomycosis. The primary endpoint was safety of the device, and secondary outcome measures were clinical efficacy and mycological cure. Patient satisfaction was measured using questionnaires at the completion of the study. All but one patient met the primary endpoint of safety and there were no long-term sequelae. The overall clinical cure was 53.8% and the mycological cure was 15.4%. The majority of patients were satisfied with the treatment. Our conclusions are that nonthermal plasma is a safe treatment and may have a beneficial effect on toenail onychomycosis.

### Clinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of a new topical treatment for onychomycosis [^48641fa4]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical study assessed the safety and efficacy of an investigational topical product for the treatment of onychomycosis (nail fungus).

Method

A prospective, multi-center, single-arm, self-controlled clinical investigation was done with adult subjects that met the inclusion criteria, primarily culture-confirmed dermatophyte infection of at least one great toe. Subjects self-treated in a weekly regimen of topical application for six months, with clinical assessment at one, three, and six months. Primary efficacy endpoint was clearance of fungal nail infection after six months of weekly treatment. Primary safety endpoint was freedom from product-related adverse events for the duration of the treatment term.

Results

Fifty males and 13 females, ages 24 to 65, infected with Trichophyton (n = 62) or Epidermophyton (n = 1) were enrolled; 53 completed six months of assessment. Sixty percent showed improvement in clinical parameters (nail color, nail plate involvement, onycholysis, thickness, and hyperkeratosis) at six months. Cumulative rates of dermatophyte-negative culture results (test of cure) were 28, 36, and 62 percent of subjects after one, three, and six months of treatment, respectively. Three minor adverse events were device-related, with no unanticipated or serious adverse events.

Limitations

This study was single-arm and self-controlled; 53 of 63 enrolled subjects completed the study.

Conclusion

This study describes a new topical medical device with safety and efficacy profiles that compare favorably to results reported for topically applied onychomycosis drug treatments.

Clinical Trials Data

The results of use of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), in treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail without lunula involvement were obtained from two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in the US. In these studies, patients with onychomycosis of the great toenails without lunula involvement were treated with ciclopirox topical solution, 8% in conjunction with monthly removal of the unattached, infected toenail by the investigator. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), was applied for 48 weeks. At baseline, patients had 20–65% involvement of the target great toenail plate. Statistical significance was demonstrated in one of two studies for the endpoint "complete cure" (clear nail and negative mycology), and in two studies for the endpoint "almost clear" (≤ 10% nail involvement and negative mycology) at the end of study. These results are presented below.

The summary of reported patient outcomes for the ITT population at 12 weeks following the end of treatment are presented below. Note that post-treatment efficacy assessments were scheduled only for patients who achieved a complete cure.

### The efficacy and safety of efinaconazole 10% solution for treatment of mild to moderate onychomycosis: a pooled analysis of two phase 3 randomized trials [^191a5055]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail apparatus that can be challenging to treat due to the modest efficacy of existing antifungal therapies and a high rate of relapse and recurrence.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy and safety of efinaconazole 10% solution in pooled Phase III clinical trial participants with mild to moderate onychomycosis.

Methods

Phase III clinical trials data from NCT01008033 and NCT01007708 were pooled. Efficacy analysis for the primary and secondary outcome variables was conducted using the mITT population and analysed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests. Subgroup analysis was conducted for prognostic factors that may affect drug efficacy. Safety analysis was conducted on all recipients of a single drug dose.

Results

Efinaconazole 10% nail solution was superior to vehicle for all primary and secondary outcome measures assessed. Complete cure was 18.5% vs 4.7% P < 0.001 [mITT] and mycological cure was 56.3% vs 16.6%, P < 0.001 [mITT]. Complete or almost complete cure and treatment success were achieved in 27.7% and 47.2% compared to 7.9% and 18.2% with vehicle, respectively (P < 0.001 [mITT]). In all subgroups, efinaconazole 10% solution had statistically higher cures rates compared to vehicle. Higher complete cure rates were observed in women and individuals with mild disease (≤ 33% involvement), but not in any other subgroup assessed. Treatment associated adverse events in the efinaconazole 10% solution group were similar to vehicle and limited to local site reactions (2%).

Conclusions

The findings from this pooled analysis suggest that efinaconazole 10% solution may become the preferred topical agent for mild to moderate onychomycosis.

### Prognostic factors for complete cure following treatment of mild and moderate toenail onychomycosis with efinaconazole topical solution 10 [^02a51236]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify those patients who are more likely to achieve treatment success with efinaconazole topical solution 10% based on clinical improvement and mycological status during treatment.

Methods

A subgroup analysis of patients, aged 18 to 70 years, randomized to receive efinaconazole topical solution 10% or vehicle from 2 identical multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled 48-week studies evaluating safety and efficacy. The primary end point, complete cure rate (0% clinical involvement of target toenail, and both negative potassium hydroxide examination and fungal culture) at week 52 was evaluated based on mycologic cure at week 24, and the degree of clinical improvement in nail involvement at week 12.

Results

Over a quarter (25.1%) of patients treated with efinaconazole topical solution 10% who could demonstrate at least 10% improvement in affected nail involvement by week 12 progressed to complete cures at week 52. Similarly, 21.7% of patients who demonstrated mycologic cure at week 24 achieved complete cures at week 52.

Conclusions

Early clinical improvement and mycologic clearance may help to predict treatment success with efinaconazole topical solution 10%.

### Proximal nail fold swelling, pain, and granulation tissue [^5049eabc]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 2. What is the recommended treatment for retronychia?

A. Topical steroids
B. Topical antifungals
C. Oral antibiotics
D. Partial nail plate avulsion
E. Total or proximal nail plate avulsion

Answers

A. Topical steroids – Incorrect. Topical steroids might decrease local inflammation but will not stop the foreign body reaction of the proximal nail fold to the ingrowing nail plate.
B. Topical antifungals – Incorrect. Antifungals will not address the underlying cause of retronychia.
C. Oral antibiotics – Incorrect. Although a bacterial infection might develop secondarily to a retronychia, antibiotics will not address the underlying cause of retronychia.
D. Partial nail plate avulsion – Incorrect. Total nail plate avulsion is the recommended treatment.
E. Total or proximal nail plate avulsion – Correct. Retronychia resolves with total nail plate or proximal nail plate avulsion. Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of a double nail and observation of normal nail growth after nail plate avulsion.

### Therapy of onychomycosis by nail avulsion and topically applied griseofulvin… [^8d9ef89e]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Prior to the development and introduction of griseofulvin, ringworm infections of the nails were almost completely resistant to therapy. 1 Griseofulvin has proven an effective agent in the therapy of onychomycosis; however, when it is administered orally, infections of the fingernails require 6 to 9 months of therapy with the drug and toenail infections require 12 to 18 months or longer. This form of treatment has additional disadvantages, for while the cure rate approximates 90% for fingernails, the cure rate for toenails is probably closer to 10%. Moreover, the prolonged oral dosage is expensive, and, as in any systemic medication, the problems of intolerance, sensitization, untoward reactions, and potential toxicity are present. This is a preliminary report of our experience with the topical use of griseofulvin for onychomycosis after surgical avulsion of the nail.

This technique was adopted for trial when intolerance to griseofulvin developed after oral administration over prolonged periods. DEMIS DJ, BROWN CS. Therapy of Onychomycosis by Nail Avulsion and Topically Applied Griseofulvin. Arch Dermatol. 1962; 85: 276–278.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^cc0f4b50]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Once onychomycosis occurs, it is generally a chronic disease requiring specialized and long‐term therapy to cure. Treatment includes oral therapy, topical therapy and surgical treatment (e.g. cutting of the nail plate, laser therapy and nail ablation), but topical therapy has an insufficient therapeutic effect due to the low concentration of the fungal agent and the low permeability of the nail plate. No topical drug has been approved for the treatment of onychomycosis in Japan for this reason. Although nail lacquers are available overseas, the complete cure rate ranges 5.5–8.5% for ciclopirox at 48 weeks and 0.96% for amorolfine at 52 weeks of treatment, indicating limited efficacies. 11, 12 Therefore, the development of a topical product with adequate efficacy as monotherapy is expected.

Under such circumstances, the first topical triazole antifungals solution exclusively formulated for onychomycosis, 10% efinaconazole, was approved in Japan in July 2014. Efinaconazole is an ingredient discovered in Japan that has low affinity to keratin, the main component of nails. This means that EFCZ has superior nail permeability and antifungal activity in the nail plate and nail bed. 13, 14 In a multinational phase III study conducted in subjects with mild to moderate onychomycosis having a 20–50% area of nail involvement, the complete cure rate was significantly greater than that in the vehicle group (study 1, 17.8% vs 3.3%; study 2, 15.2% vs 5.5%; P < 0.001). 4

Changes in secondary end‐points (full analysis set). (a) Complete cure rates. Changes in complete cure rate are shown according to severity from the start of efinaconazole 10% solution application to the final assessment. Complete cure was defined as 0% clinical involvement of the target nail, with a negative potassium hydroxide examination result. Complete cure rate showed a trend of improvement over time regardless of severity. (b) Mycological cure rate. Changes in mycological cure rate are shown according to severity from the start ofapplication to the final assessment. Mycological cure was defined as the negative result in the potassium hydroxide examination of the target nail. Mycological cure rate showed a trend of improvement over time regardless of severity. (c) Changes in clinical involvement over time. Changes in clinical involvement are shown according to severity from the start ofapplication to the final assessment. The changes in clinical involvement showed a trend of improvement over time regardless of severity. (d) Decrease rate of clinical involvement (improved and more). Changes in the decrease rate of clinical involvement for the patients with improvement and more (reduction of clinical involvement by ≥ 50%) are shown according to severity from the start ofapplication to the final assessment. The decrease rate of clinical involvement was defined as the rate of "the amount of decrease in clinical involvement from baseline to post‐application" against "the clinical involvement beforeapplication" of the target nail. The decrease rate of clinical involvement for the patients who attained more than just an improvement showed a trend of improvement over time regardless of severity. (e) Increase rate of the unaffected nail area. Changes in the increase rate of the unaffected nail area for the patients who showed 50% or more increase rates of unaffected nail area are shown according to severity from the start ofapplication to the final assessment. The increase rate of the unaffected nail area was defined as the rate of "the amount of increases of the unaffected nail area from baseline to post‐application" against "the unaffected nail area beforeapplication" of the target nail. As for the increase rate of the unaffected nail area, the proportion of patients with 50% or more showed a trend of increase over time regardless of severity, particularly in the severe cases.

### Oral antifungal medication for toenail onychomycosis [^60b1954e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infection of the toenails, also called onychomycosis, is a common problem that causes damage to the nail's structure and physical appearance. For those severely affected, it can interfere with normal daily activities. Treatment is taken orally or applied topically; however, traditionally topical treatments have low success rates due to the nail's physical properties. Oral treatments also appear to have shorter treatment times and better cure rates. Our review will assist those needing to make an evidence-based choice for treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral antifungal treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to October 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We sought to identify unpublished and ongoing trials by correspondence with authors and by contacting relevant pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing oral antifungal treatment to placebo or another oral antifungal treatment in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by one or more positive cultures, direct microscopy of fungal elements, or histological examination of the nail.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 48 studies involving 10,200 participants. Half the studies took place in more than one centre and were conducted in outpatient dermatology settings. The participants mainly had subungual fungal infection of the toenails. Study duration ranged from 4 months to 2 years. We assessed one study as being at low risk of bias in all domains and 18 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain. The most common high-risk domain was 'blinding of personnel and participants'. We found high-quality evidence that terbinafine is more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (risk ratio (RR) 6.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.96 to 9.08, 8 studies, 1006 participants) and mycological cure (RR 4.53, 95% CI 2.47 to 8.33, 8 studies, 1006 participants). Adverse events amongst terbinafine-treated participants included gastrointestinal symptoms, infections, and headache, but there was probably no significant difference in their risk between the groups (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.47, 4 studies, 399 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There was high-quality evidence that azoles were more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (RR 22.18, 95% CI 12.63 to 38.95, 9 studies, 3440 participants) and mycological cure (RR 5.86, 95% CI 3.23 to 10.62, 9 studies, 3440 participants). There were slightly more adverse events in the azole group (the most common being headache, flu-like symptoms, and nausea), but the difference was probably not significant (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12; 9 studies, 3441 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine and azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared, individually, to placebo (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38, 1 study, 35 participants; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07, 1 study, 26 participants, respectively; both low-quality evidence). There is moderate-quality evidence that terbinafine was probably more effective than azoles for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95, 15 studies, 2168 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.88, 17 studies, 2544 participants). There was probably no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.17; 9 studies, 1762 participants, moderate-quality evidence) between the two groups, and there may be no difference in recurrence rate (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.79, 5 studies, 282 participants, low-quality evidence). Common adverse events in both groups included headache, viral infection, and nausea. Moderate-quality evidence shows that azoles and griseofulvin probably had similar efficacy for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.96, 5 studies, 222 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.51, 5 studies, 222 participants). However, the risk of adverse events was probably higher in the griseofulvin group (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.73, 2 studies, 143 participants, moderate-quality evidence), with the most common being gastrointestinal disturbance and allergic reaction (in griseofulvin-treated participants) along with nausea and vomiting (in azole-treated participants). Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain about this comparison's impact on recurrence rate (RR 4.00, 0.26 to 61.76, 1 study, 7 participants). There is low-quality evidence that terbinafine may be more effective than griseofulvin in terms of clinical cure (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.72, 4 studies, 270 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90, 5 studies, 465 participants), and griseofulvin was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, although this was based on low-quality evidence (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.82, 2 studies, 100 participants). Common adverse events included headache and stomach problems (in griseofulvin-treated participants) as well as taste loss and nausea (in terbinafine-treated participants). No studies addressed recurrence rate for this comparison. No study addressed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found high-quality evidence that compared to placebo, terbinafine and azoles are effective treatments for the mycological and clinical cure of onychomycosis, with moderate-quality evidence of excess harm. However, terbinafine probably leads to better cure rates than azoles with the same risk of adverse events (moderate-quality evidence). Azole and griseofulvin were shown to probably have a similar effect on cure, but more adverse events appeared to occur with the latter (moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine may improve cure and be associated with fewer adverse effects when compared to griseofulvin (low-quality evidence). Only four comparisons assessed recurrence rate: low-quality evidence found that terbinafine or azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared to placebo, but there may be no difference between them. Only a limited number of studies reported adverse events, and the severity of the events was not taken into account. Overall, the quality of the evidence varied widely from high to very low depending on the outcome and comparison. The main reasons to downgrade evidence were limitations in study design, such as unclear allocation concealment and randomisation as well as lack of blinding.

### Onychomycosis does not always require systemic treatment for cure: a trial using topical therapy [^86c0e1fb]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Standard teaching dictates that systemic therapy is required for treatment of onychomycosis. It is unknown whether topical antifungal therapy is effective for pediatric nail infections. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study was conducted in the Pediatric Dermatology Research Unit at Rady Children's Hospital to determine whether topical antifungal therapy is efficacious for pediatric onychomycosis. Forty patients ages 2 to 16 years with nonmatrix onychomycosis were randomized 1:3 to ciclopirox lacquer or vehicle lacquer. Ciclopirox lacquer or vehicle was applied daily for 32 weeks, with weekly removal of the lacquer and mechanical trimming. Those with poor response were crossed over to active drug at week 12. Thirty-seven patients completed the 32-week study, and follow-up data were collected 1 year after completion of the study from 24 patients. Mycologic cure, effective treatment, and complete cure were assessed, as well as adverse events and effect on quality of life. Mycologic cure was 70% in the treated group and 20% in the vehicle arm (p = 0.03) at week 12. At end of the study (week 32), 77% of treated patients achieved mycologic cure and 71% effective treatment, compared with 22% of the control group. Ninety-two percent of those who were cured and followed for 1 year remained clear. Topical antifungal lacquer (ciclopirox) can be an effective option for children with nonmatrix onychomycosis. Pediatric onychomycosis does not always require systemic therapy and responds better to topical therapy than does adult disease.

### Ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery for treatment of onychomycosis [^8e3720ef]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of our study was to determine the effectiveness of using ultrasound (US) to increase the permeability of the nail, with the goal of improving outcomes in the treatment of onychomycosis.

Methods

Porcine nails were used because of their similarity to human nails. A hydrophilic blue dye was used as a drug-mimicking compound. Two sets of experiments were performed: luminosity experiments to assess the dye levels inside the nail after US and sham treatments and diffusion cell experiments for determination of changes in nail permeability due to US application. In both sets of experiments, planar US transducers were used to sonicate the nails at frequencies of 400, 600, and 800 kHz and 1 MHz, an intensity of 1 W/cm², and a duration of 5min in a continuous mode. Modeling studies were also performed to assess the safety of US application to the human toe for later clinical studies.

Results

In the luminosity experiments, application of US at frequencies of 600 and 800 kHz led to statistically significant results (P < .05), with an increase in dye delivery into the nail of up to 95% compared to control values. The diffusion cell results found statistical significance (P < .05) at all applied frequencies, with up to a 70% increase in the nail permeability compared to the control. Safety modeling studies found a maximal temperature increase of 4.4°C in the bone.

Conclusions

Our proposed US method may offer an alternative for improved treatment of onychomycosis. The current maximal temperature increase was found to be at the safety limit, and so pulsing and other alternatives will be investigated to minimize this temperature increase.

### Dermatologic adverse events associated with selective fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors: overview, prevention, and management guidelines [^5d5b474b]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Nail Changes

Counseling and education on the potential for nail changes are essential before initiation of treatment with FGFR inhibitors. Preventive strategies include avoidance of prolonged contact with water, repeated trauma, friction, and pressure on nails and nail beds. The use of protective gloves and limiting use of nail polish removers and nail hardeners is also helpful. Patients are also advised to avoid biting nails or cutting nails too short and to use topical emollients and loose‐fitting socks and footwear. Preventive correction of nail curvature may be considered.

Paronychia

Recommended treatments for grade 1 paronychia include topical povidone iodine 2%–10% applied twice daily [58] or daily nail soaking in 1:1 vinegar:water for 15 minutes a day. Patients with grade 2 or 3 paronychia should be treated with a 14‐day course of oral antibiotics in addition to daily nail soaking in 1:1 vinegar:water; bacterial cultures should be obtained to confirm sensitivity to antimicrobial agents. Dermatology consultation is recommended for grade ≥ 2 paronychia, given the potential chronicity of this event.

Onycholysis

Recommended management options for onycholysis consist of trimming the raised distal nails, clipping of the nails, and application of topical povidone iodine 2%–10% b.i.d. solution [58] around and under the nails. Oral antibiotics should be started if infection is suspected (bacterial cultures and sensitivities should be obtained prior to initiating antibiotics), and nail avulsion may be needed if the patient has painful hematoma or subungual abscess.

Alopecia

Preventive measures normally considered for patients undergoing traditional chemotherapy regimens, for example, scalp compression, scalp cooling, and medications, are not applicable to patients receiving FGFR inhibitors, and the health care provider's attention should be focused on early identification and management of symptoms.

Management of alopecia consists of prophylactic or reactive topical minoxidil 5% applied once daily to the scalp to encourage hair regrowth, and a high‐potency topical corticosteroid (e.g. fluocinonide 0.05% solution). In addition, hair camouflaging methods, which create the appearance of naturally thicker, fuller hair, may be considered. Alopecia typically reverses when treatment is discontinued.

### At-home technique for debridement of nail plate thickening [^a9923e59]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case

A 62-year-old man, Fitzpatrick skin type II, presented to our specialty nail clinic with nail plate thickening involving all 10 toenails for the past 20 years. Physical examination was significant for nail plate thickening and xanthonychia of the toenails. Histopathology of the nail plate clipping was negative for hyphae, consistent with traumatic onychodystrophy, likely due to his frequent running. He had been prescribed a topical antifungal cream by a previous physician and reported using it for several months with no improvement in the nail thickening. Treatment with topical urea 40% cream for 2 months was ineffective in thinning his nails. Nail pumicing and filing were not performed. The patient complained of discomfort when wearing shoes, difficulty with nail trimming, and feeling ashamed about the appearance of his nails.

The patient began using an at-home nail drill twice monthly, which effectively thinned his nails to allow for efficient nail clipping, improvement in quality of life, and increased comfort while wearing shoes.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^94dd1aca]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Regarding the decreased rate of clinical involvement, the proportion of subjects with improvement (reduction of involvement area by ≥ 50%) was 74.9% at the time of final assessment. By severity, the rate was 75.5% in the patient population with a clinical involvement of 20–50% and 73.8% in the population with more than 50% clinical involvement, showing a consistent trend of improvements without depending on disease severity (Fig. 3 d). The increased rate of unaffected nail area also showed a trend of improvement similar to that of the decreased rate of clinical involvement (Fig. 3 e).

When evaluating the domain scores in the OnyCOE‐t questionnaire for the day of initiation and the end (discontinuation) of EFCZ therapy based on the subjects' responses to the questionnaire, a trend of improvement was observed in the scores for symptom frequency, symptom bothersomeness, appearance problems, physical activities problems, overall problem and stigma. The treatment satisfaction score was 77.0 ± 24.4 at the end (discontinuation) of treatment (Table 3).

Changes in QOL score (OnyCOE‐t)

Safety

Within 72 weeks, 30 patients exhibited serious adverse events, which had no causal relationship with EFCZ therapy. Of the 128 adverse events observed, 14 occurring in 14 subjects (6.4%) were adverse drug reactions, confirming a causal relationship with EFCZ therapy. Of these events, 11 cases (5.0%) were of contact dermatitis, two cases (0.9%) were of application site irritation and one case (0.5%) was application site erythema, without any systemic adverse drug reactions observed. All of these events were not serious, with resolution or recovery as the final outcome (Table 4).

Secondary efficacy end‐points

Changes over time in complete cure rate

Complete cure was defined as a 0% clinical involvement of the target nail, with a negative potassium hydroxide examination result.

Changes over time in mycological cure rate

Mycological cure was defined as a negative result in the potassium hydroxide examination of the target nail.

Changes over time in the decrease rate of clinical involvement

Calculated using the following formula:

Decreased rate of clinical involvement = (clinical involvement at baseline − clinical involvement after application of EFCZ) / clinical involvement at baseline × 100

As for the analysis items, efficacy was classified as follows to calculate the number of subjects and efficacy rate: 75% or more, "remarkably improved"; 50% or more and less than 75%, "improved"; 25% or more and less than 50%, "moderately improved"; 0% or more and less than 25%, "unchanged"; and less than 0%, "aggravated".

Changes over time in clinical involvement

Calculated using the following formula:

Changes in clinical involvement = clinical involvement at baseline − clinical involvement after application of EFCZ.

Changes in the increase rate of the unaffected nail area over time

The change in the increase rate of the unaffected nail area over time was defined as the rate of the "amount of increase in the unaffected nail area from before to after EFCZ application" against "the unaffected area at baseline" of the target nail, calculated with the following formula:

Increased rate of unaffected nail area✱ = (unaffected nail area after application of EFCZ − unaffected nail area at baseline) / unaffected nail area at baseline × 100

*Unaffected nail area = 100 − clinical involvement

The above‐mentioned analysis items were classified into categories (≥ 75%, ≥ 50% and < 75%, ≥ 25% and < 50%, ≥ 0% and < 25%, and < 0%), and the number of subjects and rate were calculated.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^19909349]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

One of the new findings of our study is the evaluation of the complete cure rate in patients with long‐term treatment for more than 48 weeks. Severe cases have been reported to require a longer treatment duration, but the evaluation of EFCZ use for more than 48 weeks had been unclear. 15, 16 Considering that the treatment success rate increased until week 72 after starting EFCZ application, the clinical significance of continuing the application beyond 1 year was indicated. The complete cure rates at weeks 48 and 52 in the Japanese group in the multinational phase III study were 20.1% and 28.8%, respectively, which were almost the same as our results of 19.6% and 26.5% at weeks 48 and 60, respectively. Moreover, the rate in our study increased to 31.1% at week 72, indicating the benefit of continuing EFCZ application for more than 1 year. In fact, 121 subjects (55.3%), more than half of the enrolled subjects, continued EFCZ application to week 72, of whom 10 achieved complete cure. Generally, the factors associated with complete cure included not only fungal infection in the nail but also the growth rate of the nail. Considering that the duration until toenails are completely replaced with new growth is mostly 1 year or even longer for elderly or thickened nails, it is not an easy goal to achieve. Nevertheless, we observed many patients who attained cure after using EFCZ for over 1 year, which suggests that more patients would achieve complete cure with longer therapy. Improvement of the mycological cure rate was observed earlier than that of the treatment success rate, reaching 50.7% at week 36 and even 55.3% at week 72. In the patient population with an affected area of more than 50%, mycological cure was obtained in 47.5% of the subjects at week 72, which is expected for high antifungal activity, even in severe cases. Mycological cure in severe cases was newly achieved even at week 72, suggesting the possible efficacy by further long‐term treatment. However, outcomes from our study are limited and thus future reports are expected.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^f8fd70f4]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Another finding in our study is that the therapeutic effect was examined for severe cases with an affected area of more than 50%, which was not sufficiently evaluated in the multinational phase III clinical study. The treatment success rate in the subjects with severe onychomycosis with more than 50% affected area was 31.3% at week 48 and 36.3% at week 72, showing continuous improvement over time. Changes in the affected area started to increase from week 12 after starting the application, and at the final assessment, the changes in the affected area from the start of application was 49.7%. This indicates that the affected area in the subjects with more than 50% affected area continuously improved over time with EFCZ application. As for the decreased rate in the affected area, the proportion of subjects in whom the treatment was determined to be effective or better was almost the same in the group with affected areas of 20–50% and the group with affected areas of more than 50% at week 72, indicating the high efficacy of EFCZ regardless of severity. Limited to severe cases, the treatment success rate was 36.3% at week 72, but considering the 47.5% mycological cure rate and changes in nail growth, further improvement can be expected by continuous application. Noguchi et al. 6 also reported that efinaconazole was effective regardless of age, disease severity and clinical type when administrated alone in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases, consistent with the conclusions in our study.

### Drug synergies and the potential for combination therapy in onychomycosis [^acb28a9b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Synergy between antifungal drugs is well recognized. However, combinations of antifungals are yet to be widely adopted to treat onychomycosis. The rationale for the combination of topical and oral therapy in the treatment of onychomycosis is that the systemic antifungal reaches the infection area via the nail bed and the topical agent is absorbed through the nail surface. The combination of antifungals used should ideally be synergistic in their mode of action. Synergy between amorolfine and other antifungals has been demonstrated in vitro. This is presumably due to differences in the precise point of action of the drugs on the fungal cell membrane, where they inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol. Thus, combinations can result in increased antifungal activity at lower concentrations of both drugs. The potential exists therefore for combinations of antifungals to achieve higher cure rates in onychomycosis, in a shorter time than is currently possible. This approach warrants further investigation.

Regarding specific circumstances for onychomycosis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to offer itraconazole (pulse therapy 5 mg/kg/day for 1 week per month, 2 pulses for fingernail infection and 3 pulses for toenail infection) as first-line therapy in pediatric (aged 1–12 years) patients with dermatophyte onychomycosis. Monitor hepatic function tests in patients with pre-existing deranged results, receiving continuous therapy for > 1 month, or concomitant use of hepatotoxic drugs.

Regarding specific circumstances for onychomycosis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to consider offering fluconazole (3–6 mg/kg once weekly for 12–16 weeks for fingernail infection and 18–26 weeks for toenail infection) as second-line therapy if itraconazole and terbinafine contraindicated or not tolerated in pediatric (aged 1–12 years) patients with dermatophyte onychomycosis. Obtain baseline LFTs and CBC. Monitor LFTs in high-dose or prolonged therapy and in patients at risk because of concomitant hepatotoxic drug use.

### Antifungal therapy for onychomycosis in children [^13919e90]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a chronic infection of the nail unit, and its prevalence increases with age. Treatment options for children are similar to those for adults and include both oral and topical therapies. Oral agents, such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole have been reported to have good efficacy and a low rate of side effects in children. Topical therapies, such as amorolfine and ciclopirox, can also be used as monotherapy or combined with oral agents to treat onychomycosis. Due to their thinner, faster-growing nails, children are more likely to respond to topical monotherapy than adults. There is currently insufficient data comparing emerging medical devices, such as laser therapy, with standard therapeutic options to recommend their use in children.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^ad012dae]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

However, in clinical practise, EFCZ may be used in cases exceeding the study criteria, namely more severe cases with more than 50% clinical involvement or with long‐term use for over 1 year. 6 Therefore, it is meaningful to obtain information on the efficacy and safety of EFCZ when used in severe cases or applied for over 48 weeks to provide findings for clinical medicine.

Our study was conducted to examine the efficacy of EFCZ by daily application for up to 72 weeks in patients with onychomycosis with 20% or more clinical involvement of the nails, including severe cases. As for the impact of EFCZ on patient QOL, only one report so far has used OnyCOE‐tTM, 7 which is a QOL questionnaire regarding onychomycosis. So far, no similar study has been conducted in the Japanese population, and thus we decided to include this as one of the aims of our study.

### Fingertip injuries [^55136090]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Fingertip injuries — nail fold splinting after nail plate removal or avulsion is described as controversial because there is concern for infection when native nail is used; various techniques are used including using the original nail plate, sterile foil, petrolatum and bismuth tribromophenate–impregnated gauze (Xeroform), or petrolatum gauze; if a splint is used, it should be kept in place for 2 to 3 weeks to allow for formation of a new nail plate, and physicians should educate patients that full nail growth can take up to 6 months.
