## Question

onset of action for dutasteride

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the onset of action for dutasteride, specifically when it starts to work for conditions like BPH and androgenetic alopecia, and how early pharmacodynamic changes relate to noticeable improvements in symptoms or hair growth. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacodynamic onset of DHT suppression. Then, I should verify when symptom improvements in BPH become statistically significant. Next, I will examine the onset of hair growth effects in androgenetic alopecia. After that, I need to consider how combination therapy with an alpha-blocker changes the perceived onset. Finally, I should integrate pharmacokinetics and guideline counseling to frame expectations and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacodynamic onset of action. Dutasteride produces a rapid and profound reduction in serum DHT, with median DHT decreased by about 85% after 1 week and about 90% after 2 weeks of 0.5 mg daily dosing, indicating near-maximal suppression of circulating DHT within 1–2 weeks, which is mechanistically consistent with its dual inhibition of type 1 and type 2 5-alpha-reductase and its very slow dissociation from the enzyme complex [^1149w9AT] [^115TCogw] [^114pYVbC].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical onset for BPH symptoms, because pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes are not identical. In the pivotal BPH trials, statistically significant improvements in symptom scores (AUA-SI/IPSS) were observed as early as 3 months in one trial and by 12 months in the others, with pooled differences versus placebo of about −1.3 points at 12 months and about −2.1 points at 24 months, and these benefits were durable in extensions, which aligns with the time needed for prostate volume reduction and remodeling to translate into symptom relief [^115ukgUR] [^1131kUeG].

> Hold on, I should verify the prostate volume data to ensure the timeline is coherent. Significant reductions in prostate volume were detectable by 1–3 months and continued through 24 months, with mean decreases around 24.7% at 12 months and 26.7% at 24 months versus placebo, which supports the idea that structural changes underpin the clinical symptom onset seen around 3–12 months [^111YBfBW] [^117F58mB].

> I need to check the hair-loss onset next. For androgenetic alopecia, randomized data show that dutasteride 0.5 mg improves hair count and width by 24 weeks (about 6 months), with dose-dependent effects across lower doses, so clinically meaningful hair growth typically emerges by 6 months, even though DHT suppression is near-maximal within 1–2 weeks, reflecting the hair cycle kinetics and time to visible regrowth [^1145EZiV].

> But wait, what if faster symptom relief is needed in BPH? Combination therapy with tamsulosin provides earlier improvement because alpha-1 blockade relaxes smooth muscle immediately. In CombAT, combination therapy separated from both monotherapies by Month 9 and maintained superiority through Month 48, which is why guidelines often pair an alpha-blocker with a 5-ARI when rapid relief is desired or prostate size is larger, even though the 5-ARI's disease-modifying effects accrue more slowly [^112EEGj3] [^1171mA2a] [^117VortW].

> Let me consider pharmacokinetics to ensure the time course makes sense. Dutasteride has a terminal half-life of about 5 weeks and reaches approximately 65% of steady state by 1 month and about 90% by 3 months, which helps explain why clinical effects continue to accumulate over months even after early DHT suppression, and why serum dutasteride remains detectable for 4–6 months after discontinuation, which has implications for washout and persistence of effect [^114VsGPV].

> I should confirm guideline framing for patient counseling. The AUA advises that 5-ARIs have a slow onset and that patients should be counseled accordingly. Improvements of about 3–4 points on symptom scores are expected and maintained over long-term follow-up, and combination therapy can be used when faster relief is needed, with the option to withdraw the alpha-blocker in some patients once the 5-ARI effect is established, though evidence for withdrawal strategies is limited [^115m2bqC] [^117VortW].

> Putting this together, I should double-check the bottom line. The pharmacodynamic onset of dutasteride is within 1–2 weeks for DHT suppression, but clinically meaningful onset is use-dependent: for BPH, expect significant symptom improvement by about 3 months in some trials and by 12 months consistently, with continued gains thereafter; for androgenetic alopecia, expect visible hair improvements by about 6 months; and for faster LUTS relief, combine with an alpha-blocker, which yields earlier separation by around 9 months while the 5-ARI's disease-modifying benefits accumulate [^1149w9AT] [^115ukgUR] [^1145EZiV] [^112EEGj3].

---

Dutasteride has a **slow onset of action**, with clinically meaningful symptom improvement typically beginning at **3–6 months** and continuing to accrue through 12–24 months. This delayed onset reflects the time required for prostate shrinkage and remodeling; early pharmacodynamic DHT suppression occurs within 1–2 weeks, but clinical benefits lag behind biochemical changes. For faster relief, consider **combination therapy with an alpha-blocker** (e.g. tamsulosin), which provides earlier symptom improvement while dutasteride's disease-modifying effects mature [^115m2bqC] [^113jAkZu].

---

## Pharmacodynamic onset of action

- **DHT suppression**: Dutasteride rapidly inhibits both type 1 and type 2 5-alpha-reductase, reducing serum DHT by ~85% at 1 week and ~90% at 2 weeks [^1149w9AT] [^115TCogw].

- **Intraprostatic DHT**: Prostatic DHT falls by ~83% at 2 weeks and ~90–93% by 1–4 months, indicating early tissue-level changes [^116qjiTA].

- **Testosterone changes**: Serum testosterone rises modestly (~19–26%) but remains within physiologic range, reflecting reduced DHT conversion [^1149w9AT] [^115TCogw].

---

## Clinical onset of action

- **Symptom improvement**: Significant AUA-SI/IPSS reductions are typically seen by 3–6 months, with continued improvement through 12–24 months [^115ukgUR] [^1131kUeG].

- **Prostate volume reduction**: Statistically significant volume reductions are evident by 1–3 months and progress through 24 months [^111YBfBW] [^117F58mB].

- **Peak flow (Qmax)**: Improvements in urinary flow generally emerge by 3–6 months and continue through 24 months [^115osAQT].

---

## Factors influencing onset of action

Several factors influence the **onset of action** of dutasteride:

| **Factor** | **Influence on onset of action** |
|-|-|
| Baseline prostate size | Larger prostates (> 40 cc) may show earlier and more pronounced volume reduction and symptom improvement [^112NXiw7] |
| Age | Older patients may experience a slower onset due to reduced metabolic clearance and altered pharmacokinetics [^notfound] |
| Comorbidities | Cardiovascular or metabolic conditions may delay onset or blunt response |
| Concomitant medications | Alpha-blockers (e.g. tamsulosin) can accelerate symptom relief when combined with dutasteride [^113jAkZu] |

---

## Comparison with other 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors

Compared with finasteride, dutasteride achieves greater DHT suppression (~90% vs ~70%) and may yield faster and larger prostate-volume reductions, though both agents have similar clinical onset timelines for symptom improvement [^1142mnrw]. Clinically, dutasteride and finasteride show comparable efficacy in symptom and flow improvement, with dutasteride potentially offering a modest advantage in volume reduction due to its dual 5-ARI inhibition [^11497J3P] [^1142mnrw].

---

## Clinical implications and patient counseling

Patients should be counseled that **symptom relief is gradual**, typically beginning at 3–6 months and continuing to 12–24 months; adherence is essential to realize full benefits. For faster relief, consider combination therapy with an alpha-blocker (e.g. tamsulosin), which provides earlier symptom improvement while dutasteride's disease-modifying effects accrue [^112EEGj3] [^113jAkZu]. Regular follow-up should monitor symptom trajectories, PSA changes, and adverse effects, with therapy individualized to response and tolerability [^112XPggx].

---

Dutasteride's clinical onset is **delayed relative to its biochemical effects**, with meaningful symptom improvement typically emerging by 3–6 months and accruing through 12–24 months. Early DHT suppression occurs within 1–2 weeks, but prostate remodeling and symptom relief require months; combination therapy with an alpha-blocker can expedite symptom control while dutasteride's disease-modifying benefits mature [^1149w9AT] [^115ukgUR] [^112EEGj3].

The 5-α reductase inhibitors

Rationale and benefits

By far the most promising and well-studied chemopreventive agents are the 5-ARIs finasteride and dutasteride. The 5-α reductase (5-AR) enzyme is responsible for converting testosterone into dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone is a prevalent and potent androgen in prostate tissue and is responsible for embryologic development of the prostate, growth of the prostate and promotion of prostate cancer. Finasteride inhibits 5-AR type 2, and dutasteride inhibits 5-AR types 1 and 2. Both finasteride and dutasteride were designed and approved for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and have proven efficacy in this regard.

Finasteride was studied in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). In this RCT of 18,000 men ≥ 55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination (DRE) and PSA level ≤ 3 ng/mL, after seven years, those in the finasteride arm had a 25% reduction in prostate cancer incidence (18.4% vs. 24.4%; P < 0.001). Dutasteride was studied in the REduction by DUtasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial. In this RCT of 6,729 men ages 50 to 75 years with a prior negative prostate biopsy who had at least one on-study biopsy, those in the dutasteride arm had a 23% reduction in prostate cancer incidence after four years (19.9% vs. 25.1%; P < 0.001). The two trials are compared in Table 1. These risk reductions translate into a number needed to treat to prevent one case of prostate cancer of 17 for finasteride and 20 for dutasteride. If the story ended there, many men would undoubtedly be taking a 5-ARI drug today.

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^116JYjho]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dutasteride is a 5α‐reductase inhibitor (5‐ARI) used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and male androgenetic alopecia (AGA). Treatment with 5‐ARI, including dutasteride and finasteride, in men has been associated with adverse events (AE) related to sexual function, such as impotence (erectile dysfunction) and decreased libido. 1 There have been reports of persistent, irreversible sexual AE with finasteride 2, 3, 4 but causality remains uncertain and it is unknown whether this also occurs with dutasteride. Furthermore, sexual AE with dutasteride are not well‐characterized in men with AGA, who are generally younger (aged 18–50 years) than men with BPH (generally aged ≥ 45 years).

This study assessed sexual AE following dutasteride treatment over 24 and 48 weeks in men with AGA.

### Effect of dutasteride on clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia in asymptomatic men with enlarged prostate: a post hoc analysis of the REDUCE study [^116x1678]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Methods

The REDUCE study was designed to assess the efficacy of dutasteride in decreasing the incidence of biopsy-detected prostate cancer over a four year period in men at increased risk of prostate cancer. Participants were randomised to placebo or dutasteride 0.5 mg daily. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the original publication. This secondary analysis was prompted by the uniqueness of this dataset to answer the relatively common scenario: "How should I manage an asymptomatic man with an enlarged prostate?" This analysis aims to assess the benefit of dutasteride in men with mild or no urinary symptoms and enlarged prostates to prevent clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The population assessed in this study includes participants randomised to both trial arms who had an International Prostate Severity Scale (IPSS) score < 8 and a prostate size 40–80 mL on initial transrectal ultrasound (men with a prostate size of > 80 mL were excluded from the original study). Subjects were excluded if they were taking any prostate related medications.

IPSS questionnaires were completed at baseline and at six-month intervals during the study. Urinary flow rates were measured at study entry (patients with a flow rate < 5 ml/sec were excluded from the study) and in selected centres during follow-up. Clinical events — including acute urinary retention, prostate surgery related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, and urinary tract infection — were reported on case report forms every six months, and adverse events were assessed every three months during the study. All episodes of acute urinary retention were documented along with their cause (such as related to benign prostatic hyperplasia).

Similar to the major landmark trialsand a Cochrane review, we used a composite index of clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia as our primary end point. Participants who experienced urinary retention related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary tract infection, or symptom deterioration of IPSS score ≥ 4 points during the study were considered to have clinically progressed. A change in IPSS score of ≥ 4 has been shown to correspond to a change in patients' global feeling of urination which is clinically meaningfuland been used in several large trials of benign prostatic hyperplasia. We also assessed adverse events between groups.

### Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules (dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride) [^111dTR1q]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are a combination of 2 drugs with different mechanisms of action to improve symptoms in patients with BPH: dutasteride, a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, and tamsulosin, an antagonist of alpha1A-adrenoreceptors.

Dutasteride

Dutasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone to DHT. DHT is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, which exists as 2 isoforms, type 1 and type 2. The type 2 isoenzyme is primarily active in the reproductive tissues, while the type 1 isoenzyme is also responsible for testosterone conversion in the skin and liver.

Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both type 1 and type 2 5-alpha-reductase isoenzymes, with which it forms a stable enzyme complex. Dissociation from this complex has been evaluated under in vitro and in vivo conditions and is extremely slow. Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor.

Tamsulosin

Smooth muscle tone is mediated by the sympathetic nervous stimulation of alpha1-adrenoceptors, which are abundant in the prostate, prostatic capsule, prostatic urethra, and bladder neck. Blockade of these adrenoceptors can cause smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate to relax, resulting in an improvement in urine flow rate and a reduction in symptoms of BPH.

Tamsulosin, an alpha1-adrenoceptor blocking agent, exhibits selectivity for alpha1-receptors in the human prostate. At least 3 discrete alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes have been identified: alpha1A, alpha1B, and alpha1D; their distribution differs between human organs and tissue. Approximately 70% of the alpha1-receptors in human prostate are of the alpha1Asubtype. Tamsulosin is not intended for use as an antihypertensive.

### Dutasteride [^111qCNrD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

In volunteer trials, single doses of dutasteride up to 40 mg (80 times the therapeutic dose) for 7 days have been administered without significant safety concerns. In a clinical trial, daily doses of 5 mg (10 times the therapeutic dose) were administered to 60 subjects for 6 months with no additional adverse effects to those seen at therapeutic doses of 0.5 mg.

There is no specific antidote for dutasteride. Therefore, in cases of suspected overdosage, symptomatic and supportive treatment should be given as appropriate, taking the long half-life of dutasteride into consideration.

### Effect of dutasteride on clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia in asymptomatic men with enlarged prostate: a post hoc analysis of the REDUCE study [^112qMPAp]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

This study is the first to explore the benefit of treating asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic men with enlarged prostates. In this cohort, dutasteride significantly decreased the incidence of clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia over four years, with a relative risk reduction of over 50% and an acceptable side effect profile. This post-hoc analysis generates questions on whether 5α-reductase inhibitors should be discussed as preventive treatment for patients with an enlarged prostate.

### Dutasteride (Avodart) [^1131kUeG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Subjects receiving dutasteride achieved statistically significant improvement in symptoms versus placebo by Month 3 in 1 trial and by Month 12 in the other 2 pivotal trials. At Month 12, the mean decrease from baseline in AUA‑SI total symptom scores across the 3 trials pooled was ‑3.3 units for dutasteride and ‑2.0 units for placebo with a mean difference between the 2 treatment groups of ‑1.3 (range: ‑1.1 to ‑1.5 units in each of the 3 trials, P < 0.001) and was consistent across the 3 trials. At Month 24, the mean decrease from baseline was ‑3.8 units for dutasteride and ‑1.7 units for placebo with a mean difference of -2.1 (range: ‑1.9 to ‑2.2 units in each of the 3 trials, P < 0.001). See Figure 1. The improvement in BPH symptoms seen during the first 2 years of double‑blind treatment was maintained throughout an additional 2 years of open‑label extension trials.

These trials were prospectively designed to evaluate effects on symptoms based on prostate size at baseline. In men with prostate volumes ≥ 40 cc, the mean decrease was -3.8 units for dutasteride and -1.6 units for placebo, with a mean difference between the 2 treatment groups of -2.2 at Month 24. In men with prostate volumes < 40 cc, the mean decrease was -3.7 units for dutasteride and -2.2 units for placebo, with a mean difference between the 2 treatment groups of -1.5 at Month 24.

### 5-α reductase inhibitors and prostate cancer prevention: where do we turn now? [^115yuhy9]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

With the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer so great, an effective chemopreventive agent could have a profound impact on the lives of men. Despite decades of searching for such an agent, physicians still do not have an approved drug to offer their patients. In this article, we outline current strategies for preventing prostate cancer in general, with a focus on the 5-α-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) finasteride and dutasteride. We discuss the two landmark randomized, controlled trials of finasteride and dutasteride, highlighting the controversies stemming from the results, and address the issue of 5-ARI use, including reasons why providers may be hesitant to use these agents for chemoprevention. We further discuss the recent US Food and Drug Administration ruling against the proposed new indication for dutasteride and the change to the labeling of finasteride, both of which were intended to permit physicians to use the drugs for chemoprevention. Finally, we discuss future directions for 5-ARI research.

### Dutasteride (Avodart) [^111YBfBW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effect on Prostate Volume

A prostate volume of at least 30 cc measured by transrectal ultrasound was required for trial entry. The mean prostate volume at trial entry was approximately 54 cc.

Statistically significant differences (AVODART versus placebo) were noted at the earliest post-treatment prostate volume measurement in each trial (Month 1, Month 3, or Month 6) and continued through Month 24. At Month 12, the mean percent change in prostate volume across the 3 trials pooled was -24.7% for dutasteride and -3.4% for placebo; the mean difference (dutasteride minus placebo) was -21.3% (range: -21.0% to -21.6% in each of the 3 trials, P < 0.001). At Month 24, the mean percent change in prostate volume across the 3 trials pooled was -26.7% for dutasteride and -2.2% for placebo with a mean difference of -24.5% (range: ‑24.0% to ‑25.1% in each of the 3 trials, P < 0.001). See Figure 4. The reduction in prostate volume seen during the first 2 years of double-blind treatment was maintained throughout an additional 2 years of open‑label extension trials.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^117VortW]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) combination therapy — In an Asian cohort using a 0.2 mg tamsulosin dose, men with characteristics of disease progression had better symptomatic benefit from combination therapy than tamsulosin monotherapy, with a 24-month study reporting more prominent improvements in maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) and prostate volume reduction and reductions in the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) and BPH related surgery; another study found that initial combination dutasteride and tamsulosin improved quality of life compared to later initiation of tamsulosin after disease progression; Providers may start combination therapy with the intention of later discontinuing the alpha blocker (sometimes called "Withdrawal Therapy"). While this is a reasonable strategy, the concept has not been studied rigorously, and there are insufficient data to gauge the utility of this approach or the duration at which combination therapy should be continued before cessation of the alpha blocker. As stated previously, providers do not need to obtain a PSA solely for determination of 5-ARI efficacy as part combination therapy, although knowledge of a pre-existing value may help guide treatment options.

### Dutasteride (Avodart) [^114VsGPV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dutasteride and its metabolites were excreted mainly in feces. As a percent of dose, there was approximately 5% unchanged dutasteride (~1% to ~15%) and 40% as dutasteride-related metabolites (~2% to ~90%). Only trace amounts of unchanged dutasteride were found in urine (< 1%). Therefore, on average, the dose unaccounted for approximated 55% (range: 5% to 97%).

The terminal elimination half-life of dutasteride is approximately 5 weeks at steady state. The average steady-state serum dutasteride concentration was 40 ng/mL following 0.5 mg/day for 1 year. Following daily dosing, dutasteride serum concentrations achieve 65% of steady-state concentration after 1 month and approximately 90% after 3 months. Due to the long half-life of dutasteride, serum concentrations remain detectable (greater than 0.1 ng/mL) for up to 4 to 6 months after discontinuation of treatment.

Specific Populations

Pediatric Patients: Dutasteride pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in subjects younger than 18 years.

Geriatric Patients: No dose adjustment is necessary in the elderly. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dutasteride were evaluated in 36 healthy male subjects aged between 24 and 87 years following administration of a single 5‑mg dose of dutasteride. In this single‑dose trial, dutasteride half‑life increased with age (approximately 170 hours in men aged 20 to 49 years, approximately 260 hours in men aged 50 to 69 years, and approximately 300 hours in men older than 70 years). Of 2,167 men treated with dutasteride in the 3 pivotal trials, 60% were age 65 and over and 15% were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients.

### Dutasteride treatment over 2 years delays prostate-specific antigen progression in patients with biochemical failure after radical therapy for prostate cancer: results from the randomised, placebo-controlled avodart after radical therapy for prostate cancer study (ARTS) [^112MHa4t]. European Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after radical therapy are indicative of recurrent or residual prostate cancer (PCa). This biochemical recurrence typically predates clinically detectable metastatic disease by several years. Management of patients with biochemical recurrence is controversial.

Objective

To assess the effect of dutasteride on progression of PCa in patients with biochemical failure after radical therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 294 men from 64 centres across 9 European countries.

Intervention

The 5α-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

The primary end point was time to PSA doubling from start of randomised treatment, analysed by log-rank test stratified by previous therapy and investigative-site cluster. Secondary end points included time to disease progression and the proportion of subjects with disease progression.

Results and Limitations

Of the 294 subjects randomised (147 in each treatment group), 187 (64%) completed 24 mo of treatment and 107 discontinued treatment prematurely (71 [48%] of the placebo group, 36 [24%] of the dutasteride group). Dutasteride significantly delayed the time to PSA doubling compared with placebo after 24 mo of treatment (p < 0.001); the relative risk (RR) reduction was 66.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 50.35–76.90) for the overall study period. Dutasteride also significantly delayed disease progression (which included PSA- and non-PSA-related outcomes) compared with placebo (p < 0.001); the overall RR reduction in favour of dutasteride was 59% (95% CI, 32.53–75.09). The incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and AEs leading to study withdrawal were similar between the treatment groups. A limitation was that investigators were not blinded to PSA levels during the study.

Conclusions

Dutasteride delayed the biochemical progression of PCa in patients with biochemical failure after radical therapy for clinically localised disease. The safety and tolerability of dutasteride were generally consistent with previous experience.

### Finasteride (Proscar) [^116ttR6M]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection

In clinical studies, PROSCAR reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals.

For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking PROSCAR, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on PROSCAR may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with PROSCAR therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with PROSCAR for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with PROSCAR.

PROSCAR may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer.

The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of PROSCAR. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary.

5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer

Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA ≤ 3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8–10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia progression and its impact on treatment [^111XdQt3]. Current Opinion in Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Management of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia should reduce the lifetime risk of acute urinary retention and the need for benign prostatic hyperplasia-related surgery. A number of recent studies demonstrate that 5alpha-reductase inhibitors are unique in providing a long-term combination of improvements in symptoms and flow, and reductions in the risks of acute urinary retention and surgical intervention.

Recent Findings

The 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride was shown to reduce the risk of retention and surgery in men with large prostate volumes and/or high PSA. Recent studies have examined the role of adding an alpha1-blocker to 5alpha-reductase inhibitor in short- or long-term combination. The Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms study randomised 3,047 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia to treatment with a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride), an alpha1 blocker (doxazosin), a combination of both, or placebo. Only treatment arms containing 5alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy were associated with longer-term significant reductions in the risk of acute urinary retention and invasive therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Three randomised, two-year, placebo-controlled studies have assessed the clinical relevance of the > 93% DHT suppression provided by dutasteride. Dutasteride was also associated with a reduction in the risk of acute urinary retention of 57%, and a reduction of 48% in the risk of surgical intervention compared with placebo after 2 years.

Summary

Short-term combination of 5alpha-reductase inhibitor and alpha-blockade are optimal in providing symptomatic improvement among patients who require symptom relief, while enabling the initiation of 5alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy to reduce the risk of subsequent acute urinary retention or benign prostatic hyperplasia-related surgery in men who are at greater risk of disease progression.

### Dutasteride improves objective and subjective disease measures in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and modest or severe prostate enlargement [^111YWS39]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined whether the effect of dutasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia is influenced by baseline prostate volume using data from 3 phase III clinical trials.

Materials and Methods

Patients randomized to dutasteride or placebo in the double-blind portion of the phase III studies were eligible to receive 0.5 mg dutasteride daily in a 2-year open label extension in dutasteride/dutasteride and placebo/dutasteride groups. Patients were prospectively stratified according to baseline prostate volume 30 to less than 40 and 40 cc or greater.

Results

In patients treated with dutasteride throughout the study (dutasteride/dutasteride group) the mean reduction in prostate volume from baseline to month 48 was 30.3% in those with a baseline prostate volume of 30 to less than 40 cc and 26.2% in those with a prostate volume of 40 cc or greater. Mean improvements in peak urinary flow from baseline to month 48 were 2.7 mL per second regardless of baseline prostate volume. Improvements in the American Urological Association symptom index score were 6.3 in men with a prostate volume of 30 to less than 40 cc and 6.5 in those with a prostate volume of 40 cc or greater. No significant relationships between treatment effect and baseline prostate volume were observed for these parameters. In dutasteride/dutasteride treated patients the risk of acute urinary retention was decreased by 60% in those with a prostate volume of 30 to less than 40 cc and 55% in those with a prostate volume of 40 cc or greater vs values in placebo/dutasteride treated patients (p = 0.036 and < 0.001, respectively). The corresponding values for benign prostatic hyperplasia related surgery were 27% and 48% (p = 0.35 and < 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

This analysis demonstrates that dutasteride significantly improves objective (prostate volume and peak urinary flow) and subjective (symptom scores) measures even in patients with only a slightly enlarged prostate (30 to less than 40 cc). The risks of acute urinary retention and benign prostatic hyperplasia related surgery were decreased regardless of baseline prostate volume.

### Dutasteride [^115NzXPz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Monotherapy

Dutasteride 0.5 mg/day (n = 2,167) or placebo (n = 2,158) was evaluated in male subjects with BPH in three 2-year multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials, each with 2-year open-label extensions (n = 2,340). More than 90% of the trial population was white. Subjects were aged at least 50 years with a serum PSA ≥ 1.5 ng/mL and < 10 ng/mL and BPH diagnosed by medical history and physical examination, including enlarged prostate (≥ 30 cc) and BPH symptoms that were moderate to severe according to the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI). Most of the 4,325 subjects randomly assigned to receive either dutasteride or placebo completed 2 years of double-blind treatment (70% and 67%, respectively). Most of the 2,340 subjects in the trial extensions completed 2 additional years of open-label treatment (71%).

Effect on Symptom Scores

Symptoms were quantified using the AUA-SI, a questionnaire that evaluates urinary symptoms (incomplete emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia) by rating on a 0 to 5 scale for a total possible score of 35, with higher numerical total symptom scores representing greater severity of symptoms. The baseline AUA-SI score across the 3 trials was approximately 17 units in both treatment groups.

### 5-α reductase inhibitors and prostate cancer prevention: where do we turn now? [^1141Je49]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Future directions

Given the tremendous potential benefits of chemoprevention, there is logic in searching for a different role for 5-ARIs. Indeed, more derivative questions are still being addressed in trials. For example, investigators are studying whether short courses of finasteride improve the discriminating ability of PSA in prostate cancer screening or the cancer yield at repeat biopsy after a prior negative biopsy, as well as whether dutasteride prevents cancer in men with high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, a precursor lesion to prostate cancer. Aside from these trials, more work is needed to identify a subgroup of patients, using either clinical or genetic features, who are at increased risk of prostate cancer and/or are most likely to respond to 5-ARI therapy. Perhaps we can identify a genetic signature that predicts those prone to developing high-grade disease in the dihydrotestosterone-depleted prostate environment, and physicians could avoid using 5-ARIs in these men. Selective treatment in men without this signature would be "safer" in that it only reduces prostate cancer risk without increasing high-grade disease.

It may be that 5-ARIs are more appropriate for secondary prevention, that is, in preventing adverse outcomes in men who already have been diagnosed with cancer. The Reduction by Dutasteride of Clinical Progression Events in Expectant Management (ReDEEM) trial has now concluded. Presented only in abstract form to date, this study illustrated that in men with very low-risk prostate cancer treated with active surveillance, dutasteride reduced the time to pathologic or therapeutic progression by 38.9% (95% confidence interval 12.4 to 57.4; P = 0.007).

### What's new in therapy for male androgenetic alopecia? [^113u3VCe]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Male androgenetic alopecia is a common condition and represents a major concern for patients who experience this condition. While there are different treatments to stop hair loss and improve hair density, the 5-alpha reductase inhibitors have demonstrated to be effective in improving androgenetic alopecia in men and can maintain a positive response for many years. Oral finasteride 1 mg is a US FDA-approved option, but dutasteride 0.5 mg has been proven to induce better responses, especially in the frontal area. Both have been shown to be safe in clinical trials but there is widespread concern about sexual adverse effects among patients. The use of topical finasteride has increased during the last few years as a useful option to avoid systemic therapy. The efficacy of topical finasteride 0.25% daily has been demonstrated in clinical trials, with a less marked decrease in serum dihydrotestosterone levels than with oral intake. Mesotherapy with dutasteride has also become more widespread recently, although evidence of its effectiveness is limited to retrospective studies in real clinical practice. The use of oral minoxidil in androgenetic alopecia has not been approved by the FDA, however several clinical studies have shown that it is an effective treatment option. The initial dose recommended to treat male hair loss is 2.5 mg daily, although the dose is frequently increased to 5 mg daily. The main adverse effect of oral minoxidil is hypertrichosis, followed by dizziness or lower limb edema, which are much less common. Platelet-rich plasma is a non-pharmacological option to treat male androgenetic alopecia, with some clinical trials demonstrating an improvement in hair count after several months. Among the published studies, the main limitation to compare its efficacy is the heterogeneity of the procedure. The most frequent regimens propose treatment every 4 weeks for 3 months initially to assess the individual response. Another treatment alternative is the use of light devices with wavelengths of between 630 and 660 nm, known as low-level laser therapy. These devices can be used at home every day for 15–30 min. Their efficacy has been shown in a limited number of clinical trials; however, there is a lack of evidence about the efficacy of these devices compared with other medical options or as a complementary therapy in hair loss. The pipeline of potential new treatments for male androgenetic alopecia is strong. Pyrilutamide and GT20029 are being studied as topical antagonists of the androgen receptor, while cetirizine is another topical option with some initial promising results. Furthermore, according to isolated studies with heterogeneous treatment schemes, the use of botulinum toxin in the scalp might improve androgenetic alopecia, and lastly, scalp threading might increase the total hair count as growth factors are released during implantation.

### Dutasteride (Avodart) [^111x5PQw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Monotherapy

Over 4,300 male subjects with BPH were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5-mg daily doses of AVODART in 3 identical 2-year, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 3 treatment trials, each followed by a 2-year open-label extension. During the double-blind treatment period, 2,167 male subjects were exposed to AVODART, including 1,772 exposed for 1 year and 1,510 exposed for 2 years. When including the open-label extensions, 1,009 male subjects were exposed to AVODART for 3 years and 812 were exposed for 4 years. The population was aged 47 to 94 years (mean age: 66 years) and greater than 90% were white. Table 1 summarizes clinical adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of subjects receiving AVODART and at a higher incidence than subjects receiving placebo.

Long-term Treatment (Up to 4 Years)

High-grade Prostate Cancer: The REDUCE trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 8,231 men aged 50 to 75 years with a serum PSA of 2.5 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL and a negative prostate biopsy within the previous 6 months. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n = 4,126) or 0.5-mg daily doses of AVODART (n = 4,105) for up to 4 years. The mean age was 63 years and 91% were white. Subjects underwent protocol-mandated scheduled prostate biopsies at 2 and 4 years of treatment or had "for-cause biopsies" at non-scheduled times if clinically indicated. There was a higher incidence of Gleason score 8–10 prostate cancer in men receiving AVODART (1.0%) compared with men on placebo (0.5%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 7-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride 5 mg, PROSCAR), similar results for Gleason score 8–10 prostate cancer were observed (finasteride 1.8% versus placebo 1.1%).

### Efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with the dual 5 α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride in men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia [^113PK9tD]. European Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Dutasteride, a dual inhibitor of Type 1 and Type 2 5 alpha-reductase, has been shown to improve disease measures in patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in three randomised, placebo-controlled, large-scale, 2-year Phase III clinical studies. This paper reports the pooled results of a 2-year open-label extension of the three randomised studies assessing the long-term efficacy and safety of dutasteride.

Methods

Patients randomised to dutasteride or placebo in the double-blind portion of the Phase III studies were eligible for a 2-year open-label extension, where all patients received dutasteride 0.5mg daily (dutasteride/dutasteride [D/D] group and placebo/dutasteride [P/D group]).

Results

Significant improvements in AUA-SI score and Q(max) were observed from Month 24 to 48 in both study groups. At Month 48, patients in the D/D group had significantly greater improvements in AUA-SI score and Q(max), and significantly greater reductions in prostate volume, than those in the P/D group. Acute urinary retention and BPH-related surgery occurred in a small percentage of patients during the open-label phase. No new safety issues were noted with long-term therapy. Onset of new drug-related adverse events were reported most frequently at the start of therapy and declined over time in patients receiving dutasteride.

Conclusions

Long-term treatment with dutasteride results in continuing improvements in urinary symptoms and flow rate, and further reductions in TPV, in men with symptomatic BPH. The reduction in risk of AUR and BPH-related surgery, seen in the double-blind phase, was durable over 4-year treatment. Dutasteride was also well tolerated in long-term use.

### Alpha-blocker therapy can be withdrawn in the majority of men following initial combination therapy with the dual 5 α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride [^113jAkZu]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The Symptom Management After Reducing Therapy (SMART-1) study examined the combination of the dual action 5alpha-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) dutasteride, and alpha(1)-blocker tamsulosin, followed by withdrawal of tamsulosin in men with symptomatic BPH.

Methods

327 BPH patients were randomised to 0.5mg dutasteride and 0.4 mg tamsulosin for 36 weeks (DT36) or 0.5 mg dutasteride and 0.4 mg tamsulosin for 24 weeks followed by dutasteride and tamsulosin matched placebo for the remaining 12 weeks (DT24+D12). Patients' assessment of their symptoms, IPSS at weeks 24, 30, and drug safety were evaluated.

Results

77% of DT24+D12 patients felt the same/better at week 30 compared with week 24 (changes in IPSS were consistent with this finding). Of those subjects with an IPSS < 20 who changed to dutasteride monotherapy at week 24, 84% switched without a noticeable deterioration in their symptoms. In the 27% of men with severe baseline symptoms (IPSS ≥ 20) who had withdrawal of tamsulosin therapy at week 24, 42.5% reported a worsening of their symptoms compared with 14% in the DT36 group. The regimens were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Dutasteride can be used in a 24-week combination with tamsulosin, to achieve rapid onset of symptom relief in patients at risk of underlying disease progression. This symptom relief is maintained in the majority of patients after the alpha(1)-blocker is removed from the combination. Patients with severe symptoms may benefit from longer-term combination therapy.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) dutasteride — sexual adverse events: ED rates from the REDUCE trial were 9% versus 5.7% in the placebo group (ARD: 3.2%; 95%CI: 2.1, 4.4). At 2‑years, the CONDUCT trial reported that the incidence of ED was greater with dutasteride combined with tamsulosin compared with tamsulosin monotherapy at 8% versus 0% (ARD: 8%; 95%CI: 5, 10.7). Decreased semen volume and decreased or absent libido were also higher in men on dutasteride compared to placebo, and ejaculation failure was higher with combination dutasteride and 0.2mg tamsulosin versus 0.2mg tamsulosin alone (2.6% versus 0.3%; ARD: 2.3%; 95%CI: 0.4, 4.2).

### Dutasteride on benign prostatic hyperplasia: a meta-analysis on randomized clinical trials in 6460 patients [^113QoK9R]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the clinical effectiveness of dutasteride in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia by meta-analysis.

Materials and Methods

Several databases were searched from inception to June 2013 for prospective clinical studies comparing dutasteride vs placebo. The continuous outcomes of therapeutic efficacy included International Prostate Symptom Score/American Urological Association Symptom Index, maximum flow rate, total prostate volume, and acute urinary retention (AUR). The dichotomous outcomes included surgery risk and the rate of sexual dysfunction. The relative risk for dichotomous outcome and the weighted mean difference for continuous outcomes were estimated using fixed effects model.

Results

Four studies met the inclusion criteria and were included, in which a total of 6460 patients received dutasteride and 6475 received placebo treatment. The average symptom score was improved by 1.98 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.77–2.19 (P < .00001); the average maximum flow rate was increased by 1.16 mL/s with 95% CI 0.63–1.70 (P < .0001); the total prostate volume was reduced by 13.86 mL (95% CI 12.76–14.96; P < .00001); the odds ratio for AUR was 0.35 (95% CI 0.27–0.47; P < .00001). The major side effect for dutasteride was the increased rate of sexual dysfunction compared with placebo, with odds ratio of 0.41 (95% CI 0.31–0.54; P < .00001).

Conclusion

Dutasteride is highly effective in mitigating benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms and reducing the size of enlarged prostate and the risks of AUR and surgical intervention. However, dutasteride therapy is related to an increased rate of sexual dysfunction.

### The cardiovascular safety of dutasteride [^115D6qxj]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Randomized controlled trials suggest an increased risk of heart failure with dutasteride, which inhibits both the type 1 and type 2 isoforms of 5α-reductase. In contrast, no such association has been suggested for finasteride, which selectively inhibits the type 2 isoform. We investigated the risk of cardiovascular events among patients receiving dutasteride relative to finasteride.

Materials and Methods

We performed a population based cohort study of Ontario men 66 years old or older who commenced treatment with dutasteride or finasteride between October 1, 2005 and March 31, 2015. For each individual treated with dutasteride, we identified 1 treated with finasteride, matching on a propensity score and calendar quarter of treatment initiation to account for temporal changes in prescribing. The primary outcome was hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary analyses were done to examine acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for differences between groups.

Results

We studied 36,311 men who commenced dutasteride and 36,311 treated with finasteride. In the primary analysis, we found no difference in the risk of heart failure among patients receiving dutasteride relative to those receiving finasteride (adjusted HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88–1.08). Similarly, we found no difference in the risk of acute myocardial infarction (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82–1.08) or stroke (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88–1.20).

Conclusions

In this population based cohort study of more than 72,000 older men, dutasteride was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events relative to finasteride.

### Effect of dutasteride on clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia in asymptomatic men with enlarged prostate: a post hoc analysis of the REDUCE study [^112dhjHe]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analyses

Our power calculations — based on 792 experimental subjects and 825 control subjects, four years of follow-up, and prior data estimating median time to progression of about 14.9 years with placebo — indicated we are able to detect true hazard ratios (relative risks) of placebo versus dutasteride groups of 0.859 or 1.168 with 80% power and α = 0.05.

Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Student's t test and χ² tests were used to compare groups. A multivariable logistic regression assessed the effect of dutasteride on clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia adjusting for age and baseline variables (IPSS, prostate volume, post-void residual urine volume, and peak urinary flow rate). Further, we performed an analysis of time to first event. Symptomatic progression was defined as the time of the first of two consecutive measures of IPSS ≥ 4 points from the baseline IPSS score (after randomisation). This was done to reduce variation based on only one questionnaire and demonstrate a durable change in symptoms. IPSS questionnaires were administered every six months during the four year study. Cox proportional hazard ratios were used to compare groups.

### Effect of dutasteride on intraprostatic androgen levels in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer [^116qjiTA]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Dutasteride exerts its beneficial effects on the prostate through suppression of intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The aim of this analysis was to assess the effects of the approved dose of dutasteride (0.5 mg/d), given for 2 weeks to 4 months, on the serum and intraprostatic DHT and testosterone levels in 3 randomized studies.

Methods

Intraprostatic androgen levels were measured in benign prostatic tissue collected during transurethral resection of the prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia studies, n = 256) or radical prostatectomy (prostate cancer study, n = 51), performed after 2 weeks, or 1, 3, or 4 months of treatment with dutasteride or with placebo or surgery alone. The serum androgen levels were assessed at the same points during treatment. Data from the control groups were pooled to provide 1 comparison group.

Results

Dutasteride reduced the intraprostatic DHT levels by 83%, 90%, 92%, and 93% after 2 weeks and 1, 3, and 4 months of treatment, respectively, compared with placebo/surgery alone. Dutasteride reduced the serum DHT levels from baseline by 84% at 2 weeks and by approximately 90% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months compared with a 5.2% increase in the control group. The decrease in DHT levels with dutasteride was accompanied by a reciprocal increase in the serum and intraprostatic testosterone levels. However, the intraprostatic testosterone levels in the dutasteride groups generally remained lower than the intraprostatic DHT levels in the control group.

Conclusions

The results of our study have shown that dutasteride provides near-maximal suppression of both serum and intraprostatic DHT levels in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer at all points assessed.

### Dutasteride (Avodart) [^115TCogw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Dutasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone to DHT. DHT is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase, which exists as 2 isoforms, type 1 and type 2. The type 2 isoenzyme is primarily active in the reproductive tissues, while the type 1 isoenzyme is also responsible for testosterone conversion in the skin and liver.

Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both type 1 and type 2 5 alpha-reductase isoenzymes, with which it forms a stable enzyme complex. Dissociation from this complex has been evaluated under in vitro and in vivo conditions and is extremely slow. Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Effect on 5 Alpha-Dihydrotestosterone and Testosterone

The maximum effect of daily doses of dutasteride on the reduction of DHT is dose dependent and is observed within 1 to 2 weeks. After 1 and 2 weeks of daily dosing with dutasteride 0.5 mg, median serum DHT concentrations were reduced by 85% and 90%, respectively. In patients with BPH treated with dutasteride 0.5 mg/day for 4 years, the median decrease in serum DHT was 94% at 1 year, 93% at 2 years, and 95% at both 3 and 4 years. The median increase in serum testosterone was 19% at both 1 and 2 years, 26% at 3 years, and 22% at 4 years, but the mean and median levels remained within the physiologic range.

In patients with BPH treated with 5 mg/day of dutasteride or placebo for up to 12 weeks prior to transurethral resection of the prostate, mean DHT concentrations in prostatic tissue were significantly lower in the dutasteride group compared with placebo (784 and 5,793 pg/g, respectively, P < 0.001). Mean prostatic tissue concentrations of testosterone were significantly higher in the dutasteride group compared with placebo (2,073 and 93 pg/g, respectively, P < 0.001).

### Dutasteride: a dual 5-alpha reductase inhibitor for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111B5dRU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, drug interactions, and dosing recommendations of dutasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-February 2006) was conducted to extract human research data in the English language on dutasteride. Search terms included benign prostatic hyperplasia, dutasteride, and finasteride. The reference lists of articles identified through this search process, the manufacturer's Web site, and dutasteride prescribing information were also examined.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All published studies and clinical data from the manufacturer were included, with emphasis placed on randomized, controlled trials.

Data Synthesis

Dutasteride is approved for the treatment of symptomatic BPH in men with an enlarged prostate to improve urinary symptoms, reduce the risk of acute urinary retention, and reduce the need for BPH-related surgical interventions. Compared with placebo, dutasteride has been shown to significantly improve BPH symptoms, reduce the incidence of acute urinary retention and BPH-related surgery, and improve BPH-related quality of life. Few published data exist comparing dutasteride with finasteride. The most common adverse effects of dutasteride include ear, nose, and throat infection; malaise; headache; dizziness; and musculoskeletal pain.

Conclusions

Clinical trials, sponsored primarily by the manufacturer, have shown dutasteride to be an effective treatment of BPH compared with placebo and to likely possess efficacy similar to that of finasteride. Further studies are needed to gain a more clear understanding of any clinically significant differences between dutasteride and finasteride.

Objectives

To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of dutasteride, a dual type 1 and type 2 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, in the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia and associated lower urinary tract symptoms.

Methods

Data from two Phase IIIa multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of 2-year duration plus a 2-year open-label extension were pooled and analyzed. The entry criteria included age 50 years old or older, clinical diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate volume of 30 cm3 or greater, American Urological Association symptom score of 12 or greater, peak urinary flow rate of 15 mL/s or less, and prostate-specific antigen level of 1.5 ng/mL or greater but less than 10 ng/mL.

Results

A total of 2802 men were randomized into the double-blind phase of the two studies with 1908 patients (68%) completing the study. Of these, 1570 subjects were enrolled in the open-label phase, and 569 subjects received dutasteride for 48 months. Changes at the 48-month visit for dutasteride/dutasteride-treated subjects included improvement in prostate volume (-26.2%), American Urological Association Symptom Index (-6.1 points), and peak urinary flow rate (+2.8 mL/s). Changes for the placebo/dutasteride group included prostate volume (-20.7%), American Urological Association Symptom Index (-5.3 points), and peak urinary flow rate (+1.8 mL/s). Acute urinary retention and surgery occurred in a small percentage of subjects (less than 2% and less than 1%) in the open-label extension phase. Dutasteride was well tolerated with no statistically significant increase in drug-related adverse events during the open-label extension and no adverse laboratory trends.

Conclusions

Dual inhibition of 5-alpha-reductase with dutasteride provided sustained efficacy in subjects with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia treated for 48 months. Near-complete, long-term suppression of dihydrotestosterone (93% at 48 months) with dutasteride did not lead to an increase in adverse events compared with that reported in the 2-year period.

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^112vicHt]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment‐related AE during the DB period were reported by more participants in the dutasteride group (19%) than the placebo group (8%) (Table S2); the majority were associated with sexual function.

The incidence of sexual AE was approximately twofold higher in the dutasteride group (16%) than the placebo group (8%) during the DB period, but lower (5%) in the OL period. All sexual AE were mild to moderate in severity and considered treatment‐related. The onset of most sexual AE occurred within the first 3 months of dutasteride treatment.

Overall, 20 participants experienced one or more sexual AE: 14 participants during dutasteride treatment (nine DB and five OL), five with placebo and one after placebo was discontinued (Fig. 1, Table 1). Of note, nine out of ten impotence AE during the DB period were reported at a single study center (representing 56% of the 16 participants enrolled at that center) and four of six decreased libido AE were reported at a different center (representing 17% of 23 participants).

Table 1
Summary of special interest adverse events related to sexual function

Five participants entered the targeted follow‐up period. Four completed the follow up and were all receiving dutasteride when the sexual AE began. The frequency of sexual AE before treatment discontinuation was reported as "rarely" and the frequency after discontinuation was considered "intermittent". The AE resolved within 2–6 weeks after the last dutasteride dose. The fifth participant experienced a sexual AE nearly 3 months after discontinuing placebo; the AE was resolving at the time of study withdrawal.

### Safety and tolerability of the dual 5 α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^114KZMDM]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this paper is to examine safety and tolerability data from a number of recently completed clinical trials with the novel, dual 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride.

Methods

Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted on data for dutasteride 0.5 mg/day for drug-related adverse events, clinical laboratory test results, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels derived from four large, randomised, double-blind clinical trials (n = 5655). Further data were derived from a randomised, double-blind combination study of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day and tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day (n = 327), and several safety studies conducted in healthy volunteers.

Results

Data from two-year blinded clinical studies demonstrate that dutasteride is well tolerated, with a profile comparable with that of placebo. The exception is a modestly elevated incidence of impotence, decreased libido, ejaculation disorders, and gynaecomastia. Clinical laboratory test abnormalities were reported by < 1% of patients treated with dutasteride, and abnormal values occurred with similar frequency versus placebo-treated patients. In a healthy volunteer study, when dutasteride was administered daily for 1 year, it did not significantly affect bone metabolism markers, bone mineral density or lipid profiles. Dutasteride reduced total serum PSA concentrations by approximately 50% following 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment but had no effect on free-to-total PSA levels. The safety profile of dutasteride did not differ from that of finasteride in a large, parallel-group, comparator trial. Additionally, when dutasteride was used in combination with an alpha(1)-blocker, the drug-related adverse event profiles were as would be expected for the individual agents.

Conclusions

Considered together, these data demonstrate dutasteride to be well-tolerated.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The trial supporting the efficacy of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules was a 4-year multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial (CombAT trial) investigating the efficacy of the coadministration of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day and tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg/day (n = 1,610) compared with dutasteride alone (n = 1,623) or tamsulosin alone (n = 1,611). Subjects were aged at least 50 years with a serum PSA ≥ 1.5 ng/mL and < 10 ng/mL and BPH diagnosed by medical history and physical examination, including enlarged prostate (≥ 30 cc) and BPH symptoms that were moderate to severe according to the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the enrolled trial population was white. Approximately 52% of subjects had previous exposure to 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor or alpha-adrenergic antagonist treatment. Of the 4,844 subjects randomly assigned to receive treatment, 69% of subjects in the coadministration group, 67% in the dutasteride group, and 61% in the tamsulosin group completed 4 years of double-blind treatment.

Effect on Symptom Score

Symptoms were quantified using the first 7 questions of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). The baseline score was approximately 16.4 units for each treatment group. Coadministration therapy was statistically superior to each of the monotherapy treatments in decreasing symptom score at Month 24, the primary time point for this endpoint. At Month 24, the mean changes from baseline (± SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.2 (± 7.14) for the coadministration group, -4.9 (± 6.81) for dutasteride, and -4.3 (± 7.01) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between coadministration and dutasteride of -1.3 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -1.69, -0.86]), and between coadministration and tamsulosin of -1.8 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -2.23, -1.40]). A significant difference was seen by Month 9 and continued through Month 48. At Month 48 the mean changes from baseline (± SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.3 (± 7.40) for coadministration, -5.3 (± 7.14) for dutasteride, and -3.8 (± 7.74) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between coadministration and dutasteride of -0.96 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -1.40, -0.52]), and between coadministration and tamsulosin of -2.5 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -2.96, -2.07]).

Risk Summary

Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated for use in pregnancy because it may cause harm to the male fetus [see Contraindications (4)]. Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are not indicated for use in females.

Dutasteride, a component of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that prevents conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone necessary for normal development of male genitalia. Abnormalities in the genitalia of male fetuses are an expected physiological consequence of inhibition of this conversion. These results are similar to observations in male infants with genetic 5-alpha-reductase deficiency.

In animal reproduction studies, dutasteride inhibited normal development of external genitalia in male offspring when given to rats or rabbits during organogenesis at less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.5 mg daily, in the absence of maternal toxicity. At 15 times the MRHD, prolonged pregnancy, decreased reproductive organ weights, and delayed puberty in male offspring were observed in rats, with no-effect levels less than the MRHD of 0.5 mg daily. Increased placental weights in rabbits were also observed, with no-effect levels less than the MRHD of 0.5 mg daily (see Data).

Risk Summary

AVODART is contraindicated for use in pregnancy because it may cause harm to the male fetus [see Contraindications (4)]. AVODART is not indicated for use in women.

AVODART is a 5 alpha‑reductase inhibitor that prevents conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone necessary for normal development of male genitalia. Abnormalities in the genitalia of male fetuses is an expected physiological consequence of inhibition of this conversion. These results are similar to observations in male infants with genetic 5 alpha‑reductase deficiency.

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

In animal reproduction studies, dutasteride inhibited normal development of external genitalia in male offspring when given to rats or rabbits during organogenesis at less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.5 mg daily, in the absence of maternal toxicity. At 15 times the MRHD, prolonged pregnancy, decreased reproductive organ weights, and delayed puberty in male offspring were observed in rats, with no-effect levels less than the MRHD of 0.5 mg daily.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^114kwX3U]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) evidence appraisal: PFS is a controversial and poorly-defined constellation of chronic 5-ARI-induced sexual, physical, and psychological symptoms that putatively persist after discontinuation of the 5-ARI. Concerns regarding PFS prompted the FDA to amend the labels for 5-ARI with a warning of its risks, and the robustness of the data justifying this change, which is based on anecdotal patient-reported outcomes rather than prospective trials, remains unclear. Dutasteride, which has activity at more 5-ARI receptors than finasteride, has largely not been implicated, and dose response association with finasteride does not seem present as the 1mg dose has been more closely linked to PFS than the more potent 5mg dose. The significant increases in reporting after the first published reports of PFS in 2012 (with no signal before 2012) points towards stimulated reporting. In general, current data on PFS draw primarily from case reports rather than prospective trials, and it is the assessment of the Panel that much of these data are susceptible to bias. Overall, the existence of persistent sexual dysfunction following cessation of 5-ARI is currently not demonstrated by reliable scientific research; there are no properly designed studies that report a significant association, and if the Bradford-Hill criteria are applied, they do not support an inference of causality with neither a strong nor consistent association reported. As for biological gradient, it is difficult to understand how 1 mg of finasteride may cause persistence when the 5 mg dose of the same drug is much less likely, and DHT levels return to normal within four weeks after cessation of finasteride use, which implies no persistent effect through a mechanism involving suppressed serum DHT levels.

### The post-finasteride syndrome: possible etiological mechanisms and symptoms [^115PkHHr]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Finasteride and dutasteride, synthetic 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) are recommended in many guidelines for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms and alopecia despite a variety of side effects like sexual, neurological, psychiatric, endocrinological, metabolic and ophthalmological dysfunctions and the increased incidence of high grade prostate cancer. The sexual side effects are common during the use of the drug but in a small subgroup of patients, they can persist after stopping the drug. This so-called post-finasteride syndrome has serious implications for the quality of life without a clear etiology or therapy. Three types of 5α-reductases are present in many organs in- and outside the brain where they can be blocked by the two 5ARIs. There is increasing evidence that 5ARIs not only inhibit the conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the prostate and the scalp but also in many other tissues. The lipophilic 5ARIs can pass the blood-brain barrier and might block many other neurosteroids in the brain with changes in the neurochemistry and impaired neurogenesis. Further research and therapeutic innovations are urgently needed that might cure or relieve these side effects. More awareness is needed for physicians to outweigh these health risks against the benefits of 5ARIs.

### Effect of dutasteride on clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia in asymptomatic men with enlarged prostate: a post hoc analysis of the REDUCE study [^116sEVkv]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

The choice of treatment for symptomatic patients is often based on prostate size: α blocker monotherapy for patients with small prostates and combination therapy of 5α reductase inhibitors plus α blockers for patients with enlarged prostates. Obviously, asymptomatic men with small prostates do not require any treatment. However, it is not uncommon in clinical practice to encounter men with enlarged prostates but minimal lower urinary tract symptoms. These men are identified because of digital rectal examination or transrectal ultrasound findings for men with elevated prostate specific antigen levels. Because these patients have not been included in pivotal trials of treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, both the risk of clinical progression and the potential benefit of preventive treatment with 5α reductase inhibitors are unknown. The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) cancer prevention trialis a large multinational prospective randomised study that measured prostate volume and urinary symptoms at baseline and included men with minimal or no lower urinary tract symptoms. We can therefore use this dataset to determine if there is any role for 5α reductase inhibitors in the treatment of asymptomatic men with enlarged prostates.

Effect on Acute Urinary Retention or the Need for BPH-Related Surgery

After 4 years of treatment, combination therapy with AVODART and tamsulosin did not provide benefit over monotherapy with AVODART in reducing the incidence of AUR or BPH-related surgery.

Effect on Maximum Urine Flow Rate

The baseline Qmaxwas approximately 10.7 mL/sec for each treatment group. Combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the monotherapy treatments in increasing Qmaxat Month 24, the primary time point for this endpoint. At Month 24, the mean increases from baseline (± SD) in Qmaxwere 2.4 (± 5.26) mL/sec for combination, 1.9 (± 5.10) mL/sec for AVODART, and 0.9 (± 4.57) mL/sec for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between combination and AVODART of 0.5 mL/sec (P = 0.003; [95% CI: 0.17, 0.84]), and between combination and tamsulosin of 1.5 mL/sec (P < 0.001; [95% CI: 1.19, 1.86]). This difference was seen by Month 6 and continued through Month 24. See Figure 7.

Finasteride — symptom outcomes and counseling. Numerous robust analyses of randomized, placebo‑controlled trials have shown an improvement in standardized symptom scores superior to placebo, with improvements of 3 to 4 points observed and maintained for 6 to 10 years of follow‑up. Given the slow onset of action of this class, other medication classes may lead to more immediate relief, and patients should be counseled on a slower improvement in symptoms if men are treated with 5‑ARI alone.

### Dutasteride [^117F58mB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effect on Acute Urinary Retention and the Need for BPH-Related Surgery

Efficacy was also assessed after 2 years of treatment by the incidence of AUR requiring catheterization and BPH-related urological surgical intervention. Compared with placebo, dutasteride was associated with a statistically significantly lower incidence of AUR (1.8% for dutasteride versus 4.2% for placebo, P < 0.001; 57% reduction in risk, [95% CI: 38% to 71%]) and with a statistically significantly lower incidence of surgery (2.2% for dutasteride versus 4.1% for placebo, P < 0.001; 48% reduction in risk, [95% CI: 26% to 63%]). See Figures 2 and 3.

Effect on Prostate Volume

A prostate volume of at least 30 cc measured by transrectal ultrasound was required for trial entry. The mean prostate volume at trial entry was approximately 54 cc.

Statistically significant differences (dutasteride versus placebo) were noted at the earliest post-treatment prostate volume measurement in each trial (Month 1, Month 3, or Month 6) and continued through Month 24. At Month 12, the mean percent change in prostate volume across the 3 trials pooled was -24.7% for dutasteride and -3.4% for placebo; the mean difference (dutasteride minus placebo) was -21.3% (range: -21.0% to -21.6% in each of the 3 trials, P < 0.001). At Month 24, the mean percent change in prostate volume across the 3 trials pooled was -26.7% for dutasteride and -2.2% for placebo with a mean difference of -24.5% (range: -24.0% to -25.1% in each of the 3 trials, P < 0.001). See Figure 4. The reduction in prostate volume seen during the first 2 years of double-blind treatment was maintained throughout an additional 2 years of open-label extension trials.

### Dutasteride improves outcomes of benign prostatic hyperplasia when evaluated for prostate cancer risk reduction: secondary analysis of the REduction by DUtasteride of prostate cancer events (REDUCE) trial [^117KBbeJ]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of dutasteride versus placebo on the symptoms and associated complications of male lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) across a range of prostate volumes and BPH symptoms in men evaluated for prostate cancer risk reduction in the 4-year REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial.

Methods

REDUCE was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of prostate cancer risk reduction with daily dutasteride 0.5 mg or placebo. Eligible men were aged 50–75 years, with a prostate-specific antigen level of 2.5–10 ng/mL and a prostate volume of ≤ 80 cm3. The prespecified and post hoc analyses were performed on the incidence of acute urinary retention, BPH-related surgery, and urinary tract infections, as well as on changes in prostate volume, International Prostate Symptom Score, BPH Impact Index, and maximal urinary flow rate (Qmax).

Results

A total of 8122 men were included in the efficacy population. During the 4-year study, the International Prostate Symptom Score increased in placebo-treated patients, while dutasteride-treated patients had a stabilized or decreased International Prostate Symptom Score and improved BPH Impact Index and quality of life due to urinary symptom scores across all prostate volume quintiles (including prostate glands smaller than those studied in previous dutasteride trials). 48 months, the incidence of acute urinary retention or BPH-related surgery was significantly less in the dutasteride group (2.5%) than in the placebo group (9%) overall (P < .001) and in each baseline prostate volume quintile (P < .01).

Conclusion

During the 4-year study, dutasteride was associated with a decreased risk of BPH progression in men with mild-to-moderate symptoms and normal or enlarged prostates.

14.1 Monotherapy

AVODART 0.5 mg/day (n = 2,167) or placebo (n = 2,158) was evaluated in male subjects with BPH in three 2‑year multicenter, placebo‑controlled, double‑blind trials, each with 2‑year open‑label extensions (n = 2,340). More than 90% of the trial population was white. Subjects were aged at least 50 years with a serum PSA ≥ 1.5 ng/mL and < 10 ng/mL and BPH diagnosed by medical history and physical examination, including enlarged prostate (≥ 30 cc) and BPH symptoms that were moderate to severe according to the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA‑SI). Most of the 4,325 subjects randomly assigned to receive either dutasteride or placebo completed 2 years of double‑blind treatment (70% and 67%, respectively). Most of the 2,340 subjects in the trial extensions completed 2 additional years of open‑label treatment (71%).

Effect on Symptom Scores

Symptoms were quantified using the AUA-SI, a questionnaire that evaluates urinary symptoms (incomplete emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia) by rating on a 0 to 5 scale for a total possible score of 35, with higher numerical total symptom scores representing greater severity of symptoms. The baseline AUA-SI score across the 3 trials was approximately 17 units in both treatment groups.

### Dutasteride as a treatment to support reduced drinking: a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^112gjPcv]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Preclinical studies indicate that neuroactive steroids mediate some effects of alcohol. Dutasteride is an inhibitor of 5-alpha reductase enzymes, which play a central role in the production of 5α-reduced neuroactive steroids. A prior randomized clinical trial in men found that dutasteride reduced drinking compared with placebo. The purpose of this study was to examine dutasteride's tolerability and efficacy for reducing drinking in a sample of men and women.

Methods

A total of 167 participants who were current heavy drinkers and had a goal to stop or reduce drinking to nonhazardous levels were randomized to placebo or 1 mg dutasteride daily for 12 weeks. We hypothesized that both dutasteride-treated men and women would be more successful in reducing drinking compared with placebo.

Results

Dutasteride was well tolerated. Generalized linear mixed models identified significant effects of medication such that dutasteride-treated participants reduced drinking and heavy drinking more than placebo-treatment. During the last month of treatment, dutasteride-treated participants had reduced heavy drinking days by 40% versus 23% for placebo-treated participants (P = 0.041, Cohen's d = 0.48) and the number of drinks per week by 32% versus 16% for placebo participants (P = 0.016, Cohen's d = 0.42). When the sample was stratified by sex, a significant effect of medication compared with placebo was evident for men (n = 88) but not for women (n = 67) due to a large placebo response rate in women.

Conclusion

Dutasteride 1 mg daily was efficacious in reducing the number of heavy drinking days and drinks per week in treatment-seeking men, confirming findings from a prior RCT involving 142 men.

### Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (Jalyn) [^114pYVbC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Effect on 5 Alpha-Dihydrotestosterone and Testosterone: The maximum effect of daily doses of dutasteride on the reduction of DHT is dose-dependent and is observed within 1 to 2 weeks. After 1 and 2 weeks of daily dosing with dutasteride 0.5 mg, median serum DHT concentrations were reduced by 85% and 90%, respectively. In patients with BPH treated with dutasteride 0.5 mg/day for 4 years, the median decrease in serum DHT was 94% at 1 year, 93% at 2 years, and 95% at both 3 and 4 years. The median increase in serum testosterone was 19% at both 1 and 2 years, 26% at 3 years, and 22% at 4 years, but the mean and median levels remained within the physiologic range.

In patients with BPH treated with 5 mg/day of dutasteride or placebo for up to 12 weeks prior to transurethral resection of the prostate, mean DHT concentrations in prostatic tissue were significantly lower in the dutasteride group compared with placebo (784 and 5,793 pg/g, respectively, P < 0.001). Mean prostatic tissue concentrations of testosterone were significantly higher in the dutasteride group compared with placebo (2,073 and 93 pg/g, respectively, P < 0.001).

Adult males with genetically inherited type 2 5-alpha-reductase deficiency also have decreased DHT levels. These 5-alpha-reductase-deficient males have a small prostate gland throughout life and do not develop BPH. Except for the associated urogenital defects present at birth, no other clinical abnormalities related to 5-alpha-reductase deficiency have been observed in these individuals.

### A randomized, active-and placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of different doses of dutasteride versus placebo and finasteride in the treatment of male subjects with androgenetic alopecia [^1145EZiV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Dihydrotestosterone is the main androgen causative of androgenetic alopecia, a psychologically and physically harmful condition warranting medical treatment.

Objective

We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of dutasteride (type 1 and 2 5-alpha reductase inhibitor) with finasteride (type 2 5-alpha reductase inhibitor) and placebo in men with androgenetic alopecia.

Methods

Men aged 20 to 50 years with androgenetic alopecia were randomized to receive dutasteride (0.02, 0.1, or 0.5 mg/d), finasteride (1 mg/d), or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was hair count (2.54-cm diameter) at week 24. Other assessments included hair count (1.13-cm diameter) and width, photographic assessments (investigators and panel), change in stage, and health outcomes.

Results

In total, 917 men were randomized. Hair count and width increased dose dependently with dutasteride. Dutasteride 0.5 mg significantly increased hair count and width in a 2.54-cm diameter and improved hair growth (frontal view; panel photographic assessment) at week 24 compared with finasteride (P = 0.003, P = 0.004, and P = 0.002, respectively) and placebo (all P < .001). The number and severity of adverse events were similar among treatment groups.

Limitations

The study was limited to 24 weeks.

Conclusions

Dutasteride increased hair growth and restoration in men with androgenetic alopecia and was relatively well tolerated.

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^112eAdxu]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Treatment with 5α‐reductase inhibitors has been associated with sexual adverse events such as impotence (erectile dysfunction) and decreased libido. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate adverse events related to sexual function, based on their frequency, duration, persistence and associated treatment discontinuations, in men treated with dutasteride for androgenetic alopecia. Participants were randomized to receive double‐blind dutasteride 0.5 mg or placebo once daily for 24 weeks, followed by open‐label dutasteride 0.5 mg for an additional 24 weeks. Sexual adverse events were followed up until resolution or for up to 24 weeks after the last dose. Overall, 117 men, 23–50 years of age, were randomized. The incidence of sexual adverse events was approximately twofold higher in the dutasteride group (16%) than the placebo group (8%) during the double‐blind period; the overall incidence of sexual adverse events was lower (5%) during the open‐label period. All adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and considered treatment‐related. The adverse events resolved while on study treatment or after the end of treatment and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. A limitation of this study was the small sample size. The sexual adverse events of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders reported in this study were expected and reversible.

### Effect of dutasteride on the detection of prostate cancer in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^114Xjfg4]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the rate of prostate cancer detection in three large randomized placebo-controlled benign prostatic hyperplasia trials of dutasteride. Dutasteride, which lowers serum dihydrotestosterone more than 93% by inhibiting type 1 and type 2 5-alpha-reductase, is effective in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, its effect on the development of prostate cancer is unknown.

Methods

A total of 4325 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia but without a history, or evidence, of prostate cancer, and a serum prostate-specific antigen level of 1.5 to 10 ng/mL, were randomized to 0.5 mg/day dutasteride or placebo for 24 months. The prostate cancer detection rates for subjects were determined by non-protocol-mandated biopsies, either during the double-blind phase of the study or during the first 3 months of the open-label extension. A follow-up questionnaire was administered to a subset of consenting subjects to ascertain the number, outcomes, and reasons for the prostate biopsies.

Results

The cumulative incidence of prostate cancer as an adverse event was significantly lower in the dutasteride versus placebo group at 24 months (1.1% versus 1.9%, P = 0.025) and 27 months (1.2% versus 2.5%, P = 0.002). There were no differences in the diagnosis rates of prostate cancer during the first 15 months, after which time the detection rate of prostate cancer increased in the placebo group and remained low in the dutasteride group.

Conclusions

Prostate cancer detection was significantly lower in subjects randomized to dutasteride compared with the placebo group. These results have prompted the initiation of the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) study, which was designed and powered to test the hypothesis that treatment with dutasteride decreases the incidence and progression of prostate cancer.

### 5-alpha reductase inhibitors in androgenetic alopecia: shifting paradigms, current concepts, comparative efficacy, and safety [^115oegYg]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a multifactorial disease that carries a significant psychological burden with it. Dihydrotestosterone, the main pathogenic androgen in AGA, is produced by conversion of testosterone, which is catalyzed by the 5-alpha reductase (5-AR) isoenzyme family. Finasteride and dutasteride are inhibitors of these enzymes. Finasteride, which is a single receptor 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (5-ARI), acts by blocking dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Dutasteride, a dual receptor DHT blocker, has a higher potency than its predecessor, finasteride. This review corroborates the evidence of superiority of dutasteride over finasteride, and its comparable safety profile concerning fertility, teratogenicity, neurotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity.

Finasteride and dutasteride for hirsutism — Finasteride reduced hirsutism scores by 30% to 60%, with 5 mg finasteride the most commonly used dose; some data suggest that 7.5 mg is more effective, and doses of 2.5 and 5 mg appear to be equally effective, with systematic reviews showing a significant reduction vs placebo. Dutasteride inhibits both type 1 and 2 isoenzymes, but there are no clinical data to support its use at this time.

### The influence of baseline parameters on changes in international prostate symptom score with dutasteride, tamsulosin, and combination therapy among men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia and an enlarged prostate: 2-year data from the combAT study [^112NXiw7]. European Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Knowledge of baseline factors that influence outcomes for men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) receiving medical therapy may help to improve outcomes and cost effectiveness.

Objectives

To examine the influence of baseline parameters on changes in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and maximum urinary flow rate (Q(max)) in men with BPH receiving dutasteride, tamsulosin, or a combination of the two using 2-yr Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin (CombAT) study data.

Design, Setting, and Participants

CombAT is an ongoing, 4-yr, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study in 4844 men aged ≥ 50 yr with clinical diagnosis of BPH, IPSS ≥ 12, prostate volume ≥ 30 cm(3), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 1.5–10 ng/ml, and Q(max) > 5 and ≤ 15 ml/s with minimum voided volume ≥ 125 ml.

Intervention

Daily tamsulosin 0.4 mg, dutasteride 0.5 mg, or the combination.

Measurements

Post hoc analyses of mean IPSS and Q(max) changes from baseline by treatment group and by baseline prostate volume, PSA, age, body mass index (BMI), IPSS, IPSS quality of life (QoL) score, BPH Impact Index score, Q(max), and previous BPH medical therapy.

Results and Limitations

Combination therapy was more effective than either monotherapy after 24 mo in improving IPSS in all baseline subgroups, with benefit onset varying by baseline prostate volume. Combination therapy was also more effective in improving Q(max) versus tamsulosin in all subgroups and versus dutasteride in 10 of 18 subgroups. At 24 mo, dutasteride monotherapy resulted in significantly greater IPSS improvements versus tamsulosin in men with lower age, worse symptoms, worse QoL, less bother, higher BMI, greater Q(max), higher prostate volume, and higher PSA at baseline. Post hoc analyses, the lack of placebo control, and the exclusion of men with unsuccessful medical BPH treatment are study limitations.

Conclusions

Combination therapy with tamsulosin and dutasteride affords the greatest and the most rapid symptomatic benefit among men with higher baseline prostate volume and is effective regardless of previous BPH medical therapy. Dutasteride monotherapy is more effective than tamsulosin in men with higher baseline prostate volume or PSA and worse symptoms.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^1142mnrw]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) 5‑alpha‑reductase inhibitors (5‑ARI) — dosing, PSA threshold, and pharmacology are as follows: providers do not need to obtain a PSA solely for determination of 5‑ARI response, and a minimum threshold PSA 1.5ng/mL is advised when initiating therapy; approved doses are finasteride 5 mg daily and dutasteride 0.5 mg tablet daily. Finasteride inhibits 5‑AR type II while dutasteride inhibits types I and II; serum dihydrotestosterone reduction is approximately 70% with finasteride versus approximately 95% with dutasteride, with prostate tissue reductions approximately 80% (finasteride) and approximately 94% (dutasteride). The serum half‑life of finasteride ranges from six to eight hours, whereas that of dutasteride is five weeks.

### Dutasteride [^1149w9AT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Dutasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone to DHT. DHT is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase, which exists as 2 isoforms, type 1 and type 2. The type 2 isoenzyme is primarily active in the reproductive tissues, while the type 1 isoenzyme is also responsible for testosterone conversion in the skin and liver.

Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both type 1 and type 2 5 alpha-reductase isoenzymes, with which it forms a stable enzyme complex. Dissociation from this complex has been evaluated under in vitro and in vivo conditions and is extremely slow. Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Effect on 5 Alpha-Dihydrotestosterone and Testosterone

The maximum effect of daily doses of dutasteride on the reduction of DHT is dose dependent and is observed within 1 to 2 weeks. After 1 and 2 weeks of daily dosing with dutasteride 0.5 mg, median serum DHT concentrations were reduced by 85% and 90%, respectively. In patients with BPH treated with dutasteride 0.5 mg/day for 4 years, the median decrease in serum DHT was 94% at 1 year, 93% at 2 years, and 95% at both 3 and 4 years. The median increase in serum testosterone was 19% at both 1 and 2 years, 26% at 3 years, and 22% at 4 years, but the mean and median levels remained within the physiologic range.

In patients with BPH treated with 5 mg/day of dutasteride or placebo for up to 12 weeks prior to transurethral resection of the prostate, mean DHT concentrations in prostatic tissue were significantly lower in the dutasteride group compared with placebo (784 and 5,793 pg/g, respectively, P < 0.001). Mean prostatic tissue concentrations of testosterone were significantly higher in the dutasteride group compared with placebo (2,073 and 93 pg/g, respectively, P < 0.001).

### Dutasteride (Avodart) [^1171mA2a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Combination with Alpha-blocker Therapy (CombAT)

The efficacy of combination therapy (AVODART 0.5 mg/day plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day, n = 1,610) was compared with AVODART alone (n = 1,623) or tamsulosin alone (n = 1,611) in a 4‑year multicenter, randomized, double‑blind trial. Trial entry criteria were similar to the double‑blind, placebo‑controlled monotherapy efficacy trials described in Section 14.1. Eighty‑eight percent (88%) of the enrolled trial population was white. Approximately 52% of subjects had previous exposure to 5 alpha‑reductase–inhibitor or alpha-adrenergic–antagonist treatment. Of the 4,844 subjects randomly assigned to receive treatment, 69% of subjects in the combination group, 67% in the group receiving AVODART, and 61% in the tamsulosin group completed 4 years of double‑blind treatment.

Effect on Symptom Score

Symptoms were quantified using the first 7 questions of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (identical to the AUA‑SI). The baseline score was approximately 16.4 units for each treatment group. Combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the monotherapy treatments in decreasing symptom score at Month 24, the primary time point for this endpoint. At Month 24 the mean changes from baseline (± SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.2 (± 7.14) for combination, -4.9 (± 6.81) for AVODART, and -4.3 (± 7.01) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between combination and AVODART of ‑1.3 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: ‑1.69, ‑0.86]), and between combination and tamsulosin of ‑1.8 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: ‑2.23, ‑1.40]). A significant difference was seen by Month 9 and continued through Month 48. At Month 48 the mean changes from baseline (± SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.3 (± 7.40) for combination, -5.3 (± 7.14) for AVODART, and -3.8 (± 7.74) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between combination and AVODART of ‑0.96 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: ‑1.40, ‑0.52]), and between combination and tamsulosin of ‑2.5 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: ‑2.96, ‑2.07]).

### 5 α-reductase type 1 modulates insulin sensitivity in men [^112u6GgK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

A third isozyme of 5αR has been described and is expressed in relevant tissues. Its role in steroid metabolism is as yet not clearly defined, and furthermore, effects of 5αR inhibitors on this isozyme are uncertain, and any relevance to our findings is unclear.

Previous studies have shown more potent effects of dutasteride than finasteride to lower circulating DHT levels. Here, despite a higher etiocholanolone/androsterone ratio in urine, suggesting somewhat more potent overall 5αR inhibition by dutasteride, we did not find any differences in circulating DHT. This may reflect our use of a highly specific LC-MS/MS assay, although we might have obtained different results after longer-term treatment given the long half-life and very slow time to steady state for dutasteride. Most importantly, this indicates that differences in effects of dutasteride and finasteride on insulin sensitivity are not mediated by differences in circulating DHT. More studies are now justified to assess tissue steroid hormone concentrations and identify the downstream signaling pathways affected, particularly in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Such studies could test the hypotheses that either decreased androgen action and/or increased glucocorticoid action mediates these effects.

These results highlight a novel role for 5αR1 on modulating human metabolism; however, their clinical relevance is uncertain. The decrease in insulin sensitivity after 3 months of dutasteride (∼14%) is of similar magnitude to the beneficial effects of antidiabetic agents such as metformin. Impaired insulin sensitivity measured by euglycemic clamps predicts future risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our study sample consisted mostly of healthy men who are younger than those affected by BPH with declining β-cell function and increased body fat. Importantly, age did not confound the effect of dutasteride on insulin sensitivity in the study. Nonetheless, older men with already impaired insulin sensitivity might be more susceptible to the metabolic consequences of 5αR inhibition; the effect of disruption of 5αR1 in murine models is revealed with a high-fat diet. The association of BPH with the metabolic syndrome, and the likelihood of long-term exposure to 5αR inhibitors once treatment is initiated, suggests that further studies should now be conducted to establish whether inhibition of 5αR1 has clinically important effects on adiposity and metabolism in men with BPH.

### The role of dihydrotestosterone in benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115geBTM]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

This article examines the role of the androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the healthy and diseased prostate and considers the implications of the data on DHT for therapeutic approaches to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Development and maintenance of the normal prostate, as well as development of BPH, depend on a functional androgen-signaling axis, components of which include: (1) testosterone synthesis in the testes and adrenal glands; (2) conversion of testosterone to DHT; (3) transport of DHT to target tissues; and (4) binding of DHT to the androgen receptor with consequent modulation of genes. DHT plays a beneficial role in the developing prostate but it can be detrimental in the adult prostate in that it causes pathologic prostate growth. The role of DHT in other adult tissues is uncertain. DHT has not been shown to perform beneficial functions unique from testosterone in the adult male, and it is believed that its fundamental effect is to amplify testosterone's weaker hormonal signal. Increased understanding of the cellular mechanisms by which the androgen-signaling axis functions has led to advances in treatment for prostate disease. In BPH, the 5alpha-reductase inhibitors — the only class of therapy to act at the pathophysiologic substrate of the disease — arrest the disease process, reduce prostate volume, improve symptoms, and reduce the risk of acute urinary retention and BPH-related surgery. The availability of dutasteride, the first dual (Type 1/Type 2) 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, offers the opportunity for rapid and consistent inhibition of DHT.

### 5 α-reductase inhibitor treatment of prostatic diseases: background and practical implications [^111JHmrA]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

This literature review discusses the theoretical background of 5alpha-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) treatment and the resulting clinical implications. A Medline-based search for peer-reviewed articles addressing 5ARIs, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer was performed. The 5ARIs Finasteride and Dutasteride, which specifically inhibit the production of dihydrotestosterone by acting as competitive inhibitors of 5alpha-reductase, are clinically well tolerated and represent an effective treatment option for benign prostatic obstruction. Finasteride is the first compound which has a proven efficacy in chemoprevention of prostate cancer. The aim of this review was to elucidate, if there are sufficient data available to point out clinically relevant differences between the drugs. Both compounds achieve a significant reduction of prostate volume, an improvement of symptoms and a lower risk of acute urinary retention. Whether the different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Finasteride and Dutasteride are of clinical importance cannot be judged at this time.

### Cancer chemoprevention: a rapidly evolving field [^112Fj4pW]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Two positive large trials have explored the chemoprevention of prostate cancer, with cancer incidence as the end point. The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial compared the 5 α -reductase inhibitor, finasteride, with placebo given for 7 years in 18 882 men. At the time of analysis, 86.3% of participants had completed 7 years of treatment. There was a 26% reduction in the diagnosis of prostate cancer in the finasteride arm (P < 0.001), but the protective effect appeared to be limited to lower grade tumours. There was an increase in the number of biopsy cases with higher grade disease (1.8% vs 1.1%), which raised concerns. Subsequent analysis of prostatectomy specimens suggested that this observation was an artefact resulting from the effect of finasteride on prostate size, which affected the sampling in biopsy specimens rather than being a true increase. Unfortunately, partly because of the initial findings, the FDA has not approved finasteride for prostate cancer chemoprevention. A subsequent randomised trial, the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events, demonstrated that dutasteride (another 5 α -reductase inhibitor) reduced the risk of biopsy proven prostate cancer by 23% compared with placebo but, as with finasteride, the major benefit was in the prevention of lower grade malignancies.

### The effects of the dual 5 α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride on localized prostate cancer – results from a 4-month pre-radical prostatectomy study [^1113evqz]. The Prostate (2006). Low credibility.

Background

As dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the most potent androgen in the prostate, inhibition of the 5alpha-reductase isoenzymes, which convert testosterone to DHT, could be an appropriate target for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Methods

Eighty-one men with clinically localized prostate cancer received daily dutasteride 3.5 or 0.5 mg, or no therapy for 4 months before radical prostatectomy. Histopathological assessments were conducted on prostatectomy specimens.

Results

Treatment with dutasteride was associated with reductions in serum and intraprostatic DHT of ≥ 90%, and a decrease in total prostate and tumor volumes. No effect of dutasteride was noted on Gleason grade. Histopathological effects on benign tissue were similar but less prominent than those seen with androgen ablation, whereas there was no significant difference in cancer histology among the groups.

Conclusions

Dutasteride treatment results in similar but less marked changes compared with androgen ablation.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of dutasteride in the treatment of male patients with androgenetic alopecia [^115yfBYp]. The Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia is an androgen-induced pattern of progressive hair loss, which occurs in genetically predisposed people. This study aimed to determine long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of dutasteride 0.5 mg, an inhibitor of 5-α-reductase, in Japanese male patients with androgenetic alopecia. This was a multicenter, open-label, prospective outpatient study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01831791, GSK identifier ARI114264) in which patients took dutasteride 0.5 mg p.o. once daily for 52 weeks. Primary end-points included adverse event assessment, incidence of drug-related adverse event and premature discontinuations. Secondary end-points included hair growth, hair restoration and global improvement in hair. A total of 120 patients were enrolled, of whom 110 completed 52 weeks of treatment. Nasopharyngitis, erectile dysfunction and decreased libido were the most frequently reported adverse events and most adverse events were mild. Drug-related adverse events were reported with an incidence of 17%, none of which led to study withdrawal. Hair growth (mean target area hair count at week 52), hair restoration (mean target area hair width at week 52) and global appearance of hair (mean of the median score at week 52) improved from baseline during the study. As a potential future treatment option for male androgenetic alopecia, dutasteride 0.5 mg exhibited long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy within this study population.

### Post-finasteride syndrome: a surmountable challenge for clinicians [^116Y1EFJ]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

Post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) is a constellation of serious adverse side effects manifested in clinical symptoms that develop and persist in patients during and/or after discontinuing finasteride treatment in men with pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) or benign prostatic hyperplasia. These serious adverse side effects include persistent or irreversible sexual, neurological, physical and mental side effects. To date, there are no evidence-based effective treatments for PFS. Although increasing number of men report persistent side effects, the medical community has yet to recognize this syndrome nor are there any specific measures to address this serious and debilitating symptoms. Here we evaluate the scientific and clinical evidence in the contemporary medical literature to address the very fundamental question: Is PFS a real clinical condition caused by finasteride use or are the reported symptoms only incidentally associated with but not caused by finasteride use? One key indisputable clinical evidence noted in all reported studies with finasteride and dutasteride was that use of these drugs is associated with development of sexual dysfunction, which may persist in a subset of men, irrespective of age, drug dose or duration of study. Also, increased depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation in a subset of men treated with these drugs were commonly reported in a number of studies. It is important to note that many clinical studies suffer from incomplete or inadequate assessment of adverse events and often limited or inaccurate data reporting regarding harm. Based on the existing body of evidence in the contemporary clinical literature, the author believes that finasteride and dutasteride induce a constellation of persistent sexual, neurological and physical adverse side effects, in a subset of men. These constellations of symptoms constitute the basis for PFS in individuals predisposed to epigenetic susceptibility. Indeed, delineating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PFS will be of paramount importance to the understanding of this syndrome and to development of potential novel therapeutic modalities.

### Dutasteride [^115ukgUR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Subjects receiving dutasteride achieved statistically significant improvement in symptoms versus placebo by Month 3 in 1 trial and by Month 12 in the other 2 pivotal trials. At Month 12, the mean decrease from baseline in AUA-SI total symptom scores across the 3 trials pooled was -3.3 units for dutasteride and -2.0 units for placebo with a mean difference between the 2 treatment groups of -1.3 (range: -1.1 to -1.5 units in each of the 3 trials, P < 0.001) and was consistent across the 3 trials. At Month 24, the mean decrease from baseline was -3.8 units for dutasteride and -1.7 units for placebo with a mean difference of -2.1 (range: -1.9 to -2.2 units in each of the 3 trials, P < 0.001). See Figure 1. The improvement in BPH symptoms seen during the first 2 years of double-blind treatment was maintained throughout an additional 2 years of open-label extension trials.

These trials were prospectively designed to evaluate effects on symptoms based on prostate size at baseline. In men with prostate volumes ≥ 40 cc, the mean decrease was -3.8 units for dutasteride and -1.6 units for placebo, with a mean difference between the 2 treatment groups of -2.2 at Month 24. In men with prostate volumes < 40 cc, the mean decrease was -3.7 units for dutasteride and -2.2 units for placebo, with a mean difference between the 2 treatment groups of -1.5 at Month 24.

### Finasteride [^115wmWPa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection

In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals.

For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-­reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride.

Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer.

The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary.

5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer

Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA ≤ 3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs. placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs. 0.5% placebo). 5α-­reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established.

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^114AbF1e]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Participants were sexually active men aged 18–50 years with AGA who had been in a stable heterosexual relationship for 6 months prior to screening and expected to maintain that relationship throughout the study. Exclusion criteria are described in Appendix S1.

This international, multicenter, parallel‐group study comprised a 4‐week participant‐blinded placebo run‐in period and a 24‐week double‐blind (DB) treatment period where participants were randomized (1:1 ratio) using a centralized computer system to once‐daily dutasteride 0.5 mg or placebo. This was followed by a 24‐week open‐label (OL) active treatment period in which all participants received once‐daily dutasteride 0.5 mg, and a 4‐week post‐treatment follow‐up visit (Fig. S1). Participants with an ongoing sexual AE at the end of the treatment period and those who discontinued study treatment due to an AE related to sexual function entered a targeted follow‐up period until resolution of the sexual AE or 24 weeks after the last dose of the study treatment, whichever occurred first.

The primary objective was to evaluate the frequency, duration and persistence of AE related to sexual function (decreased libido, impotence and ejaculation disorders), and associated treatment discontinuations in men treated with dutasteride for AGA. A protocol amendment changed the primary objective from change in sexual function (measured by the International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF] – Erectile Function domain [EF]) to the incidence of sexual AE. The amendment also added the 24‐week OL period to extend monitoring of on‐treatment AE reversibility.

Other objectives included overall safety; changes in sexual function, measured by the IIEF questionnaire; participant‐perceived changes in sexual function, measured by global assessment questions; participant satisfaction with hair growth with dutasteride treatment for male AGA, measured by the Hair Growth Satisfaction Scale; and participant‐perceived impact of alopecia on health‐related quality of life (QoL), measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Additional details regarding these assessment tools and the statistical analyses can be found in Appendix S1.

This study (NCT02014584; registered 12 December 2013) was approved by the applicable institutional review board/ethics committee (registration date, 21 March 2014; registration no. 201401094MSB) for each country and study center. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to participation.

### Post-finasteride syndrome-a true clinical entity? [^115XY4NT]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

This review critically examines Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS), a condition eventually reported by men who have used finasteride for androgenetic alopecia or benign prostatic enlargement and experienced persistent adverse effects after discontinuation. We explore the clinical manifestations, including sexual dysfunction, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and physical changes, that collectively challenge both diagnosis and management. This review evaluates the evidence for PFS, discusses potential mechanisms including neurobiological alterations, genetic predispositions, and addresses the controversies surrounding its existence and recognition by the medical community. Emphasis is placed on the role of patient education and the need for thorough risk assessment before prescribing finasteride. Although contrasting data from literature, men treated with finasteride could develop a plethora of non-neglectable physical and psychological symptoms identifying PFS. A multidisciplinary approach to research, policy-making, and patient advocacy is essential to better understand, diagnose, and manage PFS, underlining the necessity for greater awareness and scientific inquiry into this contentious and impactful syndrome.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Dutasteride

Effect on 5-Alpha-Dihydrotestosterone and Testosterone: The maximum effect of daily doses of dutasteride on the reduction of DHT is dose-dependent and is observed within 1 to 2 weeks. After 1 and 2 weeks of daily dosing with dutasteride 0.5 mg, median serum DHT concentrations were reduced by 85% and 90%, respectively. In patients with BPH treated with dutasteride 0.5 mg/day for 4 years, the median decrease in serum DHT was 94% at 1 year, 93% at 2 years, and 95% at both 3 and 4 years. The median increase in serum testosterone was 19% at both 1 and 2 years, 26% at 3 years, and 22% at 4 years, but the mean and median levels remained within the physiologic range.

In patients with BPH treated with 5 mg/day of dutasteride or placebo for up to 12 weeks prior to transurethral resection of the prostate, mean DHT concentrations in prostatic tissue were significantly lower in the dutasteride group compared with placebo (784 and 5,793 pg/g, respectively, P < 0.001). Mean prostatic tissue concentrations of testosterone were significantly higher in the dutasteride group compared with placebo (2,073 and 93 pg/g, respectively, P < 0.001).

### Effective treatment of female androgenic alopecia with dutasteride [^114nAF88]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Dihydrotestosterone is the main molecule responsible for androgenic alopecia. Finasteride, which reduces transformation of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone and decreases dihydrotestosterone activity, is approved for treatment of androgenic alopecia in men. We describe the case of a 46-year-old woman with androgenic alopecia, non-responsive to minoxidil, who initially benefited from finasteride. Due to only limited improvement after finasteride and persisting profound psychological distress resulting from androgenic alopecia, another 5-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, was introduced. Clinical evaluation and trichogram were applied for assessment of dutasteride efficacy in this patient. Additionally, mean hair diameter was monitored by means of computer dermoscopy. After 6 months of therapy, significant improvement was observed and after 9 months the clinical diagnosis of androgenic alopecia could no longer be made in this patient. No side effects were observed. In conclusion, theoretical data and our experience in this case show that dutasteride might develop into a true alternative in treatment of androgenic alopecia.

### Rates of prostate surgery and acute urinary retention for benign prostatic hyperplasia in men treated with dutasteride or finasteride [^112sKAbX]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Until the early 90s, the choice of therapy in patients with BPH consisted of either watchful waiting or surgical treatment. In the last 15 years, many new therapies were introduced of which alpha-blockers and 5-ARI are most common.

Extending the follow-up with 6 months after discontinuation of 5-ARI affected the incidence rates only marginally. Applying a more strict definition of treatment, i.e. not only continuous 5-ARI treatment but also no change in alpha-blocker therapy, resulted in a more pronounced difference in rates between mono- and combination therapy, but the difference between dutasteride and finasteride users did not change.

Finasteride became available on the European market in 1992, while dutasteride became available in 2002. As new drugs are usually first given to a selected group of patients, mostly the more severe, this may create a bias in favor of older products and thus a confounded comparison of the risks of BPH-related prostate surgery between dutasteride and finasteride. In order to assess this potential introduction bias, a sensitivity analysis was performed excluding men starting with 5-ARI between 2003 and 2006. However, excluding those years did not change the comparison of risk of BPH-related prostate surgery between dutasteride and finasteride. Therefore, introduction bias seems unlikely. Furthermore, for this study, data up to and including 2011 was used. As in more recent years no substantial changes occurred with respect to the management and treatment of BPH, major changes in the association between type of 5-ARI and BPH-related prostate surgery are not likely.

Regarding medical management for benign prostatic hyperplasia, more specifically with respect to 5-ARIs, CUA 2022 guidelines recommend to offer 5-ARIs (dutasteride and finasteride) as an appropriate and effective treatment in patients with LUTS associated with demonstrable prostatic enlargement.

### A broader role for 5ARIs in prostate disease? Existing evidence and emerging benefits [^111VP9vf]. The Prostate (2009). Low credibility.

5ARIs are recommended for men who have moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Studies have confirmed the utility of combining 5ARIs with alpha-blockers; the MTOPS study showed that risk of overall clinical progression was significantly reduced after 4.5 years with combination therapy (finasteride/doxazosin) in comparison with either monotherapy, while the ongoing CombAT trial (dutasteride/tamsulosin) has for the first time shown benefit in improving symptoms for combination therapy over monotherapies within 12 months of treatment. Data also suggest roles for 5ARIs in prostate cancer. Several studies indicate that treatment with a 5ARI improves the performance of PSA testing for identifying men with prostate cancer, while the PCPT showed a significant reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer with finasteride. However, widespread use of finasteride in this setting has been tempered by an apparent increase in high-grade disease observed in the study. The ongoing REDUCE study will provide further insight into prostate cancer prevention with 5ARIs. 5ARI-containing regimens may have utility as less aggressive treatment options for patients who only have rising PSA after definitive local therapy, and in patients with disease resistant to androgen deprivation therapy who have PSA progression. Current evidence therefore shows that 5ARIs are effective in treating LUTS/BPE and preventing disease progression, and may also have a role in the prevention of prostate cancer. The overlap between BPE and prostate cancer may allow a more unified approach to managing these conditions, with 5ARIs having a central role.

### 5-α reductase inhibitors and prostate cancer prevention: where do we turn now? [^116cVbtY]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cost-effectiveness

Since the PCPT, 11 publications have explored various aspects of the trade-offs among the benefits, harms and costs of 5-ARI chemoprevention for prostate cancer. An extensive analysis of these studies is beyond the scope of this review and is complicated by the fact that each is based on a set of assumptions about the PCPT data. For example, some model the risk of high-grade disease at face value from the trial; others impute less risk of high-grade disease based on the volume grade and PSA sensitivity biases; some model the baseline cancer risk from all biopsies in the control arm, which include end-of-study biopsies; and others use Surveillance Epidemiology End Results rates to better approximate real-world incidence. Overall, most conclude that a strategy whereby all men over 55 years of age are recommended to take finasteride is not cost-effective. However, studies analyzing a strategy targeting only men at higher risk of prostate cancer suggest that finasteride chemoprevention is cost-effective.

The goal of the REDUCE study was to examine 5-ARIs in men at higher risk in hopes of answering that question. As it turned out, that cohort of men with a prior negative biopsy actually had a risk of prostate cancer equal to that of the PCPT cohort (placebo cancer rate 24.4% in PCPT vs. 25.1% in REDUCE). Only one study has examined the cost-effectiveness of dutasteride based on the REDUCE data and similarly concluded that it is unlikely to be cost-effective unless targeted at a high-risk population.

### Efficacy and safety of a dual inhibitor of 5-α-reductase types 1 and 2 (dutasteride) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115osAQT]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study the efficacy and safety of dutasteride, a dual inhibitor of the 5-alpha-reductase isoenzymes types I and II.

Methods

A total of 4325 men (2951 completed) with clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia, moderate to severe symptoms (American Urological Association-Symptom Index score of 12 points or greater), a peak flow rate of 15 mL/s or less, a prostate volume of 30 cm3 or greater (as measured by transrectal ultrasonography), and a serum prostate-specific antigen level of 1.5 to 10.0 ng/mL (inclusive) were enrolled into three identical clinical trials and randomized to 0.5 mg dutasteride daily or placebo. After a 1-month, single-blind, placebo lead-in, patients were followed up for 24 months in a double-blind trial with multiple interval assessments.

Results

At 24 months, serum dihydrotestosterone was reduced from baseline by a mean of 90.2% (median -93.7%; P < 0.001), and the total prostate and transition zone volumes were reduced by a mean of 25.7% and 20.4%, respectively (P < 0.001). The symptom score was improved by as early as 3 months, with pooled significance from 6 months onward (P < 0.001) and a reduction of 4.5 points (21.4%) at 24 months (P < 0.001). The maximal flow rate improved significantly from 1 month (P < 0.01), with an increase of 2.2 mL/s reported at 24 months (P < 0.001). Hence, the risk reduction of acute urinary retention was 57% and the risk reduction of benign prostatic hyperplasia-related surgical intervention was 48% compared with placebo. The drug was well tolerated.

Conclusions

Dutasteride is a potent inhibitor of dihydrotestosterone production that is safe and effective in terms of the reduction of prostate volume and symptoms, flow rate improvement, and the reduction of the risk of acute urinary retention and surgery during a 24-month study period.

14.2 Combination with Alpha-blocker Therapy (CombAT)

The efficacy of combination therapy (dutasteride 0.5 mg/day plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day, n = 1,610) was compared with dutasteride alone (n = 1,623) or tamsulosin alone (n = 1,611) in a 4-year multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial. Trial entry criteria were similar to the double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy efficacy trials described in section 14.1. Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the enrolled trial population was white. Approximately 52% of subjects had previous exposure to 5 alpha-reductase-inhibitor or alpha-adrenergic-antagonist treatment. Of the 4,844 subjects randomly assigned to receive treatment, 69% of subjects in the combination group, 67% in the group receiving dutasteride, and 61% in the tamsulosin group completed 4 years of double-blind treatment.

Effect on Symptom Score

Symptoms were quantified using the first 7 questions of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (identical to the AUA-SI). The baseline score was approximately 16.4 units for each treatment group. Combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the monotherapy treatments in decreasing symptom score at Month 24, the primary time point for this endpoint. At Month 24 the mean changes from baseline (± SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.2 (± 7.14) for combination, -4.9 (± 6.81) for dutasteride, and -4.3 (± 7.01) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between combination and dutasteride of -1.3 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -1.69, -0.86]), and between combination and tamsulosin of -1.8 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -2.23, -1.40]). A significant difference was seen by Month 9 and continued through Month 48. At Month 48 the mean changes from baseline (± SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.3 (± 7.40) for combination, -5.3 (± 7.14) for dutasteride, and -3.8 (± 7.74) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between combination and dutasteride of -0.96 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -1.40, -0.52]), and between combination and tamsulosin of -2.5 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -2.96, -2.07]). See Figure 6.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of dutasteride PO (also known as Avodart):
- **Decreased serum PSA**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as dutasteride reduces serum PSA levels even in the presence of prostate cancer. Measure baseline PSA at least 3 months after initiating dutasteride and monitor periodically thereafter. Evaluate for prostate cancer in case of any increase from the lowest PSA level, even if the values are still within the normal range.
- **High-grade prostate cancer**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as an increased incidence has been reported in patients receiving dutasteride. Assess for other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms before initiating dutasteride, recognizing that BPH and prostate cancer may coexist.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Dutasteride is contraindicated for use in pregnancy because it may cause harm to the male fetus [see Contraindications (4)]. Dutasteride is not indicated for use in women.

Dutasteride is a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor that prevents conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone necessary for normal development of male genitalia. Abnormalities in the genitalia of male fetuses is an expected physiological consequence of inhibition of this conversion. These results are similar to observations in male infants with genetic 5 alpha-reductase deficiency.

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

In animal reproduction studies, dutasteride inhibited normal development of external genitalia in male offspring when given to rats or rabbits during organogenesis at less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.5 mg daily, in the absence of maternal toxicity. At 15 times the MRHD, prolonged pregnancy, decreased reproductive organ weights, and delayed puberty in male offspring were observed in rats, with no-effect levels less than the MRHD of 0.5 mg daily. Increased placental weights in rabbits were also observed, with no-effect levels less than the MRHD of 0.5 mg daily (see Data).

### Dutasteride reduces prostatitis symptoms compared with placebo in men enrolled in the REDUCE study [^1173Xy8K]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Men at risk for prostate cancer may concurrently experience chronic prostatitis or pelvic pain. We evaluated the effect of dutasteride on prostatitis-like symptoms in the REDUCE study population.

Materials and Methods

REDUCE was a 4-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of prostate cancer risk reduction with 0.5 mg dutasteride vs placebo in men 50 to 75 years old with prostate specific antigen 2.5 to 10 ng/ml and a negative prostate biopsy in the previous 6 months. In this analysis we investigated change from baseline in Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index in men with prostatitis-like pain (Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index pain subscore 5 or greater) and prostatitis-like syndrome (perineal or ejaculatory pain plus Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index pain subscore 4 or greater), the proportion of subjects with at least a moderate Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index response (6-unit or greater improvement) and reports of new onset clinical prostatitis.

Results

Of 5,379 men with a total baseline Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index score 678 (12.6%) had prostatitis-like pain and 427 (7.9%) had prostatitis-like syndrome. Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index total score decreased significantly at 48 months in the dutasteride group vs placebo in men with prostatitis-like pain (p < 0.0001) and with prostatitis-like syndrome (t test p = 0.03). There were significantly more Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index responders with dutasteride vs placebo in the prostatitis-like pain (49% vs 37%, respectively, p = 0.0033) and prostatitis-like syndrome (46% vs 35%, Fisher's exact test p = 0.0265) subgroups. Prostatitis was reported as an adverse event by significantly more men randomized to placebo (3.6%) than to dutasteride (2.5%, p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Long-term dutasteride therapy resulted in improvement in prostatitis related symptoms in older men with an increased prostate specific antigen.

### Overview of pivotal studies for prostate cancer risk reduction, past and present [^117WyyT8]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer (PCa), with its potentially long latency, generally late-age onset, and high prevalence, is an ideal target for risk reduction and disease prevention strategies. Treatment of the disease is currently associated with significant side effects and reduced quality of life. Encouraging results are emerging in PCa risk reduction with 5alpha-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs). The pivotal Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) with finasteride established the efficacy of 5-ARIs in reducing the period prevalence of PCa. Ongoing trials that will further clarify the role of 5-ARIs in preventing and treating PCa include the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) with dutasteride in PCa risk reduction; the Reduction by Dutasteride of Clinical Progression Events in Expectant Management (REDEEM) trial on the effect of dutasteride on disease progression in low-grade localized PCa; and the Therapeutic Assessment of Rising PSAs [prostate-specific antigens] (TARP) trial on dutasteride in asymptomatic recurrent cancer. The data from these trials might initiate a paradigm shift in the attitudes of clinicians, healthcare policymakers, and patients to the benefits of PCa risk reduction strategies and their potential effect on a patient's health and quality of life.
