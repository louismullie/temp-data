## Question

Ct reports a large lymph node. Next steps?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the appropriate next steps are when a CT report notes a "large" lymph node. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precisely what the CT means by "large", including size thresholds by location and morphologic features. Then, I should verify the clinical context and malignancy risk factors. Next, I will apply a risk-based decision algorithm to determine whether to observe, obtain additional imaging, or pursue biopsy. After that, I need to choose the optimal tissue sampling technique based on node location. Finally, I should consider special scenarios such as known cancer, sarcoidosis, and situations where short-interval surveillance is reasonable [^112hgBN3] [^113wGzNw].

> Let me first confirm the imaging characterization on CT because "large" is imprecise; I should measure the short axis, document long-axis, and note morphology and distribution, since short-axis ≥ 10 mm is generally abnormal except for inguinal nodes where up to < 15 mm may be physiologic, while some nodal stations have lower normal cutoffs (e.g., retropharyngeal, mesenteric < 5 mm), and "bulk" is typically longest diameter ≥ 30 mm; concerning features include round shape (short/long-axis ratio > 0.5), loss of fatty hilum, necrosis, calcifications, extracapsular extension, multiplicity, and generalized versus localized distribution, all of which shift risk and management decisions [^112hgBN3] [^114s6554] [^113wGzNw].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical context before jumping to testing; I need to check age, sex, race, systemic B symptoms (fever > 38°C, drenching night sweats, > 10% weight loss), location-specific risk like supraclavicular nodes, and whether the lymphadenopathy is localized versus generalized, along with exposures (recent infection, vaccination, medications like phenytoin, autoimmune disease, animal contacts) and a focused physical exam of all nodal stations and drainage areas because these factors strongly stratify malignancy risk and guide next steps [^113wGzNw] [^113pSD2q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should categorize into high, intermediate, or low suspicion based on the integrated imaging and clinical data, since high-risk features such as supraclavicular location, short-axis ≥ 15 mm or bulky nodes, round morphology with lost hilum or necrosis, associated B symptoms, known malignancy, or persistence/enlargement beyond 2–4 weeks generally warrant tissue diagnosis rather than prolonged observation, especially for persistently enlarged cervical nodes where prompt biopsy influences outcomes [^113wGzNw] [^114Auiat] [^112hgBN3].

> If suspicion is high, I should proceed directly to biopsy and I need to ensure the sampling method matches the suspected diagnosis and anatomy; for superficial nodes (neck, axilla, groin), ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration with multiple passes can be diagnostic and allows flow cytometry when lymphoma is a concern, but I should double-check whether core or excisional biopsy is preferred when lymphoma is suspected because architectural assessment is often necessary, and FNA has notable false-negative rates in this context [^11497p9L] [^112Mogk5].

> For mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, I will now examine the least invasive, highest-yield approach; endobronchial ultrasound-guided nodal sampling is recommended as the initial procedure when tissue is needed in suspected sarcoidosis or lung cancer staging given its high yield and lower morbidity versus mediastinoscopy, though mediastinoscopy still has a higher absolute yield at the cost of greater invasiveness, so I should confirm the clinical question and operator expertise before choosing [^1125mgNn] [^114UoqtB] [^113GP4hG].

> For intra-abdominal nodal stations, I should review whether endoscopic ultrasound-guided sampling is feasible; for example, periportal lymphadenopathy without an obvious pancreatobiliary primary showed nearly one in five malignancies on EUS-FNA in a representative cohort, so targeted EUS can both diagnose and triage subsequent management when CT shows enlarged periportal or peripancreatic nodes [^112P9gdC].

> If suspicion is intermediate, I need to check whether additional imaging can sharpen risk; targeted ultrasound can refine morphology and guide same-session biopsy, while PET/CT may identify systemic disease and metabolic activity but can be falsely positive with infection/inflammation and can miss small-volume disease, so if PET is negative and clinical suspicion remains low, short-interval CT at about 4–6 weeks with biopsy if the node persists or enlarges is a prudent, evidence-aligned path that avoids premature invasive sampling [^115gHNt1] [^114YjmzU] [^117FeWXw] [^113wGzNw] [^1152XNY2].

> For low-suspicion scenarios, I should confirm features like inguinal short-axis < 15 mm, ovoid shape with preserved fatty hilum, a clear reactive trigger in a younger patient, and no systemic symptoms; in these cases, observation with clinical follow-up and short-interval reassessment is reasonable, and I need to ensure we avoid empiric corticosteroids without a diagnosis because they can obscure pathology and delay definitive evaluation if disease persists [^112hgBN3] [^113wGzNw].

> But wait, what if the patient has a known or suspected solid malignancy; then nodal findings may upstage disease and alter local therapy, so I should align the biopsy strategy with tumor-type pathways; for axillary nodes in breast cancer, ultrasound-guided FNA or core biopsy of a suspicious node can confirm metastasis and directly influence surgical planning and radiation fields, though I should double-check contemporary guidelines because the role of sentinel biopsy and axillary dissection is evolving, with defined scenarios to omit axillary dissection or even omit sentinel biopsy in select low-risk cases, so multidisciplinary discussion is essential [^11497p9L] [^115mNHuj] [^113r2rtA] [^114xGGuo] [^11764EBz].

> Let me consider special granulomatous disease scenarios; in patients with classic sarcoidosis presentations such as Löfgren syndrome or asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy and high pretest probability, it may be reasonable not to sample nodes and to follow closely, whereas when tissue is necessary, EBUS-first strategies strike a balance between yield and invasiveness, so I should verify symptoms, organ involvement, local infectious epidemiology, and follow-up reliability before deferring biopsy [^1155Y7z1] [^114kxAdp] [^1125mgNn].

> I should also double-check that my general workup addresses reversible or infectious causes; a targeted history, exam, and selective laboratory testing guided by exposures and symptoms often identify benign etiologies, and when etiology remains unclear after observation in low-risk cases, stepwise imaging and biopsy become appropriate, with the overarching goal to secure a diagnosis efficiently without overtreatment or delay in high-risk situations [^113wGzNw].

When CT reports a large lymph node, the next steps are: **confirm with ultrasound** to assess morphology and guide biopsy, and **obtain tissue diagnosis** via core needle or excisional biopsy if malignancy is suspected [^115mNHuj] [^113wGzNw]. Order **PET-CT** for metabolic characterization and staging, and perform targeted labs (CBC, LDH, ESR/CRP, infectious serologies). Overall, **management is determined by pathology**, with oncology referral for malignancy, antibiotics for infection, or observation for benign/reactive nodes [^113wGzNw].

---

## Clinical evaluation

For clinical evaluation, history and physical examination should assess systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), recent infections, malignancy history, and autoimmune disease [^113wGzNw]. The **key risk factors** — older age, firm/fixed nodes, duration > 2 weeks, supraclavicular location, and systemic symptoms — increase malignancy risk [^114hegXX] [^113hHaki].

---

## Imaging evaluation

- **Ultrasound (US)**: First-line for superficial nodes; evaluates size, shape, hilum, vascularity, and guides FNA/core biopsy [^115mNHuj] [^11497p9L].

- **PET-CT**: Assesses metabolic activity, differentiates benign vs malignant nodes, and stages disease [^114YjmzU] [^114jKpKk].

- **MRI**: Useful for deep nodes or when radiation exposure is a concern [^116KAgic].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Laboratory evaluation includes **CBC with differential** to detect cytopenias or leukocytosis, and measurement of LDH, ESR, and CRP as markers of inflammation or malignancy. Infectious serologies (HIV, EBV, CMV, TB, toxoplasmosis) are obtained as indicated [^113wGzNw].

---

## Indications for biopsy

- **Persistent enlargement**: > 4 weeks without resolution [^113wGzNw].

- **Suspicious features**: Firm, fixed, rapidly growing, or supraclavicular nodes [^113hHaki].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, night sweats, weight loss [^114hegXX].

- **Imaging suspicion**: PET-CT or US features concerning for malignancy [^114YjmzU].

---

## Biopsy techniques

- **Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)**: Minimally invasive, useful for metastatic carcinoma; limited for lymphoma subtyping [^11497p9L].

- **Core needle biopsy**: Preferred for lymphoma suspicion; provides more tissue for histology and immunophenotyping [^113wGzNw].

- **Excisional biopsy**: Gold standard for lymphoma; preserves architecture for definitive diagnosis [^111PiM6x].

---

## Management based on biopsy results

| **Diagnosis** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Malignancy (lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma) | Oncology referral, staging, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery [^114Auiat] |
| Infectious lymphadenopathy | Targeted antibiotics or antivirals [^113wGzNw] |
| Benign/reactive lymphadenopathy | Observation, follow-up imaging, treat underlying cause [^113wGzNw] |

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

For follow-up, benign/reactive nodes warrant clinical and imaging review at **4–6 weeks** [^113wGzNw], whereas malignancy requires **oncology-led follow-up** with imaging and clinical assessment [^112xhdES].

---

## Multidisciplinary approach

A multidisciplinary approach involves **team care** by radiology, pathology, oncology, infectious disease, and surgery to optimize diagnosis and management [^115mNHuj].

The next steps following a CT-reported large lymph node are to **confirm with ultrasound** [^115mNHuj], obtain tissue diagnosis [^113wGzNw], and use PET-CT and labs to guide management, with care tailored to pathology and a multidisciplinary approach.

### A practical approach to imaging the axilla [^11497p9L]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

If the initial imaging evaluation of the axilla reveals a suspicious finding, percutaneous procedures, such as ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or ultrasound-guided core biopsy, may be performed. At most institutions, FNA is currently the preferred approach, as the procedure is usually diagnostic and potential complications are minimal, including bleeding, infection, and non-diagnostic samples. FNA is typically performed using 22–25-gauge needles with aspirates sent to cytology. In most cases, at least three passes are made, especially if the cytologist is not on site during the procedure. If lymphoma is of clinical concern, additional aspirates should be obtained for flow cytometry.

However, limitations do exist for FNA, as it can be operator dependent, requires access to reliable cytology, and carries a relatively high false-negative rate of 12–23%. Most commonly performed for suspicious lymphadenopathy, the confirmation of metastatic involvement in a lymph node precludes sentinel lymph node biopsy in females with newly diagnosed breast cancer, leading to full axillary node dissection. In one study of 224 patients, the sensitivity of ultrasound-guided FNA for suspicious, indeterminate, and normal-appearing axillary nodes was 93%, 44%, and 11%, respectively, with an overall sensitivity of 59% and an overall specificity of 100%. The likelihood of a positive FNA correlated directly with the size of the primary breast malignancy, being 29% for tumors 5 cm. Alternatively, percutaneous core needle biopsy…

### Unexplained lymphadenopathy: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113wGzNw]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is benign and self-limited in most patients. Etiologies include malignancy, infection, autoimmune disorders, medications, and iatrogenic causes. The history and physical examination alone usually identify the cause of lymphadenopathy. When the cause is unknown, lymphadenopathy should be classified as localized or generalized.

- **Localized lymphadenopathy**: Patients should be evaluated for etiologies typically associated with the region involved according to lymphatic drainage patterns.

- **Generalized lymphadenopathy**: Defined as two or more involved regions, it often indicates underlying systemic disease.

Risk factors for malignancy include age older than 40 years, male sex, white race, supraclavicular location of the nodes, and the presence of systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. Palpable supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac nodes are abnormal, as are epitrochlear nodes greater than 5 mm in diameter. The workup may include blood tests, imaging, and biopsy depending on clinical presentation, location of the lymphadenopathy, and underlying risk factors. Biopsy options include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or open excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be used to treat acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis, especially in children with systemic symptoms. Corticosteroids have limited usefulness in the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy and should not be used without an appropriate diagnosis.

### Histologic diagnoses in persistently swollen cervical lymph nodes [^114Auiat]. Head & Neck (2012). Low credibility.

Biopsy and histological examination of persistently enlarged cervical lymph nodes represent a major health care issue and have a high impact on further clinical therapy. Tertiary health centers are faced with an increased demand for diagnostic workup to rule out malignancy. We performed a retrospective study from January 2000 to June 2008 to identify patients referred to us for diagnostic biopsy and to document the histopathological result.

- **Methods**: Patients with a diagnostic biopsy, but neither clinical signs of head and neck cancer nor other malignancies, were identified within the records. Patient characteristics and histopathological diagnoses were retrieved.

- **Results**: Three hundred twenty-six patients were identified (146 women and 180 men). One hundred twenty-three patients (38%; 44 women and 79 men) had a malignancy: 61 with metastatic disease and 62 with malignant lymphoma; the youngest was 15 years old and the oldest was 92 years old.

- **Conclusion**: Persistently swollen cervical lymph nodes should trigger a thorough clinical examination and prompt biopsy for histopathological workup.

### Lymph node staging with dual-modality PET/CT: enhancing the diagnostic accuracy in oncology [^114YjmzU]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Lymph node staging according to the TNM criteria is an essential part of tumor evaluation. Several morphological and functional imaging procedures are used complementarily in this setting. Dual-modality PET/CT scanners are able to provide anatomical and functional data sets in a single session with accurate image co-registration. Comparative studies between morphological imaging procedures, such as MRI and CT, with co-registered PET/CT, demonstrated significantly better lymph node staging with PET/CT than with anatomical procedures alone, regardless of the staged body compartment (head and neck, thorax, or abdominal area). Based on more accurate staging results, PET/CT was able to alter the patients' therapy in a significant number of studies.

Functional imaging with FDG-PET ([(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-desoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography) demonstrated outstanding results in lymph node staging of different tumor diseases. By adding anatomical information to PET, PET/CT outperforms PET alone when assessing the TNM stage of different malignant diseases. This paper provides an overview concerning the performance of PET/CT in staging lymph nodes for malignant spread and points out benefits and limitations of this new imaging modality.

### Time for an individualized approach to first-line management of follicular lymphoma [^112Mogk5]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Most patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) present with asymptomatic disease, and the diagnosis is often suspected incidentally during clinical or radiological examinations performed for non-FL related symptoms. When symptomatic, the clinical presentation is dominated by lymphadenopathy or, less frequently, by disease-related complications such as abdominal pain (mesenteric lymphadenopathy) or respiratory signs (cough, shortness of breath, pleural effusion) due to thoracic lymphadenopathy. The general "B" symptoms — fever > 38°C, drenching sweats, and weight loss > 10% — occur in about 20% of patients and should raise suspicion of histological transformation.

Laboratory investigations look for cytopenia, particularly anemia. While bone marrow infiltration is the most common cause, the possibility of autoimmune cytopenia should not be underestimated. The presence of circulating lymphoma cells, found in fewer than 10% of cases, is associated with a shorter progression-free survival (PFS). Lactate dehydrogenase and β2-microglobulin levels are important prognostic markers. Serum electrophoresis should be systematically requested to search for an associated monoclonal protein, and viral serology (hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus) should be determined before any treatment using anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.

The diagnosis of FL is made on a lymph node biopsy or, in the uncommon case of extranodal FL, an organ biopsy. Initial diagnosis via fine needle aspiration or needle biopsy is not recommended.

### Optimal nuclear medicine support in sentinel node detection [^114p4ymx]. Annals of surgical oncology (2001). Low credibility.

The correct identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) is paramount if this technique is to become the standard of care in the management of early disease in surgical oncology. Despite the apparent attraction and ease of this approach, a detailed understanding of its different technical components is vital. High sensitivity, reproducibility, and accuracy levels must be achieved in the identification and discrimination of the SLN if the extent and place of the standard lymph node diagnostic dissections can be challenged. This article reviews the technology and methodology and gives indications of the possible progress to be achieved.

### Individualized surgery: Gamma-probe-guided lymphadenectomy in patients with clinically enlarged lymph node metastases from melanomas [^112tK9TB]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). High credibility.

Clearly, even radical TLND loses its efficacy if occult nodal metastasis is present outside the node dissection field. It therefore seems advisable to remove all radioactive nodes, i.e. the nodes that face a higher risk of being tumor-involved. In the present study, the overall number of excised nodes was higher in the patients with classical TLND than in those with lymphatic mapping (20 versus 14 nodes). Nevertheless, regional control did not appear to be compromised after gamma-guided lymphadenectomy.

The demonstration of occult, ectopic lymph node metastases in this study is the most convincing argument in favor of a more individual approach in lymph node surgery of enlarged regional lymph node metastases. A considerable proportion of the patients suspected to have ambiguous lymphatic drainage from their primary tumor sites did indeed display tumor-draining lymph nodes outside the clinically involved nodal basin. Of the 13 additional nodal sites that were explored successfully, 6 (46%) were involved with occult metastasis. It is noteworthy that we found lymph node metastases outside the clinically involved basin, both in patients with clinically enlarged nodal metastases at initial diagnosis and in those with nodal recurrences.

### Tissue sampling in suspected sarcoidosis: Can we avoid mediastinal procedures [^111Qrt4v]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The approach may have value on a case-by-case basis in scenarios such as whether lymph node sampling should be performed in a patient presenting with asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. As these patients may be reluctant to undergo mediastinal procedures due to invasiveness and risk of complications, ultrasound assessment with a view to cervical lymph node sampling would be more acceptable.

We recommend that pulmonologists and radiologists should be more widely aware of the advantages of this approach and feel that dissemination of this option as an initial diagnostic modality could benefit a large number of patients and offer cost savings.

Finally, and importantly, it provides an attractive option during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic as a diagnostic modality with a lower cross-infection risk.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^115cDFwC]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Rheumatologic diseases with lymphadenopathy**: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is one of the rheumatologic diseases associated with lymphadenopathy. Epidemiological data report a prevalence of lymphadenopathy in SLE patients ranging from 33% to 69%. Enlarged lymph nodes in SLE tend to be soft and non-tender, more often with a diameter less than 1 cm, which is below the threshold considered enlarged by many physicians.

	- Lymphadenopathy is more frequently reported as generalized, although localized lymphadenopathy has been described in up to 25% of cases and is most frequently observed in younger patients with active disease. In SLE patients, lymphadenopathy has been correlated with a higher frequency of constitutional symptoms, cutaneous involvement, hepatosplenomegaly, increased titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies, and lower complement levels.

	- Moreover, lymphadenopathy tends to resolve with steroid therapy. Although it may rarely represent the initial presenting sign of SLE, lymphadenopathy is not included in SLE classification criteria. Increased lymph node 18F-FDG uptake at PET/CT has been described in a few SLE cases; however, its interpretation is a significant challenge as it may mimic lymphoma.

	- **Histological findings**: The histological findings in lymph node specimens are usually nonspecific, consisting of follicular hyperplasia associated with increased vascularity and scattered immunoblasts and plasma cells. The most specific but variably present histological finding is coagulative necrosis with haematoxylin bodies (amorphous aggregates of periodic acid–Schiff-positive basophilic material) or reactive follicular hyperplasia.

### What is the clinical importance of incidental findings on staging CT scans in patients with sarcoma [^11381eAP]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Low credibility.

Baseline staging CT scans are performed on nearly every patient after the diagnosis of sarcoma to evaluate for the presence of metastatic disease. These scans often identify abnormalities that may or may not be related to the known malignancy. Despite the high frequency of incidental findings, there is little guidance for clinicians on assessing these radiographic abnormalities. The interpretation of incidental findings is crucial, as it may influence decisions regarding surveillance frequency, prognostic estimation, and surgical and medical intervention.

- **Questions/purposes**: The purpose of this study was to determine (1) the frequency of abnormal findings and indeterminate nodules on staging CT scans; (2) the natural history of indeterminate nodules identified at the time of sarcoma diagnosis; and (3) the factors associated with indeterminate nodules representing true metastatic disease.

- **Methods**: Between September 2010 and February 2016, we treated 233 patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Of those, 227 (97%) had a staging CT scan of the chest or chest/abdomen/pelvis performed within 2 months of diagnosis. To be eligible for this retrospective study, a patient had to have a minimum of 6 months of radiographic follow-up after the initial CT scan. A total of 36 (16%) were lost to follow-up or did not have radiographic surveillance at least 6 months later, and 48 (21%) were excluded for other prespecified reasons, leaving 149 patients for evaluation. We recorded all abnormal findings listed in the official radiology CT report of the lung…

### ESGO/ESTRO/ESP guidelines for the management of patients with endometrial carcinoma [^1179VBrT]. International Journal of Gynecological Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for endometrial cancer, particularly concerning the management of local or locoregional disease, lymph node excision, and surgical restaging, ESGO/ESP/ESTRO 2021 guidelines recommend performing surgical lymph node staging in patients with high-intermediate-risk or high-risk disease. Performing a sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered an acceptable alternative to systematic lymphadenectomy for lymph node staging in stage I/II.

### Rapidly growing nodule on the knee [^114WE4km]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: What is the most appropriate next step in management?
	- A. Sentinel lymph node dissection for staging
	- B. Intralesional corticosteroids
	- C. Local radiation
	- D. Clinical observation
	- E. Re-excision with 5-mm margins

- **Answers**:
	- A. Sentinel lymph node dissection for staging – Incorrect. As a benign neoplasm, there is no role for sentinel lymph node dissection or any staging for proliferative fasciitis.

	- B. Intralesional corticosteroids – Incorrect. This pseudosarcomatous lesion would show very little, if any, response to intralesional corticosteroids.

	- C. Local radiation – Incorrect. The treatment for fibrosarcoma depends on clinical staging; however, it often includes adjuvant radiation for larger or high-grade tumors. Anthracyclines are often used as chemotherapy of choice. Because proliferative fasciitis is a benign neoplasm, radiation is not indicated.

	- D. Clinical observation – Correct. Although proliferative fasciitis is rapidly growing and has some histological features that can be initially confused with soft tissue sarcomas because of their cellularity and immature appearance of proliferating cells, this is a benign neoplasm. Although clinical observation is the correct management for this rare entity, it is often excised for biopsy during the diagnostic work-up to rule out malignant conditions on the clinical differential diagnosis.

	- E. Re-excision with 5-mm margins – Incorrect. As a benign neoplasm, clear margins are not required for proliferative fasciitis. Elective excision may be requested by the patient due to appearance and rapid enlargement.

### Lymph node enlargement and risk of haematological and solid cancer [^114hegXX]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Enlarged lymph nodes may be a marker of occult cancer, but accurate data on cancer risk are limited. We used population-based Danish medical registries to assess cancer risk in a cohort of patients with a first-time inpatient or outpatient hospital contact for enlarged lymph nodes during 1994–2008. Observed cancer incidences were compared with those expected in the general population. We observed 1,750 cancers among 11,284 patients with enlarged lymph nodes during a median follow-up of 4.7 years. Only 389 cases were expected. Cancer risk was 11.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 10.9–12.1%] during the first year of follow-up, corresponding to an age- and sex-standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 21.1 (95% CI: 20.0–22.3). One-year SIRs were more than 100 times increased for head and neck cancer and lymphomas. Beyond one year of follow-up, overall cancer risk remained 1.4-fold (95% CI: 1.3–1.5-fold) higher than expected, while the risk of lymphoma remained six to 10 times higher. Cancer risk was also elevated among patients with other conditions known to be associated with enlarged lymph nodes, such as infections and rheumatic disorders. We conclude that enlarged lymph nodes are a marker of occult cancer and long-term risk of cancer.

### Management of patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: An American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1134Tr5y]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of non-small cell lung cancer, specifically in the context of early-stage disease, the ACCP 2025 guidelines recommend considering systematic lymph node sampling or dissection. This includes sampling from at least three mediastinal stations and at least one hilar station in patients undergoing surgical resection of known or suspected clinical stage I and II NSCLC.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1125mgNn]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for sarcoidosis, particularly concerning lymph node biopsy, the ATS 2020 guidelines recommend considering endobronchial ultrasound-guided lymph node sampling rather than mediastinoscopy. This should be the initial procedure for mediastinal and/or hilar lymph node sampling in patients with suspected sarcoidosis and mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy when tissue sampling is necessary.

### EAU guidelines on renal cell carcinoma [^114tYAcq]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for renal cell carcinoma, specifically with respect to management of local or locoregional disease and lymphadenectomy, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend removing clinically enlarged lymph nodes during nephrectomy for staging, prognosis, and follow-up implications.

### Beyond PET/CT in Hodgkin lymphoma: A comprehensive review of the role of imaging at initial presentation, during follow-up and for assessment of treatment-related complications [^113pSD2q]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The most typical presentation of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is painless, enlarged superficial lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss. Patients with intrathoracic lymphadenopathy may present with respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnoea, and chest pain. Chest radiography can be performed as the initial investigation in these patients, providing preliminary information about the involvement of the mediastinum and lungs. Bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy at diagnosis is an unfavourable prognostic factor in patients with HL and can be quantified by using the mediastinal mass ratio. The Cotswolds modification of the Ann Arbor staging system defines bulky disease as a mediastinal mass exceeding one third of the internal transverse diameter of the thorax at the T5/6 intervertebral disc level on a posteroanterior chest radiograph.

Ultrasound (US) is often helpful in confirming enlarged nodes and guiding biopsy, particularly for cervical lymph nodes, the most common nodal group affected in patients with HL. US can be useful for the evaluation of extranodal sites of involvement in the abdomen (e.g. gallbladder, kidney) and for image-guided biopsy of focal lesions in solid organs such as the liver and spleen.

### The added value of SPECT-CT for the identification of sentinel lymph nodes in early stage oral cancer [^1157oD2E]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in early stage oral cancer is increasingly accepted as the standard of care for staging occult lymph node metastasis. Trials in which only neck dissection is performed after positive SLNB have demonstrated that SLNB is a sensitive method for detecting occult cervical lymph node metastases. A meta-analysis found a pooled sensitivity of 91% (95% CI 84–95%) and a negative predictive value of 92–98%; however, some lower sensitivity rates have been reported in recent large studies. In most studies, the procedure had lower accuracy in patients with floor-of-mouth tumors, probably due to the "shine-through phenomenon", where the large injection spot of the primary tumor overshines the eventual sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in level I.

Visualization of SLNs is routinely conducted with dynamic and static planar lymphoscintigraphy using a 99m Tc-labeled colloidal tracer, frequently combined with a blue dye intraoperatively. In our institute, single-photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT-CT) is routinely performed. After the introduction of SPECT-CT for SLNB in oral cancer in 2003 by Even-Sapir et al, most studies conclude that SPECT-CT enhances useful information in the localization of the SLNs and provides additional SLNs, as described in the review by Haerle et al. Studies of SPECT-CT in SLNB, which included different locations of primary tumors, found particular advantages for tumors with close proximity to the SLN and complex lymphatic regions, which is common in the head-and-neck region.

### Imaging and management of internal mammary lymph nodes [^114s6554]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Internal mammary lymph nodes (IMLNs) account for approximately 10%-40% of the lymphatic drainage of the breast. Internal mammary lymph nodes measuring up to 10 mm are commonly seen on high-risk screening breast MRI examinations in patients without breast cancer and are considered benign if no other suspicious findings are present. Benign IMLNs demonstrate a fatty hilum, lobular or oval shape, and circumscribed margins without evidence of central necrosis, cortical thickening, or loss of fatty hilum.

In patients with breast cancer, IMLN involvement can alter clinical stage and treatment planning. The incidence of IMLN metastases detected on US, CT, MRI, and PET-CT ranges from 10%-16%, with MRI and PET-CT demonstrating the highest sensitivities. Although there are no well-defined imaging criteria in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual for Breast Cancer, a long-axis measurement of ≥ 5 mm is suggested as a guideline to differentiate benign versus malignant IMLNs in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer.

Abnormal morphology, such as the loss of fatty hilum, irregular shape, and rounded appearance (which can be quantified by a short-axis/long-axis length ratio greater than 0.5), also raises suspicion for IMLN metastases. MRI and PET-CT have good sensitivity and specificity for the detection of IMLN metastases, but fluorodeoxyglucose avidity can be seen in both benign conditions and metastatic disease.

US is helpful for staging, and US-guided fine-needle aspiration can be performed in cases of suspected IMLN metastasis.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: A pragmatic approach [^111uRjxx]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy represents a major diagnostic challenge because it may be observed in a variety of neoplastic, infectious, and inflammatory diseases. The differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy in rheumatologic disorders is not straightforward; it may be the consequence of a primary immune activation and a benign aspect of the natural history of the immune-mediated condition, represent an infectious complication of immunosuppressive therapies, correlate to an unrelated immune process (i.e. vaccination), or indicate a lymphoproliferative transformation or metastasis from distant solid cancers requiring immediate management.

History should focus on the presence of localized signs or symptoms that may hint towards infection or malignancy (e.g. presence of a wound or a suspicious nodule, respectively), as well as on potential exposures associated with infection (e.g. contact with animals, undercooked food, risk factors). The presence of constitutional symptoms such as low-grade fever (i.e. 38°C) is most commonly associated with infections. An accurate drug history is also helpful because of medications potentially causing serum sickness. Finally, the acute onset of lymph node enlargement is more suggestive of an infectious and iatrogenic cause, while subacute or insidious onset points towards malignant and inflammatory causes.

- **Physical examination**: Localized swelling typically points towards an infectious condition in the area of nod.

### Periportal lymphadenopathy in patients without identifiable pancreatobiliary or hepatic malignancy [^112P9gdC]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Enlarged periportal lymph nodes often are noticed during imaging of the upper abdomen. Malignant infiltration and enlargement of periportal nodes occur in patients with cancers of the liver, gallbladder, biliary tree, pancreas, and lymphoma. However, there are no published data on the significance and differential diagnosis of enlarged periportal lymph nodes in patients without the above-mentioned cancers.

- **Methods**: We searched our database for patients who (1) underwent endoscopic ultrasound for evaluation of enlarged periportal nodes or (2) were found to have enlarged periportal lymph nodes (≥ 10 mm) during endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) examination. Patients with identifiable pancreatic, biliary, gallbladder, or liver cancers were excluded. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration of one or more nodes was performed.

- **Results**: Sixty-four patients with periportal lymph nodes 10–40 mm in size met the inclusion criteria. In 24 patients, enlarged periportal nodes were noted in the computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Fifty-one patients had multiple enlarged periportal nodes. Concurrently, enlargement was seen in peripancreatic nodes (n = 14), celiac nodes (n = 14), and mediastinal nodes (n = 11). Twelve of the 64 patients (18.8%; 95% confidence interval, 9.2%-28.4%) had a malignant cause of enlarged periportal lymph nodes: 5 with metastatic carcinoma and 7 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Significant cytologic findings in benign nodes included granulomas (n = 4) and lipogranulomatosis (n = 8).

- **Conclusions**: A significant number of patients were found to have underlying conditions associated with enlarged periportal lymph nodes, necessitating further investigation into their clinical significance.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for lymphogranuloma venereum, and more specifically with respect to lymph node biopsy, the BASHH 2013 guidelines recommend that histology of lymph nodes shows follicular hyperplasia and abscesses in patients with LGV. However, such findings are not specific. Nonetheless, histopathologists need to be alert to these changes and include LGV in the differential diagnosis.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: A pragmatic approach [^1127REw2]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

**Rheumatology key messages**: Lymph node enlargement is common in rheumatological and autoimmune diseases, frequently associated with disease activity. Lymphadenopathy observed in the rheumatology practice should always consider malignancy and infection as the primary causes. Rare diseases such as IgG4-related disease and Castleman disease must be considered in the differential diagnosis.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: A pragmatic approach [^116MnaDB]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common clinical finding and diagnostic challenge within general medicine and rheumatology practice. It may represent a primary manifestation of an underlying immune-mediated disease or indicate an infectious or neoplastic complication requiring differing management. Evaluating lymphadenopathy is of particular relevance in rheumatology, given that lymph node enlargement is a common finding within the clinical spectrum of several well-known rheumatologic disorders, including RA, SLE, and SS. In addition, lymphadenopathy represents a hallmark manifestation of rare immunological diseases such as Castleman disease and IgG4-related disease, which must be considered in the differential diagnosis because effective targeted treatments can now impact the prognosis of these conditions.

In this review, we present an overview of the clinical significance of lymphadenopathy in common and rare rheumatologic diseases and propose a practical approach to lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice. Differential diagnosis of Castleman disease and therapeutic options for this condition of increasing rheumatologic interest will be discussed in detail.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: A pragmatic approach [^117Pp1Cj]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis affects multiple organs, but lymphadenopathy is its most frequent clinical manifestation. Hilar lymphadenopathy occurs in over 90% of cases, while peripheral lymphadenopathy is observed in 20–45% of cases. Lymph nodes are usually moderately swollen, painless, and show bilateral involvement in the cervical, axillary, inguinal, and epitrochlear regions. A recent retrospective multicentric study found hilar lymphadenopathy to be significantly less frequent in patients with neurological, gastrointestinal, and nephrological involvement. In contrast, peripheral lymphadenopathy was significantly more common in patients with concomitant hepatosplenic and bone involvement.

Histologically, sarcoidosis typically presents with non-necrotizing granulomas formed by epithelioid histiocytes, small lymphocytes, and Langherans-type giant cells. Only about 10% of cases show small areas of fibrinoid necrosis. Histological samples are often obtained from intrathoracic lymph nodes via endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-based techniques. Although insufficient for diagnosis, some sonographic features at EBUS can be predictive of sarcoidosis, such as the absence of coagulation necrosis, nodal conglomeration, and the septal vessel sign in color Doppler mode.

Needle sampling of cervical lymph nodes, identified by neck ultrasound, is emerging as a potential alternative diagnostic tool, particularly when EBUS is poorly tolerated or inaccessible.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113GP4hG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Should patients with suspected sarcoidosis and mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy, for whom it has been determined that tissue sampling is necessary, undergo EBUS-guided lymph node sampling or mediastinoscopy as the initial mediastinal and/or hilar lymph node sampling procedure**: Tissue sampling is often helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected sarcoidosis. It begins with the least-risky and least-invasive method, such as sampling skin or peripheral lymph node (e.g. axillary lymph node) abnormalities suggestive of sarcoidosis. However, most new sarcoidosis cases lack skin and peripheral lymph node findings, and invasive testing is pursued from the start. The superiority of EBUS-guided lymph node sampling over transbronchial lung biopsy in pulmonary sarcoidosis has already been established. The committee asked whether EBUS-guided lymph node sampling or mediastinoscopy is preferable.

- **Summary of evidence**: Our systematic review identified 703 potentially relevant articles; the full text of 64 was reviewed, and 29 were selected. There were no studies comparing EBUS-guided sampling to mediastinoscopy; all studies were non-randomized studies that reported the diagnostic yield and other outcomes of either EBUS-guided lymph node sampling or mediastinoscopy in patients with suspected sarcoidosis.

EBUS-guided lymph node sampling had a diagnostic yield of 87% (95% CI, 91–94%). Among the diagnostic samples, 98% confirmed sarcoidosis, and 2% found an alternative diagnosis, including lymphoma, TB, and lung cancer.

### Mediastinal incidentalomas [^113Kd5AC]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Incidental mediastinal lymphadenopathy challenges pulmonologists to decide on eventual further diagnostic steps. The aim of this study was to characterize unexpected mediastinal findings by imaging and pathologic analysis.

- **Methods**: Entry criterion for this prospective explorative study was mediastinal lymphadenopathy as an incidental finding on computed tomography (CT) scans made for indications other than the analysis and staging of neoplasms. Lymph node dimensions were measured on CT scans. Subsequent diagnostic investigations were positron emission tomography, endoscopic ultrasound- or endobronchial ultrasound-guided punctures, and clinical follow-up.

- **Results**: Eighty-three patients from eight hospitals met the entry criteria. The median number of Naruke stations with enlarged nodes was 7 (range 3–9). The median size of all nodes measured varied between 6 and 14 mm. The median number of lymph node stations with nodes of at least 10 mm was 3 (range 0–8). Hilar node enlargement was detected in 77% of patients. No definitive diagnosis was obtained in 7 of 83 (8%) patients. Lymphocytes were found in 55 of 83 (66%) and sarcoidosis in 18 of 83 (22%) of aspirates. Positron emission tomography showed metabolic activity in 87% of patients. Follow-up CT scans were available for 36 of 62 (58%) patients without a classifying diagnosis. Two patients developed lung cancer 2 years after initial analysis.

- **Conclusions**: Incidental mediastinal lymph nodes on CT are characterized by multiplicity, relatively small sizes, and coexistence with hilar lymphadenopathy in the majority.

### Imaging of lymphadenopathy in the neck [^111HVVax]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Imaging plays a major role in the assessment of cervical lymphadenopathy. In infectious diseases, evaluating abscess formation and its relation to surrounding vital structures is crucial for management. In head and neck malignancies, imaging assists in staging. Neck imaging for assessing nodal metastases can detect occult metastases or assess the operability of palpable metastases. While imaging cannot depict micrometastases, it helps reduce the risk of occult metastases, influencing management. A very sensitive technique is necessary for this purpose. Current radiological criteria are not sensitive enough to significantly reduce the risk of occult metastases; thus, more sensitive CT and MRI criteria, and especially ultrasound-guided aspiration, should be employed to assess the clinically negative neck.

### PET-CT for assessing mediastinal lymph node involvement in patients with suspected resectable non-small cell lung cancer [^117FeWXw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

A major determinant of treatment offered to patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is their intrathoracic (mediastinal) nodal status. If the disease has not spread to the ipsilateral mediastinal nodes, subcarinal (N2) nodes, or both, and the patient is otherwise considered fit for surgery, resection is often the treatment of choice. Planning the optimal treatment is therefore critically dependent on accurate staging of the disease. PET-CT (positron emission tomography-computed tomography) is a non-invasive staging method of the mediastinum, which is increasingly available and used by lung cancer multidisciplinary teams. Although the non-invasive nature of PET-CT constitutes one of its major advantages, PET-CT may be suboptimal in detecting malignancy in normal-sized lymph nodes and in ruling out malignancy in patients with coexisting inflammatory or infectious diseases.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of integrated PET-CT for mediastinal staging of patients with suspected or confirmed NSCLC that is potentially suitable for treatment with curative intent.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to 30 April 2013: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via OvidSP (from 1946), Embase via OvidSP (from 1974), PreMEDLINE via OvidSP, OpenGrey, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, and the trials register www.clinicaltrials.gov. There were no language or publication status restrictions on the search. We also contacted researchers in the field, checked reference lists, and conducted citation searches (with an end-date of 9 July 2013) of relevant studies.

### Performance of MRI for standardized lymph nodes assessment in breast cancer: Are we ready for Node-RADS [^111kJkrh]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The present study serves as a fundamental step towards introducing a Node-RADS scoring system for assessing regional lymph nodes in breast cancer patients. Notably, the Node-RADS score demonstrated its significance as an independent predictor of lymph node involvement even after adjusting for multiple variables through a multivariable analysis.

Moreover, the Node-RADS score showed moderate-to-high overall accuracy in identifying lymph node involvement (LNI), and the Node-RADS > 2 can be considered the best cut-off for discriminating malignant nodes.

This indicates that the scoring system can effectively aid in identifying suspicious lymph nodes, staging the disease, establishing a standardized language for communicating the presence of such nodes, and avoiding unnecessary biopsies. This facilitates making appropriate treatment decisions for breast cancer patients based on the level of suspicion regarding lymph node status. It suggests no need for further evaluation for Node-RADS scores of 1 or 2, while recommending biopsy before surgery for scores of 3, 4, and 5, with the use of clip positioning.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114kxAdp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The committee acknowledged that most patients with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy will be confirmed to have sarcoidosis, especially among those presenting with Löfgren's syndrome, lupus pernio, or Heerfordt's syndrome. In asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy cases, sampling will be nondiagnostic in a substantial number of patients, and an alternative diagnosis (e.g. malignancy or infections) will be identified in a few cases, but those few cases may have important treatment implications. Factors to consider when weighing the risks and benefits of biopsy may include regional prevalence of alternative infectious etiologies; patient-specific risk factors for malignancy, infection, or enhanced procedural risk; enlarging lymph nodes; likelihood of obtaining close follow-up; and patient preference. Finally, the availability of a maximally safe, efficacious, and cost-effective means of biopsy procedure is considered. Thus, the committee concluded that the decision to biopsy asymptomatic patients with bilateral hilar adenopathy should be made on a case-by-case basis.

- **Recommendations**:
	1. In patients for whom there is a high clinical suspicion for sarcoidosis (e.g. Löfgren's syndrome, lupus pernio, or Heerfordt's syndrome), we suggest not sampling lymph nodes (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Remarks: Patients who do not undergo lymph node sampling require close clinical follow-up.
	2. For patients presenting with asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, we make no recommendations for, or against obtaining a lymph node sample.

### Man with recurrent necrotic papules [^114kxfJQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Question 2: After initial diagnosis, which of the following would be a reasonable next step in management?

A. Lymph node biopsy
B. Complete blood cell count and chest radiography
C. Bone marrow biopsy
D. Intralesional interferon alfa
E. Multiagent chemotherapy

- **Answers**:
	- **A. Lymph node biopsy — Incorrect**. A lymph node biopsy would be reasonable if a clinically enlarged lymph node greater than 1.5 cm were palpable or detected on radiologic imaging.
	- **B. Complete blood cell count and chest radiography — Correct**. Patients with LyP, including LyP type E, often have an indolent and spontaneously resolving course. Minimally invasive studies to rule out systemic lymphomas may be considered and include complete blood cell counts with a differential diagnosis, blood chemistry, or lactate dehydrogenase. Second lymphoid malignancies can occur concomitantly or precede the onset of LyP.
	- **C. Bone marrow biopsy — Incorrect**. A bone marrow biopsy may be considered for individuals who have evidence of bone marrow involvement, as observed in initial serologic studies.
	- **D. Intralesional interferon alfa — Incorrect**. LyP subtypes, including LyP type E, do not routinely require therapy. If patients have extensive or scarring lesions, topical steroids, phototherapy, or methotrexate may be useful initial interventions.
	- **E. Multiagent chemotherapy — Incorrect**. Multiagent chemotherapy is not indicated for LyP and should be avoided because of an inability to provide a durable response, as well as adverse effects and long-term complications.

### Introducing the node reporting and data system 1.0 (Node-RADS): A concept for standardized assessment of lymph nodes in cancer [^1117ErfR]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Evaluation of lymph nodes for the likelihood of disease involvement is important in the context of cancer staging because nodal involvement is a powerful adverse prognostic indicator that often determines patient management, frequently distinguishing surgical candidates from those best suited for non-surgical management. In most cases, the incidence of nodal involvement increases with tumor bulk and stage and is dependent on tumor histological type and grade.

Even though numerous studies have evaluated morphologic criteria in computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound (US), practically there is still no consensus on which criteria should be used, although nodal size is generally accepted. Paralleling approaches to assess size include short- and long-axis diameters, as well as volumetric measurements. However, lymph node size is a poor indicator for predicting the presence of secondary malignancy. In a study focusing on mesorectal lymph nodes in rectal cancer patients, Gina Brown and colleagues showed a broad size overlap between histologically benign (2–10 mm) and malignant (3–15 mm) lymph nodes.

Furthermore, using nodal size as a criterion for metastatic involvement can be confusing in the head and neck (HN) region as benign nodes have different sizes depending on patient age and anatomic location. For example, submandibular nodes are typically larger than lymph nodes in other neck groups (sometimes called stations/levels). The choice of the size cutoff will influence sensitivity and specificity for the detection of nodal involvement.

### Introducing the node reporting and data system 1.0 (Node-RADS): A concept for standardized assessment of lymph nodes in cancer [^112hgBN3]. European Radiology (2021). High credibility.

There is an ongoing debate about the setting of limits for physiologic and pathologic size of lymph nodes. Ultimately, any chosen size cutoffs depend on the desired sensitivity and specificity concerning the stage of the primary tumor and/or clinical status of patients. Many radiologists do not consider nodal size to be an absolute criterion for the assessment of likely malignant involvement. However, since the size of lymph nodes is a criterion that is widely used and is incorporated into the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria for response assessment studies, Node-RADS divides nodal sizes into three categories: "normal", "enlarged", and "bulk".

In general, a lymph node is defined to have a "normal" size when its short-axis diameter is < 10 mm. Node-RADS defines exceptions for normal size for inguinal nodes, which could measure < 15 mm in short-axis diameter. On the other hand, Node-RADS sets a lower cutoff for specific subregions, where the normal short-axis diameter should be < 5 mm: facial, parotid, retroauricular, occipital, retropharyngeal, anterior jugular, retrocrural, cardio-phrenic, mesenteric, obturator, and mesorectal lymph nodes. A "bulk" is defined as a lymph node with the longest diameter of ≥ 30 mm measured in any dimension. Since there are no generally accepted measurements for the term "bulk", especially outside of lymphomas, we were guided by the TNM classification for head and neck cancer, where a lymph node diameter of 30 mm is the threshold for N2 (with the exception of HPV-positive oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal).

### Frequency and prognostic significance of preoperatively detected enlarged regional lymph nodes in patients with pathological stage I non-small cell lung cancer following resection [^114ZNqqQ]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

To explore the clinical significance of enlarged regional lymph nodes in patients with pathological stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we retrospectively reviewed the tumor registry of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) Staging Database. This database included 6,995 patients from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2000, with clinical stage I, II, and IIIA tumors (cT1–2N0–2M0, excluding T3N0–2M0 cases) who were found to have pathological stage I NSCLC (T1–2N0M0, pStage I). We reported the frequency of enlarged nodes in patients with pStage I disease and compared the overall survival of these patients with enlarged regional lymph nodes to those with normal size regional lymph nodes.

Enlarged regional lymph nodes (cN1–2) were observed in approximately 12% of patients with pStage I disease. The median survival for patients with enlarged versus normal nodes was 102 months versus 107 months, respectively (hazard ratio 1.16, p = 0.01). Notably, survival curves for these groups converged at 8 years postsurgery.

In conclusion, enlarged regional lymph nodes are uncommon in patients with pStage I NSCLC, and the size of regional lymph nodes in these early-stage patients does not seem to provide clinically useful prognostic information.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: A pragmatic approach [^111BfqA5]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a frequent clinical finding in rheumatology practice and can often be interpreted as a clinical marker of disease activity. Moreover, lymphadenopathy can be the initial or more prominent manifestation of rare rheumatologic diseases, such as IgG4-RD and CD, the complications of which are potentially life-threatening. Early recognition and prompt treatment of these diseases may significantly impact mortality and morbidity. Nevertheless, since rheumatologic patients are at higher risk of infectious and neoplastic complications, a careful differential diagnosis is of the utmost importance.

### Mediastinal lymph node enlargement in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: relationships with disease progression and pulmonary function trends [^111H8yZQ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The prognosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most fatal among idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, is generally poor with an estimated survival between 3 and 5 years from the time of diagnosis. Despite two antifibrotic drugs, nintedanib and pirfenidone, having been proven to slow down the functional decline in IPF, most patients still deteriorate despite treatment. As such, accurate monitoring of disease progression in IPF is crucial for predicting prognosis and optimizing management, including the appropriate timing of supportive care and the prompt referral for lung transplantation.

Clinical findings, pulmonary function measures, and computed tomography findings have been extensively studied to predict survival in IPF, either individually or by using composite scoring indices; however, prognostication remains challenging in the individual patient due to the heterogeneity of IPF and the significant intra-patient variability of disease behavior. Measurement of forced vital capacity (FVC) via spirometry has been accepted as the most feasible and reliable tool to monitor disease progression in these patients in clinical practice as well as in randomized controlled trials. However, it has not been proven of great utility in predicting future loss of pulmonary function.

Visual evaluation and computer-based quantification of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) lung parenchymal patterns of fibrosis have been demonstrated to be strong predictors of outcome, particularly in IPF patients. However, their use in clinical practice is still limited.

### Mediastinal lymph node enlargement in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Relationships with disease progression and pulmonary function trends [^113gKh88]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In our cohort, a "diffuse" lymph node involvement — as defined by three or more enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes — was strongly associated with lower survival rates, in line with previous findings. Sin and coworkers demonstrated the impact of mediastinal LNE on survival in an equally-sized IPF cohort with a comparable size and similar proportion of patients showing lymph node enlargement on CT. Notably, the large majority of patients in our study received antifibrotic treatment after diagnosis, suggesting that the presence of multiple mediastinal lymphadenopathies may predict poorer prognosis despite treatment.

Importantly, our study provided the first evidence regarding the relationships between mediastinal LNE and disease progression expressed by means of functional decline. The involvement of three or more lymph nodes was found to be associated with an increased risk of disease progression, as defined by a significant drop (≥ 10%) in percent predicted FVC, suggesting that diffuse mediastinal LNE represents a marker of more aggressive disease behavior in these patients. Patients with a higher number of lymph nodal stations involved also showed decreased annual trends of pulmonary function and gas diffusion capacity, although the slopes of change were not found significantly different compared to patients with no or lesser lymph node involvement. Whilst our study was not powered to detect the impact of LNE on continuous change in pulmonary function parameters in a treated IPF population with reduced progression rates, these findings further support the hypothesis that major lymph node enlargement indicates a more severe disease course.

### Ultrasound imaging of the axilla [^115gHNt1]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Sonographic assessment of lymph nodes requires a step-by-step evaluation of multiple morphological parameters; in this sense, the authors suggest in daily practice to strictly refer to a standardized checklist (Table 2). The shape of a lymph node is usually correlated with the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse diameter (L/T ratio). In this regard, a flattened lymph node with L/T > 2 is often identified in benign lymphadenopathy (Additional file 9: Video 9); instead, a rounded lymph node with L/T < 2 can be related to a malignant condition (Additional file 10: Video 10).

The normal sonographic pattern of a lymph node presents a central hyperechoic area called the hilum and a peripheral hypoechoic portion — the cortex. The high echogenicity of the hilum is related to the presence of multiple acoustic interfaces generated by arterial/venous vessels, lymphatic channels, and fat tissue (Fig. 9). Of note, sclerolipomatosis is a frequent benign condition characterized by a progressive increase of the fat tissue surrounding the feeding vessels of the lymph node, and the corresponding sonographic pattern shows a large hyperechoic central area surrounded by a thin hypoechoic cortical tissue. Benign lymphadenopathy usually preserves the inner hyperechoic hilum, unlike malignant conditions where it is poorly visible or absent (Fig. 10).

- **Sonographic assessment of lymph nodes**: Focal areas of necrosis, calcific depositions, and extracapsular invasion. Convex indentations of the fatty hilum ("rat bite" sign), concentric hilar compression, and lateral displacement.

### An update on the minimally invasive diagnosis of lymphoma for the chest physicians [^1114x662]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Mediastinal lymphadenopathy has a broad differential diagnosis that includes lymphoma. The preferred biopsy technique for mediastinal lymph nodes is transbronchial needle aspiration, which has mixed results in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic yields. There are also limitations with subtyping lymphomas with needle aspiration alone, which can be a barrier to determining management strategies.

Invasive mediastinal lymph node sampling, such as mediastinoscopy, provides higher yields and preserved lymph node architecture for both diagnosis and subtyping of lymphoma, but it carries a higher risk of morbidity and complications. Novel techniques that may increase the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of lymphoma are core biopsy needles, intranodal forcep biopsy, and intranodal cryobiopsy. The evidence is limited due to a relatively small number of cases, so further research is needed to standardize best practices for the bronchoscopic diagnosis of lymphoma.

Pleural effusions in lymphoma can be present in up to 30% of cases, with the majority being non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The presence of exudative effusion in the setting of an existing or prior diagnosis of lymphoma should raise clinical suspicions. Other less common subtypes of lymphoma presenting as primary pleural effusions are explored as well.

### Lymphadenopathy and malignancy [^113hHaki]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with peripheral lymphadenopathy have easily identifiable causes that are benign or self-limited. Among primary care patients with lymphadenopathy, the prevalence of malignancy has been estimated to be as low as 1.1 percent. The critical challenge for the primary care physician is to identify which cases are secondary to malignancies or other serious conditions.

- **Risk factors for malignancy**: Include older age, firm and fixed nodal character, duration of greater than two weeks, and supraclavicular location. Knowledge of these risk factors is critical to determining the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy. In addition, a complete exposure history, review of associated symptoms, and a thorough regional examination help determine whether lymphadenopathy is of benign or malignant origin.

- **Management of unexplained lymphadenopathy**: Unexplained lymphadenopathy without signs or symptoms of serious disease or malignancy can be observed for one month, after which specific testing or biopsy should be performed. While modern hematopathologic technologies have improved the diagnostic yields of fine-needle aspiration, excisional biopsy remains the initial diagnostic procedure of choice.

The overall evaluation of lymphadenopathy, with a focus on findings suggestive of malignancy, as well as an approach to the patient with unexplained lymphadenopathy, will be reviewed.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^111Zafm9]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common clinical finding and diagnostic challenge within general medicine and rheumatology practice. It may represent a primary manifestation of an underlying immune-mediated disease or indicate an infectious or neoplastic complication requiring differing management. Evaluating lymphadenopathy is of particular relevance in rheumatology, given that lymph node enlargement is a common finding within the clinical spectrum of several well-known rheumatologic disorders, including RA, SLE, and SS.

In addition, lymphadenopathy represents a hallmark manifestation of rare immunological diseases such as Castleman disease and IgG4-related disease, which must be considered in the differential diagnosis because effective targeted treatments can now impact the prognosis of these conditions. In this review, we present an overview of the clinical significance of lymphadenopathy in common and rare rheumatologic diseases and propose a practical approach to lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice. Differential diagnosis of Castleman disease and therapeutic options for this condition of increasing rheumatologic interest will be discussed in detail.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: A pragmatic approach [^114uqHqG]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding in the setting of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), being reported in 30–55% of cases. Swollen lymph nodes are usually painless, with a diameter of 1–3 cm, though they can grow as large as 5 cm. In this context, lymphadenopathy may become symptomatic due to compression of adjacent structures (e.g. hydronephrosis due to ureter compression, lower limbs edema due to inferior vena cava or iliac vein compression). Lymphadenopathy is frequently generalized, and the most commonly involved lymph node stations are mediastinal, axillary, intra-abdominal, cervical, and inguinal.

Lymphadenopathy can be documented in IgG4-RD in four main clinical contexts. First, enlarged lymph nodes are incidentally found in the excision specimen of extranodal tissue demonstrating IgG4-RD features. Second, lymphadenopathy may be documented incidentally with physical examination or imaging during the diagnostic workup of extranodal disease. Third, lymphadenopathy may arise weeks to years after the diagnosis of extranodal disease. Fourth, generalized lymphadenopathy may be the first presenting symptom of IgG4-RD, weeks to years before extranodal disease appears.

Recently, IgG4-RD has been arrayed into four clinical phenotypes, based on the observation of patterns of clinical presentation. These groups are: (Group 1) pancreato-hepatobiliary disease (31% of patients), (Group 2) retroperitoneum and aorta (24%), (Group 3) head and neck–limited (24%), and (Group 4) Mikulicz's syndrome with systemic involvement (22%). Lymphadenopathy is more frequently encountered in Group 4, with 67% of patients presenting this feature.

### Lymphoma: An update on evolving trends in staging and management [^111PiM6x]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Because lymphoma frequently manifests as a neck mass, otolaryngologists are often the first to evaluate and diagnose it. Excisional biopsy of lymph nodes generally provides the definitive diagnosis. After diagnosis, however, the otolaryngologist's involvement generally wanes as subsequent treatment is provided by an oncology team. Nevertheless, it is important for the otolaryngologist to be familiar with concepts in the comprehensive evaluation and treatment of lymphoma patients. This knowledge allows participation in and facilitation of timely testing, which helps avoid undue delays between the documentation of physical findings and the initiation of treatment.

Otolaryngologists also need to be current on recent developments in the treatment of lymphomas to answer questions regarding staging and prognosis, make proper referrals, and help patients understand controversies and treatment practices.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® imaging of the axilla [^115mNHuj]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). High credibility.

This publication reviews the evidence supporting the imaging approach of the axilla in various scenarios, with broad differential diagnoses ranging from inflammatory to malignant etiologies. Controversies surrounding the management of axillary adenopathy result in disagreement on the appropriate axillary imaging tests. Ultrasound is often the appropriate initial imaging test in several clinical scenarios.

Clinical information, such as age, physical examinations, and risk factors, as well as a complete breast evaluation with mammogram, tomosynthesis, or MRI, can impact the type of initial imaging test for the axilla. Several impactful clinical trials demonstrated that selected patient populations can receive sentinel lymph node biopsy instead of axillary lymph node dissection with similar overall survival. Axillary lymph node dissection is a safe alternative as the nodal staging procedure for clinically node-negative patients or even for some node-positive patients with limited nodal tumor burden. This approach is not universally accepted, which adversely affects the type of imaging tests considered appropriate for the axilla.

This document focuses on the initial imaging of the axilla in various scenarios, with the understanding that subsequent additional tests may also be performed for the breast. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical evidence.

### Mediastinal lymph node enlargement in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Relationships with disease progression and pulmonary function trends [^1146Zrdk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Evidence of mediastinal lymph node enlargement (LNE) on CT scan is a common finding in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The study aimed to investigate whether the involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes is associated with accelerated disease progression and explored the changes occurring in mediastinal lymph nodes during the radiological follow-up of these patients.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included IPF patients referred to a single ILD center in Italy. A consensus-based assessment of mediastinal LNE on chest CT scan was performed by two thoracic radiologists. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess hazard ratios for mortality and disease progression (defined as categorical FVC decline ≥ 10%). The annualized rates of change in functional parameters for each patient were calculated using mixed linear models.

- **Results**: The study population consisted of 152 IPF patients, of whom 135 (89%) received antifibrotic treatment for IPF during the study follow-up. Patients having evidence of three or more enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes on baseline CT scan showed increased rates of mortality (HR 5.03, 95% CI 1.86–13.62, p ≤ 0.001) and significant disease progression (HR 2.99, 95% CI 1.22–7.33, p = 0.17) as compared to patients without LNE, after adjusting for GAP stage. Among 62 patients with LNE who underwent a follow-up CT scan of the chest and received antifibrotic treatment, 57 (92%) maintained evidence of mediastinal LNE over time.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114UoqtB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The committee weighed the observations that mediastinoscopy has a higher diagnostic yield than EBUS-guided lymph node biopsy (98% and 87%, respectively), but EBUS-guided lymph node biopsy is less invasive than mediastinoscopy. They recognized a probable underestimation of the risk of mediastinoscopy given the bias toward reporting only severe complications, implying that less severe complications, like vocal cord damage and their associated costs and inconveniences, were not counted. In lieu of rigorous data directly comparing complication rates of mediastinoscopy to EBUS specifically among patients with suspected sarcoidosis, the committee considered a recent systematic review of 9 studies (960 cases) comparing complications of mediastinoscopy and EBUS among patients undergoing mediastinal staging of lung cancer. The systematic review found a statistically higher complication rate for mediastinoscopy.

The committee also agreed that costs are typically lower for procedures such as EBUS that are performed in an endoscopy room compared with an operating room for mediastinoscopy, and that EBUS is better tolerated than mediastinoscopy because general anesthesia may be avoided, although dissenting opinions exist. Finally, the committee noted the ease of adding transbronchial biopsy when lymphadenopathy is accompanied by radiographic findings of parenchymal disease or endobronchial biopsy when mucosal abnormalities are noted during endoscopy, which further increase the yield of bronchoscopy with EBUS.

### Defining the role of modern imaging techniques in assessing lymph nodes for metastasis in cancer: Evolving contribution of PET in this setting [^114jKpKk]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Accurate characterization of lymph nodes in patients with cancer, as well as in those presenting with unexplained lymphadenopathy, is crucial for appropriate treatment planning and determining prognosis. Size measurements remain the most frequently used method for distinguishing between malignant and non-malignant lymph nodes; however, they are not sufficiently accurate. To enhance the evaluation of lymph nodes, there is a pressing need for imaging modalities that extend beyond anatomical assessment to allow visualization and quantification of physiological and biochemical processes at the cellular level. This review examines and discusses the use of functional imaging techniques in the evaluation of lymph nodes.

- **Preoperative imaging**: The acquisition protocol should include the following:

	- **Positioning**: Adequate anterior hyper-extension of the neck is required, as long as tolerated by the patient, to accurately evaluate the neck levels, especially level I.

	- **Dynamic acquisition**: Acquire immediate dynamic images of the neck in anterior view (within 5 minutes post-injection), with the dynamic study encompassing at least the first 10–15 minutes. This part of the imaging process is used to identify lymphatic vessels that drain the tumour.

	- **Early static images**: Anterior and lateral views should be acquired shortly after dynamic acquisition. Both of the above-described acquisition steps are particularly important to visualize the lymphatic pathways, making it possible to distinguish between SLNs and second-tier lymph nodes. To improve the quality of imaging, the distance between the collimator and the neck should be minimal. Also, an adequate zoom-factor (×1.5) should be used. This part of the imaging process is used to identify the LNs that receive direct drainage from the tumour.

	- **Late images**: A late static image at 60–120 minutes post-injection using the same views as in the early static images should be acquired, at least anterior views if SPECT/CT is also performed. This part of the imaging process is used to identify additional LNs that receive a somewhat slower direct drainage from the tumour. Importantly, comparing early and late images provides a crucial tool needed to distinguish between the surgically relevant SLNs and irrelevant higher echelon nodes.

### What is the role of imaging at primary diagnostic work-up in uterine cervical cancer [^113JAzhW]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Low credibility.

In locally advanced cervical cancer or in early-stage disease with suspicious lymph nodes on pelvic MRI or TVS/TRS, contrast-enhanced (CE) computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis is widely employed at primary diagnostic work-up for the detection of lymph node metastases and distant spread. CT images are typically acquired in the axial/transverse plane, perpendicular to the long axis of the body, and the images may be reformatted in various planes. Intravenous contrast is normally recommended unless contraindicated.

Primary tumors, when visible on CE CT, are typically depicted as slightly hypodense or isodense relative to the surrounding stromal and myometrial tissue. For local staging, CE CT has long been regarded as inferior to MRI and TVS due to its lower soft-tissue contrast resolution. Thus, recent indices for the diagnostic performance of CT for the assessment of large tumor size and deep stromal invasion are not reported in the literature. For CT assessment of parametrial invasion and pelvic lymph node metastases, the reported sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies are 14–55%, 77–100%, and 74–82%, respectively, for parametrial invasion, and 31–58%, 92–97%, and not reported (NR) for pelvic lymph node metastases. These findings illustrate that pelvic CT has limitations in accurately defining pelvic tumor extent in cervical cancer.

However, as published studies including meta-analyses comparing PET-CT and CT are limited by substantial between-study heterogeneity, the new ESGO-ESTRO-ESP joint guideline concludes that there is currently insufficient evidence to justify recommending PET-CT before CT.

### Durable responses in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma on sequential dual-agent immunotherapy after progressing on single-agent immunotherapy [^113Tbo4G]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

- **Case study**:
	- CT scans throughout the treatment course provide insight into the durable responses observed in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma undergoing sequential dual-agent immunotherapy.

	- **Initial assessment**:
		At the initiation of dual immunotherapy, a CT scan revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the celiac axis, with the index lymph node measuring 32 mm in the short axis.

	- **Three-month follow-up**:
		After three months of dual immunotherapy, there was a mild increase in the size of the index lymph node to 34 mm. Despite this slight enlargement, dual immunotherapy was continued.

	- **Six-month follow-up**:
		A follow-up at six months showed a decrease in the size of the index lymph node to 24 mm. This finding suggests that the earlier enlargement might have been pseudoprogression, as other clinical markers had improved.

### Current concepts in lymph node imaging [^116KAgic]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The accurate identification and characterization of lymph nodes by imaging hold significant therapeutic and prognostic importance in patients with newly diagnosed cancers. The presence of nodal metastases limits therapeutic options and generally indicates a worse prognosis in patients. Thus, having this information before commencing therapy is crucial.

Cross-sectional imaging modalities rely on insensitive size and morphologic criteria, lacking the desired accuracy for characterizing lymph nodes. This is mainly because metastases can be present in non-enlarged lymph nodes, and not all enlarged nodes are malignant. PET has overcome some of these limitations but is still constrained by resolution limits for small nodal metastases. This has fueled the development of targeted techniques for nodal imaging and characterization as outlined in this article. In recent years, studies have demonstrated that these newer imaging techniques can bridge some limitations of existing methods for nodal characterization, thus providing the much-needed staging information before the initiation of therapy.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^114xGGuo]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for breast cancer, especially in the context of early-stage management, the ASCO 2025 guidelines suggest considering the omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy in selected patients. This applies to those with small (≤ 2 cm) breast cancer and negative findings on preoperative axillary lymph node ultrasound, provided they meet all of the following criteria and detection of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes would not alter treatment recommendations:

- **Patient criteria**: Postmenopausal and ≥ 50 years.

- **Tumor characteristics**: Unifocal invasive ductal carcinoma ≤ 2 cm.

- **Histological grade**: Nottingham grades 1–2.

- **Receptor status**: HR+, HER2-negative in patients intending to receive adjuvant endocrine therapy.

- **Lymph node evaluation**: No suspicious lymph nodes on axillary ultrasound, or only one suspicious node with benign biopsy concordant with axillary ultrasound findings.

- **Surgical and radiotherapy considerations**: Undergoing upfront breast-conservation surgery followed by whole-breast radiotherapy in patients aged < 65 years.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^114w4sqo]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a frequent finding in the clinical course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has been reported in up to 82% of patients. In RA, lymphadenopathy tends to be predominantly localized, with a preference for involvement of lymph nodes near joints with active arthritis. Swollen lymph nodes tend to be larger than in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with a diameter commonly greater than 1 cm. This anatomical localization likely reflects the role of lymph nodes and lymphatics in the pathophysiology of inflammatory erosive arthritis. Although infrequent, generalized lymphadenopathy with constitutional symptoms has been described at the onset of RA. Not surprisingly, the most affected region is the axilla, as it drains afferent lymphatics from the upper limb's joints.

The presence of lymphadenopathy has been correlated with both local and systemic disease activity, specifically correlating with the number of tender and swollen joints, higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, higher Simple Disease Activity Index, and a higher frequency of RA-related interstitial lung disease. Moreover, alterations in the sonographic pattern at the Power Doppler signal of axillary lymph nodes were found to correlate with the degree of ultrasound (US) synovitis in affected joints. The role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET), despite being useful in monitoring disease severity and treatment response in RA, is not established in the assessment of lymphadenopathy in RA, as increased tracer uptake may mimic lymphoma. Similar to what is reported in SLE, lymphadenopathy tends to be responsive to anti-inflammatory treatment with systemic glucocorticoids, with improvement correlating with the remission of synovitis.
