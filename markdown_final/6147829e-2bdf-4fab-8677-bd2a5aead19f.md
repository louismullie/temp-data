## Question

Where does a colonize from?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking where colon cancer originates from. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomical site of origin within the colon. Then, I should verify the cellular origin, including stem cells versus differentiated lineages. Next, I will examine the molecular pathways that initiate tumorigenesis and how they differ by location. After that, I need to consider precursor lesions and clonal evolution. Finally, I should integrate special contexts like inflammation, hereditary syndromes, and early-onset disease to synthesize a complete answer.

> Let me first confirm the anatomical frame. Colon cancer arises from the colonic epithelium, the single-layer lining of the large intestine, and shows a sidedness pattern with proximal (right) and distal (left) colon exhibiting distinct molecular and clinical features, including differences in BRAF mutation prevalence and response to anti-EGFR therapy, which underscores that location matters for both biology and treatment [^114Mwp3U] [^11437yCq].

> Now, I need to check the cellular origin. The traditional view is that the initiating cell is a multipotent intestinal stem cell residing at the crypt base, which fuels epithelial renewal and can accumulate driver mutations that become fixed in the lineage. Recent single-cell chromatin analyses corroborate that microsatellite-stable colon cancers most closely associate with stem-cell chromatin states, reinforcing stem cells as the canonical cell of origin [^11422Zij] [^114d6mt8].

> Wait, let me verify whether differentiated cells can also seed tumors. Emerging data show that under inflammatory stress, differentiated secretory lineages such as Paneth cells can regain stem-like properties and initiate tumorigenesis when they acquire APC mutations, indicating a non–stem-cell origin in a meaningful subset of cases. Machine-learning models applied to human tumors likewise predict secretory-lineage origins in a substantial fraction of sporadic colon cancers, so I should not overstate stem-cell exclusivity [^113gYsWF].

> Next, I should review the initiating molecular events. Most sporadic colon cancers begin with APC loss, which dysregulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling and is the canonical first hit in the adenoma–carcinoma sequence. This mechanistic anchor explains why APC is central to initiation and early clonal expansion in the conventional pathway [^112gMLUR] [^1125cnCt].

> Hold on, I should verify alternative pathways. A distinct serrated pathway begins with BRAF V600E and the CpG island methylator phenotype, particularly in the proximal colon, and can progress to mismatch repair–deficient, hypermutated cancers. This pathway often lacks early APC mutations and is enriched in sessile serrated lesions, which alters both precursor morphology and timing of progression [^1139wc6R] [^113y5eJZ].

> I will now examine precursor lesions. Conventional adenomas (tubular, tubulovillous, villous) are the most common precursors and harbor APC mutations early, whereas serrated polyps, including hyperplastic polyps and sessile serrated adenomas/polyps, mark the serrated pathway. Importantly, even small adenomas can already contain multiple pathogenic mutations, indicating that mutation acquisition begins early and is not strictly tied to size or dysplasia grade [^1153LQ8t] [^111MDGFD].

> Let me consider clonal architecture and evolution. Tumors often start from a single clone but can be polyclonal at initiation, with distinct founder clones cooperating via complementary pathway perturbations. This polyclonality can accelerate growth and may influence progression risk, and early subclonal diversification can embed much of the tumor's mutational history in its final architecture [^114QGPzi] [^115zVsq9].

> But wait, what if inflammation changes the origin story. In colitis-associated cancer, chronic inflammation suppresses canonical stemness and can shift the cell of origin toward differentiated lineages; this context-dependent plasticity helps explain why inflammatory bowel disease–associated cancers can follow a different sequence of genetic alterations compared with sporadic cancers [^113gYsWF] [^1157HCXh].

> I should double-check hereditary syndromes. Familial adenomatous polyposis due to germline APC mutations produces hundreds to thousands of adenomas and near-inevitable cancer, illustrating the primacy of APC-driven initiation; Lynch syndrome, in contrast, is mismatch repair–deficient and predisposes to right-sided cancers with accelerated adenoma–carcinoma progression, again linking genotype to anatomical distribution and tempo [^115TCpo5] [^112dFeeV].

> Next, I should review early-onset disease. Young-onset colon cancer is enriched for distal location and microsatellite-stable tumors, with rising incidence in several countries. This epidemiology suggests environmental and lifestyle contributors superimposed on genetic susceptibility, and it reinforces that not all colon cancers follow the same initiation rules or site patterns [^112NqF2R].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything. Colon cancer originates in the colonic epithelium, most canonically from crypt-base stem cells via APC-driven Wnt dysregulation, but also, in a meaningful subset under inflammatory or permissive conditions, from dedifferentiated secretory lineages. Initiation occurs within precursor lesions such as conventional adenomas or serrated polyps, with clonal evolution beginning early and sometimes proceeding through polyclonal cooperation, and the anatomical site imposes distinct transcriptional and mutational programs that shape both biology and therapy [^1125cnCt] [^113gYsWF] [^114QGPzi] [^11437yCq].

Colon cancer originates from the **colonic epithelium**, specifically the **crypt stem cells** at the base of intestinal crypts [^11422Zij] [^114d6mt8]. These stem cells are the primary cell of origin due to their self-renewal and multipotency [^114d6mt8] [^116HymtC]. Mutations in APC, KRAS, TP53, and other genes [^112enSbt] drive the adenoma–carcinoma sequence [^1176EBBL], with inflammation [^114nb8jn] and the microbiome [^116tdxBo] as key environmental modulators. A minority of cancers arise from differentiated cells that reacquire stem-like properties [^113gYsWF] [^116H4UB9], especially in inflammatory settings.

---

## Anatomical origin

The **colonic epithelium** is a single layer lining the colon and rectum [^116HymtC]; it renews every 3–5 days, sustained by crypt stem cells [^116HymtC]. The **crypt stem cells** reside at crypt bases, are multipotent, and generate all epithelial lineages [^11422Zij]; they are the principal origin of colon cancer [^114d6mt8].

---

## Cellular origin

- **Stem cells**: Crypt stem cells are the primary origin of colon cancer [^11422Zij]; their self-renewal and multipotency make them susceptible to oncogenic transformation [^116HymtC].

- **Differentiated cells**: Recent data show differentiated cells (e.g. Paneth cells) can reacquire stem-like properties and initiate tumors, particularly in inflammation [^113gYsWF] [^116H4UB9].

- **Clonal evolution**: Tumors arise from clonal expansion of mutated stem or dedifferentiated cells, with early subclonal diversity [^117CpbrU] [^114QGPzi].

---

## Molecular pathways

| **Pathway** | **Key genes** | **Characteristics** |
|-|-|-|
| Chromosomal instability (CIN) | APC, KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA | - Most common (≈85%) [^112enSbt] <br/> - Aneuploidy and LOH [^114Jc2pe] |
| Microsatellite instability (MSI) | MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, BRAF | - ≈15% [^112enSbt] <br/> - Hypermutation [^1139wc6R] <br/> - Often right-sided [^114KaAub] |
| CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) | MLH1, BRAF | - Hypermethylation [^1139wc6R] <br/> - Linked to serrated pathway [^1139wc6R] |

---

## Environmental and lifestyle factors

- **Diet**: High red/processed meat, low fiber, and Western diets increase risk [^1167nsVR].

- **Lifestyle**: Smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and alcohol use are risk factors [^1167nsVR].

- **Inflammation**: IBD and chronic inflammation promote tumorigenesis [^114nb8jn] [^1157HCXh].

- **Microbiome**: Dysbiosis and specific bacteria (e.g. Fusobacterium nucleatum) are implicated [^1167nsVR].

---

## Precursor lesions

Precursor lesions include **adenomas** — benign polyps that progress to cancer via the adenoma–carcinoma sequence [^1176EBBL] — and **serrated polyps**, which drive the serrated pathway, particularly in the right colon [^1139wc6R] [^114PYJcG].

---

## Summary of colon cancer origin

Colon cancer originates from **crypt stem cells** in the colonic epithelium [^114d6mt8], with contributions from dedifferentiated cells in inflammation [^113gYsWF]. Mutations in APC, KRAS, TP53, and others [^112enSbt] drive progression through the adenoma–carcinoma or serrated pathways, modulated by diet, lifestyle, inflammation, and the microbiome [^1167nsVR].

### From APC to the genetics of hereditary and familial colon cancer syndromes [^117UScRN]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndromes attributable to high penetrance mutations represent 9–26% of young-onset CRC cases. The clinical significance of many of these mutations is understood well enough to be used in diagnostics and as an aid in patient care. However, despite the advances made in the field, a significant proportion of familial and early-onset cases remains molecularly uncharacterized and extensive work is still needed to fully understand the genetic nature of CRC susceptibility. With the emergence of next-generation sequencing and associated methods, several predisposition loci have been unraveled, but validation is incomplete. Individuals with cancer-predisposing mutations are currently enrolled in life-long surveillance, but with the development of new treatments, such as cancer vaccinations, this might change in the not so distant future for at least some individuals. For individuals without a known cause for their disease susceptibility, prevention and therapy options are less precise. Herein, we review the progress achieved in the last three decades with a focus on how CRC predisposition genes were discovered. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical implications of these discoveries and anticipate what to expect in the next decade.

In conclusion, we still do not understand the precise molecular events that lead to the development of a CRC with its typical phenotypic changes, but there is clear evidence now for the presence of different subtypes in CRC. Since most research groups used a different platform and/or statistical method to define their subgroups in CRC, the ultimate goal is to find a consensus about the existence of a subgroup and subsequently define a reproducible subclassifier of the existing subgroup that can be used in daily clinical practice.

### The genetic pathogenesis of colorectal cancer [^113DdobA]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Research over the past decade has established that the progression from normal colonic epithelium to colon cancer is in every case a step-wise process in which specific pathologic and molecular markers can be identified for study and clinical therapy. Genetic and epigenetic instability appears fundamentally important to this process. We have now determined that this neoplastic progression occurs along a limited set of pathways, in which specific tumor suppressors are inactivated or oncogenes activated in a defined order. Although incomplete, our new understanding of the process of carcinogenesis in the colon has already significantly impacted patient care and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Increasingly rapid research developments and technologic advances will transform the way we prevent, diagnose, and treat this common and deadly form of cancer.

### The morphogenetic code and colon cancer development [^1147goSH]. Cancer Cell (2007). Low credibility.

The initiating genetic lesion in sporadically occurring cancers is impossible to identify. The existence of rare inherited cancer syndromes has helped to uncover some of the mutations that can initiate tumorigenesis. Most of these initiating lesions affect genes belonging to morphogenetic signaling pathways. We review the evidence that the cellular fate of individual epithelial cells in the adult is nonautonomous and depends on extrinsic information, just like cells in a developing embryo. Cancer stem cells need to disrupt these extrinsic restraints to gain an autonomous clonal proliferative advantage over neighboring stem cells.

### The landscape of somatic mutation in normal colorectal epithelial cells [^111GTaY7]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

The colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence has provided a paradigmatic framework for understanding the successive somatic genetic changes and consequent clonal expansions that lead to cancer 1. However, our understanding of the earliest phases of colorectal neoplastic changes-which may occur in morphologically normal tissue-is comparatively limited, as for most cancer types. Here we use whole-genome sequencing to analyse hundreds of normal crypts from 42 individuals. Signatures of multiple mutational processes were revealed; some of these were ubiquitous and continuous, whereas others were only found in some individuals, in some crypts or during certain periods of life. Probable driver mutations were present in around 1% of normal colorectal crypts in middle-aged individuals, indicating that adenomas and carcinomas are rare outcomes of a pervasive process of neoplastic change across morphologically normal colorectal epithelium. Colorectal cancers exhibit substantially increased mutational burdens relative to normal cells. Sequencing normal colorectal cells provides quantitative insights into the genomic and clonal evolution of cancer.

### Serrated route to colorectal cancer: back street or super highway? [^114ZzzDw]. The Journal of Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Morphological and molecular studies are beginning to distinguish separate evolutionary pathways for colorectal cancer. The serrated pathway encompassing hyperplastic aberrant crypt foci, hyperplastic polyps, mixed polyps, and serrated adenoma is increasingly being linked with genetic alterations, including DNA methylation, DNA microsatellite instability, K-ras mutation, and loss of chromosome 1p. The importance of the serrated pathway has been underestimated in terms of its frequency and potential for rapid progression.

### Polyclonality overcomes fitness barriers in apc-driven tumorigenesis [^114QGPzi]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Although often initiated by a 'just right' combination of Apc mutation that preserves at least one β-catenin binding domain in one allele, dysregulation of Wnt signalling is an ongoing process in the progression of CRCs. Loss-of-function mutations in Wnt antagonists and modifiers continue to be selected. The development of polyclonal tumours from clones with distinct Apc mutational profiles suggests that just right conditions for tumour initiation can be achieved by cooperation between founder clones reciprocating in their perturbation of APC–MYC and KRAS pathways.

Adenomas represent the earliest recognized stage of tumour formation that leads to cancer in patients, but few profiling studies have been performed. However, human analyses accompanying this study confirm that polyps arising from genetic predisposition or sporadically frequently have complex clonal origins. The degree to which polyclonal polyps have an increased risk of developing into carcinomas remains uncertain but their larger size already accommodates one such risk factor. The extent to which APC mutational profiling indicates an aetiology for sporadic human polyps similar to that described here will also be important for assigning risk of progression associated with the phenomenon. Finally, clonal cooperation may no longer be required in more advanced cancers. Multiregional sampling of such cancers that reconstruct initial trunk mutations and later branching ones would support this view –. However, such analyses require identification of a founder clone and polyclonality may be under-reported for this reason. Where this constraint has been addressed, polyclonal sporadic CRCs have been identified.

### The exceptionally rare phenomenon of well-differentiated colon neuroendocrine tumors [^112sVeCB]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Colonic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), excluding rectal NETs, are often described as relatively common and aggressive, with inferior median survival compared with other gastrointestinal (GI) primary sites. However, epidemiological databases may conflate well-differentiated NETs with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), leading to a lack of precise data on the prevalence, clinical behavior, and prognosis of well-differentiated colonic NETs. We analyzed a large institutional database to identify patients with well-differentiated NETs originating in the colon, excluding rectal NETs. Cecal NETs were included; however, ileocecal NETs (overlapping the ileocecal valve) were not. We assessed their prevalence compared with other primary sites, grade, stage, and prognosis. Among 3639 patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs, only 19 (0.5%) had well-differentiated colonic NETs. This included 11 cecal and eight sigmoid colon primaries (two described as "rectosigmoid"). No tumors originated in the ascending, transverse, or descending colon. Sigmoid NETs were typically early-stage polyps discovered incidentally during colonoscopy. In contrast, eight of the 11 cecal NETs metastasized (p = .04). Six of the cecal primary patients (55%) exhibited carcinoid syndrome versus none of the sigmoid primary cases (p = .01). Well-differentiated colon NETs are exceptionally rare, comprising approximately 0.5% of GEP-NETs. These tumors fall into two distinct categories: cecal NETs, which resemble ileal NETs in behavior, and sigmoid NETs, which appear similar to rectal NETs. The broad categorization of colonic "NETs" in epidemiologic databases likely includes NECs, obscuring the true clinical picture.

### Lineage tracing in human tissues [^114W34Bu]. The Journal of Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Further, recent studies (reviewed in) have found that gene mutations commonly found in cancers that are thought to be functional for cancer development, termed driver mutations, are also present in a surprisingly high number of morphologically normal cells. Exploring how clonal populations evolve in ostensibly normal human tissue is an important step to understanding the earliest steps in cancer evolution, namely how one of these 'cancer‐primed' cells outcompetes its neighbours, clonally expands to colonise surrounding tissue, and eventually transforms into malignancy.

Lineage tracing, a general term for methods to detect parent–daughter relationships between cells using clonal markers, presents a powerful tool for probing the clonal dynamics of tissue. In mouse models, the use of experimentally induced fate markers have allowed the complex and variable dynamics of various tissues to be elucidated (e.g. skin, colon, and breast). However, such methods are inappropriate for use in humans and therefore researchers are forced to rely on somatic lineage tracing markers. The basic principle is that the (epi)genomes of recently‐related cells are expected to be more similar than those of more distantly related cells, and so, more generally, measurements of the (epi)genetic differences between cells allow for the reconstruction of their clonal relationships. To illustrate this principle, consider two cells taken from distant locations within an individual's body — say, brain and bowel — whose most recent common ancestor arose early during embryogenesis. Every time a cell divides it accrues ∼1–10 point mutations across the ∼3 billion base pairs within its genome. Given this very low probability that any specific base will be mutated, the probability that two randomly selected cells have independently developed the same mutation is extremely low. Consequently, the vast majority of somatic mutations will not be shared between these distantly related cells. In contrast, as discussed later, consider the genomes of two cells selected from the same colonic crypt. Because of the rapid turnover of cells in the colon fuelled by a small number of stem cells in intense competition to retain a place in the niche, the two cells will share the vast majority of their somatic mutations, reflecting the short time since their recent common ancestor.

Colon cancer resection — margin length and lymph node evaluation — It is recommended that at least 12 lymph nodes be evaluated to confidently assign an N0 stage, and the examination of fewer than 12 lymph nodes is a high-risk feature for stage II colon cancer; in the event that fewer than 12 lymph nodes are reported on the pathology report, the surgeon should request additional evaluation and processing and reporting of the specimen. Resection "should generally include proximal and distal longitudinal margins of 5 to 7 cm" and the mesentery to the tumor-bearing segment "should be removed up to the origin of the named primary feeding vessel(s) to enable removal of the draining intermediate and central lymph nodes".

### Measuring stem cell dynamics in the human colon – where there's a wiggle, there's a way [^116HymtC]. The Journal of Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

The mammalian intestine is lined by a single layer of epithelium that undergoes continual replacement every 5–7 days. This remarkable turnover is supported by adult intestinal stem cells located in the base of flask-shaped invaginations called crypts – the basic functional units of the gut. In the small intestine, several crypts contribute epithelium to finger-like projections called villi. Stem cells are defined functionally, firstly by their ability to self-renew and secondly by multipotency – the capacity to produce daughter cells that undergo limited lineage differentiation to produce all of the post-mitotic specialized cells of the gut. Intestinal epithelial daughter cells originate in the base of the crypt and migrate along the vertical crypt–villus axis, becoming progressively more differentiated as they age. Spontaneous apoptosis with subsequent shedding or phagocytosis occurs at the luminal surface about a week after daughter cells are 'born'. Maintenance of stem cells, daughter cell proliferation, and induction of differentiation (cell fate) are rigidly controlled by interacting gradients of intrinsic epithelial and extrinsic mesenchymally derived morphogen signalling pathways.

The last decade has seen tremendous advances in our understanding of the dynamics of this complex tissue organizational hierarchy. The major advance has been the ability to fluorescently label cell populations in transgenic mice. The simple ability to identify stem cell progeny has allowed real biological measurements to underpin mathematical modelling of stem cell dynamics. Further advances have come from the identification and fluorescent labelling of genes selectively expressed by stem cells. Lineage tracing experiments have been used to demonstrate long-term self-renewal and multipotency criteria to validate genes as bona fide stem cell markers. Landmark achievements and advances in understanding murine stem cell dynamics have rapidly followed. We now know that murine intestinal stem cells rarely divide asymmetrically, as previously believed, but instead follow a pattern of neutral drift, with clonal expansion and contraction occurring in perfect balance in intestinal homeostasis. Furthermore, stemness is principally not an intrinsic cell-defined property; instead, it appears to be determined by proximity to contextual cues from the stem cell niche. A spectrum of stem-cell competence exists with variable bias towards self-renewal or differentiation dependent on distance from a 'sweet spot' in the crypt base. Consistent with this spectrum, quiescent or reserve stem cell populations, and different secretory precursor cells that have ostensibly exited the niche, have the ability to reactivate stem cell potential at times of need and regenerate the crypt when damaged.

### Colorectal cancer: genetics is changing everything [^1177Wakj]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease caused by mutational or epigenetic alterations in DNA. There has been a remarkable expansion of the molecular understanding of colonic carcinogenesis in the last 30 years and that understanding is changing many aspects of colorectal cancer care. It is becoming increasingly clear that there are genetic subsets of colorectal cancer that have different risk factors, prognosis, and response to treatment. This article provides a general update on colorectal cancer and highlights the ways that genetics is changing clinical care.

### Lower limb necrotising fasciitis descending from malignant colonic perforation: a rare pattern [^111iVM96]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Summary

Necrotising fasciitis (NF) is a rare surgical emergency characterised by soft tissue necrosis and systemic compromise. Typically it originates following adjacent skin and soft tissue insult; however, our unusual case required a high index of clinical suspicion to avert potential mortality. A man in his 60s with diabetes mellitus presented with 2 weeks of knee pain, swelling and necrotic skin on the posterior calf. X-ray demonstrated subcutaneous emphysema. Initial debridement confirmed extensive necrotising fasciitis of the whole lower limb with tracking through femoral canal into the abdomen. CT confirmed sigmoid colon perforation. Both life-saving Hartmann's and hip disarticulation procedures were performed with good outcomes. Histology confirmed locally invasive sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma. Our case highlights lower limb necrotising fasciitis as a rare complication secondary to sigmoid perforation associated with malignancy. In cases where the infection nidus cannot be identified, an abdominal source should be considered.

### Age-related human small intestine methylation: evidence for stem cell niches [^111ZgK9P]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Mutations are rare in normal cells, but recent studies illustrate that stem cell ancestries may be automatically recorded by random somatic epigenetic errors that frequently accumulate with aging. Methylation increases with age at certain CpG-rich regions in the colon. This age-related methylation does not resemble a stereotypic developmental process because different cells within the same intestine may have different methylation patterns (5' to 3' order of methylated sites). Such random somatic errors resemble the drift of genomes during species evolution, and by analogy, such drift can be used to reconstruct somatic cell ancestry because methylation exhibits somatic inheritance and all cells are related. Therefore, somatic methylation patterns potentially encode numbers of divisions since birth, and ancestral relationships among cells within a single crypt or villus. Here we infer from methylation patterns that crypt niches containing multiple stem cells maintain the human small intestine.

### Multicolor lineage tracing reveals clonal architecture and dynamics in colon cancer [^112Zc9uY]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer derives from normal colonic mucosa by stepwise accumulation of mutations that transform epithelial cells into invasively growing tumors. Normal colonic mucosa is quite simply organized, basically as a sheet of epithelial cells with infoldings forming stereotypical crypts. These are continuously clonally repopulated by stem cells from the crypt base with maturation toward the crypt apex. In contrast to normal colonic mucosa, the architecture of colon cancer is much less understood since these tumors form masses with varying degrees of morphologically disarrayed epithelial glands. However, colon cancers do not appear to be completely unorganized. Gradients from less differentiated tumor cells at the leading tumor edge to glandular differentiated tumor cells in the tumor center can be observed in many cases, and mimic the polarity of normal colonic crypts to varying extent. However, in contrast to normal colonic crypts, such gradients in colon cancer are not situated within stereotypical morphological units and some colon cancers even lack differentiation gradients. Therefore, the relevance of phenotypically distinct tumor cells for tumor growth and the resulting colon cancer architecture remains incompletely understood.

### Many private mutations originate from the first few divisions of a human colorectal adenoma [^115zVsq9]. The Journal of Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Intratumoural mutational heterogeneity (ITH) or the presence of different private mutations in different parts of the same tumour is commonly observed in human tumours. The mechanisms generating such ITH are uncertain. Here we find that ITH can be remarkably well structured by measuring point mutations, chromosome copy numbers, and DNA passenger methylation from opposite sides and individual glands of a 6 cm human colorectal adenoma. ITH was present between tumour sides and individual glands, but the private mutations were side-specific and subdivided the adenoma into two major subclones. Furthermore, ITH disappeared within individual glands because the glands were clonal populations composed of cells with identical mutant genotypes. Despite mutation clonality, the glands were relatively old, diverse populations when their individual cells were compared for passenger methylation and by FISH. These observations can be organized into an expanding star-like ancestral tree with co-clonal expansion, where many private mutations and multiple related clones arise during the first few divisions. As a consequence, most detectable mutational ITH in the final tumour originates from the first few divisions. Much of the early history of a tumour, especially the first few divisions, may be embedded within the detectable ITH of tumour genomes.

### Commensalism and pathogenesis of Candida albicans at the mucosal interface [^112yskUF]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Fungi are important and often underestimated human pathogens. Infections with fungi mostly originate from the environment, from soil or airborne spores. By contrast, Candida albicans, one of the most common and clinically important fungal pathogens, permanently exists in the vast majority of healthy individuals as a member of the human mucosal microbiota. Only under certain circumstances will these commensals cause infections. However, although the pathogenic behaviour and disease manifestation of C. albicans have been at the centre of research for many years, its asymptomatic colonization of mucosal surfaces remains surprisingly understudied. In this Review, we discuss the interplay of the fungus, the host and the microbiome on the dualism of commensal and pathogenic life of C. albicans, and how commensal growth is controlled and permitted. We explore hypotheses that could explain how the mucosal environment shapes C. albicans adaptations to its commensal lifestyle, while still maintaining or even increasing its pathogenic potential.

### The human colon: evidence for degenerative changes during aging and the physiological consequences [^116o3Qa1]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

2 SCOPE OF REVIEW

The term "elderly" defines people around 65–75 years of age and above, but is influenced by variables affecting biological aging or senescence, including culture, lifestyle, and genetics. Here, we compare between adults of different ages and not adults versus developing juveniles or children.

The focus is on the colon, perhaps the most readily available, "intact" human gastrointestinal tissue (e.g. "macroscopically normal" tissue from patients with bowel cancer, 5–10 cm away from the tumor). For robust conclusions, different variables must be considered. First, the different regions of colon must be studied separately, given the differences in positioning, functions, embryonic origin, blood supply, extrinsic innervation, length, and gene expression. Second, the question "what is normal?" must be considered as it is difficult to fully exclude pathological changes. For example, in colonic mucosa, changes in gene expression can occur up to 10 cm from the tumor. Nevertheless, when using tissues from the same region and removed for the same disorder, it is possible to compare different age groups. Third, individual variations mean that patient details must be recorded and sample sizes large enough to generate meaningful conclusions. Finally, studies may be influenced by type of surgery, preparation, and storage of tissue. All this is important when weighing the strengths and weaknesses of data generated from human tissues.

Extent of colon resection — recommendation: The extent of resection of the colon should correspond to the lymphovascular drainage of the colon cancer, with grade of recommendation specified as strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. The extent of a curative resection for colon cancer depends on the site of the primary lesion and its lymphovascular drainage.

### Colorectal cancer screening and prevention [^112Ta6ws]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for colon cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, high-risk individuals, family history, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain CRC screening in patients with ≥ 1 first-degree relatives with CRC or adenomatous polyps, starting at 40 years of age or 10 years before the age of the youngest relative at the time of their diagnosis.

### Colon polyps: updates in classification and management [^1153LQ8t]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on colorectal polyps:

- **Definition**: Colorectal polyps are abnormal growths originating from the colonic or rectal mucosa. They can be classified into several types, including adenomatous, hyperplastic, serrated, hamartomatous, and inflammatory polyps, each with varying potential for malignant transformation.
- **Pathophysiology**: The development of colorectal polyps is a complex process involving the abnormal proliferation of epithelial cells in the colon or rectum. This can be driven by various genetic and epigenetic changes, such as chromosomal instability and MSI pathways, leading to the disruption of normal cell growth and differentiation processes. Some polyps, particularly adenomatous polyps, have the potential to progress to CRC through a process known as the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of colorectal adenomas in individuals aged > 50 years is estimated at 20–60% in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Several factors have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal polyps, including age (> 40 years), male sex, a family history of CRC or polyps, certain genetic syndromes, IBD, and lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity, and a diet high in red meat (for rectal polyps).
- **Disease course**: Most colorectal polyps are asymptomatic and are often detected incidentally during routine colonoscopies. Occasionally, large polyps can cause symptoms.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for patients with colorectal polyps is generally good, especially when the polyps are detected and removed early. Most polyps are benign and can be completely removed during a colonoscopy. However, some polyps can progress to CRC if left untreated, and the risk increases with the size and number of polyps. Adenomatous polyps are the most common type and have the highest risk of progressing to CRC, and polyps > 1 cm or with villous histology are more likely to be malignant.

Screening and genetic testing for adenomatous polyposis syndromes — polyposis syndromes should typically be considered in patients with greater than 10-lifetime adenomas, colorectal cancer diagnosed at an age younger than 50 years, a personal history of desmoid disease or other extracolonic manifestations of polyposis syndromes, or with family members with known FAP or MAP. Strength of recommendation: strong based on moderate-quality evidence. FAP, defined as having more than 100 synchronous colorectal adenomas, is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner from constitutional pathogenic variants of the APC gene.

Inherited adenomatous polyposis syndromes — genetic testing thresholds and risk: Historically, patients with more than 100 adenomas found on colonoscopy are typically given a clinical diagnosis of polyposis, and polyp formation is an age-dependent phenomenon; patients with fewer adenomas or a family history suggestive of polyposis should undergo genetic testing. Guidelines recommend genetic testing for individuals with greater than 10 to 20 cumulative lifetime adenomas, and patients with more than 20 adenomas have a more than 10% risk of carrying a genetic pathologic variant.

### Serrated polyps of right colon: guilty or innocent? [^114PYJcG]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Epidemiology of serrated polyps

The epidemiologic data on serrated polyps originate mainly from the era when they were characterized as hyperplastic or mixed; at present a large number of studies are being conducted worldwide in order to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of the specific groups of serrated polyps.

It seems that approximately 25–50% of white men have one or more serrated lesions (totally, not specific groups). It also seems that their total prevalence increases only minimally with age in comparison to conventional adenomas whose prevalence increases significantly with age. Serrated polyps are located in their majority in the sigmoid and rectum, but their distribution varies according to their histological type. HPs account for 70–95% of all serrated polyps and are located mainly in the left colon. SSA/Ps account for 5–25% of serrated polyps and are usually found in the right colon, being typically larger than HPs, and with a tendency to present more often in women. TSAs are rarer than SSA/ Ps, with a prevalence 2–3.5% and are found mainly in the left colon; they are also larger in size than HPs.

### Geographic and age variations in mutational processes in colorectal cancer [^112NqF2R]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

The age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) for most adult cancers vary across different geographic locations and can change over time. Despite extensive epidemiological research, the underlying causes for many of these variations remain unclear. However, they are thought to be due to exogenous environmental or lifestyle carcinogenic exposures, which are, in principle, preventable. Many well-known exogenous carcinogens are also mutagens, that can imprint characteristic patterns of somatic mutations — mutational signatures — in the genome. Therefore, a complementary approach to conventional epidemiology for investigating unknown causes of cancer is the characterization of mutational signatures in the genomes of cancer and normal cells –. The Mutographs Cancer Grand Challenge projecthas implemented this strategy of 'mutational epidemiology' by sequencing cancers from geographic areas of differing incidence rates, using mutational signature analysis to reveal the mutational processes that have been operative, with results so far from cancers of the oesophagus, kidneyand head and neck.

Colorectal cancer incidence rates differ markedly by geographic location and have changed substantially in some countries over the past 70 years. For instance, the ASRs for colorectal cancer in North America and in most European countries peaked in the 1980s and 1990s and have been declining since, whereas countries in East Asia such as Japan and South Korea have been steadily increasing over the past seven decades. Moreover, in the past 20 years, there has been a notable global increase in the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer, typically defined as colorectal cancer in adults under 50 years of age. This was first reported in the USAand subsequently observed in Australia, Canada, Japan and multiple European countries. Although epidemiological studies have identified multiple risk factors for colorectal cancer, specific risk factors for early-onset colorectal cancer remain largely unidentified, with the exception of family history and hereditary predisposition. The latter is predominantly attributable to Lynch syndrome, which is characterized by cancers of the proximal colon that are deficient in DNA mismatch repair, and is therefore unlikely to be implicated in the recent increase in early-onset colorectal cancer, which is mainly enriched in sporadic, DNA mismatch repair-proficient cancers that affect the distal colon and rectum.

Previous colorectal cancer whole-genome sequencing studies have largely focused on cases from North America and Europe, including the USA, UK, Netherlands – and Sweden, and incorporated limited numbers of early-onset cases –. Here we examine colorectal cancer genomes from 11 countries on 4 continents to investigate whether variation in mutational processes contributes to geographic and age-related differences in incidence rates.

### Recapitulating the adenoma-carcinoma sequence by selection of four spontaneous oncogenic mutations in mismatch-repair-deficient human colon organoids [^112enSbt]. Nature Cancer (2024). High credibility.

Main

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the deadliest cancers. CRC cases are divided into two major genetic instability categories; 85% of sporadic CRCs display chromosomal instability (CIN), while 15% of CRCs are hypermutated and display microsatellite instability (MSI). CIN tumors harbor combinations of common driver mutations in APC, TP53, KRAS, SMAD4 and PIK3CA. Histologically, CRC develops through a well-described adenoma–carcinoma sequence, known as the 'Vogelgram' (ref.), which coincides with a relatively ordered acquisition of mutations in the previously mentioned genes. Hypermutated MSI CRC occurs in the context of the hereditary Lynch syndrome (LS), which is caused by germline mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutation, or as high-MSI (MSI-H) sporadic CRC caused by somatic MMR silencing typically associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. Of note, the oncogenic driver mutations found in MSI-H CRC (ACVR2A, TGFBR2, AXIN1, AXIN2, BMPR2 and BRAF) tend to be different from those in CIN CRC.

### The molecular genetics of colorectal cancer [^112JRWBx]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy diagnosed in the UK, with over 40 000 new cases identified annually, and a lifetime risk approaching 1 in 15 for men and 1 in 19 for women.CRC does not represent a single pathological entity, rather a heterogeneous group of diseases arising through various molecular pathways that influence individual susceptibility to cancer, and have the potential to determine responsiveness or resistance to antitumour agents.

Competency 2.C. of the 2010 Gastroenterology curriculum (box 1) states that UK trainees must have an appreciation for the pathology of CRC, including awareness of the molecular genetics of colorectal carcinogenesis, the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and the range of predisposing inherited and acquired conditions. This review summarises current concepts of the molecular basis of CRC, using examples of CRC syndromes caused by germline mutations to illustrate the effects of acquired somatic mutations. Therapeutic targets within the signalling pathways that drive CRC tumourigenesis are also explored.

### Pathogenesis of colorectal cancer [^117T7xQR]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

It is frequently stated that all but a few colorectal cancers arise in adenomatous polyps, in turn initiated by APC mutation. Moderation of this view is now required. The proportion of colorectal cancers that arises in a polypoid adenoma is likely to be around 70% [39,61]. The pre-eminence of the adenoma-carcinoma model has been influenced by two factors: (1) the need to avoid overtreatment of innocent lesions, and (2) the absence of a convincing alternative mechanism. The latter position has changed in recent years. Collectively, the alternative pathways may account for the pathogenesis of up to 30% of colorectal cancers. The alternative pathways are difficult to observe in clinical practice because the precursors may be either inconspicuous or show rapid evolution following the establishment of genetic instability. As a concept, the polyp-cancer sequence is entrenched in both specialized and student texts. This is unfortunate, because progress in prevention and early cancer detection will be delayed by the failure to adopt a critical and nondogmatic approach to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. The advent of DNA chip technology will catalyze the development of revised paradigms. Specifically, modern genomics will allow polyps and cancers to be grouped within pathogenic pathways on the basis of shared gene expression profiles. The era of molecular medicine has dawned for colorectal cancer.

### Non-stem cell lineages as an alternative origin of intestinal tumorigenesis in the context of inflammation [^113gYsWF]. Nature Genetics (2024). High credibility.

According to conventional views, colon cancer originates from stem cells. However, inflammation, a key risk factor for colon cancer, has been shown to suppress intestinal stemness. Here, we used Paneth cells as a model to assess the capacity of differentiated lineages to trigger tumorigenesis in the context of inflammation in mice. Upon inflammation, Paneth cell-specific Apc mutations led to intestinal tumors reminiscent not only of those arising in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but also of a larger fraction of human sporadic colon cancers. The latter is possibly because of the inflammatory consequences of western-style dietary habits, a major colon cancer risk factor. Machine learning methods designed to predict the cell-of-origin of cancer from patient-derived tumor samples confirmed that, in a substantial fraction of sporadic cases, the origins of colon cancer reside in secretory lineages and not in stem cells.

### Less common colorectal cancer predisposition syndromes [^114BwXZ8]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

A variety of syndromes confer increased risk for intestinal polyp development, outside the more commonly occurring syndromes. Each of these uncommon syndromes predispose to pathognomonic histologies that are uncommonly observed. Accurate diagnosis of these syndromes is contingent on higher-level pathology review, evaluation of signs and symptoms beyond sole consideration of the polyps, and collection of a detailed family history. When a genetic mutation can be identified in the proband, the management of intestinal and extra-intestinal cancer screening can be more appropriately tailored.

### Colonic crypt organization and tumorigenesis [^11422Zij]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2008). Medium credibility.

An appreciation of colonic crypt organization has become essential to any understanding of tumorigenesis in the colon. Intestinal crypts house tissue-specific, multipotential stem cells, which are located in the niche at the base of the intestinal crypt and are capable of regenerating all intestinal cell types. Recent advances in our understanding of crypt biology, including how mutations in stem cells become fixed and expand within the epithelium, has led to new theories on the origins of colonic adenomas and cancers.

### Tissue-location-specific transcription programs drive tumor dependencies in colon cancer [^116eScGX]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Cancers of the same tissue-type but in anatomically distinct locations exhibit different molecular dependencies for tumorigenesis. Proximal and distal colon cancers exemplify such characteristics, with BRAF V600E predominantly occurring in proximal colon cancers along with increased DNA methylation phenotype. Using mouse colon organoids, here we show that proximal and distal colon stem cells have distinct transcriptional programs that regulate stemness and differentiation. We identify that the homeobox transcription factor, CDX2, which is silenced by DNA methylation in proximal colon cancers, is a key mediator of the differential transcriptional programs. Cdx2-mediated proximal colon-specific transcriptional program concurrently is tumor suppressive, and Cdx2 loss sufficiently creates permissive state for BRAF V600E -driven transformation. Human proximal colon cancers with CDX2 downregulation showed similar transcriptional program as in mouse proximal organoids with Cdx2 loss. Developmental transcription factors, such as CDX2, are thus critical in maintaining tissue-location specific transcriptional programs that create tissue-type origin specific dependencies for tumor development.

### The genetics of colorectal cancer [^111sivJY]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Colon cancer is a common disease that can be sporadic, familial, or inherited. Recent advances have contributed to the understanding of the molecular basis of these various patterns of colon cancer. Germline genetic mutations are the basis of inherited colon cancer syndromes; an accumulation of somatic mutations in a cell is the basis of sporadic colon cancer; and, in Ashkenazi Jewish persons, a mutation that was previously thought to be a polymorphism may cause familial colon cancer. Mutations of three different classes of genes have been described in colon cancer etiology: oncogenes, suppressor genes, and mismatch repair genes. Knowledge of many of the specific mutations responsible for colon carcinogenesis allows an understanding of the phenotypic manifestations observed and forms the basis of genetic testing for inherited disease. Although genetic testing is possible and available, it is only an adjunct to the clinical management of persons at risk for colon cancer and patients with colon cancer. As a result of advances in the understanding of the molecular causes of colon cancer and the availability of colon cancer screening methods such as colonoscopy, it should be possible to prevent the vast majority of colon cancer in our society. Practicing clinicians should recognize the patterns of clinical colon cancer, understand its causes, and be able to use genetic testing and endoscopic screening for prevention.

### Diverticulitis: a review [^115hsLFY]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Diverticulosis is defined by the presence of multiple outpouchings (diverticula) originating from the intestinal lumen. Diverticulitis is defined as inflammation of these diverticula. The annual incidence of diverticulitis in the US is approximately 180 per 100 000 people, resulting in approximately 200 000 hospital admissions annually and an estimated health care expenditure of more than $6.3 billion/year.

Observations

Risk factors for diverticular disease include age older than 65 years, genetic factors such as variant in the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15 (TNFSFI5) gene; connective tissue diseases such as polycystic kidney disease, Marfan syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; body mass index 30 or greater; use of opioids, steroids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; hypertension; and type 2 diabetes. Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with diverticulosis will develop acute diverticulitis in their lifetime, which typically presents as left lower quadrant pain associated with nausea, vomiting, fever, and leukocytosis. A contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan is the recommended diagnostic test and has a sensitivity of 98% to 99% and specificity of 99% to 100%. Approximately 85% of people with acute diverticulitis have uncomplicated diverticulitis (absence of abscess, colon strictures, colon perforation, or fistula formation). Management of patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis consists of observation with pain management (typically acetaminophen) and dietary modification with a clear liquid diet. Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with systemic symptoms such as persistent fever or chills, those with increasing leukocytosis, those older than 80 years, those who are pregnant, those who are immunocompromised (receiving chemotherapy, or high-dose steroids, or have received an organ transplant), and those with chronic medical conditions (such as cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or poorly controlled diabetes). First-line antibiotics consist of oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or cefalexin with metronidazole. For patients who cannot tolerate oral intake, intravenous antibiotic therapy (ie, cefuroxime or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or ampicillin/sulbactam) is appropriate. Complicated diverticulitis is managed with intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam and additional invasive management as indicated (ie, percutaneous drainage of associated intra-abdominal abscess or colon resection). Patients with generalized peritonitis should undergo emergent laparotomy with colonic resection. Postoperative mortality for diverticulitis managed electively or emergently is 0.5% for elective colon resection and 10.6% for emergent colon resection.

Conclusions and Relevance

In the US, diverticulitis affects approximately 180 per 100 000 people annually. For uncomplicated diverticulitis, first-line therapy is observation and pain control, and antibiotics should be initiated for patients with persistent fevers, increasing leukocytosis, sepsis or septic shock, advanced age, pregnancy, immunocompromise, and certain chronic medical conditions. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis includes intravenous antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam, and, if indicated, percutaneous drainage of abscess or resection of diseased segment of colon.

### An advanced chromocolonoscopic picture is worth a thousand words, but is it worth the effort? [^1177prqu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Chromocolonoscopy is a commonly used advanced or multimodal colon imaging method to interrogate the colon mucosa and colon polyps. The two main objectives of chromocolonosopy are to (a) detect a colon polyp and (b) define (differentiate) the lesion. Although data supporting the use of chromocolonoscopy for colon polyp detection are not strongly founded, this technique may be helpful in differentiating colon polyps and may aid in their endoscopic resection.

Anorectal abscess — drainage approach by location should follow on-page guidance: Abscess location generally determines whether a patient should have internal versus external drainage, and intersphincteric abscesses should typically be drained through the intersphincteric groove or into the anal canal via an internal sphincterotomy; it is usually preferable to drain supralevator abscesses originating from an intersphincteric abscess internally by incising the rectal wall, whereas supralevator abscesses because of cephalad extension of an ischiorectal abscess should typically be drained externally through the perianal skin, approaches that may help prevent complex fistula formation; for horseshoe abscesses, primary lay-open fistulotomy should typically be avoided, the Hanley procedure is effective but may negatively impact anal sphincter function, and a modified Hanley technique with posterior midline partial sphincterotomy plus seton placement has a high rate of abscess resolution and has been reported to better preserve anorectal function.

### A stochastic model for cancer stem cell origin in metastatic colon cancer [^1122sujL]. Cancer Research (2008). Low credibility.

Human cancers have been found to include transformed stem cells that may drive cancer progression to metastasis. Here, we report that metastatic colon cancer contains clonally derived tumor cells with all of the critical properties expected of stem cells, including self-renewal and the ability to differentiate into mature colon cells. Additionally, when injected into mice, these cells initiated tumors that closely resemble human cancer. Karyotype analyses of parental and clonally derived tumor cells expressed many consistent (clonal) along with unique chromosomal aberrations, suggesting the presence of chromosomal instability in the cancer stem cells. Thus, this new model for cancer origin and metastatic progression includes features of both the hierarchical model for cancerous stem cells and the stochastic model, driven by the observation of chromosomal instability.

### Acute mesenteric ischemia: updated guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^116oTnWt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology and epidemiology

Acute mesenteric arterial embolism

Half of cases of AMI are due to acute SMA embolism. Mesenteric emboli can originate from the left atrium (e.g. atrial fibrillation), left ventricle (e.g. left ventricular dysfunction with poor ejection fraction), or cardiac valves (e.g. endocarditis). Occasionally emboli are generated from an atherosclerotic aorta. Emboli typically lodge at points of normal anatomic artery narrowing. The SMA is particularly vulnerable because of its relatively large diameter and low takeoff angle from the aorta. The majority of emboli lodge 3–10 cm distal to the origin of the SMA, thus sparing the proximal jejunum and colon. More than 20% of SMA emboli are associated with concurrent emboli to another arterial bed including the spleen and kidney.

Acute mesenteric arterial thrombosis

Thrombosis of the SMA (approximately 25% of cases) is usually associated with pre-existing chronic atherosclerotic disease leading to stenosis. Many of these patients have a history consistent with chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI), including postprandial pain, weight loss, or "food fear". A detailed medical history is important when evaluating a patient suspected to have AMI. Thrombosis usually occurs at the origin of visceral arteries. An underlying plaque in the SMA usually progresses eventually to a critical stenosis resulting in collateral beds. Accordingly, symptomatic SMA thrombosis most often accompanies celiac occlusion. SMA thrombosis may also occur due to vasculitis, mesenteric dissection, or mycotic aneurysm. Involvement of the ileocolic artery will result in necrosis of the proximal colon.

Acute non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia

NOMI occurs in approximately 20% of cases, and is usually a consequence of SMA vasoconstriction associated with low splanchnic blood flow. The compromised SMA blood flow also affects the proximal colon due to involvement of the ileocolic artery. Patients with NOMI typically suffer from severe coexisting illness, commonly cardiac failure which may be precipitated by sepsis. Hypovolemia and the use of vasoconstrictive agents may precipitate NOMI.

### Cause, epidemiology, and histology of polyps and pathways to colorectal cancer [^113y5eJZ]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-associated mortality, with a lifetime risk of approximately 4% to 5%. Colorectal cancer develops from the sequential acquisition of defined genetic mutations in the colonic epithelium. Tumorigenesis from normal tissue to cancer occurs largely through 3 pathways: the chromosomal instability pathway, the microsatellite instability pathway, and the sessile serrated pathway. Colorectal cancer incidence and mortality have decreased by approximately 35% since the beginning of screening programs in the 1990s, although other factors such as use of aspirin for coronary disease prevention and decreased smoking rates may also be important. In this review, we discuss the etiology, epidemiology, and histology of colorectal polyps and cancer.

### Cytoskeleton out of the cupboard: colon cancer and cytoskeletal changes induced by loss of APC [^1125cnCt]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2006). Medium credibility.

Mutation of APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) is a common factor in most colorectal cancers. APC has many functions, the most prominent is its capacity to regulate beta-catenin-mediated gene transcription in response to Wnt signalling. Loss of APC leads to deregulated beta-catenin and this is intimately linked with tumour formation. However, recent evidence indicates that the interaction of APC with the cytoskeleton might also contribute to tumour initiation and progression. How does APC interact with the cytoskeleton and how could this play a part in colorectal tumorigenesis?

### SMAD4 suppresses WNT-driven dedifferentiation and oncogenesis in the differentiated gut epithelium [^116H4UB9]. Cancer Research (2018). Low credibility.

The cell of origin of colon cancer is typically thought to be the resident somatic stem cells, which are immortal and escape the continual cellular turnover characteristic of the intestinal epithelium. However, recent studies have identified certain conditions in which differentiated cells can acquire stem-like properties and give rise to tumors. Defining the origins of tumors will inform cancer prevention efforts as well as cancer therapies, as cancers with distinct origins often respond differently to treatments. We report here a new condition in which tumors arise from the differentiated intestinal epithelium. Inactivation of the differentiation-promoting transcription factor SMAD4 in the intestinal epithelium was surprisingly well tolerated in the short term. However, after several months, adenomas developed with characteristics of activated WNT signaling. Simultaneous loss of SMAD4 and activation of the WNT pathway led to dedifferentiation and rapid adenoma formation in differentiated tissue. Transcriptional profiling revealed acquisition of stem cell characteristics, and colabeling indicated that cells expressing differentiated enterocyte markers entered the cell cycle and reexpressed stem cell genes upon simultaneous loss of SMAD4 and activation of the WNT pathway. These results indicate that SMAD4 functions to maintain differentiated enterocytes in the presence of oncogenic WNT signaling, thus preventing dedifferentiation and tumor formation in the differentiated intestinal epithelium. Significance: This work identifies a mechanism through which differentiated cells prevent tumor formation by suppressing oncogenic plasticity. Cancer Res; 78(17); 4878–90. ©2018 AACR.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colon cancer [^115DEWmW]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Colon cancer — oophorectomy indications and prophylaxis — Oophorectomy is typically advised for grossly abnormal ovaries or contiguous extension of colon cancer, and routine prophylactic oophorectomy is not recommended (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C). In apparent direct extension involving an ovary, en bloc oophorectomy should typically be performed as part of a curative-intent resection, and in the setting of suspected or known metastatic disease involving an ovary, bilateral oophorectomy should typically be performed; oophorectomy has been associated with a survival benefit in retrospective series. In patients with grossly normal-appearing ovaries, data do not support routine prophylactic oophorectomy at colorectal cancer resection, although prophylactic oophorectomy should be considered for women with an inherent risk for developing ovarian cancer and for postmenopausal women desiring risk reduction; in BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers, oophorectomy has been associated with an 80% reduction in ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer and a 77% reduction in all-cause mortality.

### Tracing ancestry with methylation patterns: most crypts appear distantly related in normal adult human colon [^115id6A8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The ability to discern ancestral relationships between individual human colon crypts is limited. Widely separated crypts likely trace their common ancestors to a time around birth, but closely spaced adult crypts may share more recent common ancestors if they frequently divide by fission to form clonal patches. Alternatively, adult crypts may be long-lived structures that infrequently divide or die.

Methods

Methylation patterns (the 5' to 3' order of methylation) at CpG sites that exhibit random changes with aging were measured from isolated crypts by bisulfite genomic sequencing. This epigenetic drift may be used to infer ancestry because recently related crypts should have similar methylation patterns.

Results

Methylation patterns were different between widely separated ("unrelated") crypts greater than 15 cm apart. Evidence for a more recent relationship between directly adjacent or branched crypts could not be found because their methylation pattern distances were not significantly different than widely separated crypt pairs. Methylation patterns are essentially equally different between two adult human crypts regardless of their relative locations.

Conclusions

Methylation patterns appear to record somatic cell trees. Starting from a single cell at conception, sequences replicate and may drift apart. Most adult human colon crypts appear to be long-lived structures that become mosaic with respect to methylation during aging.

### Secondary metastatic lesions to colon and rectum [^115GU3NP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Metastatic lesions of the colon are a rare clinical entity that may present difficulties in management. The incidence of these metastases appears to be increasing, as a result of physicians' greater awareness during follow-up investigations of a primary neoplasm. Furthermore, the presence of a greater proportion of these abnormalities at autopsy should be a triggering factor for further investigation for doctors dealing with colorectal oncology. Their clinical presentation may vary from asymptomatic to signs similar to those of colorectal cancer. However, immunohistological analysis is considered the cornerstone for differentiating metastases to the colon, originating from other primaries, from primary colorectal neoplasms. Survival reports and treatment options vary. This article concisely presents the main characteristics of the secondary lesions to the colon from neoplasms that metastasize to the large intestine (namely, lung, ovary, breast, prostate, kidney, and melanoma) focusing on their incidence, their clinical presentation and the workup investigation. Physicians aware of this uncommon entity are much better prepared to apply an efficient diagnosis and workup, as well as an appropriate treatment strategy.

### Exploring and modelling colon cancer inter-tumour heterogeneity: opportunities and challenges [^114RF9Tc]. Oncogenesis (2020). Medium credibility.

It has been suggested that biological differences between CMS subtypes are in part installed at the premalignant state. Expression patterns of SSA obtained from serrated polyposis syndrome patients have been connected to the CMS1 and CMS4 subtypes, whereas tubular adenomas from familial adenomatous polyposis patients bear resemblance to the epithelial subtypes. Other classification efforts on precursor lesions have been described and categorise most hereditary and sporadic tubular adenomas into the epithelial subclasses CMS2 and CMS3, depending on the strategy employed. The majority of sporadic and serrated polyposis syndrome-derived sessile serrated adenomas and hyperplastic polyps classify as CMS1 in these analyses and CMS4-like adenomas are detected at very low incidence. This discordance suggests that although mesenchymal features may be apparent in sessile serrated adenomas, they are not as pronounced as in CMS4 cancers. We therefore suggest that while tubular and sessile serrated adenomas may be predisposed to transform into a carcinoma of a particular CMS subtype, further oncogenic transformation and microenvironmental cues during progression are needed to definitively install the biological programs associated with the individual subtypes. One of those cues might be high levels of TGFβ that push sessile serrated adenomas towards a more CMS4-like rather than a CMS1-like state.

Interestingly, the patterns in activity of specific biological pathways associated with each CMS subtype can be extrapolated to subtypes identified in carcinomas of other gastrointestinal origin. Elaborate discussion of this observation goes beyond the scope of this review, and it has been diligently reviewed elsewhere. We would however like to point out an important message that can be distilled from this: these tumours originate from unique tissue types, each using organ-specific gene expression programs and each influenced by microenvironments composed of varying cell types. The overlap in subtype characteristics could point to epithelial cells using specific routes towards the development into carcinoma cells that lead to similar behaviour of these tumours. Additionally, it creates an opportunity to use the same treatment regimen for tumours originating from different tissues that nevertheless adhere to a similar subtype. An alternative explanation for the overlap in subtype characteristics across tumour types is that it does not represent distinct biological behaviour of the epithelial cancer cell compartment, but rather reflects the attraction of a unique microenvironment consisting of different cell types.

Of the diseases that colorectal surgeons treat, both colorectal cancer (CRC) and IBD account for a dominant portion of our practice. Colorectal cancer continues to grow in prevalence worldwide; it now accounts for about 1 in every 10 cancers, constituting the second most common malignancy in the world and the third most common malignancy in the United States. Despite numerous scientific advances and an increasing number of therapeutics, more than 700,000 deaths occur annually in the world. Inflammatory bowel disease primarily refers to 2 types of chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory disorders of the bowel, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. An estimated 3.0 million Americans currently have IBD, resulting in significant morbidity and financial burden to patients and the health care systemdespite the advances in medical therapies that have decreased the need for surgical treatment over the past 6 decades.

Historically, IBD research has used mouse models of disease that are derived through chemical and genetic transformation and bulk tissue analysis. Since the discovery that intestinal stem cells could be cultured, there has been a large shift toward the derivation and use of patient samples to advance research into the treatment and pathogenesis of IBD. For both CRC and IBD, because disease heterogeneity is now recognized at the cellular and molecular levels, clinical and basic science investigators are seeking patient-derived models that 1) more closely mimic disease pathology and can be analyzed at the cellular, molecular, and functional levels and 2) are used as avatars or representations of the human tissue from which it was derived to identify and test patient biomarkers and potential individual patient responses to therapy (Fig. 1). Development of the 3-dimensional intestinal organoid has advanced to the stage that it has the potential to meet these challenges. Herein, we summarize the history of intestinal models used for these purposes, then introduce the organoid as a new model that will obviate many of the challenges to analyzing the biology of both CRC and IBD. Therefore, to allow for a thorough appraisal of the literature, we will use "Are patient-derived organoids an improvement over current technologies for recapitulating patient disease and treatment response" as the overarching question driving this review.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colon cancer [^111i5Tac]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Synchronous colon cancers — may be treated by two segmental resections or subtotal colectomy; Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. The term synchronous colon cancer is defined as a second primary colon cancer diagnosed at the same time, or up to 12 months after, detection of the index cancer, and synchronous cancers have been reported to occur in 4% to 5% of patients. Management depends on location: cancers in the same segment are removed with a segmental colectomy, whereas cancers in separate segments may be treated with an extended resection or two segmental resections; although extended resections do not incur increased surgical morbidity and have not been associated with a survival benefit, functional outcomes may diminish subsequent quality of life. When an underlying colonic disease is present, the extent of resection should consider the underlying disorder.

### Colonic involvement in amebic liver abscess: does site matter? [^1151hV33]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

In conclusion the present study demonstrates that colonic involvement is present in more than two thirds of patients with ALA. When colonic involvement is present, a right colon lesion is universally present. Colonic involvement may extend beyond the hepatic flexure in patients with multiple ALAs, either involving the right or both lobes of the liver.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Colonic involvement in amebic liver abscess occurs commonly
Colonic lesions in amebic liver abscess involve cecum and ascending colon
Portal of entry of the parasite by superior or inferior mesenteric vein

What the new findings are:

Colonic involvement in amebic liver abscess occurs in more than three quarters of cases
Amebic liver abscess with colonic lesion have universal involvement of cecum or ascending colon
Colonic involvement may extend beyond hepatic flexure in multiple amebic liver abscesses

### Hyperplastic polyps and colorectal cancer: is there a link? [^116WAbHs]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Most colorectal cancers (CRCs) are thought to arise in preexisting polyps called adenomas. A second type of colorectal polyp known as a hyperplastic polyp has been regarded as harmless for decades. Patients with hyperplastic polyps are therefore not thought to be at any increased risk of CRC, and best-practice guidelines indicate that these polyps do not require surveillance colonoscopy. Recently, it has become clear that CRC is not a single disease. One type of CRC (30%) shows a chemical alteration in DNA known as methylation, and a proportion of these also show genetic instability at the level of DNA. There is now strong evidence that the hyperplastic polyp is not harmless, but it might serve as the precursor of CRC with DNA methylation and deficient DNA mismatch repair. This novel pathway applies particularly to the subset of hyperplastic polyps that occurs in the proximal colon. If this premise is correct, it would be unsafe to ignore these polyps. There is now a need to define the genetic steps that explain the evolution of CRCs that develop within hyperplastic polyps. At the clinical level, it will be necessary to identify biomarkers for hyperplastic polyps that are especially prone to malignant conversion. Screening can then be targeted more selectively toward patients who are at significantly increased risk of malignant transformation of hyperplastic polyps.

### The adenoma carcinoma sequence: an indoctrinated model for tumorigenesis, but is it always a clinical reality? [^117LrkQC]. Colorectal Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Evidence exists to support alternative pathways to the adenoma carcinoma sequence. Some mutations in key onco-suppressor genes relate to the anatomical site of the tumour. This link is typified by microsatellite instability and proximal neoplasia. However, rectal tumours are rarely considered separately. We hypothesized that tumour behaviour in the rectum may differ in terms of pathogenesis and malignant propensity. Therefore, we aimed to look for an association between the histopathological features of adenomas and their anatomical location as compared with the distribution of cancers.

Methods

A single centre prospective study was undertaken over a four-year period. Patients referred to a colorectal assessment clinic with bowel symptoms underwent a minimum investigation of flexible sigmiodoscopy. Neoplastic lesions were either biopsied or removed after noting distance from the anal margin. Adenomas, differentiated by size, villous architecture and degree of dysplasia were compared to both early and advanced carcinomas.

Results

Of 4089 patients, polyps were identified in 8.0% and cancer in 4.2%. There was a clear difference between the distribution of cancer and adenomas > 1 cm, P < 0.001. All degrees of dysplasia in large adenomas were more prevalent in the sigmoid colon as compared to cancer, P < 0.001. Seventy-five percent of high risk diminutive adenomas were rectal in origin.

Conclusion

Our data provides indirect evidence to support the concept that a significant proportion of rectal cancers may arise via an alternative pathway to the Vogelstein model. Polyp behaviour along with malignant propensity may actually be site dependent, with rectal polyps harbouring a more aggressive phenotype.

### Lower limb necrotising fasciitis descending from malignant colonic perforation: a rare pattern [^113YDEHC]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Necrotising fasciitis (NF) is a rare surgical emergency characterised by soft tissue necrosis and systemic compromise. Typically it originates following adjacent skin and soft tissue insult; however, our unusual case required a high index of clinical suspicion to avert potential mortality. A man in his 60s with diabetes mellitus presented with 2weeks of knee pain, swelling and necrotic skin on the posterior calf. X-ray demonstrated subcutaneous emphysema. Initial debridement confirmed extensive necrotising fasciitis of the whole lower limb with tracking through femoral canal into the abdomen. CT confirmed sigmoid colon perforation. Both life-saving Hartmann's and hip disarticulation procedures were performed with good outcomes. Histology confirmed locally invasive sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma. Our case highlights lower limb necrotising fasciitis as a rare complication secondary to sigmoid perforation associated with malignancy. In cases where the infection nidus cannot be identified, an abdominal source should be considered.

### The molecular genetics of colorectal cancer [^115HUBp9]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is a common but heterogeneous disease, which arises through the accumulation of genetic mutations. Knowledge of the molecular basis of colorectal cancer has advanced at a rapid pace in recent years, reflecting progress made in the field of genomic medicine. Targeted therapies have come into mainstream use, and the exciting prospect of treatment regimens tailored to the mutation profile of individual tumours is beginning to emerge. In order to understand the development and application of the next generation of colorectal cancer treatments, it is important that gastroenterologists have a working knowledge of the pathological mechanisms that drive the disease. This review examines our current understanding of the molecular genetics of colorectal carcinogenesis.

### Subclonal diversity arises early even in small colorectal tumours and contributes to differential growth fates [^117CpbrU]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, we have demonstrated that human colon polyps have different growth fates that are independent of specific mutations and that even small polyps can have multiple pathogenic mutations. We further investigated the mechanism of adenoma growth by applying statistical inference to a three-dimensional computer model and found that these additional private, pathogenic mutations likely arise early in the lifespan of a tumour. Understanding the molecular pathway of tumourigenesis and clonal evolution in polyps will allow us to better predict which polyps are likely to progress into adenocarcinomas and which patients are predisposed to developing advanced disease. Understanding the biological phenomenon of tumour formation and evolution may allow for changes in how patients are screened for colon cancer and ultimately decrease the incidence of this disease.

### An integrated tumor, immune and microbiome atlas of colon cancer [^116tdxBo]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

In recent years, while quantitative features of primary colon cancer, including those that are cancer cell intrinsic, immunological, stromal or microbial in nature, have been reported to be significantly associated with clinical outcomes, individually –, knowledge of how their interactions impact patient outcome is fragmentary.

To dissect this phenotypic complexity with respect to outcomes, we used orthogonal genomic platforms to rigorously profile a large collection of primary colon cancer specimens (unselected for tumor cell purity) and matched healthy colon tissue, complemented with curated clinical and pathological data annotation and appropriate follow-up.

### Mesenchymal cells in colon cancer [^115JbtWu]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Mesenchymal cells in the intestine comprise a variety of cell types of diverse origins, functions, and molecular markers. They provide mechanical and structural support and have important functions during intestinal organogenesis, morphogenesis, and homeostasis. Recent studies of the human transcriptome have revealed their importance in the development of colorectal cancer, and studies from animal models have provided evidence for their roles in the pathogenesis of colitis-associated cancer and sporadic colorectal cancer. Mesenchymal cells in tumors, called cancer-associated fibroblasts, arise via activation of resident mesenchymal cell populations and the recruitment of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and fibrocytes. Cancer-associated fibroblasts have a variety of activities that promote colon tumor development and progression; these include regulation of intestinal inflammation, epithelial proliferation, stem cell maintenance, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and metastasis. We review the intestinal mesenchymal cell-specific pathways that regulate these processes, with a focus on their roles in mediating interactions between inflammation and carcinogenesis. We also discuss how increasing our understanding of intestinal mesenchymal cell biology and function could lead to new strategies to identify and treat colitis-associated cancers.

### Colorectal cancer [^1176EBBL]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Every year, more than 945000 people develop colorectal cancer worldwide, and around 492000 patients die. This form of cancer develops sporadically, in the setting of hereditary cancer syndromes, or on the basis of inflammatory bowel diseases. Screening and prevention programmes are available for all these causes and should be more widely publicised. The adenoma-carcinoma sequence is the basis for development of colorectal cancer, and the underlying molecular changes have largely been identified. Prognosis depends on factors related to the patient, treatment, and tumour, and the expertise of the treatment team is one of the major determinants of outcome. New information on the molecular basis of this cancer have led to the development of targeted therapeutic options, which are being tested in clinical trials. Further clinical progress will largely depend on the broader implementation of multidisciplinary treatment strategies following the principles of evidence-based medicine.

### Exploring and modelling colon cancer inter-tumour heterogeneity: opportunities and challenges [^1139wc6R]. Oncogenesis (2020). Medium credibility.

The second, smaller (~15%), class of colon cancer, is characterised by high mutational load caused by defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR). Repetitive DNA sequences, such as microsatellites, are especially sensitive to mutation due to dysfunctional MMR and high abundance of microsatellite length alterations, a phenotype known as microsatellite instability (MSI), is therefore used as a surrogate read-out to establish MMR deficiency. A small percentage of the MSI tumours arises through genetic predisposition; individuals affected by hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) syndrome harbour germline-inactivating mutations in MMR genes. MMR deficiency in sporadic MSI tumours is usually the result of CpG island promoter methylation and hence inactivation of the MLH1 gene, which encodes a crucial player in the MMR pathway. This promoter methylation does not stand on its own, but is accompanied by widespread methylation of promoters throughout the genome, a phenomenon known as CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). CIMP-high MSI tumours are furthermore characterised by the frequent presence of mutations in the BRAF oncogene.

Over the last 15 years it has become more widely accepted that BRAF mutation and CIMP-high phenotype are molecular features accumulated during a distinct neoplastic pathway, the serrated pathway (reviewed in ref.). These specific changes appear to be crucial first steps in the pathway, given that they can already be detected in sessile serrated adenomas, whereas high MSI is only detected at later stages. The early presence of CIMP and the BRAF V600E oncogene might be functionally linked: it has been suggested that the BRAF oncogene directly contributes to the instalment of CIMP through direction of a repressor complex including DNA methyltransferase 3B towards CpG islands. The tumour suppressor gene p16INK4a is epigenetically silenced in CIMP and this might be used to overcome BRAF-linked oncogene-induced senescence to drive progression from sessile serrated adenomas to hypermutated MSI carcinoma.

### Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^1165kSwW]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on lower gastrointestinal bleeding:

- **Definition**: LGIB is defined as gastrointestinal bleeding originating distal to the ileocecal valve, which includes the colon, rectum and anus.
- **Pathophysiology**: Notable causes of LGIB include diverticulosis (42.5%), ischemic colitis (12.5%), hemorrhoids (12.5%), colorectal polyps or neoplasms (8.5%), angioectasias (7.5%), postpolypectomy bleeding (4.5%), IBD (4%), infectious colitis (3.5%), stercoral ulceration (< 2.5%), colorectal varices (< 1.5%), radiation proctopathy (< 1%), NSAID-inducted colopathy (< 1%), and Dieulafoy's lesions (< 1%).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the age- and sex-adjusted incidence of hospitalization for LGIB is estimated at 35.7 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: LGIB classically manifests as hematochezia (maroon or red blood passed through the rectum). Uncommonly, bleeding from the right colon may present with melena. If bleeding is severe, manifestations of hemorrhagic shock may be present.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: LGIB is associated with an estimated bleeding-related mortality of 1.1% (95% CI, 0.6–1.8%), and an overall rebleeding rate of 13.5% (95% CI, 11.8–15.5%).

### Infectious causes of colorectal cancer [^1167nsVR]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality in the United States and many other regions of the world. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, from the precursor adenomatous polyp to adenocarcinoma, has evolved rapidly. Colorectal carcinogenesis is a sequential process characterized by the accumulation of multiple genetic and molecular alterations in colonic epithelial cells. However, the development of colorectal cancer involves more then just a genetic predisposition. External or environmental factors presumably play a significant role, and inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity, alcohol consumption, and a diet high in fat and low in fiber have all been implicated as risk factors for the development of either colonic adenomas or carcinomas. We are becoming increasingly aware of microbes as causes of malignancies. This article reviews the various microbes that have been associated with the development of colorectal carcinomas.

### Phase II open-label study of pembrolizumab in treatment-refractory, microsatellite instability-high / mismatch repair-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer: KEYNOTE-164 [^1143ZskE]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer death, with an estimated 881,000 deaths worldwide. In the United States, 145,600 new cases and 51,020 deaths are estimated to occur in 2019. Approximately 5% of stage IV CRC is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and results from accumulations of high levels of single-base mismatches or short insertions and deletions in repetitive DNA tracts as a result of deficiencies in DNA mismatch repair (dMMR).MSI-H/dMMR metastatic CRC often originates on the right side of the colon, is poorly differentiated, and is more closely associated with mutation in the BRAF gene than microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRC, all factors associated with poor outcomes. Typically, patients with MSI-H/dMMR metastatic CRC are less responsive to conventional chemotherapy and have a poorer prognosis than patients with mismatch repair-proficient or MSS CRC.

### Multicolor lineage tracing reveals clonal architecture and dynamics in colon cancer [^112dXsbr]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Colon cancers are composed of phenotypically heterogeneous tumor cell subpopulations with variable expression of putative stem cell and differentiation antigens. While in normal colonic mucosa, clonal repopulation occurs along differentiation gradients from crypt base toward crypt apex, the clonal architecture of colon cancer and the relevance of tumor cell subpopulations for clonal outgrowth are poorly understood. Using a multicolor lineage tracing approach in colon cancer xenografts that reflect primary colon cancer architecture, we here demonstrate that clonal outgrowth is mainly driven by tumor cells located at the leading tumor edge with clonal axis formation toward the tumor center. While our findings are compatible with lineage outgrowth in a cancer stem cell model, they suggest that in colorectal cancer tumor cell position may be more important for clonal outgrowth than tumor cell phenotype.

### From APC to the genetics of hereditary and familial colon cancer syndromes [^111DcLKy]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndromes attributable to high penetrance mutations represent 9–26% of young-onset CRC cases. The clinical significance of many of these mutations is understood well enough to be used in diagnostics and as an aid in patient care. However, despite the advances made in the field, a significant proportion of familial and early-onset cases remains molecularly uncharacterized and extensive work is still needed to fully understand the genetic nature of CRC susceptibility. With the emergence of next-generation sequencing and associated methods, several predisposition loci have been unraveled, but validation is incomplete. Individuals with cancer-predisposing mutations are currently enrolled in life-long surveillance, but with the development of new treatments, such as cancer vaccinations, this might change in the not so distant future for at least some individuals. For individuals without a known cause for their disease susceptibility, prevention and therapy options are less precise. Herein, we review the progress achieved in the last three decades with a focus on how CRC predisposition genes were discovered. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical implications of these discoveries and anticipate what to expect in the next decade.

### Relationship between telomere shortening, genetic instability, and site of tumour origin in colorectal cancers [^114KaAub]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancers (CRCs) encompass a heterogeneous complex of diseases differing in molecular pathways and biological characteristics, arising through a multistep carcinogenic process, of which several genetic and epigenetic events have been characterised. There are at least two major pathways by which molecular events can lead to CRC: loss of heterozygosity with chromosomal instability, and a deficient DNA mismatch repair pathway with microsatellite instability (MSI). Although p53 and K-ras genes are known to be involved in chromosomal instability-associated carcinogenesis, MSI is frequently associated with the CpG island methylator phenotype. These two pathways are known to have a different origin and clinical outcome; right-sided proximal colon tumours are often MSI-associated lesions and have a better prognosis than left-sided distal tumours. Rectal tumours are thought to arise through mechanisms similar to left-colon cancers; recently, it has been proposed that they constitute a third entity displaying specific characteristics.

Telomere dysfunction has emerged as having a causative role in carcinogenesis by promoting genetic instability. Indeed, telomeres are specialised DNA structures located at the end of chromosomes; they are composed of (TTAGGG) n tandem repeats and are essential for stabilising chromosomes by protecting them from end-to-end fusion and DNA degradation. Telomeres are progressively shortened during each cell-replication cycle because of end-replication problems of DNA polymerase, and telomere shortening induces somatic cells to undergo senescence and apoptosis (reviewed in). Further erosion of telomeres may impair their function in protecting chromosome ends, resulting in genetic instability. Although maintenance of telomere length by reverse transcriptase telomerase (hTERT) is critical to preserving the replicative potential of cancer cells, telomere erosion has been proposed to have two conflicting roles: tumour suppression and genetic instability, a key event in the initiation of carcinogenesis.

### Tissue-location-specific transcription programs drive tumor dependencies in colon cancer [^11437yCq]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Why tumors arising in a very closely related tissue type but different anatomical locations differ in molecular drivers of cancers is an important and basic question in cancer biology. In colon cancers, BRAF mutations tend to occur predominantly in the proximal colon in the context of the epigenetic CIMP-H phenotype. Using the organoid-based colon cancer model to address the molecular dependencies for BRAF-driven colon cancers, our studies here show that transcriptional states of cells vary by the rostrocaudal axis in the colon, and importantly these transcriptional states are critical determinants of tumor development by BRAF mutations. Our studies here reveal Cdx2 to be critical for maintaining stem cell and differentiation programs specifically in the proximal colon-derived epithelial cells. Mechanistically, our studies show that Cdx2 helps maintain a cell-intrinsic tumor suppressive epigenetic state specifically in proximal colon stem cells, and that loss of Cdx2 results in suppression of the transcriptional response to differentiation signals and partial activation of stem cell markers in the proximal colon stem cells. Importantly, Cdx2 does not directly suppress the Wnt pathway, but by being an important regulator of the differentiation program, it is required to maintain the balance between stemness and differentiation. These molecular effects of Cdx2 loss resulted in acquisition of transient Wnt-independent growth in the proximal but not distal colon-derived organoids, which further specifically resulted in transformation of only the proximal colon stem cells by mutant BRAF. This dependency on Cdx2 for maintaining stem and differentiation programs and tumor development by BRAF specifically in proximal colon stem cells strongly suggests that the underlying transcriptional states and its regulation play central roles in defining differences in tumors along the colonic axis.

Colorectal cancer surveillance — symptom triggers: During the course of surveillance, the development of suspicious symptoms should prompt investigation because these may be the first sign of CRC recurrence. In randomized studies, 16% to 66% of patients with CRC were symptomatic at the time of their diagnosis of recurrence, yet < 7% of patients with symptomatic CRC recurrence have resectable disease. Suspicious symptoms commonly include new-onset abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, blood in stool, abdominal mass, weight loss, and obstructive symptoms.

Evaluation and risk assessment — history, laboratory testing, and genetic risk: A cancer-specific history should be obtained including disease-specific symptoms, past medical and family history, physical examination, and perioperative medical risk, and routine laboratory values, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, should be obtained; this is a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Sporadic, familial, and hereditary colorectal cancer types account for approximately 65%, 30%, and < 5% of new colorectal cancers in the United States, respectively. The personal and family history should include documentation of premalignant lesions and cancers, age of diagnosis, and the lineage of affected first- and second-degree relatives, and patients should be asked about known hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, previous genetic testing, and family ancestry/ethnicity. Patients with findings suggestive of an inherited susceptibility should be referred for genetic counseling. Among colon cancer patients younger than 50 years, up to one-third may carry a germline mutation associated with colon cancer.

### From APC to the genetics of hereditary and familial colon cancer syndromes [^11395Fmv]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite major advances in the field, CRC remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death and a major economic burden that personalized medicine is thought to alleviate. The decreasing costs of genomic research technologies bring the onset of precision medicine closer to reality as more research is carried out. Our current knowledge of germline and somatic changes in CRC predisposition has given us meaningful clinical predictors for the best-characterized syndromes; however, extending this to the rarer or lesser-known syndromes and understanding the genotype–phenotype correlations present in recognized syndromes is still awaiting further research. This includes the analysis of the noncoding genome and disease-modifying variants, which are anticipated to shed light onto the susceptibility to cancer as well as its progression and treatment. The work of cancer genomics projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, The International Cancer Genome Consortium, or the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium, will likely deepen our understanding of CRC through the development of research tools and techniques able to identify generalized patterns and characteristics of cancer, such as mutational signatures, contributing to the missing factors prohibiting detailed molecular profiling of patient-matched cancer and interpretation of variants of unknown significance.

Currently, many of the syndromes are not surgically curable, and patients need life-long monitoring. With the rate of new technological advances, the next decade will be exciting and will likely yield a better understanding of the genetic and environmental determinants of CRC susceptibility, the phenotype–genotype correlations of the already established susceptibility genes, and optimal management of heritable CRC in its various forms.

### Cancers of the colon and rectum: identical or fraternal twins? [^113vYZy9]. Cancer Discovery (2012). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer represents a major cause of cancer morbidity and mortality, with approximately 1.2 million cases and 600,000 deaths worldwide each year. Because of the anatomic continuity of the colon into the rectum, cancers affecting these organs have historically been considered equivalent. In this Prospective, we discuss the clinical and experimental data suggesting that colon cancer and rectal cancer are highly related, but distinct, diseases. Reconsidering the relationship between these cancers has implications for the development of new therapeutic paradigms.

### Inflammation and colon cancer [^114nb8jn]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

The connection between inflammation and tumorigenesis is well-established and in the last decade has received a great deal of supporting evidence from genetic, pharmacological, and epidemiological data. Inflammatory bowel disease is an important risk factor for the development of colon cancer. Inflammation is also likely to be involved with other forms of sporadic as well as heritable colon cancer. The molecular mechanisms by which inflammation promotes cancer development are still being uncovered and could differ between colitis-associated and other forms of colorectal cancer. Recent work has elucidated the role of distinct immune cells, cytokines, and other immune mediators in virtually all steps of colon tumorigenesis, including initiation, promotion, progression, and metastasis. These mechanisms, as well as new approaches to prevention and therapy, are discussed in this review.

### Carcinogenesis in IBD: potential targets for the prevention of colorectal cancer [^1157HCXh]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

In patients with IBD, chronic colonic inflammation increases the risk of colorectal cancer, perhaps because inflammation predisposes these tissues to genomic instability. Carcinogenesis in the inflamed colon seems to follow a different sequence of genetic alterations than that observed in sporadic cancers in the uninflamed colon. In this Review, we focus on the genetic alterations in colitis-associated colorectal cancer that contribute to the acquisition of the essential hallmarks of cancer, and on how those alterations differ from sporadic colorectal cancers. Our intent is to provide a conceptual basis for categorizing carcinogenetic molecular abnormalities in IBD, and for understanding how cancer-preventive therapies might target reversal of acquired abnormalities in specific biochemical pathways.

### Secondary metastatic lesions to colon and rectum [^113tuG4U]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Metastatic lesions of the colon are a rare clinical entity that may present difficulties in management. The incidence of these metastases appears to be increasing, as a result of physicians' greater awareness during follow-up investigations of a primary neoplasm. Furthermore, the presence of a greater proportion of these abnormalities at autopsy should be a triggering factor for further investigation for doctors dealing with colorectal oncology. Their clinical presentation may vary from asymptomatic to signs similar to those of colorectal cancer. However, immunohistological analysis is considered the cornerstone for differentiating metastases to the colon, originating from other primaries, from primary colorectal neoplasms. Survival reports and treatment options vary. This article concisely presents the main characteristics of the secondary lesions to the colon from neoplasms that metastasize to the large intestine (namely, lung, ovary, breast, prostate, kidney, and melanoma) focusing on their incidence, their clinical presentation and the workup investigation. Physicians aware of this uncommon entity are much better prepared to apply an efficient diagnosis and workup, as well as an appropriate treatment strategy.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) — initial evaluation should include focused history, examination, laboratories, and diagnostic imaging with preferred modalities to exclude mechanical obstruction. Recommendation 11 states: Initial evaluation should include a focused history and physical examination, baseline laboratory values, and diagnostic imaging. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Typical signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, altered bowel function, and dilation of the ascending and transverse colon without evidence of mechanical obstruction on imaging, and routine laboratory testing, such as a basic metabolic panel, should be included during the initial evaluation. For diagnosis, computed tomography or water-soluble contrast enema can reliably distinguish ACPO from a mechanical large-bowel obstruction, and unless there is a high suspicion for a distal obstruction, endoscopy is not typically recommended for diagnostic purposes given the associated risk of perforation in the setting of colon dilation.

### AGA clinical practice update on young adult-onset colorectal cancer diagnosis and management: expert review [^116NwNt1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Young adult–onset colorectal cancer — molecular epidemiology is marked by a greater proportion of microsatellite instability (MSI) in 350 tumors from young adult–onset vs older adult–onset distal colon and rectal cancers; deficient mismatch repair (MMR) cancers arise from pathogenic mutations in 1 of the 4 DNA MMR genes or in up to 2% of sporadic colon cancers; microsatellite and chromosome stable (MACS) tumors often arise in the distal colon and rectum and are less likely to produce the immune response of many MSI tumors; and overall, colorectal cancer (CRC) patients < 40 years of age are more likely to have consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) CMS1 or CMS2 than CMS3 or CMS4.

### The human colon cancer methylome shows similar hypo-and hypermethylation at conserved tissue-specific CpG island shores [^113kBKMX]. Nature Genetics (2009). Medium credibility.

For the past 25 years, it has been known that alterations in DNA methylation (DNAm) occur in cancer, including hypomethylation of oncogenes and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. However, most studies of cancer methylation have assumed that functionally important DNAm will occur in promoters, and that most DNAm changes in cancer occur in CpG islands. Here we show that most methylation alterations in colon cancer occur not in promoters, and also not in CpG islands, but in sequences up to 2 kb distant, which we term 'CpG island shores'. CpG island shore methylation was strongly related to gene expression, and it was highly conserved in mouse, discriminating tissue types regardless of species of origin. There was a notable overlap (45–65%) of the locations of colon cancer-related methylation changes with those that distinguished normal tissues, with hypermethylation enriched closer to the associated CpG islands, and hypomethylation enriched further from the associated CpG island and resembling that of noncolon normal tissues. Thus, methylation changes in cancer are at sites that vary normally in tissue differentiation, consistent with the epigenetic progenitor model of cancer, which proposes that epigenetic alterations affecting tissue-specific differentiation are the predominant mechanism by which epigenetic changes cause cancer.

### Transmission of the gut microbiota: spreading of health [^116rUASD]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transmission of commensal intestinal bacteria between humans could promote health by establishing, maintaining and replenishing microbial diversity in the microbiota of an individual. Unlike pathogens, the routes of transmission for commensal bacteria remain unappreciated and poorly understood, despite the likely commonalities between both. Consequently, broad infection control measures that are designed to prevent pathogen transmission and infection, such as oversanitation and the overuse of antibiotics, may inadvertently affect human health by altering normal commensal transmission. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms and factors that influence host-to-host transmission of the intestinal microbiota and examine how a better understanding of these processes will identify new approaches to nurture and restore transmission routes that are used by beneficial bacteria.

### Acute mesenteric ischemia: guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^113ErfAz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric arterial embolism

Roughly, 50% of all cases of AMI are due to acute mesenteric embolism. Mesenteric emboli can originate from the left atrium, associated with cardiac dysrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, left ventricle with global myocardial dysfunction associated with poor ejection fraction, or cardiac valves due to endocarditis. Occasionally emboli generated from an atherosclerotic aorta. Emboli typically lodge at points of normal anatomic narrowing, and the SMA is particularly vulnerable because of its relatively large diameter and low takeoff angle from the aorta. The majority of emboli lodge 3 to 10 cm distal to the origin of the SMA, thus classically sparing the proximal jejunum and colon. More than 20% of emboli to the SMA are associated with concurrent emboli to another arterial bed including the spleen, or kidney. Thus, findings of changes in these organs on CTA suggest a proximal embolic source.

Acute mesenteric arterial thrombosis

Thrombosis of the SMA (approximately 25% of cases) is usually associated with pre-existing chronic atherosclerotic disease leading to stenosis. Many of these patients have a history consistent with chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI), including postprandial pain, weight loss, or "food fear", and thus a systematic history is important when evaluating a patient suspected to have AMI. Thrombosis usually occurs at the origin of visceral arteries, moreover, an underlying plaque in the SMA usually progresses to a critical stenosis over years resulting in collateral beds. Accordingly, symptomatic SMA thrombosis most often accompanies celiac occlusion. SMA thrombosis may also occur due to vasculitis, mesenteric dissection, or a mycotic aneurysm. Involvement of the ileocolic artery will result in necrosis of the proximal colon.

Pathophysiology of acute non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia

NOMI occurs in approximately 20% of cases and is usually a consequence of SMA vasoconstriction associated with low splanchnic blood flow. The compromised SMA blood flow often involves the proximal colon as well due to involvement of the ileocolic artery. Patients with NOMI typically suffer from severe coexisting illness, commonly cardiac failure which may be precipitated by sepsis. Hypovolemia and the use of vasoconstrictive agents may precipitate NOMI.

### Subclonal diversity arises early even in small colorectal tumours and contributes to differential growth fates [^111MDGFD]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Historically, many investigators have believed that colorectal adenocarcinomas form through a stepwise progression from benign adenomatous polyps to premalignant polyps with foci of high-grade dysplasia, to locally invasive cancer and eventually to metastatic disease. This progression was thought to be driven by the sequential accumulation of mutations, perturbing specific genetic pathways at each step in the process: WNT signalling, RAS/RAF signalling, inhibition of apoptosis and TGFβ signalling. While these perturbations themselves are undoubtedly critical to colon tumourigenesis, the timing of the acquisition of these genomic changes is still under investigation and continued debate.

Advances in sequencing technology have revealed vast intratumoral heterogeneity in many solid tumours, including colorectal cancers. These lower frequency mutations were undetectable at the time when this stepwise progression model was hypothesised. The data presented here demonstrate that even small adenomas and HPs can have multiple pathogenic mutations, indicating that mutation profile does not define colon polyp stage. Interestingly, mouse models with simultaneous induction of pathogenic mutations in Apc, Kras and Pik3ca still progress through a histological adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence, further demonstrating that mutational profile of the tumour is not predictive of the stage of the disease. Similarly, others have shown that mutation profiles are relatively stable even when comparing primary and corresponding metastatic tumour. In addition to genetic profiles, longitudinal gene expression studies in mouse models show minimal expression differences between the early adenoma and intramucosal carcinoma stage. Collectively, these data point to non-genetic changes as the benchmarks between tumour stages; however, this conclusion depends on the assumption that all polyps have the same capacity for progression if given enough time.

### Rapamycin rescues APC-mutated colon organoid differentiation [^11527Be6]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Scientific background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally and ranks as the third most prevalent cancer. It develops through a multi-step process characterized by the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that transform healthy colon and rectal epithelial cells into malignant tumors. This progression typically involves the sequential transformation from normal tissue to adenomatous polyps and eventually invasive carcinoma. Loss of APC function due to germline mutations is an early and critical event in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder that significantly increases the risk for CRC. It is caused by a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, a critical tumor suppressor gene. Individuals with FAP usually develop hundreds to thousands of colorectal adenomas during adolescence, with a nearly 100% lifetime risk of progression to CRC unless prophylactic colectomy is performed. The APC gene, located on chromosome 5q21-q22, encodes a large multi-domain protein that negatively regulates Wnt signaling by controlling cellular levels of β-catenin, which is crucial for cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

### From APC to the genetics of hereditary and familial colon cancer syndromes [^112QrT1f]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Clues From Molecular Tumor Phenotype

Chromosomal abnormalities have been attributed to the genesis of cancer for over a century, and deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q) have been recognized as the most frequent chromosome anomaly in secondary leukemia and in some solid cancers for some 40 years. As 5q was already a prominent factor in cancer development and familial clustering of colon polyposis was acknowledged, a clinical report of a Gardner syndrome patient with a de novo interstitial deletion within the 5q arm provided the 'missing link' connecting 5q to polyposis predisposition. Soon, several research groups confirmed frequent allelic loss in 5q in CRC and linked the adenomatous polyposis phenotype to the locus, leading to the detailed characterization of the APC gene and initiating the hunt for gene defects responsible for inherited CRC and polyposes. Today, germline APC mutations are recognized as the underlying cause of FAP (Table 1); of these, 10–25% arise de novo. Typical of disorders with high de novo mutation rates, somatic APC mutations are sometimes restricted to certain tissues or organs, reflecting the timing of the mutation occurrence in embryogenesis. In these cases multiple genotypes are present in the patient, collectively referred to as genetic mosaicism. Patients with somatic APC mosaicism generally manifest as sporadic cases, as a disease phenotype only occurs when a substantial number of cells with the mutation are present in the target tissue. The detection of somatic APC mosaicism with conventional methods often proves difficult; the mutations might not be observable in samples derived from peripheral blood. Somatic APC mutations are commonplace in colorectal tumors and key players initiating colonic tumorigenesis.

### Guidelines on genetic evaluation and management of Lynch syndrome: a consensus statement by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^112dFeeV]. Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Lynch syndrome (LS) colorectal cancer (CRC) distribution and natural history indicate predominant right-sided location, high metachronous CRC after segmental resection, fewer adenomas by age 50, accelerated adenoma–carcinoma progression, distinctive histopathology, and improved stage-specific survival. CRC arises primarily (60%–80%) on the right side of the colon compared with 30% in sporadic CRC, and metachronous CRC occurs in 16% at 10 years and 41% at 20 years after segmental resection. LS patients develop fewer colorectal adenomas by age 50 years (usually < 3 neoplasms), and the adenoma–carcinoma sequence appears more rapid with dwell times estimated at 35 months compared with 10–15 years in sporadic cancer. Histopathology is more frequently poorly differentiated with signet cell histology, abundant extracellular mucin, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and a lymphoid host response, and LS patients have improved survival from CRC stage for stage compared with sporadic cancer.

### Oncofetal reprogramming drives phenotypic plasticity in WNT-dependent colorectal cancer [^114tHamR]. Nature Genetics (2025). High credibility.

These genetically engineered models offer an ideal platform for accurately investigating cell state dynamics, free from confounding factors typically associated with human datasets, such as treatment exposure and inconsistent temporal sampling. Nevertheless, given the inherent genetic heterogeneity and microenvironmental diversity among patients, we defined a human OnF signature to investigate OnF reprogramming in patients with CRC (Methods and Supplementary Table 1f). Our analysis of matched normal colons and adenocarcinomas from the Cancer Genome Atlas Colon Adenocarcinoma (TCGA/COAD) dataset confirmed activation of the OnF program in CRC (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Moreover, single-cell analysis of the Broad and SMC/KUL3 CRC cohorts, unequivocally demonstrated that the OnF state is significantly enriched in tumors (Fig. 1e, f). Further examination of 27 samples of matched primary tumors and liver metastases from five patients with CRCconfirmed its persistence in metastatic tumors (Fig. 1g). Notably, patient stratification based on both mismatch repair (MMR) and APC mutation status proved that OnF reprogramming is a common feature in APC mut /MSS (microsatellite-stable) CRC (Extended Data Fig. 2b–d). These data address a long-standing ambiguity surrounding OnF reprogramming in WNT-driven CRC –, and indicate that lack of comparison to adjacent healthy tissue in previous studies led to inaccurate conclusions.

Despite the widespread occurrence of OnF reprogramming in CRC, its biological significance remains largely elusive. We reasoned that this developmental rewind may endow neoplastic cells with enhanced plasticity, enabling them to transcend their typical lineage restraints. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of CRC tumors and various developmental stages of the human gastrointestinal tractrevealed remarkable similarities across tumors, fetal intestines, and adult stomach tissues (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Overall, we noticed a discernible shift in neoplastic tissue identity from its posterior colonic origins toward more anterior regions of the gut tube (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Further examination of single-cell transcriptomic data using lineage-specific signatures(Supplementary Table 1g) corroborated that CRC tumors have acquired a metaplastic multiregional identity (Fig. 1h, i). It is interesting that we noted a significant correlation between the OnF score and lineage plasticity, characterized by a loss of the original colonic identity and acquisition of noncanonical cell fates (Fig. 1j–l and Extended Data Fig. 2g–j).

### Exploring and modelling colon cancer inter-tumour heterogeneity: opportunities and challenges [^114KmyZT]. Oncogenesis (2020). Medium credibility.

Importantly, all these different types of preclinical models capture the various facets of colon cancer heterogeneity, including CRIS and CMS subtypes, illustrated by a vast range of published repositories. Before we discuss patterns in therapy sensitivity and resistance that have been identified, we would like to point out that every preclinical model is associated with a certain level of bias in terms of the subgroups that it represents best (Fig. 2). GEMM for colon cancer were typically driven by APC loss and these mice develop tubular adenomas and epithelial-like tumours. Novel conditional GEMM have emerged over the last years in which MMR genes are deleted to model MSI colon cancer, or in which APC is not included as a driver gene. These non-canonical GEMM typically give rise to serrated-like adenomas and more invasive and aggressive colon cancer. Traditional cell lines are enriched for MSI positivity, and primary cell line and organoid cultures adhere more to the CMS2 subtype. Other patient-derived models are likewise associated with biases: the original organoid establishment protocol is less suitable for generating serrated polyp cultures, whereas direct PDX appear to be more successfully derived from CMS1 and CMS4 tumours. Fully individualised therapy selection based on an in vitro or in vivo model is therefore still challenging, as one cannot know up front what technique would establish a personal preclinical model for a particular patient. Studying the responses across panels of models has however yielded valuable insights.

### Strong pathogen competition in neonatal gut colonisation [^1114eKfj]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Neonatal gut colonisation of E. coli adheres to the first-come, first-served principle

A more detailed analysis was carried out to scrutinise the possible variation across the time points the E. coli lineages appear to colonise the neonatal gut and to what degree they are inherited from the mother. In addition, we examined whether the lineages that are successful within the first 21 days persist in the infancy period sampling 4–12 months later. Examining the colonisation-time trajectories for each individual, we found the colonisation typically to already haven taken place at the very first sampling time at 4 days in the vaginal delivery cohort (Fig. 4a; 88 out of total 314 in the cohort were colonised at 4 days, 184 of whom were detected to carry E. coli at some point in the first 21 days). In the subsequent sampling point at 7 days after birth nearly all of the infants who had detectable amounts of E. coli at any time point were colonised (150 out of 184; Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 2a) and 66 of the infants were carrying the lineage that was also observed at 4 days. In the remaining 22 individuals out of the total 88 carrying E. coli at 4 days, in 3 cases, the lineage identified at 4 days had been replaced by another lineage and in 19 cases, no E. coli was present in detectable amounts at 7 days.

### Pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of colon cancer [^112gMLUR]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Colon cancer is believed to arise from two types of precursor polyps via two distinct pathways: conventional adenomas by the conventional adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence and serrated adenomas according to the serrated adenoma-to-carcinoma theory. Conventional adenomas arise from mutation of the APC gene; progression to colon cancer is a multistep process. The fundamental genetic defect in serrated adenomas is unknown. Environmental factors can increase the risk for colon cancer. Advanced colon cancer often presents with symptoms, but early colon cancer and premalignant adenomatous polyps commonly are asymptomatic, rendering them difficult to detect and providing the rationale for mass screening of adults over age 50.

SCOOP achieves cell subset granularity in COO predictions

We next examined SCOOP's ability to discern the COO within intestinal and hematopoietic regenerative lineages, focusing on microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer (CRC), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CRC tumors are typically classified into two major subtypes based on their microsatellite status: microsatellite stable (MSS) and microsatellite instable (MSI). Correlating aggregate mutational density of 51 MSS CRCwith normal colon scATAC-seq data meta-cells(Fig. 2a; Methods), we observed the highest association with intestinal epithelial stem cells, the apex of the gut regenerative hierarchy. In agreement with this analysis and prior knowledge, SCOOP also identified colon stem cells as the most informative feature and COO of MSS CRC when trained using only normal gut scATAC-seq data, (Fig. 2b) as well as normal cell subsets across tissues (Supplementary Fig. 4a).

### The chromosomal instability pathway in colon cancer [^114Jc2pe]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

The acquisition of genomic instability is a crucial feature in tumor development and there are at least 3 distinct pathways in colorectal cancer pathogenesis: the chromosomal instability (CIN), microsatellite instability, and CpG island methylator phenotype pathways. Most cases of colorectal cancer arise through the CIN pathway, which is characterized by widespread imbalances in chromosome number (aneuploidy) and loss of heterozygosity. It can result from defects in chromosomal segregation, telomere stability, and the DNA damage response, although the full complement of genes underlying CIN remains incompletely described. Coupled with the karyotypic abnormalities observed in CIN tumors are the accumulation of a characteristic set of mutations in specific tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that activate pathways critical for colorectal cancer initiation and progression. Whether CIN creates the appropriate milieu for the accumulation of these mutations or vice versa remains a provocative and unanswered question. The goal of this review is to provide an updated perspective on the mechanisms that lead to CIN and the key mutations that are acquired in this pathway.
