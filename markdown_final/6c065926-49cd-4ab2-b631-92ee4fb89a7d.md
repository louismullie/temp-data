how long can you continue chantix

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long varenicline (Chantix) can be continued, including typical duration and whether to extend treatment beyond 12 weeks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled duration and dosing schedule. Then, I should verify the clinical trial evidence supporting extended therapy to 24 weeks. Next, I will consider which patient profiles warrant extension beyond 12 weeks. After that, I need to check dosing details including pre-quit titration and any evidence on preloading. Finally, I should review safety over different durations, relevant guidelines, whether there is a maximum duration, and what to do about retreatment in those who relapse or do not achieve abstinence by week 12 [^111WiYbX] [^113cXc95] [^112J2nn4] [^11341zdx] [^11341jib].

> Let me first confirm the labeled standard. The FDA prescribing information specifies titration from 0.5 mg once daily for days 1–3 to 0.5 mg twice daily for days 4–7, then 1 mg twice daily for a maintenance duration of 12 to 24 weeks, which sets 12 weeks as the standard initial course with the option to extend to 24 weeks, and this dosing framework is the starting point for clinical decisions [^111WiYbX] [^112o7NAV].

> Next, I will examine the evidence base for extending treatment. The pivotal JAMA maintenance trial randomized individuals abstinent after 12 weeks of open-label varenicline to an additional 12 weeks versus placebo and showed significantly higher continuous abstinence through weeks 13–24 and persisting benefits to week 52 with continued varenicline, supporting a total 24-week course for relapse prevention, especially in those already abstinent at 12 weeks [^113cXc95]. Hold on, I should verify replication across designs; in a 2015 JAMA trial of smokers not ready to quit immediately, a 24-week varenicline course using a reduction-to-quit approach also improved abstinence during weeks 15–24 versus placebo, indicating effectiveness of extended durations in reduction paradigms as well [^114cPb2d]. Let me also consider duration head-to-head data; a 2021 double-blind factorial trial comparing 12-week versus 24-week varenicline found that extending to 24 weeks was a viable option without major safety concerns, although the interaction of duration with efficacy was not statistically significant for the primary 52-week point-prevalence outcome, suggesting that extension should be individualized rather than routine for all [^112J2nn4].

> I need to determine who benefits most from 24 weeks rather than stopping at 12. The most compelling case is relapse prevention in patients who achieve abstinence by week 12 but remain at high risk for relapse due to high dependence or prior failures, where the JAMA maintenance trial showed a meaningful and durable benefit of the extra 12 weeks of varenicline, and this aligns with the concept of maintenance therapy in tobacco dependence care [^113cXc95]. I should also consider those using a slow-reduction approach or who need more time to transition to abstinence; the 24-week reduction-to-quit trial supports extended therapy in this scenario from initiation, while continuing medication through early lapses can still lead to later success, reinforcing that not quitting on the target quit date does not mandate discontinuation of therapy [^114cPb2d] [^112KH6Rk]. Guideline perspectives remain consistent with first-line use and clinician discretion on duration within labeling; the American Thoracic Society endorses varenicline as a preferred first-line agent and the WHO 2024 guideline recommends it as a first-line pharmacotherapy, both broadly consistent with 12–24 week courses per labeling, though they do not mandate a specific duration beyond the label [^11341zdx] [^11341jib].

> Let me verify dosing, quit-date timing, and any flexibility. Standard titration is 0.5 mg once daily for 3 days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 4 days, then 1 mg twice daily for the remainder of the course, usually starting one week before the target quit date, and this is reflected both in labeling and contemporary trials using 12-week courses with counseling and a prequit titration week [^111WiYbX] [^117FPqJA]. But wait, what about preloading beyond one week; extended pre-quit varenicline for 4–6 weeks has been studied and can reduce smoking reward and ad libitum consumption pre-quit, with signals for improved early abstinence in some studies, suggesting preloading can be considered for select patients needing more extinction of cigarette reinforcement before the quit date, though core post-quit treatment duration still follows the 12–24 week maintenance window [^114x74d9] [^111UyKYg].

> I should confirm safety and tolerability across durations to ensure that extension does not introduce cumulative risks. The most common adverse effects are nausea, insomnia, and abnormal dreams, typically dose-related and often manageable by taking with food, temporary dose reduction to 0.5 mg twice daily, or slower titration, and these patterns are consistent across trials and labeling without evidence of a duration-dependent toxicity signal up to 24 weeks [^116AoUgh] [^11463kEe]. Hold on, I should review neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular signals; current labeling emphasizes warnings for potential neuropsychiatric symptoms and recommends monitoring, while evidence over time has questioned the causal strength of earlier risk communications, and pooled data have not shown a significant increase in cardiovascular serious adverse events attributable to varenicline, supporting safety through extended courses with appropriate clinical vigilance, including in patients with psychiatric comorbidities where ATS still favors varenicline [^116UH6wD] [^114q1WUn] [^116FxsoA] [^11341zdx].

> Let me think about special populations and dose adjustments because duration choices must be compatible with safe dosing. In severe renal impairment with creatinine clearance under 30 mL/min, the maximal recommended dose is 0.5 mg twice daily, which can be used over the same 12–24 week durations as tolerated, while no dose adjustment is needed for hepatic impairment, and these constraints should be incorporated before deciding to extend to 24 weeks [^115dAGXb] [^111cHadX] [^116hgqBc]. I should double-check that pregnancy remains a special risk scenario; given limited human data and animal signals of fetal harm, varenicline is generally avoided in pregnancy, so duration questions there defer to alternative strategies and shared decision-making rather than extension per se [^115CyjSJ].

> Now, I need to clarify the maximum duration and whether to go beyond 24 weeks. The labeled maintenance window is 12 to 24 weeks, and routine treatment beyond 24 weeks is not established by the FDA label or high-certainty evidence, so I should avoid exceeding 24 weeks in a single course and instead consider maintenance within 24 weeks or retreatment later if relapse occurs, guided by patient response and tolerability [^111WiYbX]. Hmm, wait a minute, what if a patient strongly prefers continuing past 24 weeks; absent robust evidence or labeling support, the safer and more evidence-consistent course is to stop at 24 weeks and reassess, using counseling support and follow-up to mitigate relapse risk rather than indefinite pharmacotherapy [^111WiYbX].

> I will now examine retreatment because many patients relapse after an adequate course. Retreatment with a subsequent 12-week course of varenicline has demonstrated efficacy versus placebo in those who previously used varenicline, with meaningful continuous abstinence benefits that generalize across subgroups, indicating that a new standard 12-week cycle is a reasonable strategy after relapse rather than trying to extend the original course beyond 24 weeks [^1122Zjej] [^11463kEe]. I should confirm practical details; retreatment uses the same titration, allows dose reduction for tolerability, includes counseling, and follows patients for long-term outcomes, which fits standard clinic pathways [^11463kEe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about combining therapies or simply extending for nonresponders. The 2021 factorial trial found no significant added benefit from combining varenicline with a nicotine patch or extending to 24 weeks for the primary 52-week point-prevalence outcome, suggesting that for patients not abstinent by 12 weeks, intensifying behavioral support or considering alternative pharmacotherapy strategies may be preferable to automatic extension, though guideline panels have offered a conditional suggestion for varenicline plus patch with low certainty of evidence, so this decision should be individualized with shared decision-making and close follow-up [^112J2nn4] [^114hhb8M]. I should double-check for exceptions; in reduction-to-quit paradigms or in those who become abstinent late, continuing to a 24-week total can still be reasonable if the trajectory is improving and tolerability is acceptable, consistent with the reduction trial and maintenance data [^114cPb2d] [^113cXc95].

> Putting this together, my practical recommendation is to initiate a 12-week course with standard titration and counseling, reassess at week 12, and, if the patient is abstinent or clearly benefiting with high relapse risk, offer an additional 12 weeks to complete 24 weeks for relapse prevention; if the patient is not abstinent, consider behavioral intensification or a change in pharmacotherapy rather than routine extension, and reserve retreatment with a new 12-week course for future relapse, keeping total single-course duration within 24 weeks and monitoring safety throughout [^111WiYbX] [^113cXc95] [^112J2nn4] [^1122Zjej]. I need to ensure we also tailor for renal function, psychiatric history, and patient preference, while emphasizing that the strongest evidence supports 12 weeks as standard with selective extension to 24 weeks for maintenance and reduction-to-quit strategies under clinical supervision [^115dAGXb] [^11341zdx] [^114cPb2d].

The standard duration of Chantix (varenicline) is **12 weeks** [^111WiYbX] at 1 mg twice daily following a 1-week titration. If you achieve abstinence, an additional **12 weeks** [^113cXc95] (total 24 weeks) [^112J2nn4] is recommended to reduce relapse risk. For those not ready to quit immediately, up to **24 weeks** [^114cPb2d] of treatment is supported to facilitate reduction-to-quit. Retreatment is appropriate after relapse [^1122Zjej], but prolonged use beyond 24 weeks [^111WiYbX] is not standard and should be individualized with close monitoring for neuropsychiatric [^116UH6wD] and cardiovascular adverse effects [^116FxsoA].

---

## Standard duration of chantix therapy

Initial titration (week 1): **0.5 mg once daily for days 1–3** [^111WiYbX], then **0.5 mg twice daily for days 4–7** [^117FPqJA]. Standard maintenance (weeks 2–12): **1 mg twice daily for 12 weeks** [^111WiYbX].

---

## Extended chantix therapy

Relapse prevention: For those abstinent at 12 weeks, continue an **additional 12 weeks** [^113cXc95] (total **24 weeks**) [^112J2nn4] to reduce relapse. Reduction-to-quit: For smokers not ready to quit immediately, treatment can continue for up to **24 weeks** [^114cPb2d] to support reduction and quitting within 3 months.

---

## Retreatment with chantix

After relapse, varenicline can be restarted [^11534sL3]; **retreatment is appropriate and effective** for those who relapse after initial therapy [^1122Zjej].

---

## Safety considerations for prolonged use

- **Neuropsychiatric effects**: Monitor for mood changes, agitation, and suicidal ideation [^114q1WUn].
- **Cardiovascular events**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease [^116FxsoA] [^116UH6wD].
- **Other adverse effects**: Nausea, insomnia, abnormal dreams [^116AoUgh], and rare seizures or sleepwalking may occur [^112FBJVb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

WHO 2024 guidelines identify varenicline as a **first-line option** [^11341jib] for tobacco cessation, and **ATS 2020 guidelines** recommend varenicline [^11341zdx] for tobacco-dependent adults.

## Summary table: chantix duration and recommendations

| **Treatment phase** | **Duration** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial therapy | 12 weeks | Standard duration [^111WiYbX] |
| Extended therapy | Additional 12 weeks (total 24 weeks) | For relapse prevention [^113cXc95] or reduction-to-quit [^114cPb2d] |
| Retreatment | 12–24 weeks | After relapse [^1122Zjej] |

---

Chantix is typically used for **12 weeks** [^111WiYbX], with an additional **12 weeks** [^113cXc95] for relapse prevention or reduction-to-quit [^114cPb2d]. Retreatment is appropriate after relapse [^1122Zjej], but **prolonged use beyond 24 weeks is not standard** [^111WiYbX] and should be individualized with close monitoring for adverse effects [^116UH6wD].

### Effect of varenicline on smoking cessation through smoking reduction: A randomized clinical trial [^114cPb2d]. JAMA (2015). High credibility.

Some cigarette smokers may not be ready to quit immediately but may be willing to reduce cigarette consumption with the goal of quitting.

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of varenicline for increasing smoking abstinence rates through smoking reduction.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial was conducted with a 24-week treatment period and a 28-week follow-up, taking place between July 2011 and July 2013 at 61 centers in 10 countries. The 1510 participants were cigarette smokers who were not willing or able to quit smoking within the next month but were willing to reduce smoking and make a quit attempt within the next 3 months. Participants were recruited through advertising.

- **Interventions**: The interventions included twenty-four weeks of varenicline titrated to 1 mg twice daily or a placebo, with a reduction target of 50% or more in the number of cigarettes smoked by 4 weeks, 75% or more by 8 weeks, and a quit attempt by 12 weeks.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary efficacy endpoint was carbon monoxide-confirmed self-reported abstinence during weeks 15 through 24. Secondary outcomes were carbon monoxide-confirmed self-reported abstinence for weeks 21 through 24 and weeks 21 through 52.

- **Results**: The varenicline group (n = 760) had significantly higher continuous abstinence rates during weeks 15 through 24 compared to the placebo group (n = 750) (32.1% for the varenicline group vs 6.9% for the placebo group; risk difference (RD), 25.2% [95% CI, 21.4%-29.0%]; relative risk (RR), 4.6 [95% CI, 3.5–6.1]).

### Effect of maintenance therapy with varenicline on smoking cessation: a randomized controlled trial [^113cXc95]. JAMA (2006). High credibility.

The majority of cigarette smokers who achieve abstinence relapse within the first year and require many attempts before achieving permanent abstinence. Evidence to support pharmacological treatment for relapse prevention is insufficient.

- **Objective**: To determine whether smokers who quit after 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline, a selective alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, maintain greater continuous abstinence rates (defined as not a single "puff" of a cigarette) than placebo controls during an additional 12 weeks of treatment and until 52 weeks after treatment initiation.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Randomized controlled trial conducted at multiple medical clinics in 7 countries with follow-up to 52 weeks after study baseline. Of 1927 cigarette smokers recruited between April 2003 and February 2004 and treated for 12 weeks with open-label varenicline titrated to 1 mg twice per day, 1236 (64.1%) did not smoke, use tobacco, or use nicotine replacement therapy during the last week of treatment, and 62.8% (n = 1210) were randomized to additional treatment or placebo.

- **Intervention**: Participants were randomly assigned to receive either double-blind varenicline, 1 mg twice per day (n = 603), or placebo (n = 607) for an additional 12 weeks.

- **Main outcome measures**: Carbon monoxide-confirmed continued abstinence during weeks 13 to 24 and weeks 13 to 52 of the study.

- **Results**: The carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous abstinence rate was significantly higher for the varenicline group than for the placebo group for weeks 13 to 24 (70.5%).

### Immediate versus delayed quitting and rates of relapse among smokers treated successfully with varenicline, bupropion SR or placebo [^1155syji]. Addiction (2010). High credibility.

To investigate successful quitting patterns among all those achieving continuous abstinence for weeks 9–12, a post hoc analysis was conducted on pooled data from two identical varenicline versus bupropion sustained-release (SR) and placebo randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our purpose was to examine the contribution of two subgroups of successful quitters who achieved continuous abstinence for at least the last 4 weeks of treatment. One group quit on the TQD and remained continuously abstinent throughout the 12-week treatment period. The other group had periods of smoking prior to attaining continuous abstinence for at least the last 4 weeks.

In addition to examining overall patterns of successful quitting, we tested two primary hypotheses with respect to differential medication effects. First, because varenicline's partial agonist and antagonist activity at α4β2 receptors has been reported to be linked to reduction in pleasure and reward from smoking, we hypothesized that quitting patterns for participants in the varenicline arm may be more dynamic across the 12 weeks of treatment compared with participants in the bupropion SR or placebo (counseling alone) arms. That is, we expected that smokers unable to achieve abstinence on the TQD or who experienced early lapses would be more likely to recover if they were in the varenicline arm. Therefore, we predicted that the varenicline arm would have a higher proportion of delayed quitters than the other two arms.

Secondly, we hypothesized that the experience of reduced rewards when smoking while taking varenicline may blunt mo

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing the efficacy of varenicline tartrate for alcohol dependence [^114P6gkE]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of varenicline (Chantix) for treating alcohol dependence. Varenicline is a partial α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine agonist approved by the Food and Drug Administration for smoking cessation. It has been shown to reduce drinking in animal studies and in small studies of humans who were both heavy drinkers and smokers. This research represents the first multisite clinical trial of varenicline in a population of smokers and nonsmokers with alcohol dependence.

Men and women (n = 200) meeting the criteria for alcohol dependence were recruited across five clinical sites. Patients received double-blind varenicline or placebo and a computerized behavioral intervention. Varenicline was titrated during the first week to 2 mg/d, which was maintained from weeks 2 to 13.

The results indicated that the varenicline group had significantly lower weekly percent heavy drinking days (primary outcome) (adjusted mean difference = 10.4), drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, and alcohol craving compared with the placebo group (P < 0.05). The average treatment effect on alcohol use was similar for smokers and nonsmokers. Varenicline was well-tolerated; adverse events were expected and mild.

The study concludes that varenicline significantly reduced alcohol consumption and craving, suggesting it might be a viable option for the treatment of alcohol dependence.

### Is a combination of varenicline and nicotine patch more effective in helping smokers quit than varenicline alone? A randomised controlled trial [^111mh2fk]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Such hypotheses have not been experimentally evaluated so far. One observational study from an in-patient smoking cessation facility found no differences in outcome between a cohort of patients receiving various combinations of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products plus varenicline and a cohort receiving various combinations of NRT products alone or with bupropion. The results need to be interpreted with caution as the groups were self-selected and the various medication combinations were not systematic. However, the study provides reassurance that the combination of NRT and varenicline is safe and well tolerated.

The present trial was designed to compare varenicline alone with a combination of varenicline and nicotine patch in effects on urges to smoke and abstinence for up to four weeks. This was a proof-of-concept trial, in that a positive finding would provide a justification for a long-term outcome trial. A negative finding would indicate a more definitive result as the lack of efficacy during a period in which the combination is expected to have its main effect would be unlikely to translate into a significant effect later on unless type II error was present.

We included a placebo patch to control for participants' and staff expectations. We did not include study arms using placebo varenicline. Varenicline is superior to nicotine patches across the time period of our study. Finding patches plus varenicline more effective than patches plus placebo could just reflect the difference between the two medications rather than any effect of their combination.

The provision of double placebo to sm…

### Comparative clinical effectiveness and safety of tobacco cessation pharmacotherapies and electronic cigarettes: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112PjUvg]. Addiction (2022). Low credibility.

Varenicline standard + NRT standard showed a high probability of being ranked as the best or second-best intervention for three outcomes, although there was no information available for this drug combination on prolonged abstinence. Varenicline standard + bupropion standard yielded the highest probability of being ranked as the best intervention for prolonged abstinence, although there was higher uncertainty concerning its ranking for the other outcomes. Varenicline standard showed the highest probabilities of being ranked second- to fourth-best for the different outcomes, whereas e-cigarettes presented a more uncertain ranking profile. Placebo was ranked as the least effective option for all outcomes. The findings for the standard doses also held in the rank-o-grams across all doses.

- **Rank-o-gram of intervention classes**: At standard doses with the exception of e-cigarettes across effectiveness outcomes. All nine intervention classes contributed to the ranking for any abstinence, whereas eight intervention classes were included for sustained abstinence (bupropion standard + nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) had no data), six for 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) (e-cigarette low, e-cigarette high, and bupropion standard + NRT standard had no data), and four for prolonged abstinence (no data for NRT standard, e-cigarette low, e-cigarette high, bupropion standard + NRT standard, varenicline standard + NRT standard).

As an indication of absolute effects, sustained abstinence probabilities are given for a UK population by applying.

### Varenicline for smoking cessation in individuals who smoke cigarettes and use electronic cigarettes: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^116HR5U3]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Continuous abstinence rates at weeks 4–12 (CAR 4–12) and 4–24 (CAR 4–24) in dual users randomized to varenicline were assessed. The proportion of participants who reported abstinence from smoking was defined by exhaled carbon monoxide level-verified (< 10 ppm) self-reported abstinence. The bars in the figure indicate standard errors.

Continuous abstinence rates and 7-day point prevalence changes in smoking status at each study visit are illustrated in more detail in Appendix; eTable 2. Smoking reduction and smoking relapse rates were calculated by considering changes in smoking behavior trajectories.

For the whole cohort of participants completing the study (n = 114 at 12 weeks; n = 88 at 24 weeks), a reduction in smoking consumption was observed in 25.4% and 18.2% of the participants at week 12 and week 24, respectively. The number of cigarette reducers between the study groups was significantly different only at week 24 after stopping treatment (33.3% vs. 7.7% for placebo and varenicline, respectively; P = 0.0007).

Smoking relapse was observed in 24.6% and 22.7% of the participants at week 12 (V6) and week 24 (V7), respectively. For the intention-to-treat analysis, the smoking relapse rate considered behavior trajectories from V5 to V6 (for changes occurring in week 8–12), and from V6 to V7 (for changes occurring in week 12–24). Specifically, variations in the total number of relapsing smokers were calculated by also adding the increase in the number of LTFUs and then dividing the results.

### Varenicline versus transdermal nicotine patch for smoking cessation: results from a randomised open-label trial [^115ZHSpt]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

The odds of abstinence at the end of open-label treatment for varenicline over nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (OR 1.70) is the same as that reported for abstinence 4 weeks after the quit date in the comparison of varenicline versus NRT in consecutive routine cases before and after the introduction of varenicline. This also approximates recent varenicline versus bupropion SR double-blind comparisons showing odds ratios (ORs) of 1.90 and 1.93 at the end of treatment.

In the longer term (over 52 weeks), the OR of remaining abstinent with open-label varenicline versus NRT in this study was 1.40, which is similar to the OR for double-blind varenicline versus bupropion SR through week 52 in one previous study (1.46) and lower than in another study (1.77).

In a meta-analysis of trials comparing transdermal NRT to placebo or no patch, the estimated long-term abstinence rate (after 52 weeks from the start of treatment with transdermal NRT) was 13.7%, compared with the continuous abstinence rate (CAR) of 20.3% through week 52 in the present study. The reasons for the higher abstinence rates in this study are unclear.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^11341zdx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Our systematic review identified two randomized clinical trials (n = 2,194) that directly compared varenicline with a nicotine patch in a cohort of participants with mental illness. Both studies assessed serious adverse events (SAEs), as well as point-prevalence abstinence at the end of the 12-week treatment period and at the 6-month follow-up. Relapse of tobacco use was not reported in these two trials.

- **Evidentiary basis for strong recommendation favoring varenicline**: Varenicline is favored over a nicotine patch in patients with substance-use or psychiatric disorders, with moderate-certainty evidence.

- **Benefits**: Compared with a nicotine patch, varenicline increased end-expired carbon monoxide (eCO)-confirmed 7-day point-prevalence abstinence assessed at a 6-month follow-up (Relative Risk [RR], 1.31; 95% Confidence interval, 1.12 to 1.53; Absolute Risk Reduction [ARR], 36 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 14 more to 62 more; high certainty in the estimated effects). Varenicline likely increased the 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at the end of the 12-week treatment period (RR, 1.78; 95% CI, 0.78 to 4.08; ARR, 108 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 31 fewer to 428 more; moderate certainty in the estimated effects). Relapse rates at follow-up at 6 months or later and impacts on quality of life (QOL) were not reported.

### Increasing varenicline dose in smokers who do not respond to the standard dosage: a randomized clinical trial [^114TDmKJ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Standard varenicline tartrate dosing was formulated to avoid adverse effects, primarily nausea, but some patients may be underdosed. To our knowledge, no evidence-based guidance exists for physicians considering increasing varenicline dose if there is no response to the standard dosage.

The objective of this study was to determine whether increasing varenicline dose in patients showing no response to the standard dosage improves treatment efficacy. In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial, 503 smokers attending a stop smoking clinic commenced varenicline use 3 weeks before their target quit date (TQD). Two hundred participants reporting no strong nausea, no clear reduction in smoking enjoyment, and less than 50% reduction in their baseline smoking on day 12 received additional tablets of varenicline or placebo.

All participants began standard varenicline tartrate dosing, gradually increasing to 2 mg/d. Dose increases of twice-daily varenicline (0.5 mg) or placebo took place on days 12, 15, and 18, up to a maximum of 5 mg/d.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Participants rated their smoking enjoyment during the prequit period and withdrawal symptoms weekly for the first 4 weeks after the TQD. Continuous validated abstinence rates were assessed at 1, 4, and 12 weeks after the TQD.

- **Results**: The dose increase reduced smoking enjoyment during the prequit period, with mean (SD) ratings of 1.7 (0.8) for varenicline vs. 2.1 (0.7) for placebo (P = .001). It had no effect on the mean (SD) frequency of urges to smoke at 1 week.

### Use of stop-smoking medications in the United States before and after the introduction of varenicline [^113fDYRY]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to evaluate trends in the use of stop-smoking medications (SSMs) before and after varenicline (Chantix™) was introduced to the marketplace in the United States. It also sought to determine whether varenicline reached segments of the population unlikely to use other SSMs.

- **Design**: Cohort survey.

- **Setting**: United States.

- **Participants**: A nationally representative sample of adult smokers in the United States was interviewed as part of the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey between 2004 and 2011. Primary analyses used cross-sectional data from 1,737 smokers who attempted to quit (approximately 450 per wave).

- **Measurements**: Reporting an attempt to quit smoking and the use of each of the following types of SSMs for the purpose of quitting smoking: nicotine gum, nicotine patch, other nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline.

- **Findings**: There was a significant increase in the rate of use of any SSM among quit attempters across the study period [odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10–1.21 per year]. This increase was largest after varenicline was introduced (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.07–1.26 per year); however, there was a decline in nicotine patch use during this time (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.76–0.99 per year). Varenicline users were generally similar to users of other SSMs but differed from those who did not use any SSMs, in that they tended to be older (OR = 5.46, P = 0.024), to be white (OR = 2.33, P = 0.002), to have high incomes (OR = 1.85, P = 0.005), to have high nicotine dependence prior to quitting (OR = 2.40, P = 0.001), and to have used medication in the past (OR = 3.29, P < 0.001).

### Varenicline for smoking cessation in individuals who smoke cigarettes and use electronic cigarettes: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^1161j4cW]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of varenicline for smoking cessation among individuals who smoke tobacco cigarettes and also use electronic cigarettes (known as e-cigarettes or vapes) have not been studied. We aimed to address this knowledge gap and examine predictors for smoking abstinence.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre randomised trial in Italy, we enrolled adults who had used an e-cigarette daily for at least 12 months and who also smoked at least one tobacco cigarette per day and had a willingness to quit smoking. A total of 155 participants were randomly assigned to receive either varenicline (n = 78) or matched placebo (n = 77). Varenicline (1 mg, administered twice daily for 12 weeks) was given in combination with smoking cessation counseling to dual users with an intention to quit smoking. Participants in both treatment groups received the same smoking cessation counselling throughout the study. The trial consisted of a 12-week treatment phase followed by a 12-week follow-up. The primary efficacy endpoint was the continuous abstinence rate (CAR) in weeks 4–12. Secondary efficacy endpoints were the CAR in weeks 4–24 and the 7-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence at weeks 12 and 24. This study is registered in EUDRACT, 2016–000339–42.

- **Findings**: Between November 2018 and February 2020, 114 participants (61 in the varenicline group and 53 in the placebo group) completed the intervention phase at week 12, and 88 participants (52 in the varenicline group and 36 in the placebo group) completed the follow-up phase at week 24.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114hhb8M]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The panel concluded that varenicline plus a nicotine patch showed a large, desirable effect compared with varenicline alone on smoking abstinence and that varenicline plus a nicotine patch may increase the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) only slightly compared with varenicline alone. As a result, the panel suggested varenicline plus a nicotine patch rather than varenicline alone for the treatment of tobacco dependence. The panel chose to make a conditional recommendation because the low certainty in estimated SAEs limited confidence in the overall certainty of the evidence.

Of note, the original clinical question sought to identify the relative effect of adding a nicotine reliever to the varenicline controller to manage acute cue-induced cravings, which returned no direct evidence for analysis. The panel, therefore, decided to liberalize the definition of nicotine therapy to include the patch, comparing varenicline plus a nicotine patch with varenicline alone. Given the differences in pharmacokinetics between a nicotine patch and other delivery forms, the panel did not believe that a conclusion regarding the effectiveness of other forms of nicotine replacement could be made at this time.

For tobacco-dependent adults in whom treatment is being initiated, the guideline suggests varenicline plus a nicotine patch over using varenicline alone (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the estimated effects).

To our knowledge, no other clinical practice guideline has compared varenicline plus a nicotine patch with varenicline alone.

### The Food and Drug Administration and varenicline: Should risk communication be improved [^114q1WUn]. Addiction (2017). High credibility.

Patients and clinicians are likely to interpret the FDA Black Box warning about serious adverse neuropsychiatric events as implying a causal effect of varenicline. This warning does not reflect scientific evidence accurately and should be revised.

On May 11, 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved varenicline (Chantix, Champix) for use in smoking cessation. It was the first oral non‐nicotine treatment licensed by the FDA since bupropion in 1997. However, it was not long before concerns were raised about the neuropsychiatric safety of the medicine. Anecdotal reports from popular press and internet sites, in addition to post‐marketing case reports and reports to the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS), suggested that some patients prescribed varenicline had experienced suicidal behavior. As a result, in November 2007, the FDA announced that they were conducting two safety reviews of varenicline's associations with suicidality and neuropsychiatric adverse events not related to suicidality. Findings from these reviews were published in 2008, with the FDA concluding that "[varenicline] may cause worsening of a psychiatric illness even if it is currently under control and may cause an old psychiatric illness to recur". In July 2009, the FDA went further, mandating that varenicline carry a "Black Box warning". These warnings highlighted "the risk of serious neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients using these products". Symptoms included changes in behavior, hostility, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, and behavior.

### SPL drug information for varenicline tartrate [^115CyjSJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of varenicline tartrate PO (also known as Chantix) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, there is insufficient evidence. Animal studies have shown evidence of fetal harm. The drug varenicline tartrate PO is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. It has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Retreatment with varenicline for smoking cessation in smokers who have previously taken varenicline: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^117GN8wT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

In countries with long-standing tobacco control policies and declining prevalence of smoking, an increasing proportion of continuing smokers accessing smoking cessation medications have a history of previous quit attempts with these medications. In medical conditions for which multiple medication options are available for treatment, there may be more flexibility for the clinician to recommend or prescribe a drug different from the one used earlier. However, smoking cessation medications approved by national regulatory agencies are generally limited to nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), bupropion, and varenicline. Development and approval of new therapies have been slow, with the most recent approvals for bupropion (1997) and varenicline (2006).

Switching from one form of NRT to another, or from NRT to bupropion, may increase the likelihood of abstinence with the next quit attempt, but there are few medications to try before retreatment with one of these medications is the only option remaining. There are limited data to guide clinical decisions for subsequent treatments with smoking cessation medications. Long-term abstinence rates (6 months) for previous nicotine patch users retreated with various forms of NRT range from 0 to 6.4%. The 6-month abstinence rate for the one bupropion retreatment study was 12%. A recent study tested repeated 6-month cycles of treatment with bupropion (7 weeks) or NRT (nicotine patches; 6 weeks) in smokers who failed to achieve abstinence at the end of initial treatment. Abstinence rates were measured as a 7-day point prevalence at the end of three consecutive cycles.

### Factors moderating the relative effectiveness of varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy in clients using smoking cessation services [^115xLwtQ]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

To assess how far the greater effectiveness of varenicline over nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is moderated by characteristics of smokers or setting in clinical practice, we used observational data from 22,472 treatment episodes between 2013 and 2016 from smoking cessation services in England. We aimed to determine whether differences between varenicline and NRT were moderated by various smoker and setting characteristics. These included levels of social deprivation, age, gender, ethnic group, nicotine dependence, and treatment context. From the collected data, 15,640 episodes were analyzed in relation to 4-week quit rates and 14,273 episodes at 12 weeks. All two-way interactions involving pharmacotherapy were fitted, in addition to the main effects, and a parsimonious model was identified using a backward stepwise selection procedure.

- **Setting**: England

- **Participants**: Clients of the smoking cessation service (number of individuals in 4-week quit analysis = 15,640).

- **Measurements**: Four-week carbon monoxide-validated (primary outcome) and 12-week self-reported (secondary outcome) quit success/failure.

At both follow-up points, varenicline was associated with higher success rates overall [P < 0.001 at both 4 and 12 weeks; adjusted odds ratio (OR) varenicline versus NRT = 1.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.61, 2.06) and 2.58 (95% CI = 2.26, 2.94) at 4 and 12 weeks, respectively]. At 12 weeks, the relative benefits of varenicline were found to be influenced by the setting in which advice was provided [P < 0.001 for interaction pharmacotherapy × setting; adjusted odds ratio for varenicline].

### Retreatment with varenicline for smoking cessation in smokers who have previously taken varenicline: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^1122Zjej]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). High credibility.

The continuous abstinence rates (CARs) for weeks 9–12 for all the randomized (intent-to-treat) population were 44.6% for varenicline compared to 11.7% for placebo (OR = 6.96; 95% CI: 4.27, 11.33). End-of-treatment CARs, defined based on participants with more than 80% compliance with study medication, were 56.4% for varenicline versus 15.4% for placebo (OR = 8.99; 95% CI: 5.16, 15.67). Participants who completed more than 80% of the planned number of days in the study had a median duration of treatment of 84 days in both treatment groups.

The primary efficacy endpoint of CAR for weeks 9–12 was further examined in exploratory subgroup analyses controlling separately for smoking cessation history and baseline characteristics. The analysis model included the main effect of treatment, one covariate (including one of the subgroup characteristics in the model separately), and the treatment by covariate interaction effect. There were no significant treatment by subgroup interactions in this exploratory analysis (all P > 0.09), and results can be generalized to all subgroups. CARs by subgroup are available online in Supplementary Table S2.

Additionally, the 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate was significantly higher for varenicline compared to placebo at week 12 (53.0% vs. 14.7%; OR = 7.85; 95% CI: 4.92, 12.51; P < 0.0001) and week 24 (32.9% vs. 15.5%; OR = 2.94; 95% CI: 1.86, 4.64; P < 0.0001).

### Varenicline for smoking cessation in individuals who smoke cigarettes and use electronic cigarettes: A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^117FPqJA]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Participants in the varenicline group received varenicline (1 mg, administered twice daily for 12 weeks) plus counselling. Participants in the placebo group received a placebo (administered twice daily for 12 weeks) plus counselling. According to the manufacturer's recommendations, participants assigned to varenicline were titrated to a full dose by the time of their target quit date (TQD). They were started on 0.5 mg once daily for 2–3 days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 4–5 days, and finally 1 mg twice daily for 11 weeks.

Participants in both treatment groups received the same smoking cessation counselling throughout the entire duration of the study. One-on-one counselling sessions were provided at each visit for a total of 10–15 minutes by two experienced clinical psychologists. Our approach to smoking cessation was partially adapted from the 5A's brief tobacco interventions for smokers who are ready to quit. "Received intervention" indicates participants who were randomised to receive treatment (varenicline/placebo) and also underwent smoking cessation counselling. "Completed treatment phase" indicates participants who completed 12 weeks of interventions (i.e. varenicline/placebo + smoking cessation counselling). Study drug adherence was monitored by dosing record checks at each study visit.

At the baseline visit (V1), eligibility criteria were reassessed, and participants were randomised as outlined above. The following data were recorded at V1: sociodemographic information.

### Varenicline versus transdermal nicotine patch for smoking cessation: Results from a randomised open-label trial [^116QLKm2]. Thorax (2008). High credibility.

In a recent meta-analysis using indirect comparisons of treatment effect versus placebos, varenicline was found to be significantly superior to NRT at 3 months (OR 1.78) and at 12 months (OR 1.66) while bupropion SR versus NRT at 12 months showed no difference (OR 1.14). The direct comparisons of varenicline versus NRT reported here are similar to these indirect comparisons but with a lower difference at 12 months.

Preclinical studies have shown that varenicline acts as a partial agonist at the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), with both agonist and antagonist effects. Participants who continued to smoke in the varenicline group reported a greater reduction in smoking satisfaction than continuing smokers in the NRT group. This may reflect the antagonist action of varenicline at α4β2 nAChRs, which are thought to mediate the reinforcing effects of nicotine. As an agonist, nicotine would be expected to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. In this study, varenicline showed significant benefit over NRT in measures of craving and withdrawal by decreasing the urge to smoke, negative effect, and restlessness. These findings are consistent with lower severity ratings of craving in participants in a routine smoking cessation clinic taking varenicline compared with those taking NRT, and are encouraging in terms of increasing the pharmacotherapy choices for smokers who find it hard to cope with symptoms of withdrawal during quit attempts.

This benefit of a partial agonist over a full agonist is perhaps surprising, but may be due to the combined effect of nicotine concentrations.

### Effects of nicotine patch vs varenicline vs combination nicotine replacement therapy on smoking cessation at 26 weeks: A randomized clinical trial [^116qpmjL]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Smoking cessation medications are routinely used in health care; it is vital to identify medications that most effectively treat this leading cause of preventable mortality.

The objective of the study was to compare the efficacies of varenicline, combination nicotine replacement therapy (C-NRT), and the nicotine patch for 26-week quit rates.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A three-group randomized intention-to-treat clinical trial occurred from May 2012 to November 2015 among smokers recruited in the Madison, Wisconsin, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, communities. Of the smokers offered the study, 65.5% (2687/4102) refused participation prior to randomization.

- **Interventions**: Participants were randomized to one of three 12-week open-label smoking cessation pharmacotherapy groups: (1) nicotine patch only (n = 241); (2) varenicline only (including 1 prequit week; n = 424); and (3) C-NRT (nicotine patch + nicotine lozenge; n = 421). Six counseling sessions were offered.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was carbon monoxide-confirmed self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes were carbon monoxide-confirmed self-reported initial abstinence, prolonged abstinence at 26 weeks, and point-prevalence abstinence at weeks 4, 12, and 52.

Results indicated that among 1086 smokers randomized (52% women; 67% white; mean age, 48 years; mean of 17 cigarettes smoked per day), 917 (84%) provided 12-month follow-up data. Treatments did not differ on any abstinence outcome measure at 26 or 52 weeks, including point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks (nicotine patch, 22.8% [55/241]).

### Varenicline for smoking cessation in individuals who smoke cigarettes and use electronic cigarettes: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^111hi9KW]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

This study was a double-blind, single-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess the efficacy and safety of varenicline versus placebo, alongside smoking counseling, in individuals who both vape and smoke and intend to quit smoking. Recruitment began in November 2018, with the first participant's visit in December 2018, and concluded in February 2020, with the last participant's visit in September 2020. The trial lasted for a total of 24 weeks, consisting of a 12-week treatment phase immediately followed by a 12-week non-treatment phase. The study was conducted at the Centro per la Prevenzione e Cura del Tabagismo (CPCT), a university-operated smoking cessation center.

Individuals who both vape and smoke, intending to quit, were randomized to receive either varenicline at a dose of 1 mg twice daily for 12 weeks or a matched placebo for the same period. Participants were monitored prospectively for up to 24 weeks. During this time, assessments were made of smoking and vaping habits, exhaled carbon monoxide levels, questionnaire scores, adverse events, vital signs, and body mass index at each study visit. Dashed lines indicate the follow-up phase; symbols and telephone contacts represent communication methods used during the study.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^116mxgpT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

- **Harms and burdens**: Our systematic review suggested that varenicline may decrease the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) slightly compared with a nicotine patch (risk ratio [RR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 1.67; absolute risk reduction [ARR], 1 fewer per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 5 fewer to 8 more; moderate certainty in the estimated effects). The undesirable effects were judged as trivial. There was one randomized controlled trial (RCT) that evaluated the impact of varenicline on the use of other substances. The effect of varenicline on other substance use was unclear because of very low certainty of evidence (for alcohol use: RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.3; ARR, 128 fewer per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 221 fewer to 87 more; very low certainty in the estimated effects; other substance use: RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.71 to 2.87; ARR, 108 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 75 fewer to 483 more; very low certainty in the estimated effects). The effect on the severity of withdrawal was not available.

- **Certainty in estimated effects**: Certainty in the estimated effects of varenicline was judged to be high for 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 6-month follow-up. Certainty in the estimated effects on 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 12-week follow-up and on SAEs were judged to be moderate because of serious imprecision, with 95% CIs that could lead to opposing conclusions. Estimates for the impact of varenicline on the risks of other substance use were judged to be of very low certainty because of a serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision due to the small number of events.

### Varenicline and counseling for vaping cessation: a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial [^116DAGhz]. BMC Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Varenicline is a specific partial agonist and antagonist of the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that has been found to be effective in increasing abstinence rates among cigarette smokers. It is expected to help with the cessation of nicotine vaping due to its mechanism of action, which attenuates nicotine withdrawal symptoms and craving. Consistent with this observation in cigarette smokers, varenicline was shown to be effective at reducing the urge to vape in people who use electronic cigarettes (ECs). Another mechanism by which varenicline facilitates sustained abstinence is by reducing the likelihood of relapse to smoking during a quit attempt. Although relapse prevention was not formally investigated, this effect of varenicline was confirmed in the present study; after stopping varenicline (between week 12 and week 24), the vaping relapse rate increased by 17.2% compared to 9.9% after stopping placebo.

- **Anxiety and cohabitant vapers**: The presence of cohabitant vapers and high levels of anxiety greatly reduced the odds of success for abstinence from vaping, similar to observations in cigarette smokers. Smokers with anxiety disorders experience more severe withdrawal symptoms during smoking cessation than those without such disorders and are less likely to quit. For EC users, high levels of anxiety were significantly associated with reduced odds of sustained vaping cessation.

The presence of smokers in the household is known to be among the strongest sociodemographic predictors of quitting smoking in adult cigarette smokers. In the future, cessation interventions for EC users should consider these sociodemographic factors to better support quitting efforts.

### Flexible, dual-form nicotine replacement therapy or varenicline in comparison with nicotine patch for smoking cessation: A randomized controlled trial [^114YPcof]. BMC Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The sample characteristics were similar between the treatment groups at baseline. Participants had a mean age of 48.6 years (standard deviation (SD), 10.8; median (Mdn), 50; interquartile range (IQR), 42–56), with 53.6% (n = 395) being male and 91.8% (n = 669) identifying as white. They reported an average of 14 years of education (SD, 3.0; Mdn, 14; IQR, 12–16) and 52.0% (n = 381) were employed full-time.

Most participants (82.9%; n = 611) had at least one medical condition, with chronic pain (39.1%; n = 286), respiratory illness (34.7%; n = 255), and arthritis (31.2%; n = 229) being the most prevalent. A significant proportion (59.0%; n = 435) met criteria for a lifetime psychiatric diagnosis, with major depressive disorder (64.6%; n = 281) and anxiety disorders (21.4%; n = 93) being the most common.

Participants started smoking during adolescence (mean age, 14.5 years; SD, 4.0; Mdn, 20; IQR, 15–25), smoked for an average of 31 years (SD, 11.7), and consumed 23.2 cigarettes per day (SD, 10.8; Mdn, 32; IQR, 23–32). They tended to live with one smoker on average (M, 1.04; SD, 1.02), with 66.2% (n = 475) living with one or more smokers. High nicotine dependence (M, 6.1; SD, 2.2; Mdn, 6; IQR, 5–8), confidence (M, 7.38; SD, 2.16; Mdn, 8; IQR, 6–8), and motivation (M, 8.69; SD, 1.47; Mdn, 9; IQR, 8–9) to quit were evident at the baseline assessment.

### Varenicline versus transdermal nicotine patch for smoking cessation: results from a randomised open-label trial [^116mJSi9]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

Results:

- **Participants**: A total of 957 participants were screened for the study and 757 were randomized (378 to varenicline and 379 to NRT). Of these, 376 participants in the varenicline group and 370 in the NRT group reported taking at least one dose of the treatment medication. The progression of participants through the study is shown in Figure 2. The demographic characteristics and smoking histories were comparable between the treatment groups.

- **Efficacy**:
	- **End of treatment 4-week CAR**: For the primary analysis population (all randomized and treated), the proportion of participants who remained continuously abstinent for the last four weeks of treatment was significantly greater for varenicline (weeks 9–12, 55.9% (n = 210)) than for NRT (weeks 8–11, 43.2% (n = 160); OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.28, p < 0.001). The results were similar for the all randomized population (varenicline, 55.6%; NRT, 42.2%; OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.36, p < 0.001) and were also similar when the two treatments were compared in the same four-week periods: weeks 9–12 (varenicline, 55.9%; NRT, 42.2%; OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.39, p < 0.001) and weeks 8–11 (varenicline, 55.1%; NRT, 43.2%; OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.21, p < 0.001).

### Efficacy and safety of varenicline for adolescent smoking cessation: A randomized clinical trial [^11317tqe]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide, with most tobacco users beginning in adolescence. Although advances have yielded efficacious pharmacotherapies to complement smoking cessation counseling in adults, far less progress has been made in addressing tobacco use in this younger population.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of varenicline tartrate for smoking cessation in adolescents and young adults.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This 2-group randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intention-to-treat clinical trial enrolled a volunteer sample of treatment-seeking adolescent and young adult cigarette smokers (n = 157) aged 14 to 21 years at an outpatient clinical site in Charleston, South Carolina, from August 15, 2012, to October 20, 2017. Follow-up was completed on January 25, 2018. Data were analyzed from March 19, 2018, to August 11, 2018, with further revisions completed April 10, 2019.

- **Interventions**: Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a 12-week course of varenicline (n = 77) or placebo (n = 80). All participants received weekly smoking cessation counseling.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The preselected primary efficacy outcome was urine cotinine level-confirmed 7-day abstinence at the end of treatment. Secondary efficacy outcomes included weekly abstinence throughout active treatment, abstinence at post-treatment follow-up visits, and time to first 7-day abstinence. The primary safety outcome was the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events.

### Effects of 21 days of varenicline versus placebo on smoking behaviors and urges among non-treatment seeking smokers [^111UyKYg]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

Varenicline promotes smoking cessation and reduces urges to smoke; however, the mechanisms associated with these effects and their time course are not well characterized. One potential mechanism may be extinction, but the duration of the dosing protocol may not be sufficient. We examined the effect of extended pre-treatment with varenicline on smoking behavior among 17 non-treatment seeking adult smokers. Using a within-subjects, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, participants received standard dosing of varenicline for 21 days, followed by a 14-day washout period and 21 days of placebo, with the order counterbalanced.

- **Cigarettes per day (CPD)**: Smoking topography, smoking urges (QSU), and side effects were assessed every three days.
- **Biomarkers (e.g. nicotine metabolites)**: Collected on days 1, 7, and 21.

There was a significant drug by time interaction indicating a reduction in CPD during the varenicline phase (between days 10–21), but no reduction during placebo. Varenicline also led to reductions in nicotine metabolites and urges to smoke. Among this sample of non-treatment seeking smokers, varenicline significantly reduced smoking behavior. Results have important treatment implications because changes in CPD and craving did not occur until after the typical one-week run-up period. This suggests that a longer duration of pre-treatment may be beneficial for some smokers.

### Flexible, dual-form nicotine replacement therapy or varenicline in comparison with nicotine patch for smoking cessation: A randomized controlled trial [^116RRcWC]. BMC Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial was to compare the effectiveness of three cessation treatment strategies: standard-dose monotherapy nicotine replacement therapy (NRT); extended duration of combinations of NRT products (NRT+); and extended varenicline (VR). These interventions were chosen as they are first-line treatments for smoking cessation. The use of flexible and dual-form NRT reflects contemporary clinical practice and the choices of smokers in the real world; the efficacy of this treatment and varenicline compared to standard-dose nicotine replacement therapy requires further testing. We hypothesized that NRT+ and/or VR would each be superior to standard-dose NRT in achieving smoking cessation.

### Effects of combined varenicline with nicotine patch and of extended treatment duration on smoking cessation: A randomized clinical trial [^112J2nn4]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

The importance of this study lies in understanding the efficacy of smoking cessation medications regularly used in healthcare. Research suggests that combining varenicline with the nicotine patch, extending the duration of varenicline treatment, or both, may enhance cessation effectiveness.

- **Objective**: To compare combinations of varenicline plus the nicotine or placebo patch versus combinations used for either 12 weeks (standard duration) or 24 weeks (extended duration).

- **Design, settings, and participants**: This was a double-blind, 2×2 factorial randomized clinical trial conducted from November 11, 2017, to July 9, 2020, at one research clinic in Madison, Wisconsin, and one clinic in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Out of the 5836 adults approached to participate in the study, 1251 participants who smoked 5 cigarettes per day or more were randomized.

- **Interventions**: All participants received cessation counseling and were randomized to one of four medication groups: varenicline monotherapy for 12 weeks (n = 315), varenicline plus nicotine patch for 12 weeks (n = 314), varenicline monotherapy for 24 weeks (n = 311), or varenicline plus nicotine patch for 24 weeks (n = 311).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was carbon monoxide-confirmed self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 52 weeks.

- **Results**: Among the 1251 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 49.1 [11.9] years; 675 [54.0%] women), 751 (60.0%) completed treatment and 881 (70.4%) provided final follow-up. For the primary outcome, no significant interaction was found between the two treatment factors of medication type and medication duration (odds ratio [OR], 1.03 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.17]; p = 0.66).

### Stopping smokeless tobacco with varenicline: Randomised double blind placebo controlled trial [^113LN24G]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

To assess the efficacy and safety of varenicline, a licensed cigarette smoking cessation aid, in helping users of smokeless tobacco to quit, a double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial was conducted. The setting comprised medical clinics, mostly primary care, in Norway and Sweden.

Participants included men and women aged 18 and over who used smokeless tobacco at least eight times a day, had no abstinence period over three months within one year before screening, and wanted to quit all tobacco use. Exclusions were made for those using any other form of tobacco or medication to stop smoking within three months of screening, or with any pre-existing medical or psychiatric condition.

The intervention included administering varenicline 1 mg twice daily, titrated during the first week, or placebo for 12 weeks, with a follow-up of 14 weeks after treatment.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary endpoint was the four-week continuous abstinence rate at the end of treatment (weeks 9–12), confirmed with cotinine concentration. A secondary endpoint was continuous abstinence rate for weeks 9–26. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.

Results showed that 431 participants (213 using varenicline and 218 using placebo) were randomised and received at least one dose of the study drug. Demographics and baseline use of smokeless tobacco were similar between groups; 89% and 90% were men, the mean age in both groups was 43.9, participants used smokeless tobacco products about 15 times a day, and about 80% first used smokeless tobacco within 30 minutes after awakening.

### Varenicline and counseling for vaping cessation: A double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial [^117FivtJ]. BMC Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Vaping cessation is virtually unexplored, and there is a clear need for treatment protocols and guidelines to advance best practices and outcomes for people who use electronic cigarettes (ECs) and want to quit. The efficacy and safety of medications approved for smoking cessation by the U.S. FDA for aiding vaping cessation have never been investigated. The findings of the present RCT indicate that the inclusion of varenicline in a vaping cessation program for adults who use ECs and intend to quit may result in prolonged abstinence without serious adverse events. This evidence supports the use of varenicline in cessation programs to help EC users stop vaping and may inform future recommendations by health authorities and healthcare providers. Studies with longer follow-ups should be conducted to evaluate long-term efficacy.

### Is a combination of varenicline and nicotine patch more effective in helping smokers quit than varenicline alone? A randomised controlled trial [^114WMz3j]. BMC Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and varenicline are both effective in helping smokers quit. There is growing interest in combining the two treatments to improve treatment outcomes, but no experimental data exist on whether this is efficacious. This double-blind randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate whether adding nicotine patches to varenicline improves withdrawal relief and short-term abstinence rates.

- **Methods**: 117 participants seeking help to stop smoking were randomly allocated to varenicline plus placebo patch or varenicline plus nicotine patch (15 mg/16 hour). Varenicline use commenced one week prior to the target quit date (TQD), and patch use started on the TQD. Ratings of urges to smoke and cigarette withdrawal symptoms were collected weekly over four weeks post-TQD. Medication use and smoking status were established at 1, 4, and 12 weeks. Participants lost to follow-up were included as continuing smokers.

- **Results**: 92% of participants used both medications during the first week after the TQD. The combination treatment generated no increase in nausea or other adverse effects. It had no overall effect on urges to smoke or on other withdrawal symptoms. The combination treatment did not improve biochemically validated abstinence rates at 1 week and 4 weeks post-TQD (69% vs. 59%, p = 0.28 and 60% vs. 59%, p = 0.91, in the nicotine patch and placebo patch arm, respectively), or self-reported abstinence rates at 12 weeks (36% vs. 29%, p = 0.39, NS).

- **Conclusions**: The efficacy of varenicline was not enhanced by the addition of nicotine patches, although further research may be necessary.

### Immediate versus delayed quitting and rates of relapse among smokers treated successfully with varenicline, bupropion SR or placebo [^112KH6Rk]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

We assessed to what degree smokers who fail to quit on the target quit date (TQD) or lapse following TQD eventually achieve success with continued treatment.

- **Design**: A secondary analysis of pooled data of successful quitters treated with varenicline (306 of 696), bupropion (199 of 671), and placebo (121 of 685) from two identically-designed clinical trials of varenicline versus bupropion sustained-release and placebo.

- **Setting**: Multiple research centers in the US.

- **Participants**: Adult smokers (n = 2052) randomized to 12 weeks of drug treatment plus 40 weeks follow-up.

- **Measurement**: The primary end-point for the trials was continuous abstinence for weeks 9–12. TQD was day 8. Two patterns of successful quitting were identified. Immediate quitters (IQs) were continuously abstinent for weeks 2–12. Delayed quitters (DQs) smoked during one or more weeks for weeks 2–8.

- **Findings**: Cumulative continuous abstinence (IQs + DQs) increased for all treatments during weeks 3–8. Overall, IQs and DQs for varenicline were (24%; 20%) versus bupropion (18.0%, P = 0.007; 11.6%, P < 0.001) or placebo (10.2%, P < 0.001; 7.5%, P < 0.001). However, DQs as a proportion of successful quitters was similar for all treatments (varenicline 45%; bupropion 39%; placebo 42%) and accounted for approximately one-third of those remaining continuously abstinent for weeks 9–52. No gender differences were observed by quit pattern. Post-treatment relapse was similar across groups.

Our data support continuing cessation treatments without interruption for smokers motivated to remain in the quitting process.

### The Food and Drug Administration and varenicline: Should risk communication be improved [^116QLYEz]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

From the first warnings about potential neuropsychiatric adverse effects of varenicline in November 2007 to the present, 4.1 million people are likely to have died from smoking‐related disease in the United States alone. The EMA has already updated its guidance on varenicline and removed its Black Triangle warnings on varenicline's product labeling. It is time for the FDA to do the same.

### Immediate versus delayed quitting and rates of relapse among smokers treated successfully with varenicline, bupropion SR or placebo [^114ueYFz]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

Cigarette smoking remains a critical public health problem, resulting in unnecessary illness and deaths worldwide. While effective smoking cessation treatments, including counseling, social support, and pharmacotherapies are widely available, quitting success rates can vary significantly. Even among those who receive evidence-based treatments, adherence to recommendations is often poor, with negative implications for treatment outcomes. This suggests the importance of longer-term adherence support for patients attempting to quit smoking actively.

Adverse events, fear of becoming dependent upon medication, and cost have all been associated with the premature discontinuation of pharmacological treatments. An area receiving more recent attention concerns the role played by different definitions of quitting success or abstinence in treatment outcomes. Definitions of treatment failure linked to the target quit day (TQD) may contribute to the interruption of an active quitting process when smokers believe they have already failed due to the inability to achieve initial abstinence or maintain continuous abstinence after the planned TQD. Additionally, drug labeling that cautions patients about the risks of smoking while using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and some health insurance guidelines, such as those of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, which assess quit success at 4 weeks after the TQD, may have the unintended effect of prematurely shortening the duration of treatment for those not abstinent at 4 weeks.

### Extending varenicline preloading to 6 weeks facilitates smoking cessation: A single-site, randomised controlled trial [^114x74d9]. EClinicalMedicine (2020).

Tobacco smoking remains a major cause of health problems in economically developed countries and has a substantial effect on morbidity and mortality. Smoking cessation medications are invaluable tools that help smokers quit smoking. Varenicline is the best single pharmacotherapy for supporting smoking cessation. In clinical practice, people aiming to quit smoking with the aid of varenicline begin taking the medication one week before the target quit day (TQD) to reduce the adverse events that might occur with a rapid escalation of the dose.

In a "proof-of-concept" study, Hajek and colleagues found that in patients receiving the standard varenicline treatment, increasing the pre-quit period to four weeks was associated with reduced ad libitum smoking and increased 12-week abstinence rates. This finding supported their hypothesis that, since varenicline lowers the subjective reward connected to smoking, its use over an extended period helped to weaken the association of smoking with reward, enhancing cessation. Subsequently, using a similar research design, Hawk and colleagues observed greater pre-quit reductions in smoking rates in smokers receiving varenicline for a pre-quit period of four weeks; however, post-treatment abstinence was enhanced only among women.

Although these studies provide useful initial information about extended varenicline preloading, their sample sizes were not powerful enough to estimate the effect of preloading for medium-to-long term follow-up periods. Additionally, as noticed by Hajek and colleagues, at week four the effects of varenicline on smoking cessation were evident, but further exploration was needed to confirm these findings over longer periods.

### Immediate versus delayed quitting and rates of relapse among smokers treated successfully with varenicline, bupropion SR or placebo [^113jUYc1]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

No uniform standard has been established for when 'smoking abstinence' should be assessed. The definitions of abstinence can vary considerably, including 24 hours, 4 weeks following a TQD, and the last 4 weeks of treatment, as well as other intervals.

The definition of abstinence employed can result in decisions to change, interrupt, or discontinue treatments, as has been suggested for those who fail to quit on or shortly following a TQD. In an effort to guide more uniformity and flexibility when treating smokers, the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) recommended including a 2-week 'grace period' following the TQD when assessing successful abstinence. However, successful quitting in clinical practice and much of the literature remains focused upon abstinence end-points, while much remains unknown about quitting and smoking behaviors. Quitting patterns and processes during a quit attempt are an under-investigated but emerging area of research.

Previous research has not established the degree to which motivated smokers who fail to achieve immediate abstinence on the recommended TQD or who experience early lapses would eventually achieve continuous abstinence if treatment were not interrupted or discontinued. Secondary analyses of data from drug efficacy trials can expand our knowledge of quitting processes beyond the TQD. Although these trials are focused on abstinence end-points, often the last 4 weeks of treatment, abstinence data are collected beginning with the TQD. All participants, regardless of abstinence status, are encouraged to take the study drug.

### Effect of 0.5 mg versus 1 mg varenicline for smoking cessation: A randomized controlled trial [^113oAniP]. Addiction (2017). High credibility.

Varenicline is used in smoking cessation. The aims of the trial were to test for differences between standard 1 mg and 0.5 mg doses (both twice daily during 8 weeks) in abstinence, adherence, and side effects.

- **Design**: Open-label randomized parallel-group controlled trial with 1-year follow-up. All participants randomized were included in the final sample using an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach.

- **Setting**: This study was conducted at the Stop-Smoking Clinic of the Virgen Macarena University Hospital in Seville, Spain.

- **Participants**: The study comprised 484 smokers, 59.5% of whom were men, with a mean age of 50.67 years and a smoking history of 37.5 pack-years.

- **Intervention and comparator**: Participants were randomized to receive either 1 mg (n = 245) or 0.5 mg (n = 239) along with behavioral support, which consisted of a baseline visit and six follow-ups during the year.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcome was continuous self-reported abstinence during 1 year, with biochemical verification. Secondary outcomes included adherence and side effects, as well as baseline demographics, medical history, and smoking characteristics.

- **Findings**: Abstinence rates at 1 year were 46.5% with 1 mg versus 46.4% with 0.5 mg [odds ratio (OR) = 0.997; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.7–1.43; P = 1.0]; Bayes factor in favor of H0 = 238.507 and against H0 = 0.004. Treatment adherence was similar in both regimens (OR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.8–1.7; P = 0.44). Side effects were reported in 19.3% of cases with 1 mg versus 12.1% with 0.5 mg, although there were no significant differences between regimens (OR = 1.73; 95% CI = 0.8–1.7; P = 0.44).

### Risk of cardiovascular serious adverse events associated with varenicline use for tobacco cessation: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116FxsoA]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

Two reviewers independently conducted article data extraction and quality assessment for each study meeting the inclusion criteria. Data extraction included descriptive characteristics of the study samples; varenicline dose; duration of drug treatment; study duration; sample attrition; and the number of participants with treatment-emergent cardiovascular serious adverse events in the inactive and active drug conditions. For comparability, we used the same primary outcome as Singh and colleagues, defining cardiovascular serious adverse events as any ischemic or arrhythmic adverse cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, transient ischemic attacks, stroke, sudden death or cardiovascular-related death, or congestive heart failure).

We obtained details on the timing of the cardiovascular serious adverse events from the study publications, the online clinical trials registries, the Chantix product label, and for three trials, for which the information was not publicly available, we contacted the medical adviser for varenicline at Pfizer or the study lead author directly. For one additional study, we contacted the lead author to confirm that no serious adverse events had occurred in the trial because only adverse events were reported. Discrepant findings between reviewers were settled by discussion, further review of the article, and, if necessary, consultation with a third reviewer.

We assessed study quality using a three-item method developed by Jadad and colleagues that evaluates…

### Quantitative assessment of exposure-response relationships for the efficacy and tolerability of varenicline for smoking cessation [^112YdH8P]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Population exposure-response analyses involving approximately 2,000 cigarette smokers provided an integrated understanding of dose, exposure, patient characteristics, and response relating to the efficacy and tolerability of varenicline for smoking cessation. Full models with a linear function of area under the concentration-time curve at steady state AUC(0–24)(ss) and covariate effects on the baseline probability of response were constructed. Logistic regression results consistently showed that the end-of-treatment abstinence rate increased with increasing varenicline exposure, from 38% at 0.5 mg b.i.d. to 56% at 1 mg b.i.d. (vs. 22% for placebo). Baseline smoking status and age were predictive of smoking cessation, whereas race and gender showed little or no influence.

Nausea was the most common adverse event, with an incidence that was gender-related and that increased with varenicline exposure. At a dosage of 1 mg b.i.d., the predicted probability of nausea relative to placebo was 24% vs. 7% in male subjects and 40% vs. 14% in female subjects. The incidence of nausea also showed a decreasing trend with time.

### Fifty-two-week continuous abstinence rates of smokers being treated with varenicline versus nicotine replacement therapy [^115tjjNz]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

Cross-study comparisons of effect sizes suggest that varenicline is more effective than nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in aiding smoking cessation, but evidence from direct comparisons is limited. This study compared biochemically verified 52-week sustained abstinence rates in smokers attending the same clinical service according to whether they used varenicline or NRT in their quit attempt.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective cohort study of 855 smokers attending a large smoking cessation clinic who used their choice of NRT product or varenicline in their quit attempt. All received the same behavioural support programme and chose their medication option (n = 519 varenicline; n = 336 NRT). The primary outcome measure was self-report of 52 weeks' abstinence following the target quit date confirmed by expired air carbon monoxide concentration. Baseline measures included socio-demographic variables, mental health diagnoses, measures of smoking, cigarette dependence, and past use of NRT or varenicline.

- **Results**: The 52-week abstinence rates were 42.8% versus 31.0% in those using varenicline versus NRT, respectively (P < 0.001). After adjusting for all baseline variables, the odds of remaining abstinent for 52 weeks were 2.03 (95% CI 1.46–2.82), P < 0.001 times higher in those using varenicline than those using NRT.

- **Conclusions**: Smokers in the same behavioural support programme who use varenicline appear to have a greater probability of achieving long-term abstinence than those using their choice of nicotine replacement therapy options, even after adjusting for potential confounding factors.

### Immediate versus delayed quitting and rates of relapse among smokers treated successfully with varenicline, bupropion SR or placebo [^116jyj5J]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

We assessed to what degree smokers who fail to quit on the target quit date (TQD) or lapse following TQD eventually achieve success with continued treatment.

- **Design**: A secondary analysis of pooled data of successful quitters treated with varenicline (306 of 696), bupropion (199 of 671), and placebo (121 of 685) from two identically designed clinical trials of varenicline versus bupropion sustained-release and placebo.

- **Setting**: Multiple research centers in the US.

- **Participants**: Adult smokers (n = 2052) randomized to 12 weeks of drug treatment plus 40 weeks of follow-up.

- **Measurement**: The primary endpoint for the trials was continuous abstinence for weeks 9–12. TQD was day 8. Two patterns of successful quitting were identified. Immediate quitters (IQs) were continuously abstinent for weeks 2–12. Delayed quitters (DQs) smoked during 1 or more weeks for weeks 2–8.

- **Findings**: Cumulative continuous abstinence (IQs + DQs) increased for all treatments during weeks 3–8. Overall IQs and DQs for varenicline were (24%; 20%) versus bupropion (18.0%, P = 0.007; 11.6%, P < 0.001) or placebo (10.2%, P < 0.001; 7.5%, P < 0.001). However, DQs as a proportion of successful quitters was similar for all treatments (varenicline 45%; bupropion 39%; placebo 42%) and accounted for approximately one-third of those remaining continuously abstinent for weeks 9–52. No gender differences were observed by quit pattern. Post-treatment relapse was similar across groups.

Our data support continuing cessation treatments without interruption for smokers motivated to remain in the quitting process.

### Retreatment with varenicline for smoking cessation in smokers who have previously taken varenicline: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^11463kEe]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). High credibility.

Eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive either varenicline or a placebo in a 1:1 ratio for a 12-week drug treatment period, using computer-generated block randomization within each site. The dosing schedule was titrated as follows:

- 0.5 mg/day for days 1–3
- 0.5 mg twice daily for days 4–7
- 1 mg twice daily through the end of week 12
- Dosing could be reduced to 0.5 mg twice daily for participants unable to tolerate the recommended dose

Compliance with dosing was monitored by pill counts and participant self-reports during each visit in the drug treatment period. Participants underwent a 40-week nondrug follow-up phase after completing the initial treatment.

- **Clinic visits**:
	- **During drug treatment**: Screening, baseline, weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
	- **During follow-up phase**: Weeks 13, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 52

- **Telephone visits**: Weeks 5, 7, 14, 20, 28, 36, 44

- **Counseling sessions**: Individual counseling sessions (up to 10 minutes each), based on the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline, were provided to all participants at both clinic and telephone visits, starting with the baseline visit. These sessions aimed to assist participants in developing coping strategies for achieving and maintaining abstinence.

Participants were instructed to set a target quit date to align with the week 1 visit.

Participants who discontinued the study drug were encouraged to remain part of the study and complete the remaining visits.

### Cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric risks of varenicline: a retrospective cohort study [^112SaQN6]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Cigarette smoking continues to be one of the leading causes of preventable death, killing nearly 6 million people worldwide each year. Smokers who do not stop lose, on average, a decade of life expectancy. Effective pharmacotherapies to help smokers quit include bupropion, nicotine replacement treatment (NRT), and varenicline. Varenicline, a selective α4β2 nicotine acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency as a drug for smoking cessation in 2006, and it has subsequently been recommended by US and international clinical guidelines. Varenicline is more effective than bupropion and single forms of NRT, and it has become the most frequently prescribed smoking cessation drug other than NRT. It is also effective and safe in increasing long-term smoking cessation rates via smoking reduction in cigarette smokers not willing or able to quit at treatment initiation.

### Is a combination of varenicline and nicotine patch more effective in helping smokers quit than varenicline alone? A randomised controlled trial [^1156ryhU]. BMC Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and varenicline are both effective in helping smokers stop smoking; however, their efficacy is limited. The majority of smokers receiving intensive support and either of these two medications are likely to fail in their attempt to quit. It has been suggested that combining these two medications may increase treatment efficacy.

In terms of observable effects on smokers, the two medications appear similar. Varenicline has antagonist as well as agonist effects. Both medications seem to aid abstinence by alleviating the discomfort of nicotine withdrawal. They also make cigarettes smoked while on the medications less rewarding, potentially facilitating extinction. This effect has been demonstrated for both varenicline and NRT, although the evidence for NRT seems weak.

Regarding neurophysiological targets, varenicline primarily affects alpha4 beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), where it has a higher affinity than nicotine, essentially blocking nicotine effects and acting as a partial agonist. Nicotine from NRT acts on nAChRs in a manner similar to nicotine from tobacco smoke, but delivery from NRT is much slower.

It remains unclear if the central effects of the two medications are sufficiently different to allow synergy. However, if they do differ, combining them could have several beneficial effects. In theory, it could improve withdrawal relief and/or assist smokers who may not react to one of them but may be sensitive to the other.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114vbDaH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, no other clinical practice guideline has compared varenicline with electronic cigarettes. The American College of Cardiology recently produced a tobacco-cessation clinical pathway, recommending pharmacotherapy and advocating discussion with patients who choose to use electronic cigarettes. Several professional societies, including the U.S. CDC, the European Respiratory Society, the Federation of International Respiratory Societies, the Ibero-Latino-American Respiratory Scientific Societies, the American Association for Cancer Research, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, have developed warnings or adopted policy positions regarding the electronic cigarette's role in tobacco-dependence treatment. Each of these organizations recommends that clinicians rely on medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or other regulatory agencies instead of relying on alternative modalities that lack an established evidentiary base. A 2018 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine evidence review of the public health impact of electronic cigarettes commented specifically on the quality of the evidence comparing electronic cigarettes with pharmacotherapy, noting insufficient evidence to warrant electronic cigarettes as cessation pharmacotherapy. A widely cited policy statement produced by the Royal College of Physicians in 2016 did promote the widespread availability of electronic cigarettes in the United Kingdom as a public health substitute for smoking, but it avoided positioning electronic cigarettes as a means of treating tobacco dependence.

### Varenicline versus transdermal nicotine patch for smoking cessation: Results from a randomised open-label trial [^112oaSEr]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

Varenicline, a new treatment for smoking cessation, has demonstrated significantly greater efficacy over placebo and sustained release bupropion (bupropion SR). A study was undertaken to compare a 12-week standard regimen of varenicline with a 10-week standard regimen of transdermal nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation.

- **Methods**: In this 52-week, open-label, randomised, multicentre, phase 3 trial conducted in Belgium, France, The Netherlands, the UK, and the United States, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive varenicline uptitrated to 1 mg twice daily for 12 weeks or transdermal NRT (21 mg/day reducing to 7 mg/day) for 10 weeks. Non-treatment follow-up continued to week 52. The primary outcome was the biochemically confirmed (exhaled carbon monoxide ≤ 10 ppm) self-reported continuous abstinence rate (CAR) for the last 4 weeks of the treatment period in participants who had taken at least one dose of treatment. Secondary outcomes included CAR from the last 4 weeks of treatment through weeks 24 and 52, and measures of craving, withdrawal, and smoking satisfaction.

- **Results**: A total of 376 and 370 participants assigned to varenicline and NRT, respectively, were eligible for analysis. The CAR for the last 4 weeks of treatment was significantly greater for varenicline (55.9%) than NRT (43.2%). The odds ratio was 1.70 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.26 to 2.28 (p < 0.001). The week 52 CAR (NRT, weeks 8–52; varenicline, weeks 9–52) was 26.1% for varenicline and 20.3% for NRT (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.99, p = 0.056). Varenicline significantly reduced craving and withdrawal symptoms (p < 0.001).

Tobacco dependence continues to kill an estimated 5 million tobacco users each year worldwide. Most smokers would like to quit, and many make several quit attempts each year. However, few are able to achieve permanent or long-term abstinence (≥ 6 months) from smoking with a single quit attempt. This chronic cycling of periods of tobacco use followed by periods of abstinence and periods of relapse in highly dependent smokers has led to tobacco dependence being defined as a chronic disease. Treatment guidelines encourage clinicians to prescribe or recommend medications plus counseling for each quit attempt. Repeated medication-assisted quit attempts can result in progressively greater abstinence over time. Even if increasing the frequency of quit attempts per year does not result in long periods of abstinence, these attempts may still be clinically important by reducing exposure to toxicants in tobacco smoke and improving lung function.
