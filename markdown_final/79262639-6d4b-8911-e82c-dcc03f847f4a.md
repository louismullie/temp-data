## Question

Can linezolid treat pseudomonas

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether linezolid can treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about linezolid's intrinsic antimicrobial spectrum and mechanism. Then, I should verify what the FDA label says about activity against gram-negative organisms, especially Pseudomonas. Next, I will review authoritative guidelines for pneumonia and other syndromes where Pseudomonas coverage is needed. After that, I should check for any conflicting in vitro or clinical data suggesting activity. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and clarify any exceptions or combinations where linezolid might be used alongside antipseudomonal therapy.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and spectrum. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis at the 23S rRNA initiation complex; it is primarily active against gram-positive pathogens such as MRSA, VRE, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, with essentially no meaningful activity against gram-negative rods, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, due to permeability barriers and efflux mechanisms [^35048e33] [^d7f07198].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position before drawing conclusions. The FDA labeling explicitly states that linezolid is not indicated for gram-negative infections and instructs clinicians to initiate specific gram-negative therapy immediately if a gram-negative pathogen is documented or suspected, which directly addresses Pseudomonas coverage needs in mixed infections [^412dbac0].

> Next, I should review guideline recommendations where Pseudomonas coverage is required. For hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia, IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend empiric coverage for Pseudomonas with agents such as piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, meropenem, or imipenem, and they advise adding vancomycin or linezolid only when MRSA risk is present; linezolid is never used as antipseudomonal therapy in these regimens, reinforcing that it lacks Pseudomonas activity [^9ea6bab3] [^ee997461] [^e589bb5c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check for any conflicting data. Some reviews mention borderline in vitro activity against Haemophilus, but that is not Pseudomonas, and even then, clinical utility is limited; importantly, there are no robust clinical trials demonstrating efficacy of linezolid monotherapy against Pseudomonas, and no guideline endorses its use for this pathogen [^d7f07198] [^9ea6bab3].

> I will now examine real-world combinations to ensure I'm not missing a niche. In HAP/VAP trials and practice, linezolid is paired with antipseudomonal agents like ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam when both MRSA and Pseudomonas coverage are indicated; this is combination therapy for mixed pathogens, not evidence of linezolid activity against Pseudomonas itself [^a63be731] [^9ea6bab3].

> But wait, what if someone cites a bone cement study suggesting activity? Let me reconsider. In vitro bone cement models show variable effects of antibiotic-loaded cement on biofilms, and while one study reported no Pseudomonas biofilm on tobramycin or gentamicin discs, this does not translate into clinical efficacy of linezolid against Pseudomonas; these are experimental systems and should not override pharmacologic and clinical evidence [^9e4daf7d].

> Synthesis and recommendation: Linezolid has no reliable activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and should not be used to treat Pseudomonas infections. If Pseudomonas is suspected or confirmed, use guideline-directed antipseudomonal therapy, and add linezolid only when there is a concurrent indication for MRSA or VRE coverage, promptly de-escalating based on cultures to avoid unnecessary toxicity and resistance selection [^412dbac0] [^9ea6bab3] [^ee997461].

---

Linezolid is **not effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa** because it lacks activity against gram-negative rods, including Pseudomonas [^d7f07198] [^35048e33]. It should **never be used as monotherapy** for Pseudomonas infections. If Pseudomonas is suspected or confirmed, use antipseudomonal agents such as piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, meropenem, or ciprofloxacin [^9ea6bab3] [^ee997461]. Linezolid may be added only when MRSA coverage is also indicated, but it does not replace antipseudomonal therapy [^9ea6bab3].

---

## Mechanism of action and spectrum of activity

Linezolid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing formation of the 70S initiation complex [^c2f8d0d6]. This mechanism is unique and not shared by other antibiotic classes, which explains its activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive organisms [^c2f8d0d6]. However, linezolid's spectrum is **limited to gram-positive bacteria**, including:

- Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
- Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)
- Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae

Linezolid has **no clinically meaningful activity against gram-negative bacteria**, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, due to outer membrane permeability barriers and efflux pump mechanisms [^d7f07198].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding Pseudomonas aeruginosa

Extensive clinical and microbiological data consistently show that linezolid has **no reliable activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa** [^d7f07198]. The FDA explicitly states that linezolid is not indicated for gram-negative infections, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and that specific gram-negative therapy must be initiated if such pathogens are suspected or confirmed [^412dbac0].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) **do not recommend linezolid for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections** [^9ea6bab3]. Instead, they recommend antipseudomonal agents such as:

- Piperacillin-tazobactam
- Cefepime
- Ceftazidime
- Meropenem or imipenem
- Ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin

Linezolid may be considered only when there is a concurrent need for MRSA coverage, but it should never be used as monotherapy for Pseudomonas infections [^9ea6bab3].

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks of inappropriate use

Using linezolid inappropriately for Pseudomonas infections can lead to **treatment failure**, progression of infection, and increased mortality. It also contributes to antibiotic resistance and unnecessary exposure to linezolid's adverse effects, including myelosuppression and serotonin syndrome [^b2faccb7] [^c3e07ab8].

## Summary of evidence

| **Evidence type** | **Findings regarding linezolid and pseudomonas** |
|-|-|
| FDA labeling | - Not indicated for gram-negative infections <br/> - Including Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^412dbac0] |
| Clinical guidelines | - Do not recommend linezolid for Pseudomonas infections <br/> - Recommend antipseudomonal agents instead [^9ea6bab3] [^ee997461] |
| Clinical studies | - No evidence of efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^d7f07198] |
| Mechanism of action | - Limited to gram-positive bacteria <br/> - No activity against gram-negative rods [^35048e33] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Linezolid is **not effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa** and should not be used to treat infections caused by this organism [^d7f07198]. Clinicians should use guideline-recommended antipseudomonal agents and reserve linezolid for confirmed or strongly suspected gram-positive infections, particularly MRSA or VRE, when indicated [^9ea6bab3].

### New oxazolidinones [^9344a61c]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

Due to the emergence of resistance to known antibiotics to various organisms, for example, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococci, and Pseudomonas there is a renewed interest in the discovery of new antibacterials. Oxazolidinones, totally synthetic class of novel antibacterials, possess activity against drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, especially MRSA. Linezolid, the first approved drug from this class, has shown a great promise in saving lives of many patients by acting against drug-resistant Gram-positive organisms. However, its use is somewhat limited because of its myelotoxicity when used long term (> 21 days). Various research groups are active in this area either to improve myelotoxicity profile of linezolid or to expand the spectrum of activity of linezolid. In spite of active research in this area, the discovery of an oxazolidinone possessing improved myelotoxicity compared to linezolid, linezolid-like efficacy, and PK remains challenging.

### Recent developments in antibiotic treatment [^b9dfa085]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria remains a major challenge for clinicians treating HAP. Since the recent release of linezolid and QD, treatment options for resistant gram-positive bacteria have improved. The development of new substances continues and it is hoped that some of them will be available soon. Investigation has centered on gram-positive bacteria, although multiresistant gram-negative pathogens, such as A haumanii, S maltophilia, and resistant P aeruginosa, are of major clinical relevance. New treatment options are unfortunately not in sight. No antibiotic, however, is a miraculous magic wand against resistant bacteria. The bugs are smart; they have been on this world far longer than humans. Regardless of how innovative the mechanism of action of new substances is, resistance will emerge. The solution is certainly not a nihilistic approach leading to a fearful restriction in the use of new substances. No antibiotic, regardless of its potency, can free the clinician from keeping the difficult balance between individual undertreatment and general overtreatment.

MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage and HCAP category — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the inpatient setting: we recommend abandoning use of the prior categorization of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) to guide selection of extended antibiotic coverage in adults with CAP (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and we recommend clinicians only cover empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa in adults with CAP if locally validated risk factors for either pathogen are present (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence); empiric treatment options for MRSA include vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 h, adjust based on levels) or linezolid (600 mg every 12 h), and for P. aeruginosa include piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 h), cefepime (2 g every 8 h), ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h), aztreonam (2 g every 8 h), meropenem (1 g every 8 h), or imipenem (500 mg every 6 h); if clinicians are currently covering empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa on the basis of published risk factors but do not have local etiologic data, we recommend continuing empiric coverage while obtaining culture data to justify continued treatment after the first few days of empiric treatment (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### A phase 3 randomized double-blind comparison of ceftobiprole medocaril versus ceftazidime plus linezolid for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia [^64b46b69]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Ceftobiprole, the active moiety of ceftobiprole medocaril, is a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin, with bactericidal activity against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) and penicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococci, and gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Methods

This was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study of 781 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including 210 with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Treatment was intravenous ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours, or ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours plus linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours; primary outcome was clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit.

Results

Overall cure rates for ceftobiprole vs ceftazidime/linezolid were 49.9% vs 52.8% (intent-to-treat [ITT], 95% confidence interval [CI] for the difference, -10.0 to 4.1) and 69.3% vs 71.3% (clinically evaluable [CE], 95% CI, -10.0 to 6.1). Cure rates in HAP (excluding VAP) patients were 59.6% vs 58.8% (ITT, 95% CI, -7.3 to 8.8), and 77.8% vs 76.2% (CE, 95% CI, -6.9 to 10.0). Cure rates in VAP patients were 23.1% vs 36.8% (ITT, 95% CI, -26.0 to -1.5) and 37.7% vs 55.9% (CE, 95% CI, -36.4 to 0). Microbiological eradication rates in HAP (excluding VAP) patients were, respectively, 62.9% vs 67.5% (microbiologically evaluable [ME], 95% CI, -16.7 to 7.6), and in VAP patients 30.4% vs 50.0% (ME, 95% CI, -38.8 to -0.4). Treatment-related adverse events were comparable for ceftobiprole (24.9%) and ceftazidime/linezolid (25.4%).

Conclusions

Ceftobiprole is a safe and effective bactericidal antibiotic for the empiric treatment of HAP (excluding VAP). Further investigations are needed before recommending the use of ceftobiprole in VAP patients. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT00210964, NCT00229008.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^5e44981f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — evidence certainty was rated as very low by the guideline panel for multiple bodies of evidence, including the estimated prevalence of various pathogens, the estimated effects of inadequate antibiotic therapy on non-mechanically ventilated patients with HAP due to P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli, and the estimated effects of various empiric regimens, as well as for the estimated adverse effects of aminoglycosides, the study evaluating inadequate therapy in HAP due to S. aureus, and estimates from comparisons of vancomycin to linezolid.

### Linezolid: its role in the treatment of Gram-Positive, drug… [^388bd308]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The FDA has approved linezolid for certain gram-positive infections in adult patients. 15 Other pathogens that linezolid has demonstrated in-vitro activity against include penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, vancomycin-sensitive E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, Corynebacterium sp, Moraxella catarrhalis, legionella species Listeria monocytogenes, Pasteurella multocida, and Bacteroides fragilis. 10, 16. In all the therapeutic trials thus far, the 600-mg dosage was consistently more effective in the treatment of patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus infections than was the 200-mg dosage. Intravenous linezolid at twice daily dosages of 600 mg produced a clinical cure rate of 88. 6 percent compared with
73. 7 percent in the patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus infections who received 200 mg daily.

21 Of note, biologic eradication was achieved in all evaluated patients infected with S. pneumoniae. Linezolid demonstrated similar efficacy to ceftriaxone and/or cefpodoxime proxetil, with a clinical cure rate of approximately 90 percent for community-acquired pneumonia. 16 Interestingly, linezolid was clinically and microbiologically superior to ceftriaxone in treating patients with concurrent bacteremia.
16. Linezolid therapy has been found to cure or improve more than 90 percent of patients treated for skin and soft tissue infections. 16 The 400-mg and 600-mg dosages twice daily produced clinical success rates exceeding 89 percent in patients with complicated and uncomplicated skin/soft tissue infections. 16 Linezolid also exhibited similar efficacy to oxacillin /dicloxacillin and vancomycin.
16.

Thus far, it has demonstrated activity against all clinically significant, gram-positive bacteria. With its role in multidrug-resistant bacteria, linezolid will play a crucial role in both the community and the nosocomial setting. Physicians should prescribe this agent judiciously so as to minimize antimicrobial resistance.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults and adolescents with HIV — empiric therapy: For patients at risk of Pseudomonas pneumonia, an intravenous (IV) antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal beta-lactam plus ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 8–12 hours or levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily (AI) is listed under preferred therapy; preferred beta-lactams are piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, or meropenem. For patients at risk for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, add vancomycin IV or linezolid (IV or by mouth [PO]) to the baseline regimen (AII), and addition of clindamycin to vancomycin (but not to linezolid) can be considered for severe necrotizing pneumonia to minimize bacterial toxin production (CII).

### Antimicrobial agents-optimising the ecological balance [^1a3c3b25]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

What's new in the pipeline?

Since the approval of telavancin in 2009 and ceftaroline in 2010, five new antibiotics have been approved by the FDA, three of which have mainly gram-positive activity and two directed against gram-negative pathogens. Oritavancin and dalbavancin are long-acting, synthetic lipoglycopeptides with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and are approved for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. Tedizolid, an oxazolidinone-class antibiotic similar to linezolid, is licensed for treatment of these infections, with treatment for other indications underway, including hospital-acquired pneumonia. While these new drugs have the advantage of being utilised in the outpatient setting, thus avoiding prolonged intravenous use and length of hospital stay, they are still costly and questions remain as to their utility in the treatment of more serious clinical infections such as bacteraemia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis and device-related infections. Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam are approved for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections; nevertheless, the latter is only approved for use in patients with limited or no treatment options as it was the first drug to go through the recommended regulatory pathway and deemed to be an "unmet medical need drug". Both antibiotics have activity against extended spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC producers and multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but only ceftazidime/avibactam has activity against Class A carbapenemases.

### Costs-effectiveness and cost components of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions affecting antibiotic resistance outcomes in hospital patients: a systematic literature review [^385ffa8a]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

We identified 59 studies investigating the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions reducing ABR among WHO's global priority pathogen list in hospital settings. We flag the reduced data among critical pathogens, such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the scarcity of standardised cost-effectiveness methods, ingredient costs and limited data from low-income and middle-income countries indicated the need for more consistent approaches in the future.

More studies found that, compared with vancomycin, linezolid was more effective and less costly for the treatment of MRSA infections. Despite pharmaceutical costs being a highly predictable line item in hospital budgets (eg, diagnostic tests, treatment), LOS often constitutes a higher proportion of the cost for hospital stay and should be considered in cost-effectiveness analyses and decisions related to formulary and drug reimbursement. For example, Kauf et al reported that drug costs drove 6.4% of the total inpatient cost compared with LOS accounting for 85.9% of total inpatient cost for patients with cSSSI. Treatment resulting in expedited infection resolution will likely be more cost-effective even when drug costs are much higher. This is also seen with linezolid compared with vancomycin. Vancomycin can be taken orally (as opposed to intravenously) meaning that patients can be discharged earlier, potentially offsetting higher drug acquisition costs. De Cock et al noted that in a scenario analysis between linezolid and vancomycin, when the most conservative treatment durations were applied rather than those estimated by the physician panel, linezolid was dominant over vancomycin based on the shorter LOS.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^9ea6bab3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Empiric antibiotic coverage for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) — In patients with suspected VAP, we recommend including coverage for S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacilli in all empiric regimens (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest including an agent active against MRSA only when there is a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance, when units have > 10%–20% of S. aureus isolates methicillin resistant, or when MRSA prevalence is not known (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). We suggest including an agent active against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and not MRSA when patients lack risk factors for antimicrobial resistance and are treated in ICUs where < 10%–20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). If empiric coverage for MRSA is indicated, we recommend either vancomycin or linezolid (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). When empiric treatment should include MSSA coverage, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), noting that oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin are preferred for proven MSSA but are not necessary for empiric VAP if one of the above agents is used.

### Continuous infusion of linezolid for critically ill patients: toward a new standard of care [^a0c3dbe1]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rethinking the role of MIC in dosing decisions

MIC variability complicates dose optimization, as values fluctuate with pathogen traits, resistance, and testing methods. Though an MIC of 2 mg/L is often used empirically, it does not always reflect in vivo drug activity or patient-specific factors, limiting its reliability.

A broader approach integrating infection severity, drug exposure, and PK/PD profiles is essential.

### Linezolid for gram-positive infections [^245f2f3c]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2001). Low credibility.

Linezolid (Zyvox — Pharmacia) — the first oxazolidinone antibacterial — is marketed in the UK for treating hospital- and community-acquired pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections. The manufacturer claims that switching from i.v. to oral administration of linezolid needs no dose adjustment and "will lead to early patient discharge and reduced hospital length of stay" for patients needing treatment for infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Here, we assess the place of linezolid.

### Linezolid versus glycopeptide or β-lactam for treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^b2faccb7]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

Linezolid has been approved for the treatment of patients with infections caused by Gram-positive cocci that are resistant to traditionally used antibiotics, including glycopeptides. This oxazolidinone antibiotic has been reported to have excellent pharmacokinetics and effectiveness. We did a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to clarify whether linezolid is superior to glycopeptides or beta-lactams for the treatment of Gram-positive infections. 12 RCTs, involving 6093 patients, were included. Overall, with respect to treatment success, linezolid was more effective than glycopeptides or beta-lactams (odds ratio [OR] 1.41 [95% CI 1.11–1.81]). Mortality was similar between the groups (OR 0.97 [0.79–1.19]). Linezolid was more effective than comparators in patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (OR 1.67 [1.31–2.12]) and bacteraemia (OR 2.07 [1.13–3.78]). However, there was no difference in treatment success for patients with pneumonia (OR 1.03 [0.75–1.42]). Treatment with linezolid was not associated with more adverse effects in general (OR 1.40 [0.95–2.06]); however, thrombocytopenia was recorded more commonly in patients receiving linezolid (OR 11.72 [3.66–37.57]). Although linezolid is more effective than its comparators for the empirical treatment of selected patients, several points, such as the use of less potent antistaphylococcal beta-lactams, the same all-cause mortality, and the higher probability of thrombocytopenia, should be taken into account and may limit the use of linezolid to specific patient populations or infections that are difficult to treat with other antibiotics.

### Linezolid: its role in the treatment of gram-positive, drug-resistant bacterial infections [^c2f8d0d6]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

While the choices available for the management of gram-positive, drug-resistant bacterial infections are becoming limited, antimicrobial resistance is becoming increasingly problematic because of the widespread overuse of antibiotics. Linezolid is a synthetic antibiotic belonging to a new class of antimicrobials called the oxazolidinones. Linezolid disrupts bacterial growth by inhibiting the initiation process of protein synthesis — a mechanism of action that is unique to this class of drugs. It is well absorbed with high bioavailability that allows conversion to oral therapy as soon as the patient is clinically stable. It has been approved for certain gram-positive infections including certain drug-resistant enterococcus, staphylococcus, and pneumococcus strains. It is generally well tolerated, with myelosuppression being the most serious adverse effect. As a nonselective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, caution is recommended when used with adrenergic or serotonergic agents (e.g., tyramine, dopamine, pseudoephedrine, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Judicious use of this medication should help physicians treat patients with multidrug-resistant infections.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^6406a175]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia: initial empiric therapy for CAP, HAP, VAP

Severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP). For patients without risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) infection, the currently recommended initial empiric therapy is (a) beta-lactam plus a macrolide or (b) beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone (FQ), both of which are acceptable, although more evidence favors a beta-lactam/macrolide. While evidence supporting these recommendations is based upon observational studies, a meta-analysis and systematic review found improved mortality for treatment with beta-lactam/macrolide over a beta -lactam/FQ, especially with severe CAP. There are not sufficient data to recommend treatment with FQ monotherapy or a beta-lactam plus doxycycline in severe CAP.

Patients with risk factors for MRSA or PSA might have been characterized as healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) in the past, but his term has been abandoned. Multiple studies demonstrated that HCAP risk factors did not necessarily predict the presence of resistant organisms and that coverage for these organisms did not improve clinical outcomes. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline recommends empiric MRSA and/or PSA coverage for CAP patients with risk factors for these pathogens, followed by de-escalation of therapy, if cultures are negative. The best risk factors for MRSA and PSA infection are previous growth of these pathogens, as well as recent hospitalization and parenteral antibiotic exposure (within 90 days). The development of validated scoring systems that accurately predict risk for these pathogens has proven difficult, as have efforts to develop locally validated risk factors. Empiric MRSA and/or PSA coverage in severe CAP, with de-escalation, has proven to be a safe strategy. However, a recent study found a low overall rate of de-escalation in the setting of negative cultures, providing an opportunity to improve antibiotic use. Possible empiric regimens recommended for MRSA pneumonia include vancomycin or linezolid. Therapy for PSA includes piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, meropenem, or imipenem. Newer agents may also have a role.

### An integrated safety summary of omadacycline, a novel aminomethylcycline antibiotic [^5c092128]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Omadacycline is an aminomethylcycline, a semisynthetic tetracycline-class antibiotic. Modifications to the tetracycline molecule protect omadacycline from tetracycline-specific active efflux and ribosomal modifications that lead to resistance to the historical tetracyclines. Omadacycline has in vitro activity against gram-positive pathogens, many gram-negative pathogens, atypical pathogens, and some anaerobic pathogens. However, no activity has been observed against Proteus, Providencia, Pseudomonas, and Morganella species. In phase III studies, omadacycline was demonstrated to be noninferior to linezolid in acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and to moxifloxacin in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP).

While bacterial resistance to the historic tetracyclines decreased their use several decades ago, tetracycline-class antibiotics have been in use for > 70 years and have an established safety profile. Here, the relevant safety information on omadacycline is presented, with a focus on the safety profile observed from 3 pivotal, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase III clinical trials in ABSSSI and CABP: Omadacycline in Acute Skin and Skin Structure Infections Study (OASIS-1: NCT02378480; OASIS-2: NCT02877927), and Omadacycline for Pneumonia Treatment In the Community (OPTIC: NCT02531438).

### Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and fluoroquinolone use [^3f60cec7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The results of this study raise a number of questions for further investigation. Why did the association between fluoroquinolone use and resistance become weaker in the later study years? Does this finding represent random fluctuation or an underlying trend? Mean fluoroquinolone use, after increasing through the first 3 study years, reached a plateau in the last 2 years (Figure 1). Perhaps associations with resistance are reflected most strongly when antimicrobial drug use is increasing, as was seen in the first 3 study years. The study by Zervos et al. found a significant association between changes in fluoroquinolone use and changes in resistance in P. aeruginosa in 10 teaching hospitals from 1991 to 2000. During this period, fluoroquinolone use increased by a mean of 97% in the participating hospitals; in the present study, the mean increase during the study period was 23%. Also, the percentage of resistance among MRSA and P. aeruginosa was relatively high in all hospitals from the beginning of this study. Monnet et al. in their study of the impact of antimicrobial drug use on an outbreak of MRSA in Scotland, observed that "… antimicrobial drug use was a more important ecologic risk factor at the start of the outbreak than once MRSA had become endemic in the hospital". After antimicrobial use "drives" resistance to a certain point, other effects such as cross-transmission may become the dominant mode of spread. From a scientific standpoint, this finding suggests that ecologic studies may be more likely to detect a significant effect when a particular form of resistance is in its "infancy" (current examples might be linezolid-resistant S. aureus or fluoroquinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae). From a clinical point of view, this finding suggests that measures to ensure proper antimicrobial drug use would have the most effect before resistance becomes widespread.

### Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in culture-proven sepsis and outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use [^2369dd96]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Prior studies have estimated the national and global burden of antimicrobial resistance, but our study is among the first to estimate the net prevalence of antibiotic resistance across all culture sites in patients with culture-positive community-onset sepsis. We found that approximately 1 in 8 patients had resistant gram-positive organisms (primarily MRSA and rarely VRE) and 1 in 8 had resistant gram-negative organisms (primarily ceftriaxone-resistant gram-negative organisms and rarely ESBL or CRE). More than two-thirds of patients received broad-spectrum therapy directed at resistant organisms, but MRSA was only isolated in 1 in 6 patients treated with vancomycin or linezolid, P aeruginosa or other ceftriaxone-resistant gram-negative organisms in 1 in 6 patients treated with anti- Pseudomonal agents, VRE in 1 in 16 patients treated with linezolid or daptomycin, and ESBLs in 1 in 70 patients treated with carbapenems. Both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric therapy were associated with higher mortality after detailed risk adjustment.

Our findings almost certainly overestimate the prevalence of resistant pathogens across the entire spectrum of patients treated for possible sepsis given the following: (1) we limited our analysis to bacterial, culture-positive sepsis, and between 30% and 50% of all patients with sepsis are culture negative; (2) viruses are often implicated in severe pneumonia (the most common cause of sepsis), and (3) there are many noninfectious mimickers of sepsis that are treated as sepsis. All told, the net fraction of patients with sepsis who would benefit from broad-spectrum therapy, including agents active against both MRSA and Pseudomonas, is small. This may be an acceptable trade-off given the increased risk of death associated with inadequate therapy, but it underscores the need for rapid tests to more efficiently identify the small fraction of patients who truly need broad spectrum therapy. Alternatively, predictive models may soon allow clinicians to effectively select and tailor antibiotic regimens at the point of care.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia [^d587d88e]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarises some of the notable papers on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) from January 2003 to October 2004.

Recent Findings

Ventilator-associated pneumonia remains an important drain on hospital resources. All population groups are affected, but patients with VAP are more likely to be older, sicker, and male, with invasive medical devices in situ. Early VAP diagnosis is desirable to reduce VAP mortality and to retard emergence of multidrug-resistant microbes. This may be possible using preliminary culture results or intracellular organism in polymorphonuclear cells. In most intensive care units, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii are the commonest organisms isolated in VAP. However, causative organisms vary between and within hospitals. Consequently, individual intensive care units should develop empirical antibiotic policies to target the pathogenic bacteria prevalent in their patient populations. Preventative strategies aimed at reducing aerodigestive tract colonisation by pathogenic organisms, and also their subsequent aspiration, are becoming increasingly important. Educating medical staff about these simple measures is therefore pertinent. To reduce the occurrence of multidrug-resistant organisms, limiting the duration of antibiotic treatment to 8 days and antimicrobial rotation should be contemplated. Empirical therapy with antipseudomonal penicillins plus beta-lactamase inhibitors should be considered. If methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus VAP is a possibility, linezolid may be better than vancomycin.

Summary

Prevention remains the key to reducing VAP prevalence.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: diagnosis and management [^30247ffd]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of death. Risk factors include older age and medical comorbidities. Diagnosis is suggested by a history of cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, or acute functional or cognitive decline, with abnormal vital signs (e.g., fever, tachycardia) and lung examination findings. Diagnosis should be confirmed by chest radiography or ultrasonography. Validated prediction scores for pneumonia severity can guide the decision between outpatient and inpatient therapy. Using procalcitonin as a biomarker for severe infection may further assist with risk stratification. Most outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia do not require microbiologic testing of sputum or blood and can be treated empirically with a macrolide, doxycycline, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Patients requiring hospitalization should be treated with a fluoroquinolone or a combination of beta-lactam plus macrolide antibiotics. Patients with severe infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit require dual antibiotic therapy including a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide alone or in combination with a fluoroquinolone. Treatment options for patients with risk factors for Pseudomonas species include administration of an antipseudomonal antibiotic and an aminoglycoside, plus azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone. Patients with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid, or ceftaroline in resistant cases. Administration of corticosteroids within 36 hours of hospital admission for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia decreases the risk of adult respiratory distress syndrome and length of treatment. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations are both recommended for adults 65 years and older to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia.

### Linezolid and quinupristin / dalfopristin: novel antibiotics for gram-positive infections of the skin [^e2eb14b3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

With the continuing development of clinical drug resistance among bacteria, the need for new, effective agents to treat multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive infections remains important. With treatment options limited, it has become critical to identify antibiotics with novel mechanisms of activity. Several new drugs have emerged as possible therapeutic alternatives. This review focuses on agents newly introduced and FDA-approved for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections: linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin.

### Linezolid: a review of safety and tolerability [^410aa87c]. The Journal of Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Linezolid has demonstrated activity against antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant aerobic Gram-positive cocci. The availability of intravenous and oral formulations, with near 100% bioavailability of the latter, is hoped to facilitate the management of multiply drug-resistant Gram-positive infections. Linezolid was approved for clinical use in the United States in April 2000 and has subsequently been approved in other countries for the management of community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia, complicated and uncomplicated skin and soft-tissue infections, and infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, including cases with concurrent bacteremia. Additional studies have demonstrated potential use in febrile cancer patients with neutropenia, and case reports have documented some efficacy in the management of infective endocarditis, tuberculosis, nocardiosis, and in anaerobic infections. Given the potential for significantly increased use of linezolid, a thorough review and update of its tolerability and safety profile is warranted.

### Advances in antibiotic therapy in the critically ill [^d87dbcfb]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Table 2
The most important new antibiotic agents in the pipeline

Adapted from with permission

Omadacycline (an aminomethylcycline) and eravacycline (a fluorocycline) are developed from the tetracyclines and have now entered phase II clinical trials. Omadacycline is available for intravenous and oral therapy. It is effective against a large number of sensitive but also resistant Gram-positive pathogens (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci and MRSA) and against some Gram-positive pathogens, such as H. influenzae, Klebsiella, and Escherichia coli. Eravacycline is also active against resistant Gram-negative pathogens but not against P. aeruginosa or Burkholderia.

Fifth-generation cephalosporins with MRSA activity (ceftaroline, which does not have Pseudomonas activity, and the Pseudomonas -active ceftobiprole) are available in a number of countries, but have not been used extensively (because of a lack of data) in critically ill patients. In a recent RCT, ceftobiprole (3 × 500 mg) was compared with the combination of ceftazidime (3 × 2 g) and linezolid (2 × 600 mg) in 781 patients with nosocomial pneumonia, including 210 with VAP. Clinical cure rates overall were around 50% in both groups, but ceftobiprole performed less well in VAP (23.1 versus 36.8% cure rate). Ceftolozane/tazobactam is a new cephalosporin that differs from ceftazidime by a modification of the side chain in the third position of the cephem nucleus, allowing increased antipseudomonal activity and activity against some extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing strains. In a recent study in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection, ceftolozane/tazobactam (3 × 1.5 g) plus metronidazole was non-inferior to meropenem (3 × 1 g). In another large trial, treatment with ceftolozane/tazobactam was also associated with better responses compared with high-dose levofloxacin in patients with complicated lower urinary tract infections or pyelonephritis.

### Pneumonia in patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation [^892506eb]. Microbes and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Nosocomial pneumonia is the most important infectious disease in patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Understanding of the etiology helps to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP can develop in four ways: by aspiration, inhalation, hematogenous spread and by contiguous spread. The two most common are aspiration from the oropharyngeal region and inhalation, usually from manipulation of tubing or infected equipment. VAP is prevented by hand-washing, keeping the head of the bed at 45 and, in some cases, by treating the surface bacteria which usually cause VAP. Sputum can be used for the diagnosis of VAP in most of these patients instead of invasive bronchoscopy. However, if the patients are critically ill, then bronchoscopy is used. Treatment in these patients depends on the bacteria. Pseudomonas is treated by two drugs (beta-lactam plus a quinolone or aminoglycoside), Acinetobacteria by ampicillin/sulbactam or carbapenam, extended-spectrum beta-lactam-producing bacteria by carbapenums, and Staphylococcus by vancomycin or linezolid.

### Linezolid: the first oxazolidinone antimicrobial [^37deddc9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Linezolid is the first of a new class of antimicrobial agents, the oxazolidinones, to be approved for clinical use in the United States and elsewhere. The drug is a totally synthetic compound, which lessens the likelihood of naturally occurring resistance mechanisms. It has excellent activity against virtually all important gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci, macrolide-resistant streptococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Development of resistance to the compound has been infrequent thus far. Linezolid is 100% bioavailable, so it can be given in equal doses orally or parenterally. Its elimination half-life allows dosing twice per day, and alteration of drug dosage is not required in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Linezolid has approved indications for skin and soft tissue infections; lower respiratory tract infections; and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, including cases with concurrent bacteremia. The drug has an acceptable profile of adverse events, but reversible myelosuppression has occurred in patients receiving high doses for more than 2 weeks.

### Bacterial biofilm formation is variably inhibited by different formulations of antibiotic-loaded bone cement in vitro [^9e4daf7d]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of the present study was to quantitatively assess biofilm growth on the surface of bone cements discs containing different antibiotics, including colistin and linezolid. Biofilms of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were grown on bone cement discs for 96 h.

Methods

Biofilm amounts were measured by confocal laser microscopy using live/dead staining and dedicated software at different time intervals (48, 72, and 96 h).

Results

Bone cement containing vancomycin was not effective at reducing MRSA biofilm formation 96 h following bacterial inoculation. At a comparable time interval, linezolid-, clindamycin-, and aminoglycoside-loaded cement was still active against this biofilm. At the 72- and 96-h observations, S. epidermidis biofilm was present only on tobramycin and gentamicin discs. P. aeruginosa biofilms were present on cement discs loaded with colistin at all time intervals starting from the 48-h observation, whereas no biofilms were detected on tobramycin or gentamicin discs.

Conclusion

Bone cements containing different antibiotics have variable and time-dependent windows of activity in inhibiting or reducing surface biofilm formation. The effectiveness of bone cement containing vancomycin against MRSA biofilm is questionable. The present study is clinically relevant, because it suggests that adding the right antibiotic to bone cement could be a promising approach to treat periprosthetic infections. Indeed, the antibiofilm activity of different antibiotic-loaded bone cements could be preoperatively assessed using the current methodology in two-stage exchange procedures.

### Linezolid: an oxazolidinone antimicrobial agent [^6f56b4c5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Linezolid is the first oxazolidinone anti-infective agent marketed in the United States. It is indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other susceptible organisms, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections. It also is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, and community-acquired pneumonia caused by penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Objective

This article reviews the pharmacologic properties and clinical usefulness of linezolid.

Methods

Using the terms linezolid, PNU-100766, and oxazolidinone, we performed a literature search of the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 to September 2000), HealthSTAR (1993 to September 2000), Iowa Drug Information Service (1966 to September 2000), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to September 2000), PharmaProjects (January 2000 version), and meeting abstracts of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (1996 to 2000).

Results

Linezolid has a unique structure and mechanism of action, which targets protein synthesis at an exceedingly early stage. Consequently, cross-resistance with other commercially available antimicrobial agents is unlikely. It is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria. To date, resistance to linezolid has been reported in patients infected with enterococci. The pharmacokinetic parameters of linezolid in adults are not altered by hepatic or renal function, age, or sex to an extent requiring dose adjustment. Linezolid is metabolized via morpholine ring oxidation, which is independent of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system; as a result, linezolid is unlikely to interact with medications that stimulate or inhibit CYP450 enzymes. Compassionate-use trials and other clinical studies involving mainly adult hospitalized patients with gram-positive infections have shown that linezolid administered intravenously or orally is effective in a variety of nosocomial and community-acquired infections, including those caused by resistant gram-positive organisms. Reported adverse effects include thrombocytopenia. diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, constipation, rash, and dizziness. Preliminary pharmacoeconomic data indicate that a significantly higher percentage of patients receiving linezolid therapy versus comparator could be discharged from the hospital by day 7 (P = 0.005).

Conclusions

Linezolid appears to be effective while maintaining an acceptable tolerability profile. Due to the risk of bacterial resistance, linezolid should be reserved for the treatment of documented serious vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections.

Table 12 Cure Rates at the Test-of-Cure Visit for Microbiologically Evaluable Adult Patients with Nosocomial Pneumonia

Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with clinically documented complicated skin and skin structure infections were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy trial comparing study medications administered intravenously followed by medications given orally for a total of 10 to 21 days of treatment. One group of patients received linezolid injection 600 mg every 12 hours followed by linezolid tablets 600 mg every 12 hours; the other group received oxacillin 2 g every 6 hours intravenously followed by dicloxacillin 500 mg every 6 hours orally. Patients could receive concomitant aztreonam if clinically indicated. There were 400 linezolid-treated and 419 oxacillin-treated patients enrolled in the study. Two hundred forty-five (61%) linezolid-treated patients and 242 (58%) oxacillin-treated patients were clinically evaluable. The cure rates in clinically evaluable patients were 90% in linezolid-treated patients and 85% in oxacillin-treated patients. A modified intent-to-treat (MITT) analysis of 316 linezolid-treated patients and 313 oxacillin-treated patients included subjects who met all criteria for study entry. The cure rates in the MITT analysis were 86% in linezolid-treated patients and 82% in oxacillin-treated patients. The cure rates by pathogen for microbiologically evaluable patients are presented in Table 13.

### The oxazolidinones as a new family of antimicrobial agent [^c8108b05]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

The oxazolidinones are a new chemical class of synthetic antmicrobials characterized by a unique mechanism of protein synthesis inhibition. Linezolid is the first compound of this class and has recently received approval for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia and skin and skin structure infections. In vitro tests demonstrate that linezolid possesses a significant activity against Gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), vancomycin-intermediate strains (VISA) and penicillin-resistant pneumococci (PRPN). Combined with other drugs linezolid interacts favourably against many important pathogens and it is able to affect some bacterial virulence factors as well as produce a postantibiotic effect. Results from experimental models of infection reveal linezolid to be highly active in vivo against infections due to Gram-positive pathogens. Linezolid may be administered either intravenously or orally with oral bioavailability of approximately 100% and limited adverse effects. The clinical efficacy of linezolid has been investigated in several phase II and III trials. Linezolid has been proved to be useful in severe infections sustained by multiresistant Gram-positive micro-organisms. Synthesis of the second-generation oxazolidinones with improved potency against Gram-positive and negative bacteria is currently under way.

### Severe lactic acidosis associated with oral linezolid [^b8352858]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We present the case of a patient with cystic fibrosis on long-term oral linezolid treatment for Mycobacteria abscessus lung infection who developed severe linezolid-induced lactic acidosis (LILA) resulting in deranged clotting and pancytopenia. The lactic acidosis was resistant to treatment with intravenous fluid but resolved within 20 hours of initiating continuous veno-venous haemofiltration. An unintended consequence of haemofiltration was that vascular access interfered with effective chest physiotherapy, resulting in worsened lung consolidation requiring prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy for coexisting Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Given the potential mortality and morbidity of LILA, monitoring lactate levels may be clinically important but the optimum timing of monitoring is currently unclear.

### Linezolid for the treatment of resistant gram-positive cocci [^19548eb4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a comprehensive review of linezolid, the first of a new class of antibiotics, the oxazolidinones. Therapeutic issues regarding the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and a brief history of the oxazolidinones are also discussed.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-March 2001) was conducted to identify pertinent literature, including preclinical trials, clinical trials, and reviews. Unpublished clinical data, adverse effects, and dosing information were abstracted from product labeling.

Study Selection

Clinical efficacy data were extracted from clinical trials, case reports, and abstracts that mentioned linezolid. Additional information concerning antibiotic resistance, the oxazolidinones, in vitro susceptibility and the pharmacokinetic profile of linezolid also was reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Linezolid exhibits activity against many gram-positive organisms, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Linezolid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis at an early step in translation and is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a number of unpublished clinical trials in adults with pneumonia, skin and skin structure infections, and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium infections. The adverse effect profile is similar to that of comparator agents (beta-lactams, clarithrornycin, vancomycin).

Conclusions

Linezolid is the first oral antimicrobial agent approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Since the oxazoildinones have a unique mechanism of action and expanded spectrum of activity against virulent and highly resistant gram positive pathogens, linezolid is a valuable alternative to currently available treatment options. Clinical trials evaluating linezolid and other oxazolidinones for antibiotic-resistant gram-positive infections, as well as comparator studies comparing linezolid with other candidate drugs, such as quinupristin/dalfopristin and choramphenicol, will further define the role of linezolid.

### Breast implant-associated infections: the role of the national surgical quality improvement program and the local microbiome [^5ba9977e]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The most common cause of surgical readmission after breast implant surgery remains infection. Six causative organisms are principally involved: Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Propionibacterium, and Corynebacterium. The authors investigated the infection patterns and antibiotic sensitivities to characterize their local microbiome and determine ideal antibiotic selection.

Methods

A retrospective review of 2285 consecutive implant-based breast procedures was performed. Included surgical procedures were immediate and delayed breast reconstruction, tissue expander exchange, and cosmetic augmentation. Patient demographics, chemotherapy and/or irradiation status, implant characteristics, explantation reason, time to infection, microbiological data, and antibiotic sensitivities were reviewed.

Results

Forty-seven patients (2.1 percent) required inpatient admission for antibiotics, operative explantation, or drainage by interventional radiology. The infection rate varied depending on surgical procedure, with the highest rate seen in mastectomy and immediate tissue expander reconstruction (6.1 percent). The mean time to explantation was 41 days. Only 50 percent of infections occurred within 30 days of the indexed National Surgical Quality Improvement Program operation. The most commonly isolated organisms were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (27 percent), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (25 percent), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (7 percent), Pseudomonas (7 percent), and Peptostreptococcus (7 percent). All Gram-positive organisms were sensitive to vancomycin, linezolid, tetracycline, and doxycycline; all Gram-negative organisms were sensitive to gentamicin and cefepime.

Conclusions

Empiric antibiotics should be vancomycin (with the possible inclusion of gentamicin) based on their broad effectiveness against the authors' unique microbiome. Minor infections should be treated with tetracycline or doxycycline as a second-line agent. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data are adequate for monitoring and comparing breast infections but certainly not comprehensive.

### Current choices of antibiotic treatment for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections [^7eb13db6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most feared nosocomial pathogens. Treatment of P. aeruginosa infections is challenging because of the limited choices of antibiotics and the emergent resistance of the pathogen. The present review aims at addressing the management of P. aeruginosa infections and highlighting the novel antibiotics that show a future promising role.

Recent Findings

Novel fluoroquinolones have been recently introduced and show favorable activity. New combinations of β-lactams/β-lactamase inhibitors have been studied in various indications of infections because of P. aeruginosa. Cefiderocol, a new cephalosporin, shows very promising results against P. aeruginosa. Currently, combination therapy is only recommended in limited scenarios. Extended-infusion of β-lactams exhibit clinical benefit. Bacteriophage therapy is a growing field of interest and may have an impactful effect on the treatment of resistant P. aeruginosa.

Summary

Factors that guide clinical decisions for empiric and directed P. aeruginosa therapy include the epidemiology, the patient's risk factors, the site of infection, and the available treatment options. Conventional antipseudomonal antibiotics have been used successfully for a long time, but the increase in worldwide resistance necessitates the need for newer agents. Antimicrobial stewardship is essential to preserve the new drugs and prevent future development of resistance.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^3d1c7e5d]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed by clinical features (e.g., cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain) and by lung imaging, usually an infiltrate seen on chest radiography. Initial evaluation should determine the need for hospitalization versus outpatient management using validated mortality or severity prediction scores. Selected diagnostic laboratory testing, such as sputum and blood cultures, is indicated for inpatients with severe illness but is rarely useful for outpatients. Initial outpatient therapy should include a macrolide or doxycycline. For outpatients with comorbidities or who have used antibiotics within the previous three months, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, or moxifloxacin), or an oral beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide should be used. Inpatients not admitted to an intensive care unit should receive a respiratory fluoroquinolone, or a beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide. Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia or who are admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, plus azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Those with risk factors for Pseudomonas should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic (piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, doripenem, or cefepime), plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin or an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin). Those with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid. Hospitalized patients may be switched from intravenous to oral antibiotics after they have clinical improvement and are able to tolerate oral medications, typically in the first three days. Adherence to the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia has been shown to improve patient outcomes. Physicians should promote pneumococcal and influenza vaccination as a means to prevent community-acquired pneumonia and pneumococcal bacteremia.

Table 1 — recommended antimicrobial therapy in patients with healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis by isolated pathogen — details standard versus alternative agents as follows: For methicillin sensitive staphylococci, standard therapy is nafcillin or oxacillin with vancomycin as an alternative; for methicillin resistant staphylococci, standard therapy is vancomycin with daptomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or linezolid as alternatives. For Propionibacterium acnes, standard therapy is penicillin G with third-generation cephalosporin, vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid as alternatives. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, standard therapy is cefepime, ceftazidime, or meropenem with aztreonam or ciprofloxacin as alternatives. For Haemophilus influenzae that is β-lactamase negative, standard therapy is ampicillin with third-generation cephalosporin, cefepime, or a fluoroquinolone as alternatives; for β-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae, standard therapy is third-generation cephalosporin with cefepime, aztreonam, or a fluoroquinolone as alternatives. For extended spectrum β-lactamase–producing gram-negative bacilli, standard therapy is meropenem with cefepime or a fluoroquinolone as alternatives. For Acinetobacter baumannii, standard therapy is meropenem with colistin (usually formulated as colistimethate sodium) or polymyxin B as alternatives. For other Enterobacteriaceae, standard therapy is third-generation cephalosporin with meropenem, aztreonam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or ciprofloxacin as alternatives. For Candida species, standard therapy is lipid formulation of amphotericin B ± flucytosine with fluconazole or voriconazole as alternatives; footnotes specify that Candida krusei should not be treated with fluconazole and that Candida glabrata may be treated with fluconazole if it is susceptible, although many isolates will only be susceptible to high doses or will be resistant. For Aspergillus species, standard therapy is voriconazole with lipid formulation of amphotericin B or posaconazole as alternatives.

### Ceftazidime, avibactam (Avycaz) [^ca8fcb58]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Resistance

No cross-resistance with other classes of antimicrobials has been identified. Some isolates resistant to other cephalosporins (including ceftazidime) and to carbapenems may be susceptible to AVYCAZ.

Interaction with Other Antimicrobials

In vitro studies have not demonstrated antagonism between AVYCAZ and colistin, levofloxacin, linezolid, metronidazole, tigecycline, tobramycin, or vancomycin.

Activity against Ceftazidime - N onsusceptible Bacteria in Animal Infection Models

Avibactam restored activity of ceftazidime in animal models of infection (e.g. thigh infection, pyelonephritis, systemic infection induced by intraperitoneal injection) caused by ceftazidime non-susceptible beta-lactamase- producing (e.g. ESBL, KPC and AmpC) gram-negative bacteria.

Antimicrobial Activity

AVYCAZ has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1.1), (1.2) and (1.3)].

### Antibiotic strategies for eradicating Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis [^1bf03856]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory tract infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occur in most people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Established chronic P aeruginosa infection is virtually impossible to eradicate and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Early infection may be easier to eradicate. This is an updated review.

Objectives

Does giving antibiotics for P aeruginosa infection in people with CF at the time of new isolation improve clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, quality of life and morbidity), eradicate P aeruginosa infection, and delay the onset of chronic infection, but without adverse effects, compared to usual treatment or an alternative antibiotic regimen? We also assessed cost-effectiveness.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and conference proceedings. Latest search: 24 March 2022. We searched ongoing trials registries. Latest search: 6 April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with CF, in whom P aeruginosa had recently been isolated from respiratory secretions. We compared combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics with placebo, usual treatment or other antibiotic combinations. We excluded non-randomised trials and cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 11 trials (1449 participants) lasting between 28 days and 27 months; some had few participants and most had relatively short follow-up periods. Antibiotics in this review are: oral - ciprofloxacin and azithromycin; inhaled - tobramycin nebuliser solution for inhalation (TNS), aztreonam lysine (AZLI) and colistin; IV - ceftazidime and tobramycin. There was generally a low risk of bias from missing data. In most trials it was difficult to blind participants and clinicians to treatment. Two trials were supported by the manufacturers of the antibiotic used. TNS versus placebo TNS may improve eradication; fewer participants were still positive for P aeruginosa at one month (odds ratio (OR) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.18; 3 trials, 89 participants; low-certainty evidence) and two months (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.65; 2 trials, 38 participants). We are uncertain whether the odds of a positive culture decrease at 12 months (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.67; 1 trial, 12 participants). TNS (28 days) versus TNS (56 days) One trial (88 participants) comparing 28 days to 56 days TNS treatment found duration of treatment may make little or no difference in time to next isolation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.76; low-certainty evidence). Cycled TNS versus culture-based TNS One trial (304 children, one to 12 years old) compared cycled TNS to culture-based therapy and also ciprofloxacin to placebo. We found moderate-certainty evidence of an effect favouring cycled TNS therapy (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.82), although the trial publication reported age-adjusted OR and no difference between groups. Ciprofloxacin versus placebo added to cycled and culture-based TNS therapy One trial (296 participants) examined the effect of adding ciprofloxacin versus placebo to cycled and culture-based TNS therapy. There is probably no difference between ciprofloxacin and placebo in eradicating P aeruginosa (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.44; moderate-certainty evidence). Ciprofloxacin and colistin versus TNS We are uncertain whether there is any difference between groups in eradication of P aeruginosa at up to six months (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.23; 1 trial, 58 participants) or up to 24 months (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.42; 1 trial, 47 participants); there was a low rate of short-term eradication in both groups. Ciprofloxacin plus colistin versus ciprofloxacin plus TNS One trial (223 participants) found there may be no difference in positive respiratory cultures at 16 months between ciprofloxacin with colistin versus TNS with ciprofloxacin (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.29; low-certainty evidence). TNS plus azithromycin compared to TNS plus oral placebo Adding azithromycin may make no difference to the number of participants eradicating P aeruginosa after a three-month treatment phase (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.35; 1 trial, 91 participants; low-certainty evidence); there was also no evidence of any difference in the time to recurrence. Ciprofloxacin and colistin versus no treatment A single trial only reported one of our planned outcomes; there were no adverse effects in either group. AZLI for 14 days plus placebo for 14 days compared to AZLI for 28 days We are uncertain whether giving 14 or 28 days of AZLI makes any difference to the proportion of participants having a negative respiratory culture at 28 days (mean difference (MD) -7.50, 95% CI -24.80 to 9.80; 1 trial, 139 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Ceftazidime with IV tobramycin compared with ciprofloxacin (both regimens in conjunction with three months colistin) IV ceftazidime with tobramycin compared with ciprofloxacin may make little or no difference to eradication of P aeruginosa at three months, sustained to 15 months, provided that inhaled antibiotics are also used (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.09; P = 0.18; 1 trial, 255 participants; high-certainty evidence). The results do not support using IV antibiotics over oral therapy to eradicate P aeruginosa, based on both eradication rate and financial cost.

Authors' Conclusions

We found that nebulised antibiotics, alone or with oral antibiotics, were better than no treatment for early infection with P aeruginosa. Eradication may be sustained in the short term. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether these antibiotic strategies decrease mortality or morbidity, improve quality of life, or are associated with adverse effects compared to placebo or standard treatment. Four trials comparing two active treatments have failed to show differences in rates of eradication of P aeruginosa. One large trial showed that intravenous ceftazidime with tobramycin is not superior to oral ciprofloxacin when inhaled antibiotics are also used. There is still insufficient evidence to state which antibiotic strategy should be used for the eradication of early P aeruginosa infection in CF, but there is now evidence that intravenous therapy is not superior to oral antibiotics.

### Linezolid [^412dbac0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Nosocomial Pneumonia

Linezolid Injection is indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates) or Streptococcus pneumoniae [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.2 Community-acquired Pneumonia

Linezolid Injection is indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, including cases with concurrent bacteremia, or Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.3 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Linezolid Injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections, including diabetic foot infections, without concomitant osteomyelitis, caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid Injection has not been studied in the treatment of decubitus ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.4 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Linezolid Injection is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) or Streptococcus pyogenes [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.5 Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium Infections

Linezolid Injection is indicated for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, including cases with concurrent bacteremia [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.6 Limitations of Use

- Linezolid Injection is not indicated for the treatment of Gram-negative infections. It is critical that specific Gram-negative therapy be initiated immediately if a concomitant Gram-negative pathogen is documented or suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- The safety and efficacy of Linezolid Injection formulations given for longer than 28 days have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studie s (14)].

1.7 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Linezolid Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Linezolid Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Case 2: prior MDR colonization (Additional file 4)

The second clinical case was a LTx for cystic fibrosis with colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa only susceptible to carbapenems, colistin and tobramycin. This colonization was not considered a contraindication in 94.9% of the centers, and there was no pretransplant decolonization strategy in 69.7%. The postoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of meropenem or imipenem (92.9%), tobramycin (45.5%), colistin (36.3%), and antibiotics with activity against MRSA pathogens such as vancomycin, linezolid or teicoplanin (25.3%). Combined antibiotics with a carbapenem (or a new antipseudomonal cephalosporin with a beta-lactamase inhibitor) and tobramycin or colistin were proposed in 69.7%. The duration of this antibiotic treatment was very heterogeneous (Fig. 4 b) but was at least 14 days in 66.7% of the centers. After 4 days of antibiotic treatment, even if the results of the bacteriological samples issued from the donor and the recipient were negative and without any sign of infection, antibiotics were not stopped in 89.9% of the centers. Similarly, cases with colonization by a Burkholderia species were not considered absolute contraindications for LTx by 11.1% of the respondents unless the strain was pan-resistant (38.4%).

Case 3: definition of colonization (Additional file 5)

The third clinical case was the definition of colonization with wild-type or MDR bacteria in a COPD recipient. The questions were related to the delay between the last bacterial isolation and the LTx to consider if the therapy should target these bacteria. In such cases, where wild bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were isolated at least once and never found again on the last samples, the delay was widely heterogeneous: 15 days or less (14.2%), between 1 and 3 months (35.3%), 6 months (16.2%), and 1 year or more (28.2%). If the organism was an MDR strain, the duration to consider antibiotic prophylaxis targeting this bacteria was longer: 15 days or less (14.2%), between 1 and 3 months (27.3%), 6 months (22.2%), and 1 year or more (34.3%).

### Infectious keratitis isolates and susceptibility in Southern California [^88b167fe]. Cornea (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine longitudinal trends in prevalence and resistance profiles for infectious keratitis at referral centers in Southern California.

Methods

Cultured infectious keratitis cases from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2009, and January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2019, at the University of California, Los Angeles, were evaluated. Outcome measures included microbial isolate prevalence and antibiotic/antifungal susceptibility and resistance patterns.

Results

One hundred thirty-nine and 315 culture-positive isolates were obtained between 2006–2009 and 2016–2019, respectively. Gram-positive organisms accounted for 65% (2006–2009) and 74% (2016–2019) of bacterial isolates (P = 0.076). Staphylococcus infections, the most common gram-positive and bacterial isolate in both study epochs, demonstrated increased prevalence from 2006–2009 to 2016–2019 (41% vs. 53%, P = 0.019). Although coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) increased from 40% to 58% (P = 0.0012), the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was unchanged (28% vs. 28%, P = 0.99). Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common gram-negative organism, demonstrated decreased prevalence from 18% to 10% (P = 0.027). Candida species comprised 3.5% of culture-positive isolates in both epochs. All gram-positive isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, and all Staphylococcus isolates were susceptible to linezolid. Pseudomonas aeruginosa remained susceptible to tested fluoroquinolones (> 93%) and aminoglycosides (100%) over time.

Conclusions

In southern California between 2006 and 2019, there was a shift toward Staphylococcus species, with increased CoNS, decreased methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and decreased prevalence of P. aeruginosa. Empiric therapy of vancomycin and a fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside provides effective antibacterial coverage for predominant bacterial species when culture sensitivities are pending.

### Early stoppage of empirical antibiotic therapy in paediatric acute leukaemia with high-risk febrile neutropenia: a randomized, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority trial [^6c4d7ad5]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Eligible patients were required to be clinically free of infection with a negative blood culture and afebrile for at least 72 h while receiving intravenous EAT. Patients were considered afebrile if their axillary temperature remained below 37.5 °C (99.5 °F) for at least 48 h. Exclusion criteria included clinical, radiological, or microbiological evidence of infection, the requirement for third-line antibiotics, therapeutic antifungals, need for organ support during the treatment of febrile neutropenia. Additionally, patients with a history of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, diagnosis of HIV infection, or those with creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min were excluded. Patients diagnosed with mixed phenotypic acute leukaemia, acute promyelocytic leukaemia, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm or Burkitt's leukaemia were also excluded.

All children who experienced febrile neutropenia during induction chemotherapy for acute leukaemia at our centre were screened for this study. The standard evaluation for evidence of infection during an episode of febrile neutropenia included blood culture, complete blood count, renal and liver function tests accompanied by a chest radiograph. Based on clinical suspicion, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, urine culture, and abdomen-pelvis ultrasound were also included.

EAT was initiated as per institutional protocol with dual antibiotics with at least one anti-pseudomonas agent. Patients received antibiotics according to a tiered protocol. First-tier antibiotics included cefoperazone-sulbactam, amikacin, or levofloxacin either as single agent or in combination. Second-tier agents included meropenem, teicoplanin, oral clindamycin, and oral linezolid. Third-tier antibiotics comprised piperacillin-tazobactam, colistin, tigecycline, aztreonam, daptomycin, intravenous linezolid, and ceftazidime-avibactam. Voriconazole or amphotericin B was administered for breakthrough fungal infections, while echinocandins, azoles, or amphotericin B was used for established fungal infections such as candidemia, sino-orbital mucormycosis, and fungal pneumonia (Supplementary Table S1).

5.11 Hyponatremia and/or Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH)

Postmarketing cases of hyponatremia and/or Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) have been observed in patients treated with linezolid. In reported cases, the signs and symptoms included confusion, somnolence, generalized weakness, and in severe cases led to respiratory failure and even death. Monitor serum sodium levels regularly in the elderly, in patients taking diuretics, and in other patients at risk of hyponatremia and/or SIADH while taking Linezolid. If signs and symptoms of hyponatremia and/or SIADH occur, discontinue Linezolid, and institute appropriate supportive measures.

5.13 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing linezolid in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

14.1 Adults

Nosocomial Pneumonia

Adult patients with clinically and radiologically documented nosocomial pneumonia were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, double-blind trial. Patients were treated for 7 to 21 days. One group received linezolid injection 600 mg every 12 hours, and the other group received vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours intravenously. Both groups received concomitant aztreonam (1 to 2 g every 8 hours intravenously), which could be continued if clinically indicated. There were 203 linezolid-treated and 193 vancomycin-treated patients enrolled in the study. One hundred twenty-two (60%) linezolid-treated patients and 103 (53%) vancomycin-treated patients were clinically evaluable. The cure rates in clinically evaluable patients were 57% for linezolid-treated patients and 60% for vancomycin-treated patients. The cure rates in clinically evaluable patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia were 47% for linezolid-treated patients and 40% for vancomycin-treated patients. A modified intent-to-treat (MITT) analysis of 94 linezolid-treated patients and 83 vancomycin-treated patients included subjects who had a pathogen isolated before treatment. The cure rates in the MITT analysis were 57% in linezolid-treated patients and 46% in vancomycin-treated patients. The cure rates by pathogen for microbiologically evaluable patients are presented in Table 12.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of linezolid for the treatment of pediatric patients with the following infections are supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients, and additional data from a comparator-controlled study of Gram-positive infections in pediatric patients ranging in age from birth through 11 years [see Indications and Usage (1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14)]:

- nosocomial pneumonia

- complicated skin and skin structure infections

- community-acquired pneumonia (also supported by evidence from an uncontrolled study in patients ranging in age from 8 months through 12 years)

- vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections

The safety and effectiveness of linezolid for the treatment of pediatric patients with the following infection have been established in a comparator-controlled study in pediatric patients ranging in age from 5 through 17 years [see Clinical Studies (14)]:

- uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only) or Streptococcus pyogenes

Pharmacokinetic information generated in pediatric patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts showed variable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) linezolid concentrations following single and multiple dosing of linezolid; therapeutic concentrations were not consistently achieved or maintained in the CSF. Therefore, the use of linezolid for the empiric treatment of pediatric patients with central nervous system infections is not recommended.

### Review on risk factors, classification, and treatment of sternal wound infection [^2f23bd65]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

One should mind that some patients have no obvious symptoms of infection. It has been reported that most DSWI patients with PaiRolero classification I-II have typical clinical manifestations such as fever, purulent exudation, and chest pain after admission. However, most of the type III patients do not have the above-mentioned typical clinical manifestations, and the indicators such as WBC and neutrophil percentage are not abnormal. Therefore, we believe that multiple bacterial cultures of wound secretions, sputum, and blood should be performed in DSWI patients after admission, regardless of whether they have obvious symptoms of infection. In their study, Zhou Dan et al. found that pathogenic bacteria could not be detected in about 1/2 of the 69 patients, which was considered to be related to the routine use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent infection before cardiac surgery. Atypical pathogens such as bacteria and mycoplasma are also difficult to diagnose by in vitro culture. Therefore, we believe that the empirical use of antibiotics is also necessary before the results of drug susceptibility are available. The most common bacteria in SWI are gram-positive cocci, of which Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis account for more than 60%, gram-negative bacilli account for 5% ~ 22%, in addition, some are fungi, and about 25% of patients are infected by multiple pathogens.

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common gram-positive bacteria, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter Bauman are the most common gram-negative bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are highly resistant to penicillin G and sensitive to linezolid, tigecycline, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. It has been reported that linezolid is highly recommended, which has better tissue penetration, can form effective drug concentration under the sternum and mediastinum, conduct a more excellent antibacterial effect, and has an explicit clinical effect on Gram-positive bacteria in DSWI with osteomyelitis. Vancomycin has poor tissue penetration, obvious adverse effects of renal injury, and a poor antibacterial effect against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The drug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased year by year, and the drug resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii increased more seriously. The former showed high resistance to imipenem, meropenem, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxone, and the drug resistance rate to common antibiotics of the latter exceeded 70%.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis — oral antibacterial agents with excellent oral bioavailability are outlined with dosing and use limitations: Metronidazole 500 mg PO tid to qid can be used in the initial course of NVO due to Bacteroides species and other susceptible anaerobes; Moxifloxacin 400 mg PO once daily is not recommended for use in patients with staphylococcal NVO, but may be used in NVO due to Enterobacteriaceae and other susceptible aerobic gram-negative organisms; Linezolid 600 mg PO bid can be used in the initial course of NVO due to oxacillin-resistant staphylococci when first-line agents cannot be used; Levofloxacin 500–750 mg PO once daily is not recommended for use in patients with staphylococcal NVO as monotherapy but may be used in NVO due to Enterobacteriaceae and other susceptible aerobic gram-negative organisms; Ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg PO bid is not recommended for use in patients with staphylococcal NVO but may be used in NVO due to Enterobacteriaceae and other susceptible aerobic gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella species; Clindamycin 300–450 mg PO qid is recommended as second-line choice for sensitive staphylococcal NVO; Doxycycline and rifampin are mostly used in patients with brucellar NVO. Dosages need adjustment for renal and hepatic function, and antimicrobial selection should consider in vitro susceptibility, allergies, intolerances, and potential drug interactions or contraindications.

Nosocomial Pneumonia

Adult patients with clinically and radiologically documented nosocomial pneumonia were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, double-blind trial. Patients were treated for 7 to 21 days. One group received ZYVOX I.V. Injection 600 mg every 12 hours, and the other group received vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours intravenously. Both groups received concomitant aztreonam (1 to 2 g every 8 hours intravenously), which could be continued if clinically indicated. There were 203 linezolid-treated and 193 vancomycin-treated patients enrolled in the study. One hundred twenty-two (60%) linezolid-treated patients and 103 (53%) vancomycin-treated patients were clinically evaluable. The cure rates in clinically evaluable patients were 57% for linezolid-treated patients and 60% for vancomycin-treated patients. The cure rates in clinically evaluable patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia were 47% for linezolid-treated patients and 40% for vancomycin-treated patients. A modified intent-to-treat (MITT) analysis of 94 linezolid-treated patients and 83 vancomycin-treated patients included subjects who had a pathogen isolated before treatment. The cure rates in the MITT analysis were 57% in linezolid-treated patients and 46% in vancomycin-treated patients. The cure rates by pathogen for microbiologically evaluable patients are presented in Table 12.

### Linezolid versus vancomycin for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections [^03a3fe6a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Linezolid, the first available member of a new antibiotic class, the oxazolidinones, is broadly active against gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant strains. In this randomized, open-label trial, hospitalized adults with known or suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were treated with linezolid (600 mg twice daily; n = 240) or vancomycin (1 g twice daily; n = 220) for 7–28 days. S. aureus was isolated from 53% of patients; 93% of these isolates were MRSA. Skin and soft-tissue infection was the most common diagnosis, followed by pneumonia and urinary tract infection. At the test-of-cure visit (15–21 days after the end of therapy), among evaluable patients with MRSA, there was no statistical difference between the 2 treatment groups with respect to clinical cure rates (73.2% of patients in the linezolid group and 73.1% in the vancomycin group) or microbiological success rates (58.9% in the linezolid group and 63.2% in the vancomycin group). Both regimens were well tolerated, with similar rates of adverse events.

### Clinical experience with linezolid for the treatment of central nervous system infections [^be9ee0a5]. European Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, exhibits bacteriostatic activity against virtually all Gram-positive bacteria and even covers atypical organisms like mycobacteria and Nocardia. However, little is known about its effectiveness for central nervous system (CNS) infections. We report on our good experience with linezolid for the treatment of CNS infections in 10 patients, amongst whom three were caused by mycobacteria. While six of our patients clinically improved during linezolid therapy even after failure of various antibiotics, it was unsuccessful in one case. Side-effects were only mild gastrointestinal problems in one patient after long term-treatment, which however led to the cessation of therapy. Linezolid appears to be a safe alternative to vancomycin for therapy-resistant CNS infections because of its good CSF penetration and few side-effects.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — empiric gram-negative coverage and number of anti-Pseudomonas agents: The evidence indicated that approximately 35% of HAP cases are caused by gram-negative bacilli, and the panel agreed this dictates that all empiric regimens target P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli; the recommendation is strong despite the very low quality of evidence. Regarding whether to use one or 2 antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa, the panel concluded that HAP patients with factors increasing the likelihood of gram-negative infection, including Pseudomonas, or increased risk for mortality should receive antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa, whereas patients without these factors should receive only one such antibiotic. A high risk for mortality was defined as requiring ventilatory support due to pneumonia and having septic shock.

### Development and implementation of a performance improvement project in adult intensive care units: overview of the improving medicine through pathway assessment of critical therapy in hospital-acquired pneumonia (IMPACT-HAP) study [^7ea7683a]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with risk factors for MDROs were to receive expanded-spectrum combination therapy with dual gram-negative coverage and either linezolid or vancomycin as anti-MRSA therapy. Of the ATS/IDSA options for primary gram-negative coverage (antipseudomonal cephalosporin, antipseudomonal carbapenem, or β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor), centers chose the following three options: cefepime, imipenem or piperacillin-tazobactam. Of the ATS/IDSA options for secondary gram-negative coverage (antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside), most centers chose tobramycin or amikacin.

The intent of the IMPACT-HAP pathway (Figure 1) was to assist clinicians at the participating ICUs in recognizing the signs and symptoms of suspected nosocomial pneumonia and subsequently delivering antibiotics compliant with the ATS/IDSA guidelines as quickly as possible. Centers were permitted to adapt the consensus pathway based on their formulary and local susceptibility data determined by unit-specific antibiograms. Two centers had, as part of their educational tools, secondary gram-negative therapy for all patients with risk factors for MDROs and suspected HAP, VAP, or HCAP (see example in Additional file 1). Two centers reserved secondary gram-negative therapy for VAP only, on the basis of their local microbiology and the low risk of resistant gram-negative pathogens in patients not requiring mechanical ventilation. Although not in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, colistin was prospectively deemed an acceptable secondary gram-negative agent when carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter was of concern, as was the case in one ICU.

On Day 3, antibiotic therapy was to be discontinued in patients who met the criteria for short-course therapy as described by Singh and colleagues. Criteria for short-course therapy were clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) of ≤ 6 on days 0 and 3, and no sepsis, shock, or immunosuppression. De-escalation was to be considered on Day 3 if patients were not candidates for short-course therapy. Criteria for de-escalation were clinical improvement and cultures positive for a pathogen that allowed antibiotics to be narrowed or focused based on susceptibility. On Day 8, antibiotic therapy was to be discontinued if the patient had improved clinically and did not have cultures positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter spp. The total duration of antibiotics was not to exceed 14 days.

### Antimicrobial resistance to linezolid [^c67dc873]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Acquired resistance to linezolid, the first approved oxazolidinone, has been selected in laboratory experiments and has been observed in clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci. This resistance has typically been associated with single-nucleotide changes in varying numbers of copies of the genes encoding 23S ribosomal RNA. In the current environment of increasingly prevalent resistance to standard antibiotics, linezolid is an important drug because of its activity against a number of clinically significant gram-positive cocci, including multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. Although resistance to linezolid remains uncommon, the development of resistance by clinical isolates should prompt increased attention to susceptibility testing for this agent and should be taken into account in consideration of the therapeutic use of this drug.

### Bloodstream infections in hospitalized children: epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibilities [^fc4d85ca]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Bloodstream infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Much of our understanding of the epidemiology and resistance patterns of bloodstream infections comes from studies of hospitalized adults.

Methods

We evaluated the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of bloodstream infections occurring during an 11-year period in a large, tertiary care children's hospital in the US. All positive blood cultures were identified retrospectively from clinical microbiology laboratory records. We excluded repeat positive cultures with the same organism from the same patient within 30 days and polymicrobial infections.

Results

We identified 8196 unique episodes of monomicrobial bacteremia in 5508 patients. Overall, 46% were community onset, 72% were Gram-positive bacteria, 22% Gram-negative bacteria and 5% Candida spp. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus was the most common isolated organism. ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) accounted for 20% of episodes. No S. aureus isolate was resistant to vancomycin or linezolid, and no increase in vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration among methicillin-resistant S. aureus was observed during the study period. Clinically significant increases in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were not observed during the study period; however, rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus increased over time (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Gram-positive and ESKAPE organisms are leading causes of bacteremia in hospitalized children. Although antimicrobial resistance patterns were favorable compared with prior reports of hospitalized adults, multicenter studies with continuous surveillance are needed to identify trends in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in this setting.

Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Adult patients with clinically documented complicated skin and skin structure infections were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy trial comparing study medications administered intravenously followed by medications given orally for a total of 10 to 21 days of treatment. One group of patients received ZYVOX I.V. Injection 600 mg every 12 hours followed by ZYVOX Tablets 600 mg every 12 hours; the other group received oxacillin 2 g every 6 hours intravenously followed by dicloxacillin 500 mg every 6 hours orally. Patients could receive concomitant aztreonam if clinically indicated. There were 400 linezolid-treated and 419 oxacillin-treated patients enrolled in the study. Two hundred forty-five (61%) linezolid-treated patients and 242 (58%) oxacillin-treated patients were clinically evaluable. The cure rates in clinically evaluable patients were 90% in linezolid-treated patients and 85% in oxacillin-treated patients. A modified intent-to-treat (MITT) analysis of 316 linezolid-treated patients and 313 oxacillin-treated patients included subjects who met all criteria for study entry. The cure rates in the MITT analysis were 86% in linezolid-treated patients and 82% in oxacillin-treated patients. The cure rates by pathogen for microbiologically evaluable patients are presented in Table 13.

A separate study provided additional experience with the use of ZYVOX in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. This was a randomized, open-label trial in hospitalized adult patients with documented or suspected MRSA infection.

One group of patients received ZYVOX I.V. Injection 600 mg every 12 hours followed by ZYVOX Tablets 600 mg every 12 hours. The other group of patients received vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours intravenously. Both groups were treated for 7 to 28 days, and could receive concomitant aztreonam or gentamicin if clinically indicated. The cure rates in microbiologically evaluable patients with MRSA skin and skin structure infection were 26/33 (79%) for linezolid-treated patients and 24/33 (73%) for vancomycin-treated patients.

### Pediatric antimicrobial susceptibility trends across the United States [^9025d364]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns across US pediatric healthcare institutions are unknown. A national pooled pediatric antibiogram (1) identifies nationwide trends in antimicrobial resistance, (2) allows across-hospital benchmarking, and (3) provides guidance for empirical antimicrobial regimens for institutions unable to generate pediatric antibiograms.

Methods

In January 2012, a request for submission of pediatric antibiograms between 2005 and 2011 was sent to 233 US hospitals. A summary antibiogram was compiled from participating institutions to generate proportions of antimicrobial susceptibility. Temporal and regional comparisons were evaluated using χ(2) tests and logistic regression, respectively.

Results

Of 200 institutions (85%) responding to our survey, 78 (39%) reported generating pediatric antibiograms, and 55 (71%) submitted antibiograms. Carbapenems had the highest activity against the majority of gram-negative organisms tested, but no antibiotic had more than 90% activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Approximately 50% of all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant. Western hospitals had significantly lower proportions of S. aureus that were methicillin resistant compared with all other regions tested. Overall, 21% of S. aureus isolates had resistance to clindamycin. Among Enterococcus faecium isolates, the prevalence of susceptibility to ampicillin (25%) and vancomycin (45%) was low but improved over time (P < .01), and 8% of E. faecium isolates were resistant to linezolid. Southern hospitals reported significantly higher prevalence of E. faecium with susceptibilities to ampicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid compared with the other 3 regions (P < .01).

Conclusions

A pooled, pediatric antibiogram can identify nationwide antimicrobial resistance patterns for common pathogens and might serve as a useful tool for benchmarking resistance and informing national prescribing guidelines for children.

### Linezolid is the first of a new class of antibiotics… [^d7f07198]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

In response to the emergence of resistant bacteria, efforts are being made to develop antimicrobial agents that are active against these resistant organisms. The oxazolidinones are a new family of totally synthetic antimicrobials for which there are no preexisting resistance genes in bacteria. Moellering reviewed the activity and clinical use of linezolid, the first oxazolidinone approved for use in the United States. Linezolid exerts its antimicrobial effect by a unique mechanism of action that results in inhibition of bacterial ribosome assembly. Because no other known antimicrobial agent inhibits this process, there is no cross-resistance with other antibiotics. All major pathogenic gram-positive bacteria are sensitive to linezolid in vitro. The drug demonstrates in vitro activity against major strains of. Neisseria and borderline activity against Haemophilus influenzae, but it is inactive against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species.

Although linezolid has demonstrated activity against atypical organisms, including Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, more data are needed on its effectiveness against these organisms in vivo. Linezolid is currently approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for use in treating, among others, the following infections: vancomycinresistant. Enterococcus faecium infections, community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia caused by penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus, and skin infections caused by S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Because of lack of activity against H. influenzae, linezolid should not be considered a first-line drug for community-acquired pneumonia. Studies are being conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of linezolid in patients with endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and meningitis.

The author concludes that linezolid is useful against almost all of the important gram-positive organisms. It is effective in skin, respiratory, and systemic infections caused by susceptible organisms, but it should not be considered a first-or second-line therapy for community-acquired respiratory infections. Compared with vancomycin, linezolid may result in shorter hospital stays for patients with known or suspected methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections.

For localized infections, "Treatment with mupirocin ointment or oral antistaphylococcal antibiotic agents may be warranted", whereas "Oral antibiotic agents, such as the first-generation cephalosporins (eg, cephalexin or cefadroxil and penicillinase-resistant penicillins), are appropriate treatment options for more extensive but uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections". When community methicillin resistance is a concern, "Alternative antibiotic agents (ie, clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) may be more appropriate", and "Guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S aureus, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America, also suggest doxycycline or linezolid might also be appropriate". If an abscess develops, "surgical incision and drainage often are necessary", and after clinical resolution "An earring can be replaced, or the ear can be repierced 6 to 8 weeks after resolution of local swelling and tenderness".

Pharmacokinetic information generated in pediatric patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts showed variable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) linezolid concentrations following single and multiple dosing of linezolid; therapeutic concentrations were not consistently achieved or maintained in the CSF. Therefore, the use of linezolid for the empiric treatment of pediatric patients with central nervous system infections is not recommended.

### Linezolid-induced pancytopenia [^c3e07ab8]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Linezolid is a bacteriostatic antibiotic of the Oxazolidinone class; it works by inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis on bacterial ribosomes. Due to its excellent bioavailability after oral dosing, it has become an important tool in combating multi-drug-resistant bacteria including glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Side effects are multiple and potentially serious. We report the case of an 87-year-old man who developed pancytopenia secondary to a 6-week course of linezolid. Withdrawal of the antibiotic was decided as the treatment and resolution of the pancytopenia was evident within 2 weeks. Clinicians should be aware of this side effect of linezolid therapy and that weekly full blood count monitoring is paramount.

### Linezolid versus vancomycin or teicoplanin for nosocomial pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2712d862]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Compared with glycopeptides, linezolid achieves higher lung epithelial lining fluid concentrations, which may correlate with improved efficacy in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia. However, clinical superiority has not been demonstrated.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that linezolid may be superior to glycopeptides.

Methods

Prospective randomized trials that tested linezolid vs. vancomycin or teicoplanin for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia were included. Heterogeneity was analyzed by I(2) and Q statistics. Meta-analysis relative risks were based on fixed and random-effects models. Outcomes evaluated consisted of clinical cure, microbiological eradication, and side effects.

Results

Nine linezolid trials (vancomycin [7]; teicoplanin [2]) were included (n = 2329). The linezolid vs. glycopeptide analysis shows clinical cure relative risk of 1.01 (95% confidence interval, 0.93–1.10; p = .83; I(2) = 0%) and microbiological eradication relative risk of 1.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.22; p = .10; I(2) = 0%). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus subgroup analysis yielded a microbiological eradication relative risk of 1.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.87–1.38; p = .44; I(2) = 16%). If linezolid is compared with vancomycin only, then clinical cure relative risk is 1.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.12), microbiological eradication and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus relative risks are 1.07 (95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.26; p = .45) and 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.33; p = .71). The risks of thrombocytopenia (relative risk, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.30–2.87; p = .001) and gastrointestinal events (relative risk, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–3.70; p = .02) are higher with linezolid, but no differences are seen for renal dysfunction (relative risk, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–1.43; p = .64) or all-cause mortality (relative risk, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–1.18; p = .63).

Conclusions

Our study does not demonstrate clinical superiority of linezolid vs. glycopeptides for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia despite a statistical power of 95%. Linezolid shows a significant two-fold increase in the risk of thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal events. Vancomycin and teicoplanin are not associated with more renal dysfunction than linezolid.

Upon acquisition, resistance to carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, fluoroquinolones and amikacin was observed in 39 (37%), 19 (18%), 30 (29%), 29 (28%) and 1 (1%) strains, respectively.

The univariate analysis of the relationship between patient's characteristics or exposures and the acquisition of P. aeruginosa is shown in Table 2. Multivariate analysis selected shock, orotracheal intubation, enteral nutrition for ≤ 3 days, parenteral nutrition for ≤ 3 days, tracheostomy and colonization pressure > 0.43 as being independently associated with the acquisition of P. aeruginosa, whereas exposure to fluoroquinolones for > 3 days was protective. The complete model is shown in Table 3.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines: treatment of pulmonary exacerbations [^8e3d2762]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa treatment strategy in cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations: The standard approach to antibiotic treatment of P. aeruginosa in patients with CF has been to use two antipseudomonal drugs to enhance activity and reduce selection of resistant organisms, yet the use of combination antibiotic therapy with synergistic activity in vitro has not been shown to result in improved clinical outcomes; upon analysis, the committee determined that there remains insufficient evidence addressing this important question, and the trials did not demonstrate compelling evidence that the two therapies are equivalent or to support one therapy over the other; nevertheless, the Committee feels the comparison of monotherapy with combination therapy is a question worthy of further investigation, and although the Committee recognizes that the use of combination antibiotic therapy has not been validated in the treatment of CF lung infections, the standard of care has been to use combination antibiotics as treatment of P. aeruginosa.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) empiric antibiotic coverage — scope and thresholds: When local resistance resembles surveillance benchmarks, "empiric coverage should include an agent active against MRSA and at least 2 agents active against gram-negative organisms, including P. aeruginosa", whereas if local data indicate "a low prevalence of MRSA and low antibiotic resistance rates among gram-negatives", "a single agent active against MSSA combined with one agent active against Pseudomonas and other gram-negatives is likely adequate". Empiric choices "should be informed by patient-specific risk factors" and "Not all patients require maximal empiric coverage", and "Narrower-spectrum coverage may be appropriate" when risk factors and local prevalence are low. For threshold guidance, "The panel suggests that ICU-level S. aureus methicillin resistance rates of > 10%–20% merit selecting a gram-positive agent active against MRSA, and that ICU-level gram-negative resistance rates of > 10% to an agent being considered for empiric gram-negative monotherapy merit using 2 gram-negative agents for empiric therapy of suspected VAP". If calculating local rates is difficult, "the resistance rate for Pseudomonas is a reasonable, albeit conservative, proxy because Pseudomonas is the most common gram-negative organism associated with VAP".

### Should linezolid replace clindamycin as the adjunctive antimicrobial of choice in group A streptococcal necrotizing soft tissue infection and toxic shock syndrome? A focused debate [^58ac086c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Group A Streptococcus (GAS) necrotizing soft tissue infections and toxic shock syndrome remain high-mortality conditions. In vitro and animal model data, as well as multiple observational studies, suggest adjunctive clindamycin (ie, given with a beta-lactam) reduces invasive GAS infection mortality by inhibiting exotoxin production. Unfortunately, clindamycin resistance in GAS has been rapidly increasing in the United States since the mid-2010s, although the clinical significance of this remains unclear. Linezolid is a promising alternative adjunctive agent to which US GAS isolates remain near-universally susceptible, with a similar mechanism of action and similar in vitro evidence of GAS virulence factor attenuation. However, the clinical data supporting linezolid's value in severe GAS infections are far more limited. Here the authors review the data and reasoning behind a general preference for clindamycin or linezolid in a focused, pro-con debate format.

### How do I manage difficult-to-treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections? Key questions for today's clinicians [^29653b5a]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a remarkable ability to develop resistance to antimicrobials in vivo, often leaving very limited therapeutic options and making treatment particularly challenging. In fact, P. aeruginosa infections with "difficult-to-treat resistance" are one of the most concerning contemporary bacterial infections. Many are hospital-acquired and frequently affect immunocompromised patients with high mortality risk.

Objectives

In the absence of head-to-head clinical trials, we have conducted a narrative review of the current therapeutic options for these infections addressing five key management questions.

Content and Implications

Ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam and cefiderocol are newer options, but resistance and lack of relevant data from randomised clinical trials hampers knowledge of the best way to use them. Ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam are initially preferred when susceptible because they enter the market first and there is more published evidence about them. Ceftolozane-tazobactam is preferred in P. aeruginosa pneumonia instead of ceftazidime-avibactam. Both can be equally used in other P. aeruginosa infection types. Imipenem-relebactam and cefiderocol may retain susceptibility when there is resistance to ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam, and when metallo-beta-lactamases are not present. However, there are no head-to-head comparative studies to support a preference for one over the other. In the presence of metallo-beta-lactamases, cefiderocol is the preferred agent. Other options in this situation are aztreonam-avibactam, ceftazidime-avibactam combined with aztreonam, and polymyxins combined with meropenem, but evidence is small. In difficult-to-treat P. aeruginosa infections combination therapy could be an option. However, despite demonstrations of in vitro synergy and of enhanced activity in hollow fiber or animal models, there is no clinical evidence to support using combination therapy in these infections and it is not currently recommended as a general option. The role of older antibiotics such as fosfomycin, polymyxin B or colistin, is also reviewed.

### Oxazolidinone antibiotics [^35048e33]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Many common gram-positive pathogens (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents, and new drugs with activity against gram-positive bacteria are urgently needed. The oxazolidinones, a new chemical class of synthetic antimicrobial agent, have a unique mechanism of inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Linezolid, the first oxazolidinone to be approved for clinical use, displays in-vitro activity (generally bacteriostatic) against many important resistant pathogens, including meticillin-resistant Staph aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant Strep pneumoniae. Linezolid is a parenteral agent that also possesses near-complete oral bioavailability plus favourable pharmacokinetic and toxic effect profiles. Clinical trials confirm the activity of linezolid in the setting of pneumonia, skin and soft-tissue infections, and infections due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Linezolid shows promise as an alternative to glycopeptides and streptogramins to treat serious infections due to resistant gram-positive organisms. New agents with greater potency and new spectra of activity could arise from further modification of the oxazolidinone nucleus.

### Risk of target non-attainment in obese compared to non-obese patients in calculated linezolid therapy [^5702c990]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim was to characterize linezolid population pharmacokinetics in plasma and interstitial space fluid of subcutaneous adipose tissue (target site) of obese compared with non-obese patients and to determine dosing regimens enabling adequate therapy using Monte Carlo simulations.

Methods

In this prospective, parallel group, open-label, controlled, single-centre trial, 30 surgery patients (15 obese, 15 non-obese) received 600 mg of intravenous linezolid. A population pharmacokinetic analysis characterizing plasma and microdialysis-derived target site pharmacokinetics was followed by Monte Carlo simulations using twice/thrice daily 600–1200 mg short-term and extended infusions of linezolid. Adequacy of therapy was assessed by the probability of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment for time and exposure-related indices.

Results

In the model, lean body weight and obesity status largely explained between-patient variability in linezolid PK parameters (12.0–44.9%). Both factors caused lower area under the concentration-time curve in typical obese patients in plasma (-20.4%, 95% CI -22.0% to -15.9%) and at target-site (-37.7%, 95% CI -47.1% to -24.2%) compared with non-obese patients. Probability of target attainment showed improvement with increasing linezolid doses. Depending on lean body weight, adequate therapy was partially attained for 900- and 1200-mg linezolid doses and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ≤ 2 mg/L (probability of target attainment 62.5–100%) but could not be reached for MIC = 4 mg/L (probability of target attainment ≤ 82.3%). Additionally, lower linezolid distribution into the target site in obese patients as described above might compromise the plasma-based probability of target attainment analysis.

Discussion

This analysis revealed risks of linezolid underdosing in empirical antibiotic therapy of most resistant bacteria for obese and non-obese patients. Doubling the standard dose is associated with adequate probability of target attainment throughout most body masses for MIC ≤ 2 mg/L. Further clinical studies with adjusted dosing regimens in for example intensive care patients are needed.

### Rational approach in the management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections [^a109aff0]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review details the management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections covering both current and future treatment options that are and may be available for the clinicians.

Recent Findings

Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are a great concern in hospital-acquired infections with very limited therapeutic options. The increasing antibiotic resistance has led to a need for different treatment choices that range from the use of new antibiotics to new nonantibiotic alternative agents to kill or disarm the pathogen.

Summary

New molecules such as ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, and imipenem-relebactam have shown an adequate activity against P. aeruginosa, especially against multidrug resistance strains. Other nonantibiotic alternative treatments, such as antibodies, bacteriocins or phage therapy, have shown promising results, but future clinical studies are needed.

### Linezolid for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections in children [^4022e137]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Gram-positive pathogens are a major cause of complicated skin and skin structure infections (CSSSIs) in children. Many pathogens are developing decreased susceptibility to currently used antibiotics, increasing the need for new therapies. Linezolid is well-tolerated and effective in the treatment of these infections in adults.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of iv/oral linezolid and iv vancomycin in children with Gram-positive CSSSIs.

Methods

Hospitalized children < 12 years of age were randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive either linezolid 10 mg/kg iv every 8 h (with the option to change treatment to oral linezolid suspension 10 mg/kg every 8 h) or iv vancomycin 10 to 15 mg/kg every 6 to 24 h (according to age). Clinical response, tolerance and safety were evaluated at follow-up. The results of a subset analysis of patients with CSSSIs are presented here.

Results

One hundred twenty intent-to-treat patients (linezolid 80, vancomycin 40) with CSSSI were included in this analysis. Clinical cure rates for clinically evaluable patients with CSSSI did not differ between treatment groups (linezolid, 93.2% vs. vancomycin, 90.0%; P = 0.594). Significantly fewer linezolid-treated patients experienced drug-related adverse events than did vancomycin-treated patients (23% vs. 48%; P = 0.006). The percentages of patients with laboratory abnormalities, including selected hematologic parameters, were generally low and similar between the treatment groups.

Conclusions

Linezolid given iv or orally was well-tolerated and safe. It was as effective as vancomycin in treating children with Gram-positive CSSSIs.
