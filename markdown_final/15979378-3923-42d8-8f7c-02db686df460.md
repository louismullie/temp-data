## Question

Should you take calcium while on biphospates

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether calcium should be taken with bisphosphonates, including how to dose, how to time it, and what exceptions apply. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we're dealing with osteoporosis treatment, oncology-related bone protection, or hypercalcemia of malignancy. Then, I should verify guideline recommendations for calcium and vitamin D co-administration. Next, I will check for hypocalcemia risk and baseline labs. After that, I need to review drug–drug interactions and correct timing for oral bisphosphonates. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring, and a practical, safety-focused plan with dosing targets and adherence strategies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts because the answer differs slightly: osteoporosis treatment, adjuvant bone protection in breast cancer or aromatase inhibitor therapy, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, and hypercalcemia of malignancy all use bisphosphonates but with different goals and monitoring needs, so I need to ensure I'm framing the recommendation correctly for each scenario.

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. Hold on, let me verify the consensus: multiple high-credibility sources recommend that patients on bisphosphonates should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D unless contraindicated, with NCCN specifying daily calcium 1200–1500 mg and vitamin D3 400–800 IU in oncology settings, ASCO-OH recommending supplementation unless otherwise contraindicated, and the Endocrine Society advising calcium and vitamin D as adjuncts to osteoporosis therapies in postmenopausal women [^111MBkTF] [^111BaDZw] [^114VpDcu].

> I need to check the rationale carefully. Bisphosphonates suppress osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, which can unmask or worsen hypocalcemia, especially in patients with vitamin D deficiency, renal impairment, or high bone turnover states; thus, ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D mitigates hypocalcemia risk and supports mineralization during antiresorptive therapy, and this is explicitly emphasized in FDA labeling for alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate [^116xkso3] [^115MP3c8] [^113egzks].

> Wait, let me verify the timing because this is where errors often occur. For oral bisphosphonates, calcium-containing supplements and antacids can bind and impair absorption; therefore, patients should take the bisphosphonate first thing in the morning with a full glass of water, remain upright for 30–60 minutes, and then wait at least 60 minutes before taking calcium or other oral medications; some monographs suggest a 2-hour separation, but 60 minutes is the minimum consistent with FDA labeling for ibandronate and standard counseling for alendronate and risedronate, so I should anchor to that 60-minute minimum and extend to 2 hours if feasible for optimal absorption [^1114zwd8] [^1156o7Am] [^111BaDZw].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing targets and reconcile them with safety. Total daily calcium intake of about 1000–1200 mg is reasonable for most adults, with NCCN allowing 1200–1500 mg in oncology cohorts; vitamin D is typically 400–800 IU/day, but I need to ensure 25-hydroxyvitamin D is sufficient, generally aiming for at least 20 ng/mL and preferably 30 ng/mL, because deficiency increases hypocalcemia risk and reduces bisphosphonate effectiveness; I should also remember that calcium absorption is better when divided into doses of 500 mg or less, and that high total calcium intake, especially above 2000–2500 mg/day, may increase nephrolithiasis risk, so I should tailor to diet and avoid over-supplementation [^111MBkTF] [^113BDzPM] [^1117yH8D] [^114xKJik].

> I should confirm baseline assessment before starting therapy. Serum calcium, preferably albumin-corrected or ionized, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be measured, and any hypocalcemia or vitamin D deficiency corrected prior to initiating bisphosphonates; in patients at high risk of hypocalcemia, such as those with renal insufficiency, osteoblastic metastases, or on androgen deprivation, prophylactic calcium and vitamin D started a few days to a week early is prudent, and some labels advise rechecking calcium within about 2 weeks after the first dose in high-risk patients [^111BaDZw] [^111w78wp] [^112tRqhY].

> But wait, what about special populations and exceptions. In oncology, particularly with zoledronic acid, hypocalcemia is more common, so ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D and monitoring calcium is especially important; in CKD, I need to be cautious because calcium-phosphate-PTH abnormalities complicate management, and bisphosphonates may be contraindicated or require dose adjustment and specialist input; in primary hyperparathyroidism, bisphosphonates can be used to improve BMD, but calcium intake should follow general guidelines and not be restricted unless there is a compelling reason; in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, calcium and vitamin D are foundational, with antiresorptives added based on risk [^11167t9D] [^116Q8y6N] [^113LsBWi] [^1112Bbk5].

> I will now examine adherence and formulation choices because they materially affect outcomes. Calcium carbonate is economical but more constipating and gas-forming, whereas calcium citrate is better tolerated and can be taken without food, which may help with adherence; dividing doses to 500 mg or less improves absorption; for vitamin D, weekly or biweekly dosing can improve adherence compared with daily dosing; I should double-check that the patient understands the timing separation from oral bisphosphonates to avoid chelation and reduced absorption [^111csVmY] [^114xKJik] [^1114zwd8].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and ensure I'm not missing a contraindication. Yes, calcium should be taken with bisphosphonates in most patients, but not at the same time for oral agents; correct hypocalcemia and vitamin D deficiency first, target total calcium around 1000–1200 mg/day with vitamin D 400–800 IU/day while adjusting to diet, separate calcium by at least 60 minutes after the oral bisphosphonate, monitor calcium periodically especially in high-risk patients, and individualize in CKD or hypercalcemic states; if hypercalcemia of malignancy is the indication, the goal is to lower calcium with IV bisphosphonate or denosumab, and calcium is generally withheld initially until calcium normalizes, which is a different scenario altogether [^111BaDZw] [^111MBkTF] [^114bM9tf] [^112iiP6s].

---

Patients on bisphosphonates should **take calcium and vitamin D** unless contraindicated, as bisphosphonates can cause or worsen hypocalcemia [^116xkso3] [^113egzks]. Calcium and vitamin D are **recommended for all patients** receiving bisphosphonates, with typical targets of 1,000–1,200 mg/day of elemental calcium and 800–1,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 [^111MBkTF] [^114VpDcu]. For oral bisphosphonates, take calcium at least 30–60 minutes after the dose to avoid absorption interference [^1114zwd8]; for IV bisphosphonates, calcium can be taken at any time. Monitor serum calcium before starting and periodically during therapy, especially in patients with renal impairment or high bone turnover [^111BaDZw] [^112tRqhY].

---

## Clinical rationale for calcium supplementation

Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, which can lower serum calcium and cause or worsen hypocalcemia, particularly in patients with vitamin D deficiency, renal impairment, or high bone turnover (e.g. Paget's disease, malignancy) [^112tRqhY] [^113egzks]. Hypocalcemia is a known adverse effect of bisphosphonates and can be severe if not recognized and treated [^116xkso3] [^115MP3c8]. Calcium supplementation helps **maintain normal serum calcium**, supports bone mineralization, and reduces the risk of hypocalcemia-related symptoms (muscle cramps, paresthesia, tetany, cardiac arrhythmias) [^112iiP6s] [^115yVtn7] [^111w78wp].

---

## Recommended calcium intake

Current guidelines recommend a **total daily calcium intake** (diet plus supplements) of 1,000–1,200 mg for most adults, with 1,200–1,500 mg/day for older adults, particularly women over 50 and men over 70 [^1117yH8D] [^114xKJik]. For patients on bisphosphonates, calcium supplementation is advised to ensure adequate intake, especially when dietary sources are insufficient [^111BaDZw] [^115SMhze].

---

## Timing and administration of calcium with bisphosphonates

The timing of calcium intake relative to bisphosphonate dosing is important to avoid **absorption interference**:

- **Oral bisphosphonates**: Calcium supplements should be taken at least 30–60 minutes after the bisphosphonate dose to prevent binding and reduced absorption [^1114zwd8] [^111PJPLV].

- **Intravenous bisphosphonates**: Calcium supplements can be taken at any time, as IV administration bypasses the gastrointestinal tract.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Multiple guidelines emphasize the importance of calcium and vitamin D supplementation with bisphosphonate therapy:

- **NCCN guidelines**: Recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation for patients receiving bisphosphonates, with typical doses of 1,200–1,500 mg/day of calcium and 400–800 IU/day of vitamin D3 [^111MBkTF] [^115SMhze].

- **ASCO-OH guidelines**: Recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation unless contraindicated, with serum calcium monitoring before and during therapy [^111BaDZw].

- **Endocrine Society**: Recommends calcium and vitamin D as adjuncts to osteoporosis therapies, including bisphosphonates [^114VpDcu] [^113a1955].

---

## Risks and considerations

While calcium supplementation is generally safe, certain risks and considerations should be noted:

- **Hypercalcemia**: Excessive calcium intake can cause hypercalcemia, particularly in patients with renal impairment or hyperparathyroidism [^notfound].

- **Kidney stones**: High calcium intake may increase the risk of kidney stones, especially in predisposed individuals [^1117yH8D].

- **Drug interactions**: Calcium supplements can interact with other medications, such as tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, reducing their absorption [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and individualized care

Patients on bisphosphonates should have **serum calcium monitored** before starting therapy and periodically thereafter, especially in those with renal impairment, vitamin D deficiency, or high bone turnover [^111BaDZw] [^112tRqhY]. Individualized calcium supplementation should consider dietary intake, comorbidities, and concurrent medications [^115eq3eW].

---

Patients on bisphosphonates should **take calcium and vitamin D** to prevent hypocalcemia and support bone health, with typical targets of 1,000–1,200 mg/day of calcium and 800–1,000 IU/day of vitamin D3. Calcium should be timed to avoid interference with oral bisphosphonate absorption, and serum calcium should be monitored regularly [^1123vJ4h] [^111BaDZw].

### Bisphosphonates in the treatment of osteoporosis [^112Zb89u]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis to reduce fracture risk. Because of their long retention time in bone and uncommon side effects, questions have been raised about the optimal duration of therapy. Potential side effects appear to be rare and may not be causally related. Although there is no strong science to guide "drug holidays", there appears to be some lingering antifracture benefit when treatment is stopped, so some time off treatment should be offered to most patients on long-term bisphosphonate therapy. For most patients with osteoporosis, the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.

### Emerging issues with bisphosphonates [^113ei3qk]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are the most commonly used agents in the management of metabolic bones diseases. Despite their established therapeutic value, a number of points of uncertainty remain, particularly in connection with their optimal long-term use. It is likely that definitive clinical trial data will not become available to resolve these questions, so careful clinical observation and caution are needed in patients who require treatment over periods of more than 10 years.

5.3 Mineral Metabolism

Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking risedronate sodium tablets. Treat hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting risedronate sodium tablets therapy. Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients, especially in patients with Paget's disease in whom bone turnover is significantly elevated [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Information for Patients (17.1)].

5.4 Jaw Osteonecrosis

Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including risedronate sodium tablets. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (for example, tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (for example, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (for example, periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates.

For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment.

Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain

In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain in patients taking bisphosphonates [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping medication. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Consider discontinuing use if severe symptoms develop.

Bisphosphonates use — dosing frequency, supplementation, administration, and monitoring are described as follows: In trials, the rate of SREs in the 4‑week versus 12‑week arms was 29.5% versus 28.6% and 22% versus 23.2%, and the NCCN Panel recommends an optimal dosing of every 12 weeks. The use of bisphosphonates should be accompanied by calcium and vitamin D supplementation with daily doses of calcium of 1200 to 1500 mg and vitamin D3 of 400 to 800 IU. Recommended agents are pamidronate 90 mg intravenously over 2 hours or zoledronic acid 4 mg intravenously over 15 minutes. The original studies continued treatment for up to 24 months, current clinical trial results support use for up to 2 years, and the risk of renal toxicity necessitates monitoring of serum creatinine prior to each dose with dose reduction or discontinuation if renal function is reduced; longer durations may provide additional benefit, but this has not yet been tested in clinical trials.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^114VpDcu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Calcium and vitamin D — treatment positioning in postmenopausal osteoporosis states the following: In postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density (BMD) and at high risk of fractures with osteoporosis, "we suggest that calcium and vitamin D be used as an adjunct to osteoporosis therapies". For those at high fracture risk who "cannot tolerate bisphosphonates, estrogen, selective estrogen response modulators, denosumab, tibolone, teriparatide, and abaloparatide, we recommend daily calcium and vitamin D supplementation to prevent hip fractures".

### NCCN bone health task force: key recommendations [^115w7DNA]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2014). Low credibility.

For patients with advanced cancers involving bone, the standard of care for maintaining bone health is the use of antiresorptive therapies such as bisphosphonates, selective estrogen-receptor modulators, and denosumab. However, although long-term adverse events are rare and the risk-benefit ratio of these agents is usually markedly in favor of treatment, clinicians should be aware that they can occur. At the NCCN 19th Annual Conference, Dr. Azeez Farooki presented the key findings of the NCCN Bone Health Task Force, focusing on such topics as screening for osteoporosis; the controversial use of drug holidays from chronic bisphosphonate therapy; the provocative yet unclear story surrounding the potential anticancer benefits of antiresorptive agents; imaging for metastatic bone disease; and safety considerations linked to calcium supplements, vitamin D, and bone-strengthening agents.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11167t9D]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Treatment regimens for hypercalcemia of malignancy — intravenous bisphosphonates include pamidronate and zoledronic acid. Pamidronate is given 60 to 90 mg IV over 2 to 24 hours and can be repeated every 2 to 3 weeks; effects last 7 to 14 days and may last 2 to 4 weeks, and it normalizes calcium in 60% to 70% of patients, with adverse events including acute-phase response, hypocalcemia, possible renal insufficiency if decreased glomerular filtration rate, and rare atypical femoral fractures/ONJ. Zoledronic acid is dosed 3 to 4 mg IV over 15 to 30 minutes, can be repeated in 7 days if desirable calcium level not achieved and every 3 to 4 weeks thereafter, yields 4 to 6 weeks of effect and normalizes calcium in 80% to 90% of patients, but may cause kidney damage especially if glomerular filtration rate < 30 to 35 mL/ minute and requires dose adjustment if glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min with administration over 30 to 60 minutes.

### Alendronate sodium [^115eq3eW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.7 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation

Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium if dietary intake is inadequate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home-bound, or chronically ill) may need vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered.

Patients treated with glucocorticoids should receive adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D.

2.8 Administration Instructions for Missed Doses

If a once-weekly dose of alendronate sodium tablets is missed, instruct patients to take one dose on the morning after they remember. They should not take two doses on the same day but should return to taking one dose once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.

### Calcium builds strong bones, and more is better – correct? Well, maybe not [^114RuMPD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Calcium supplementation has been considered the gold standard therapy for osteoporosis in the general population. It is given in both the placebo and treatment groups of trials evaluating antifracture efficacy of new therapies. Similarly, calcium-based phosphate binders have been considered the gold standard comparator for all new phosphate binders. However, large randomized trials demonstrate conflicting data on the antifracture efficacy of calcium supplementation, particularly in high doses, in patients with osteoporosis without CKD. In addition, recent data suggest an increased risk for cardiovascular events. These new studies raise safety concerns for the general approach with calcium supplementation and binders. This review describes recent data on the adverse effects of calcium supplementation for osteoporosis and how these new data should affect the strategy for phosphate binder use in CKD.

### The good and the bad about the 2017 American College of Physicians osteoporosis guidelines [^116GXSDb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The American College of Physicians (ACP) published a set of guidelines on how to prevent fractures in men and women with low bone density or osteoporosis. As the population ages, the overall risk of fractures increases, thus burdening the health care system. These guidelines review current evidence for osteoporosis management, providing an update to the previous 2008 ACP's guidelines.

Methods

The ACP put forth 6 recommendations addressing the complexities in osteoporosis management based on evidence available through October 2016 with a focus on bisphosphonates, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen. Evidence was graded according to recommended strength by using the ACP standard methods.

Findings

The ACP recommends anti-osteoporosis therapy with 1 of 3 bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronic acid) or denosumab in patients with osteoporosis, while excluding anabolic therapies, and recommends against raloxifene. Although bisphosphonates are the mainstay of treatment, anabolic therapy and raloxifene may be used in specific situations. Pharmacologic therapy is recommended for 5 years, oversimplifying length of therapy and failing to promote an individualized patient-centered care approach. Moreover, abrupt discontinuation of denosumab is associated with a decline in bone mineral density (BMD), which must be addressed. Routine monitoring of BMD by dual x-ray absorptiometry is not endorsed during treatment, which leads to underrecognition of management issues. Pharmacologic treatment with bisphosphonates for male osteoporosis is recommended, although therapies such as denosumab and teriparatide are excluded. Finally, the ACP recommends treatment for women aged ≥ 65 years at high risk for fracture with osteopenia after a discussion of patient preferences, fracture risk profile, and medications.

Implications

Osteoporosis management is complex. The 2017 ACP guidelines address challenges faced by clinicians but oversimplify more complex issues. These are among a number of guidelines that are available for osteoporosis management, which may be used in combination with other sources to assist clinicians with diagnostic and management strategies.

2. Low calcium levels in your blood (hypocalcemia).

BINOSTO may lower the calcium levels in your blood. If you have low blood calcium before you start taking BINOSTO, it may get worse during treatment. Your low blood calcium must be treated before you take BINOSTO. Most people with low blood calcium levels do not have symptoms, but some people may have symptoms. Call your doctor right away if you have symptoms of low blood calcium such as:

### Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116aaDHq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Clinical considerations for pharmacologic management — Clinicians should prescribe generic medications if possible rather than more expensive brand-name medications. Clinicians treating postmenopausal females with osteoporosis should encourage adherence to recommended drug treatments and healthy lifestyle modifications, including exercise, and counseling for evaluation and prevention of falls. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake should be part of fracture prevention in all postmenopausal females with low bone mass or osteoporosis. Clinicians should assess baseline risk for fracture based on individualized assessment of bone density, history of fractures, response to prior treatments for osteoporosis, and multiple risk factors for fractures in postmenopausal females with primary osteoporosis. Current evidence suggests that increasing the duration of bisphosphonate therapy to longer than 5 years probably reduced risk for new vertebral fractures but not risk for other fractures at the expense of increased risk for long-term harms. Therefore, clinicians should consider stopping bisphosphonate treatment after 5 years unless the patient has a strong indication for treatment continuation. The decision of a temporary treatment discontinuation (holidays) should be individualized and based on baseline risk for fractures, type of medication and its half-life in bone, duration of discontinuation, benefits and harms of discontinuation, and higher risk for fracture due to drug discontinuation. Females initially treated with an anabolic agent should be offered an antiresorptive agent after discontinuation to preserve gains and because of serious risk for rebound and multiple vertebral fractures. Older postmenopausal females with primary osteoporosis or low bone mass are at increased risk for falls and other adverse events due to polypharmacy and drug interactions need individualized treatment selection based on comorbidities and concomitant medications associated with higher risk for falls/fractures.

### Short-term and long-term effects of osteoporosis therapies [^114CjqSN]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Progress continues to be made in the development of therapeutics for fracture prevention. Bisphosphonates are now available orally and intravenously, often as inexpensive generics, and remain the most widely used interventions for osteoporosis. The major safety concern associated with the use of bisphosphonates is the development of femoral shaft stress fractures and, although rare, this adverse event affords the principal rationale for restricting bisphosphonate therapy to those individuals with femoral T-scores < -2.5, and for providing drug holidays in those individuals requiring therapy for > 5 years. Newer antiresorptive therapies, in the form of denosumab and cathepsin K inhibitors, might increase efficacy and possibly circumvent some of the safety concerns associated with bisphosphonate use (for example, gastrointestinal and renal complications). The combination of teriparatide with antiresorptives markedly increases effects on BMD; new anabolic agents are also very promising in this regard. However, whether or not these changes in BMD translate into improved efficacy of fracture prevention remains to be determined. Vitamin D is important for the prevention of osteomalacia, but does not influence BMD or fracture risk in patients not deficient in vitamin D. The balance of risks and benefits of calcium supplementation is contentious, but patients should be encouraged to adhere to a balanced diet aimed at maintaining a healthy body weight. Consideration of a patient's risk of falling, and its mitigation, are also important. In this Review, I summarize the short-term and long-term effects of osteoporosis therapies.

Breast cancer — Bone health during adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy — The panel discourages the selective ER modulators to treat osteoporosis or osteopenia in patients with breast cancer, whereas the use of a bisphosphonate (oral/IV) or denosumab is recommended to maintain or to improve bone mineral density and reduce risk of fractures in postmenopausal (natural or induced) patients receiving adjuvant AI therapy. Optimal duration of either therapy has not been established and the optimal duration and benefits beyond 3 years is not known; there are case reports of spontaneous fractures after denosumab discontinuation. Patients treated with bisphosphonates or denosumab should undergo a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of therapy, and should take supplemental calcium and vitamin D.

Applicability of study findings indicates that most studies enrolled adults at high risk for fracture with heterogeneous baseline risk definitions due to different scoring scales and differing proportions with prior vertebral fractures; primary studies did not consistently report prior treatment response, although most allowed previous bisphosphonate treatments; only bisphosphonates have been tested as first-line treatment in treatment‑naive patients; enrolled adults were already taking vitamin D, calcium, or both; most studies included females and a very small number of males, and few RCTs assessed the effect of zoledronic acid in males with osteoporosis.

### A comprehensive approach to fragility fractures [^115iZCER]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2011). Low credibility.

To address the cause of fragility fractures, an understanding of the determinants of bone strength is needed. Identifying patients at increased fracture risk should take into account bone quantity, quality, and turnover. Postmenopausal osteoporosis remains the most common derangement of bone strength; however, decreased bone strength can also result from secondary causes of osteoporosis. In order to properly manage patients with fragility fractures, assessment should include a focused medical history and physical examination, proper laboratory investigation, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry screening, and, if necessary, use of the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX). Treatment options will include nonpharmacologic treatment such as calcium and vitamin D and pharmacologic treatment with antiresorptive or anabolic agents to prevent future fractures. Bisphosphonates remain the standard treatment for osteoporosis. Concerns of oversuppression of bone turnover on long-term bisphosphonate treatment can be addressed with a drug holiday depending on the patient's fracture risk. An anabolic agent such as teriparatide is a powerful tool for the prevention of fragility fractures and should be reserved for patients at high risk for fracture, such as those with declining bone mineral density despite bisphosphonate treatment. Careful evaluation of all patients with a fragility fracture will enable the orthopaedic surgeon to identify the cause of fracture and implement a treatment plan that can prevent subsequent fractures in this vulnerable population.

### Efficacy, effectiveness and side effects of medications used to prevent fractures [^112DQKB8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There is an increasing number of effective therapies for fracture prevention in adults at risk of osteoporosis. However, shortcomings in the evidence underpinning our management of osteoporosis still exist. Evidence of antifracture efficacy in the groups of patients who most commonly use calcium and vitamin D supplements is lacking, the safety of calcium supplements is in doubt, and the safety and efficacy of high doses of vitamin D give cause for concern. Alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate and denosumab have been shown to prevent spine, nonspine and hip fractures; in addition, teriparatide and strontium ranelate prevent both spine and nonspine fractures, and raloxifene and ibandronate prevent spine fractures. However, most trials provide little information regarding long-term efficacy or safety. A particular concern at present is the possibility that oral bisphosphonates might cause atypical femoral fractures. Observational data suggest that the incidence of this type of fracture increases steeply with duration of bisphosphonate use, resulting in concern that the benefit-risk balance may become negative in the long term, particularly in patients in whom the osteoporotic fracture risk is not high. Therefore, reappraisal of ongoing use of bisphosphonates after about 5 years is endorsed by expert consensus, and 'drug holidays' should be considered at this time. Further studies are needed to guide clinical practice in this area.

### The relationship between bisphosphonate adherence and fracture: is it the behavior or the medication? Results from the placebo arm of the fracture intervention trial [^112Fiw3p]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population

The FIT was a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 6469 women randomized to alendronate versus placebo. The FIT-I and FIT-II cohorts included women with low bone mass (defined as a T -score of less than −1.6 at the femoral neck) with and without existing vertebral fracture at baseline, respectively. Data from both groups of women were pooled for this analysis given comparable compliance to study medication in the two cohorts. Daily calcium intake was estimated by food-frequency questionnaire, and participants in both groups who had calcium intakes of less than 1000 mg were given a daily supplement providing 500 mg of elemental calcium (as the carbonate salt) and 250 IU of cholecalciferol (vitamin D). About 82% of participants received the supplement at the randomization visit.

Ascertainment of compliance and fracture outcomes

Compliance in FIT was evaluated using daily patient diaries and pill counts returned at annual study visits, which had excellent agreement with one another. Although compliance therefore was defined as a continuous variable ranging from 0% to 100%, women were defined as having high compliance in this analysis if they took 80% or more of dispensed medication, following prior conventions. Fractures were confirmed centrally through review of medical records, as per the FIT protocol.

### Calcium and vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis-a clinical update [^1123vJ4h]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation is an essential component of the management of osteoporosis, supported by a strong scientific rationale. The types of individuals who should receive calcium and vitamin D supplements are those: (i) patients with documented osteoporosis receiving antiresorptive or anabolic treatment; (ii) patients receiving glucocorticoids; and (iii) individuals with or at high risk of calcium and/or vitamin D insufficiencies, in particular older women and men. This article describes the evidence base that supports targeting these groups. Benefits are most apparent when 800 IU day(-1) vitamin D is complemented with a dose of 1000–1200 mg day(-1) elemental calcium. Compliance is also key to optimizing clinical efficacy.

### 2017 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis [^1112Bbk5]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop recommendations for prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review to synthesize the evidence for the benefits and harms of GIOP prevention and treatment options. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to rate the quality of evidence. We used a group consensus process to determine the final recommendations and grade their strength. The guideline addresses initial assessment and reassessment in patients beginning or continuing long-term (≥ 3 months) glucocorticoid (GC) treatment, as well as the relative benefits and harms of lifestyle modification and of calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonate, raloxifene, teriparatide, and denosumab treatment in the general adult population receiving long-term GC treatment, as well as in special populations of long-term GC users.

Results

Because of limited evidence regarding the benefits and harms of interventions in GC users, most recommendations in this guideline are conditional (uncertain balance between benefits and harms). Recommendations include treating only with calcium and vitamin D in adults at low fracture risk, treating with calcium and vitamin D plus an additional osteoporosis medication (oral bisphosphonate preferred) in adults at moderate-to-high fracture risk, continuing calcium plus vitamin D but switching from an oral bisphosphonate to another antifracture medication in adults in whom oral bisphosphonate treatment is not appropriate, and continuing oral bisphosphonate treatment or switching to another antifracture medication in adults who complete a planned oral bisphosphonate regimen but continue to receive GC treatment. Recommendations for special populations, including children, people with organ transplants, women of childbearing potential, and people receiving very high-dose GC treatment, are also made.

Conclusion

This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making treatment decisions. Clinicians and patients should use a shared decision-making process that accounts for patients' values, preferences, and comorbidities. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.

### Diagnosis and management of osteoporosis [^111Wetn8]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis-related fractures affect approximately one in two white women and one in five white men in their lifetime. The impact of fractures includes loss of function, significant costs, and increased mortality. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry to screen all women 65 years and older, and younger women who have an increased fracture risk as determined by the World Health Organization's FRAX Fracture Risk Assessment Tool. Although guidelines are lacking for rescreening women who have normal bone mineral density on initial screening, intervals of at least four years appear safe. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening for osteoporosis in men; other organizations recommend screening all men 70 years and older. In patients with newly diagnosed osteoporosis, suggested laboratory tests to identify secondary causes include serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, creatinine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. First-line treatment to prevent fractures consists of fall prevention, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake, and bisphosphonate therapy. Clinicians should consider discontinuing bisphosphonate therapy after five years in women without a personal history of vertebral fractures. Raloxifene, teriparatide, and denosumab are alternative effective treatments for certain subsets of patients and for those who are unable to take or whose condition does not respond to bisphosphonates. The need for follow-up bone mineral density testing in patients receiving treatment for osteoporosis is uncertain.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^114fvWtY]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Bone metastatic disease in RAI-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) — management and bone-directed agents: Metastatic bone disease represents a particularly challenging clinical problem in patients with RAI-refractory DTC, especially given the high rate of multiple skeletal-related events in patients following detection of an initial bone lesion. Patients with a small number of threatening and/or symptomatic bone lesions are generally best treated with local approaches such as radiation therapy and/or surgery and/or thermablation, and in such patients focal therapy to symptomatic lesions or lesions at high risk of complications may be beneficial and should be performed before initiation of systemic treatment. Kinase inhibitors appear to be less effective in controlling bone metastatic disease in comparison to disease at other soft tissue sites such as lungs and lymph nodes, and progression of bone metastases while on kinase inhibitor therapy commonly occurs despite maintained benefit at other sites; hence, kinase inhibitor therapy cannot be relied upon to control diffuse bone metastases in many patients with RAI-refractory DTC. Bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy should be considered in patients with diffuse and/or symptomatic bone metastases from RAI-refractory DTC, either alone or concomitantly with other systemic therapies, and adequate renal function (bisphosphonates) and calcium level (bisphosphonates and denosumab) should be documented prior to each dose, and dental evaluation should take place before initial use.

### Bisphosphonates [^114m7FoG]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates now occupy a prominent position among therapeutic options for the prevention and treatment of various forms of osteoporosis. Their clinical profile of bone-specific efficacy, rapid response, protection from both spine and hip fractures in patients with osteoporosis, and excellent tolerability is all that can be expected of an anti-remodeling drug. Even in the era of anabolic agents, bisphosphonates will continue to be important treatment options. It is not possible to compare or contrast the clinical effectiveness of the various bisphosphonates on the basis of existing data. Despite marked differences in the in vitro potency of drugs, the clinical responses to each of the bisphosphonates discussed above are similar. New bisphosphonates may not be more effective but will provide different tolerability profiles and different routes of administration, thereby increasing the number of patients in whom bisphosphonates can be used. Having these effective agents challenges clinicians to identify the most appropriate patients for bisphosphonate use and to develop strategies to improve acceptance of and adherence to these useful agents.

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^111csVmY]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Adherence to supplements, particularly calcium supplements, is often low, which can have a negative impact on efficacy. In patients receiving a bisphosphonate or denosumab, measures should be taken to maximise adherence to calcium and vitamin D supplements: the risk of hypocalcaemia and the importance of adherence to supplements should be discussed with patients, and serum calcium levels should be monitored to assess adherence. Regular patient follow-up to encourage treatment compliance may help to ensure that supplements are taken correctly.

Compliance may be enhanced by choosing a suitable dose and delivery method for calcium and vitamin D supplements. Calcium and vitamin D supplements are available as separate or combined formulations, as a variety of delivery compounds including oral tablets, capsules, soft-chews, powders, or as solution. Calcium carbonate, available as powder formulations, has been shown to have increased bioavailability compared with calcium citrate, most often given as tablet formulations. However, patient preference studies of calcium and vitamin D supplements have shown that soft-chew tablets are preferred over powder formulations. In addition, patients are more likely to be adherent with once-daily dietary supplements than with twice-daily supplements. However, the advantages of once-daily supplementation depend on the dose required and should be considered in light of the reduced percentage absorption of calcium when it is given in doses above 500 mg. As discussed above, vitamin D supplements can be given weekly or biweekly, which may improve adherence compared with daily supplements.

Calcium supplements are associated with a number of adverse events that may reduce patient compliance with treatment. In particular, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events are common in patients taking calcium supplements. Compared with calcium citrate, calcium carbonate is more often associated with GI symptoms. Although most GI adverse events are mild, a meta-analysis assessing the safety of calcium supplements in randomised trials found a significantly increased incidence of hospital admissions for GI adverse events in patients receiving calcium (6.8%) when compared with those receiving placebo (3.6%). For patients who experience unmanageable adverse events with calcium supplements, it is essential to provide dietary advice on how to increase calcium intake with calcium-rich foods (Table 2). In contrast, vitamin D supplements are generally well tolerated, but we advise regular monitoring of vitamin D levels in patients who are at a high risk of hypocalcaemia and those for whom poor adherence to supplementation is suspected.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^112iiP6s]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Calcium metabolism in cancer and hypercalcaemia of malignancy

The balance between bone formation and resorption may be disrupted in patients with cancer, leading either to increased bone resorption, calcium release, and possibly hypercalcaemia, or to increased bone formation, sequestration of calcium, and possibly hypocalcaemia. In adults, hypercalcaemia of malignancy is most common in patients with tumours that produce factors that induce osteoclast activation and enhance bone resorption. Impaired renal function and increased renal tubular calcium resorption may further affect calcium levels.

Treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy

Inhibitors of bone resorption, first the bisphosphonates and, later, denosumab, have been shown to be effective in hypercalcaemia treatment. Bisphosphonates (which are administered intravenously) are approved for hypercalcaemia of malignancy and are the current mainstay of treatment, whereas denosumab (which is administered subcutaneously) may offer an option for patients who do not respond to bisphosphonates or suffer from renal insufficiency.

Hypocalcaemia: treatment and prevention

Hypocalcaemia is most common in patients with prostate cancer and osteoblastic bone metastases, but can occur in patients with a variety of tumour types who are receiving inhibitors of bone resorption. While patients often respond to calcium and vitamin D supplementation, prevention should be the aim; at-risk patients should be identified before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption, be closely monitored during at least the first few months of treatment, and receive concomitant calcium and vitamin D supplementation unless hypercalcaemia is present.

Conclusion

Both hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia can be serious if left untreated. It is therefore important that patients with cancer are closely monitored and receive adequate prevention and treatment measures to maintain normal blood calcium levels.

### Bisphosphonates for steroid-induced osteoporosis [^115aBpSc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1999. Corticosteroids are widely used in inflammatory conditions as an immunosuppressive agent. Bone loss is a serious side effect of this therapy. Several studies have examined the use of bisphosphonates in the prevention and treatment of glucocorticosteroid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) and have reported varying magnitudes of effect.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of bisphosphonates for the prevention and treatment of GIOP in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase up to April 2016 and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) via OVID up to January 2012 for relevant articles and conference proceedings with no language restrictions. We searched two clinical trial registries for ongoing and recently completed studies (ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal). We also reviewed reference lists of relevant review articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) satisfying the following criteria: 1) prevention or treatment of GIOP; 2) adults taking a mean steroid dose of 5.0 mg/day or more; 3) active treatment including bisphosphonates of any type alone or in combination with calcium or vitamin D; 4) comparator treatment including a control of calcium or vitamin D, or both, alone or with placebo; and 4) reporting relevant outcomes. We excluded trials that included people with transplant-associated steroid use.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, performed 'risk of bias' assessment and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Major outcomes of interest were the incidence of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures after 12 to 24 months; the change in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and femoral neck after 12 months; serious adverse events; withdrawals due to adverse events; and quality of life. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

We included a total of 27 RCTs with 3075 participants in the review. Pooled analysis for incident vertebral fractures included 12 trials (1343 participants) with high-certainty evidence and low risk of bias. In this analysis 46/597 (or 77 per 1000) people experienced new vertebral fractures in the control group compared with 31/746 (or 44 per 1000; range 27 to 70) in the bisphosphonate group; relative improvement of 43% (9% to 65% better) with bisphosphonates; absolute increased benefit of 2% fewer people sustaining fractures with bisphosphonates (5% fewer to 1% more); number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 31 (20 to 145) meaning that approximately 31 people would need to be treated with bisphosphonates to prevent new vertebral fractures in one person. Pooled analysis for incident nonvertebral fractures included nine trials with 1245 participants with low-certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision and serious risk of bias as a patient-reported outcome). In this analysis 30/546 (or 55 per 1000) people experienced new nonvertebral fracture in the control group compared with 29/699 (or 42 per 1000; range 25 to 69) in the bisphosphonate group; relative improvement of 21% with bisphosphonates (33% worse to 53% better); absolute increased benefit of 1% fewer people with fractures with bisphosphonates (4% fewer to 1% more). Pooled analysis on BMD change at the lumbar spine after 12 months included 23 trials with 2042 patients. Eighteen trials with 1665 participants were included in the pooled analysis on BMD at the femoral neck after 12 months. Evidence for both outcomes was moderate-certainty (downgraded for indirectness as a surrogate marker for osteoporosis) with low risk of bias. Overall, the bisphosphonate groups reported stabilisation or increase in BMD, while the control groups showed decreased BMD over the study period. At the lumbar spine, there was an absolute increase in BMD of 3.5% with bisphosphonates (2.90% to 4.10% higher) with a relative improvement of 1.10% with bisphosphonates (0.91% to 1.29%); NNTB 3 (2 to 3). At the femoral neck, the absolute difference in BMD was 2.06% higher in the bisphosphonate group compared to the control group (1.45% to 2.68% higher) with a relative improvement of 1.29% (0.91% to 1.69%); NNTB 5 (4 to 7). Pooled analysis on serious adverse events included 15 trials (1703 participants) with low-certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). In this analysis 131/811 (or 162 per 1000) people experienced serious adverse events in the control group compared to 136/892 (or 147 per 1000; range 120 to 181) in the bisphosphonate group; absolute increased harm of 0% more serious adverse events (2% fewer to 2% more); a relative per cent change with 9% improvement (12% worse to 26% better). Pooled analysis for withdrawals due to adverse events included 15 trials (1790 patients) with low-certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). In this analysis 63/866 (or 73 per 1000) people withdrew in the control group compared to 76/924 (or 77 per 1000; range 56 to 107) in the bisphosphonate group; an absolute increased harm of 1% more withdrawals with bisphosphonates (95% CI 1% fewer to 3% more); a relative per cent change 6% worse (95% CI 47% worse to 23% better). Quality of life was not assessed in any of the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

There was high-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates are beneficial in reducing the risk of vertebral fractures with data extending to 24 months of use. There was low-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates may make little or no difference in preventing nonvertebral fractures. There was moderate-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates are beneficial in preventing and treating corticosteroid-induced bone loss at both the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Regarding harm, there was low-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates may make little or no difference in the occurrence of serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events. We are cautious in interpreting these data as markers for harm and tolerability due to the potential for bias. Overall, our review supports the use of bisphosphonates to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures and the prevention and treatment of steroid-induced bone loss.

### Bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis: benefits, risks, and drug holiday [^1159ZZnK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The amino-bisphosphonates are first-line therapy for the treatment of most patients with osteoporosis, with proven efficacy to reduce fracture risk at the spine, hip, and other nonvertebral skeletal sites. Further, bisphosphonates have been associated with a significant decrease in morbidity and increase in survival. Following the use of bisphosphonates in millions of patients in clinical practice, some unexpected possible adverse effects have been reported, including osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femur fractures, atrial fibrillation, and esophageal cancer. Because bisphosphonates are incorporated into the skeleton and continue to exert an antiresorptive effect for a period of time after dosing is discontinued, the concept of a drug holiday has emerged, whereby the risk of adverse effects might be decreased while the patient still benefits from antifracture efficacy. Patients receiving bisphosphonates who are not at high risk for fracture are potential candidates for a drug holiday, while for those with bone mineral density in the osteoporosis range or previous history of fragility fracture, the benefits of continuing therapy probably far outweigh the risk of harm.

### Bisphosphonates for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis [^111ify9z]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by bone loss, which leads to impaired bone strength and an increased risk of fractures. Two million fractures are attributed to osteoporosis annually in the United States and they are associated with serious morbidity and mortality. Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of fracture by suppressing bone resorption and increasing bone strength, and they have been widely used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. However, the use of these drugs for the management of osteoporosis remains a clinical challenge. There are several important considerations including appropriate patient selection, pretreatment evaluation, potential adverse effects, patient preferences, and adherence. This review will discuss the evidence informing the clinical strategy for using bisphosphonates in patients with osteoporosis and those at high risk of fracture, focusing on the benefits and risks of treatment. We will also consider issues related to the monitoring and duration of treatment.

### Calcium intake and bone mineral density: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115QpSGV]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Implications of findings

The absence of any interaction with baseline dietary calcium intake or a dose-response relation suggests that increasing intake through dietary sources or through supplements does not correct a dietary deficiency (in which case greater effects would be seen in those with the lowest intakes or the highest doses). An alternative possibility is that increasing calcium intake has a weak anti-resorptive effect. Calcium supplements reduce markers of bone formation and resorption by about 20%, and increasing milk intake also reduces bone turnover by a similar amount. Suppression of bone turnover by this amount might lead to the small observed increases in BMD.

Increases in BMD of about 1–2% over one to five years are unlikely to translate into clinically meaningful reductions in fractures. The average rate of BMD loss in older post-menopausal women is about 1% a year. So the effect of increasing calcium intake is to prevent about one to two years of normal BMD loss, and if calcium intake is increased for more than one year it will slow down but not stop BMD loss. Epidemiological studies suggest that a decrease in BMD of one standard deviation is associated with an increase in the relative risk of fracture of about 1.5–2.0. A one standard deviation change in BMD is about equivalent to a 10% change in BMD. Based on these calculations, a 10% increase in BMD would be associated with a 33–50% reduction in risk of fracture. Therefore, the 1–2% increase in BMD observed with increased calcium intake would be predicted to produce a 5–10% reduction in risk of fracture. These estimates are consistent with findings from randomised controlled trials of other agents. The modest increases in BMD with increased calcium intake are smaller than observed with weak anti-resorptive agents such as etidronateand raloxifene. Etidronate, however, does not reduce vertebral or non-vertebral fractures, and raloxifene reduces vertebral but not non-vertebral fractures. In contrast, potent anti-resorptive agents such as alendronate, zoledronate, and denosumab increase BMD by 6–9% at the spine and 5–6% at the hip over three years. These changes are associated with reductions of 44–70% in vertebral fracture, 35–41% in hip fracture, and 15–25% in non-vertebral fractures. The magnitude of fracture reduction predicted by the small increases in BMD we observed with increased calcium intake are also consistent with the findings of our systematic review of calcium supplements and fracture. We observed small (< 15%) inconsistent reductions in total and vertebral fracture overall but no reductions in fractures in the large randomised controlled trials at lowest risk of bias and no reductions in forearm or hip fractures.

Bisphosphonates — acute-phase reactions and other adverse events: Intravenous (IV) or high-dose oral nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates may cause acute-phase reactions in up to 30% of first-dose patients, characterized by fever and muscle aches; acetaminophen given 1 to 2 hours before treatment may reduce risk and treat symptoms. Postmarketing reports describe severe bone, joint, or muscle complaints that usually resolve on discontinuation. Regarding esophageal cancer, one study suggested no increased risk while another suggested a small absolute increase — from 1 case per 1,000 untreated to 2 cases per 1,000 with use ≥ 5 years; the FDA concluded no definite association.

### Clinical question: what is the best approach to managing glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis? [^111yE3Ku]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is common, and the resulting fractures cause significant morbidity and mortality. Rapid bone loss and increased fracture risk occur soon after the initiation of glucocorticoid therapy and are dose dependent. The increase in fracture risk is partly independent of bone mineral density, probably as a result of changes in bone material properties and increased risk of falling. Fracture risk can be assessed using the FRAX algorithm, although risk may be underestimated in patients taking higher doses of glucocorticoids. Because of the rapidity of bone loss and increase in fracture risk after the start of glucocorticoid therapy, primary prevention should be advised in high-risk individuals, for example older women and men, individuals with a previous fracture history and those with low bone mineral density. Bisphosphonates are the front-line choice for the prevention of fracture in the majority of glucocorticoid-treated patients, with teriparatide as a second-line option. Calcium and vitamin D supplements should be co-prescribed unless there is evidence of an adequate dietary calcium intake and vitamin D status.

Consider endocrine therapy for 5 years for patients with ER-positive DCIS, if treated with excision alone. Endocrine therapy options are tamoxifen for premenopausal patients and tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal patients with some advantage for aromatase inhibitor therapy in patients < 60 years or with concerns for thromboembolism. Risk reduction therapy for contralateral breast: counseling regarding risk reduction. CYP2D6 genotype testing is not recommended for patients considering tamoxifen. Low-dose tamoxifen (5 mg per day or 10 mg every other day for 3–5 years) is an option if patient is symptomatic on the 20-mg dose or if patient is unwilling or unable to take standard-dose 20 mg per day tamoxifen (10 mg every other day since 5-mg dose is not available in the United States). The use of a bisphosphonate (PO/IV) or denosumab is acceptable to maintain or improve bone mineral density and reduce risk of fractures in postmenopausal (natural or induced) patients receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy; optimal duration of either therapy has not been established, and benefits from duration beyond 3 years or optimal duration beyond 3 years is not known; patients treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab should undergo a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of therapy, and should take supplemental calcium and vitamin D.

### Comparing therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis prevention and treatment [^115TpdDy]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature concerning the efficacy of calcium, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and calcitonin in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Data Sources

Articles were identified through searches of the MEDLINE (1966-July 2002), EMBASE (1980-July 2002), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-July 2002) databases using the key words osteoporosis, postmenopausal, fracture, calcium, vitamin D, hormone replacement therapy, bisphosphonates, alendronate, risedronate, raloxifene, and calcitonin. Additional references were located through review of the bibliographies of the articles cited. Searches were not limited by time restriction, language, or human subject.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Experimental and observational studies of the use of calcium and antiresorptive therapies for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis were selected. Articles evaluating bone mineral density (BMD) or fracture efficacy were included in this review.

Data Synthesis

HRT, bisphosphonates, raloxifene, and calcitonin have demonstrated stabilization of and improvement in BMD. Randomized clinical trials have shown fracture risk reduction with bisphosphonates, raloxifene, HRT, calcium, and calcitonin. The largest risk reductions have been reported with use of bisphosphonates in several trials.

Conclusions

Several therapeutic options with well-documented improvements in BMD and reductions in fracture risk are available to women for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

### Medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop on the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism [^1163j2zS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The only available definitive therapy is parathyroidectomy, which is appropriate to consider in all patients. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on calcium and vitamin D supplementation and medical management for those patients with PHPT who cannot or do not want to undergo surgery.

Methods

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken, and relevant articles published between 2008 and 2013 were reviewed in detail. The questions were addressed by the panel of experts, and consensus was established at the time of the workshop.

Conclusions

The recommended calcium intake in patients with PHPT should follow guidelines established for all individuals. It is not recommended to limit calcium intake in patients with PHPT who do not undergo surgery. Patients with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be repleted with doses of vitamin D aiming to bring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to ≥ 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) at a minimum, but a goal of ≥ 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) also is reasonable. Pharmacological approaches are available and should be reserved for those patients in whom it is desirable to lower the serum calcium, increase BMD, or both. For the control of hypercalcemia, cinacalcet is the treatment of choice. Cinacalcet reduces serum calcium concentrations to normal in many cases, but has only a modest effect on serum PTH levels. However, bone mineral density (BMD) does not change. To improve BMD, bisphosphonate therapy is recommended. The best evidence is for the use of alendronate, which improves BMD at the lumbar spine without altering the serum calcium concentration. To reduce the serum calcium and improve BMD, combination therapy with both agents is reasonable, but strong evidence for the efficacy of that approach is lacking.

### Bisphosphonates and risk of cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1179QZgs]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Notably, we did not find that the duration of bisphosphonates had an effect on specific cancers, except breast cancer. For breast cancer, our results were consistent with a meta-analysis by Liu et al.which showed that using bisphosphonates upto at least 1 year (RR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.66–0.84) seemed to be greater protective on breast cancer than using them for less than 1 year (RR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.84–0.97). However, Ou et al.suggested that bisphosphonate was not associated with risk of breast cancer when the usage time was less than 1 year (RR = 0.93, 95%: 0.86–1.00), but a significant 26% reduction was found upto at least 1 year (RR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.66–0.83), which was consistent with the study by Newcomb et al. Patients with the long-term use of bisphosphonates might have a healthier lifestyle and higher adherence to the drugs, so the benefits observed in the analysis might be overestimated. Thus, further studies are needed to consider this potential bias and find the best duration and dose of bisphosphonates.

In this study, the evidence we have on the use of bisphosphonates and risk of cancers is based mainly on observational studies. Many studies are not able to adequately control confounding factors related to cancers. Wright et al.demonstrated a small but significantly increased risk of oesophageal cancer in women, not in men. Generally, women prescribe bisphosphonates for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, while men are more likely to prescribe bisphosphonates for iatrogenic osteoporosis. Hence, most of the participants in included studies were women, and the number of men was much smaller. To date, there is still a lack of studies on the association between bisphosphonates and risk of cancers in people of different genders. Secondly, some studies have reported that supplemental calcium and vitamin D might have a protective effect on colorectal cancer, which are usually prescribed with bisphosphonates. Some included studies did not control for calcium and vitamin D when analysing the association between bisphosphonates and the risk of colorectal cancer. In addition, only a few studies adjust the use of statins, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and family history of cancers, which are also related to cancers. –

### The role of calcium in osteoporosis drug therapy [^115x68t4]. Journal of Women's Health (2005). Low credibility.

Great advances have been made in the field of osteoporosis treatment and prevention in recent years that have led to the availability of powerful new drugs. These drugs are viewed by patients and physicians as a major breakthrough in the management of osteoporosis. Unfortunately, this view has led many to ignore the importance of concurrent calcium supplementation to ensure the maximum benefit from these drugs, as evidenced by the recent decline in use of calcium supplements. As the majority of patients fail to consume the minimum recommended dietary intake of calcium, it is critical to recommend calcium supplements to raise total daily calcium intake to the levels needed to ensure maximum efficacy of osteoporosis treatments. Furthermore, osteoporosis drug labeling should be strengthened to encourage proper use of these drugs in combination with calcium supplements.

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^114xKJik]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Adequate supplementation is necessary in all patients treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab. For patients receiving denosumab, concomitant supplementation with a minimum of 500 mg calcium daily and 400 IU vitamin D daily is required. When managing hypocalcaemia risk in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer, it is important to note that those receiving androgen-deprivation therapy should also receive calcium and vitamin D supplements as part of the preventative treatment for cancer treatment-induced bone loss.

The recommended daily intake of calcium varies by guideline and by patient population. To avoid calcium deficiency, the British Dietetic Association recommends that adults consume 700 mg of calcium daily. The National Institutes of Health recommends a daily intake of calcium of 1000 mg for adults aged up to 70 years (1200 mg for women aged 51–70 years) and 1200 mg for those aged over 70 years. Elderly patients have an increased requirement for calcium due to age-associated reduction in intestinal calcium absorption. For all patients, the percentage of calcium absorbed depends on the total amount of elemental calcium consumed at one time. The percentage absorption decreases as the amount of calcium increases: absorption is maximal when doses of 500 mg or less are consumed at one time.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^1172tDwu]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to chemoprophylaxis, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients for baseline fracture risk and measure bone mineral density prior to initiating an aromatase inhibitor. Recognize that multiple studies have reported an increased rate of bone loss in women treated with aromatase inhibitors. Use anastrozole with caution in postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral density loss, and if it is used, consider the use of bone-protective agents such as bisphosphonates and RANK ligand inhibitors. Encourage all patients receiving aromatase inhibitors to exercise regularly and take adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements. Recognize that a history of osteoporosis and/or severe bone loss is a relative contraindication for the use of anastrozole. In the International Breast Intervention Study-II, women with severe osteoporosis (T score < -4 or more than two vertebral fractures) were excluded. Recognize that other endocrine preventive therapies that do not reduce bone density, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, are also available for this group of women.

Patient values and preferences indicate that compliance with oral bisphosphonates is low (~30% still continuing at 1 year); in patients with adherence difficulties or who fail to respond, zoledronic acid given annually as an intravenous (IV) infusion or denosumab given by subcutaneous injection every 6 months may be advantageous for effectively lowering fracture risk, and concerns about risks of atypical femoral fractures (AFFs) or osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) should be considered when contemplating bisphosphonate holidays.

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^111w78wp]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 3
First occurrence of hypocalcaemia by time period in patients receiving denosumab (n = 313)

To prevent hypocalcaemia in patients receiving a bisphosphonate or denosumab, serum vitamin D and albumin-corrected (or ionized) calcium concentrations should be measured before treatment initiation. Pre-existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before treatment initiation. For patients with a substantial tumour burden in the bone (≥ 3 bone lesions), prophylactic calcium and vitamin D should be prescribed 1 week before starting treatment with a bisphosphonate or denosumab. During this week, patient adherence to and tolerance of these supplements should be assessed. The denosumab label recommends that serum calcium concentration should be measured within 2 weeks of the initial dose in all patients and that additional monitoring should be conducted in patients with suspected symptoms of hypocalcaemia and in those at high risk of hypocalcaemia. However, in clinical practice, we recommend such monitoring following the initial dose of a bisphosphonate or denosumab only in patients who are at a high risk of hypocalcaemia, such as those who are critically ill or who have renal insufficiency. Nevertheless, we do recommend measuring calcium levels in at-risk patients prior to administering the second dose of a bisphosphonate or denosumab. Additionally, patients should be counselled on the signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia and encouraged to report symptoms indicative of this condition. Monitoring allows early detection of hypocalcaemia and hence the correction of serum calcium concentration before administering further doses of a bisphosphonate or denosumab.

Calcium and vitamin D supplements

Preventative supplementation with calcium and/or vitamin D is associated with fewer hypocalcaemia adverse events for patients receiving zoledronic acid or denosumab. Use of these supplements [recommended doses: calcium ≥ 500 mg/day; vitamin D ≥ 400 International Units (IU) /day] has been shown to lower the risk of developing hypocalcaemia by 27% or 40% in patients receiving zoledronic acid or denosumab, respectively (Fig. 4). This reduction in risk is impressive given that, in this analysis, patients were considered to be receiving supplements if they had reported taking oral calcium and/or vitamin D at any time during the study (excluding those who reported supplement use only after their first hypocalcaemia event).

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^115tWxh6]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Both hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia can lead to serious complications in patients with advanced cancer. Bisphosphonates are effective treatments for both osteolytic and humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy. In patients with persistent or relapsed hypercalcaemia of malignancy that fails to respond or no longer responds to bisphosphonate treatment, denosumab offers a therapeutic option and, as such, has been approved for this indication in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Russia. Denosumab is a more potent inhibitor of bone resorption than zoledronic acid and is more effective at preventing hypercalcaemia. It is possible that the incidence of hypercalcaemia of malignancy may further decrease as potent inhibitors of bone resorption are used more commonly and earlier in the course of management of patients with metastatic cancer. On the other hand, inhibitors of bone resorption have been shown to increase the risk of developing hypocalcaemia. This risk is higher with denosumab than with zoledronic acid; however, it can be managed by proper identification of at-risk patients and careful monitoring of those receiving these agents. Given the potential improvements to quality of life that inhibitors of bone resorption offer patients with advanced cancer, the benefits and risks associated with their use must be assessed. Further to this, physicians need to be aware of the measures they can take to counteract these risks and to find the balance between hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: 2006 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111JdZ7G]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2002 regarding the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this updated document. A panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of metabolic bone diseases and/or women's health were enlisted to review the 2002 NAMS position statement, compile supporting statements, and reach consensus on recommendations. The panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Osteoporosis, whose prevalence is especially high among elderly postmenopausal women, increases the risk of fractures. Hip and spine fractures are associated with particularly high morbidity and mortality in this population. Given the health implications of osteoporotic fractures, the primary goal of osteoporosis therapy is to prevent fractures, which is accomplished by slowing or stopping bone loss, maintaining bone strength, and minimizing or eliminating factors that may contribute to fractures. The evaluation of postmenopausal women for osteoporosis risk requires a medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. Major risk factors for postmenopausal osteoporosis (as defined by bone mineral density) include advanced age, genetics, lifestyle factors (such as low calcium and vitamin D intake, smoking), thinness, and menopause status. The most common risk factors for osteoporotic fracture are advanced age, low bone mineral density, and previous fracture as an adult. Management focuses first on nonpharmacologic measures, such as a balanced diet, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, adequate exercise, smoking cessation, avoidance of excessive alcohol intake, and fall prevention. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, government-approved options are bisphosphonates, a selective estrogen-receptor modulator, parathyroid hormone, estrogens, and calcitonin.

Conclusions

Management strategies for postmenopausal women involve identifying those at risk of low bone density and fracture, followed by instituting measures that focus on reducing modifiable risk factors through lifestyle changes and, if indicated, pharmacologic therapy.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116ZQLhe]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2006 regarding the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

Methods

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this updated document. A panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of metabolic bone diseases and/or women's health was enlisted to review the 2006 NAMS position statement, compile supporting statements, and reach consensus on recommendations. The panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Osteoporosis, which is especially prevalent among older postmenopausal women, increases the risk of fractures. Hip and spine fractures are associated with particularly high morbidity and mortality in this population. Given the health implications of osteoporotic fractures, the primary goal of osteoporosis therapy is to prevent fractures, which is accomplished by slowing or stopping bone loss, maintaining bone strength, and minimizing or eliminating factors that may contribute to fractures.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^1132wSX7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Anastrozole for breast cancer risk reduction — recommendations 4.4–4.6 advise that discussions between patients and health care providers should include both the benefits and risks of anastrozole along with the other approved drugs for risk reduction based on menopausal status. Prior to initiating an aromatase inhibitor, clinicians should evaluate patients for baseline fracture risk and measure bone mineral density, should use anastrozole with caution in postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral density loss and consider the use of bone-protective agents such as bisphosphonates and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) inhibitors, should encourage regular exercise and adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements for all patients receiving aromatase inhibitors, and should recognize that a history of osteoporosis and/or severe bone loss is a relative contraindication; in IBIS-II, women with severe osteoporosis (T score < –4 or more than two vertebral fractures) were excluded and other endocrine preventive therapies that do not reduce bone density, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, are also available for this group of women. Clinicians should also inform women of the possibility of joint stiffness, arthralgias, vasomotor symptoms, hypertension, dry eyes, and vaginal dryness while taking anastrozole, and this is labeled as Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong.

### Evaluation of vitamin D deficiency in breast cancer patients on bisphosphonates [^112hyfi6]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Bisphosphonates are very effective in treating osteoporosis and metastatic bone disease; however, unfavorable outcomes can occur when they are given to patients with occult vitamin D deficiency. No clear consensus exists on the assessment of vitamin D status in cancer patients undergoing bisphosphonate therapy. This study examines the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among breast cancer patients treated with bisphosphonates for osteoporosis or metastatic bone disease, and observes the use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in these patients.

Methods

This retrospective study reviewed the electronic records of 321 breast cancer patients treated with bisphosphonates. Information on age, race, and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), parathyroid hormone, and calcium were collected, and intakes of calcium and vitamin D supplements were queried in an outpatient pharmacy database.

Results

Of the 321 patients treated with bisphosphonates, 209 (65.1%) had their 25-OHD levels checked at least once. Of these patients, 57 (27.3%) had a serum 25-OHD level < 20 ng/ml. Of the 209 patients with a known 25-OHD level, only eight (3.8%) received > 600 IU of vitamin D per day, and 41 (19.6%) patients received 400–600 IU of vitamin D daily.

Conclusion

Especially in the setting of metastatic bone disease in breast cancer patients, we advocate routine 25-OHD concentration screening for vitamin D deficiency in general. Clear guidelines for the diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency in cancer patients would be extremely beneficial to have, as would identification of the proper dose of vitamin D supplementation. We recommend 1,000 IU daily to our metastatic cancer patients.

### Calcium intake and bone mineral density: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114XLCAb]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The large number of randomised controlled trials that studied increased calcium intake and BMD and the consistency of the results across different populations in studies using higher or lower doses of calcium and in studies of dietary calcium sources or calcium supplements does not reveal any obvious gaps in the evidence. Any future trials conducted should have a strong rationale as to why the results are likely to differ from the large body of existing trial evidence. It is usually recommended that anti-resorptive agents are co-prescribed with calcium and vitamin D, although randomised controlled trials of such agents have shown reductions in risk of fractureand the expected increases in BMDwithout the co-administration of calcium and vitamin D. Randomised controlled trials clarifying the role of calcium and vitamin D in individuals using anti-resorptive agents might be valuable. In subgroup analyses, we stratified trials by thresholds of baseline dietary calcium intake (800 mg/day) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (50 nmol/L). The clinical consequences of low calcium intake or vitamin D status such as osteomalacia, however, probably occur only at much lower thresholds, and there might also be interactions between calcium intake and vitamin D status. Analyses of individual patient data would be valuable in exploring these issues further.

Conclusions

In summary, increasing calcium intake from dietary sources increases BMD by a similar amount to increases in BMD from calcium supplements. In each case, the increases are small (1–2%) and non-progressive, with little further effect on BMD after a year. Subgroup analyses do not suggest greater benefits of increasing calcium intake on BMD in any subpopulation based on clinically relevant baseline characteristics. The small effects on BMD are unlikely to translate into clinically meaningful reductions in fractures. Therefore, for most individuals concerned about their bone density, increasing calcium intake is unlikely to be beneficial.

### Reducing fracture risk with calcium and vitamin D [^113BDzPM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Studies of vitamin D and calcium for fracture prevention have produced inconsistent results, as a result of different vitamin D status and calcium intake at baseline, different doses and poor to adequate compliance. This study tries to define the types of patients, both at risk of osteoporosis and with established disease, who may benefit from calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The importance of adequate compliance in these individuals is also discussed. Calcium and vitamin D therapy has been recommended for older persons, either frail and institutionalized or independent, with key risk factors including decreased bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporotic fractures, increased bone remodelling as a result of secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased propensity to falls. In addition, treatment of osteoporosis with a bisphosphonate was less effective in patients with vitamin D deficiency. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is a key component of prevention and treatment of osteoporosis unless calcium intake and vitamin D status are optimal. For primary disease prevention, supplementation should be targeted to those with dietary insufficiencies. Several serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) cut-offs have been proposed to define vitamin D insufficiency (as opposed to adequate vitamin D status), ranging from 30 to 100 nmol/l. Based on the relationship between serum 25(OH)D, BMD, bone turnover, lower extremity function and falls, we suggest that 50 nmol/l is the appropriate serum 25(OH)D threshold to define vitamin D insufficiency. Supplementation should therefore generally aim to increase 25(OH)D levels within the 50–75 nmol/l range. This level can be achieved with a dose of 800 IU/day vitamin D, the dose that was used in successful fracture prevention studies to date; a randomized clinical trial assessing whether higher vitamin D doses achieve a greater reduction of fracture incidence would be of considerable interest. As calcium balance is not only affected by vitamin D status but also by calcium intake, recommendations for adequate calcium intake should also be met. The findings of community-based clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium supplementation in which compliance was moderate or less have often been negative, whereas studies in institutionalized patients in whom medication administration was supervised ensuring adequate compliance demonstrated significant benefits.

### Alendronate sodium (Fosamax) [^112tRqhY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2	Mineral Metabolism

Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with FOSAMAX [see Contraindications (4)]. Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with FOSAMAX.

Presumably due to the effects of FOSAMAX on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur, especially in patients with Paget's disease, in whom the pretreatment rate of bone turnover may be greatly elevated, and in patients receiving glucocorticoids, in whom calcium absorption may be decreased.

Ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is especially important in patients with Paget's disease of bone and in patients receiving glucocorticoids.

5.3	Musculoskeletal Pain

In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This category of drugs includes FOSAMAX (alendronate). Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.

In placebo-controlled clinical studies of FOSAMAX, the percentages of patients with these symptoms were similar in the FOSAMAX and placebo groups.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^1139XgwN]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is a chronic disease, and antiresorptive treatments are often continued for many years. Despite their established efficacy in reducing fracture risk, the most commonly used antiresorptive treatments, bisphosphonates and denosumab, have short‐ and long‐term risks that, coupled with their benefits and other unique characteristics, influence consideration for at least periodic discontinuation. Bisphosphonates retain their effects even after discontinuation due to their prolonged skeletal retention, whereas denosumab discontinuation is associated with a rapid rebound in bone turnover and increased fracture risk. There is controversy about how, when, and why to potentially stop these agents. We discuss both permanent and temporary discontinuation of long‐term treatment with bisphosphonates and denosumab. We focus on the reasons and timing for discontinuation as well as strategies to mitigate future fracture risk.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medications may interfere with absorption of ibandronate. Do not take within 60 minutes of dosing. (7.1)
Use caution when co-prescribing aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may worsen gastrointestinal irritation. (7.2)

7.1 Calcium Supplements/Antacids

Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of ibandronate sodium. Therefore, instruct patients to take ibandronate sodium at least 60 minutes before any oral medications, including medications containing multivalent cations (such as antacids, supplements or vitamins). Also, patients should wait at least 60 minutes after dosing before taking any other oral medications (see Dosage and Administration [2.3]).

7.2 Aspirin/Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

Because aspirin, NSAIDs, and bisphosphonates are all associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be exercised in the concomitant use of aspirin or NSAIDs with ibandronate sodium.

7.3 H2Blockers

In healthy volunteers, co-administration with ranitidine resulted in a 20% increased bioavailability of ibandronate, which was not considered to be clinically relevant (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY [12.3]).

7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Bisphosphonates are known to interfere with the use of bone-imaging agents. Specific studies with ibandronate have not been performed.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^112TJ2qa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Atypical femoral fracture (AFF) risk with bisphosphonates — incidence and duration trends is characterized by very low absolute rates but increases with longer exposure; studies report "about 3 AFFs per 1000 hip fractures", with population rates "about 5 per 100,000 person-years" versus hip fracture incidences of "300 to 400 per 100,000 person-years". Duration-related risk rose from "~3 per 100,000 person-years" after 2 years to "~20 per 100,000 person-years" at 5 years and "~50 per 100,000 with > 8 years of use". A benefit–risk analysis estimated that treating 1000 osteoporotic women for 3 years would "prevent 100 fractures, including 11 hip fractures, while causing about 0.1 AFF". Given rising risk beyond 5 years, the text states "the consistent increase shown for treatment beyond 5 years suggests consideration of AFF risk in treating patients for > 5 years", and notes the ASBMR proposal of a drug holiday "from oral bisphosphonates after 5 years and from IV bisphosphonates after 3 years" in low-to-moderate risk patients.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^115h8jrU]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Systemic mastocytosis — treatment for osteopenia/osteoporosis lists supplemental calcium and vitamin D, bisphosphonates (with continued use of antihistamines), and Anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody (eg, denosumab); bisphosphonates may resolve bone pain and improve vertebral bone mineral density (more than femoral head bone mineral density). Peginterferon alfa-2a is listed, and consideration is noted for patients with refractory bone pain and/or worsening bone mineral density on bisphosphonate therapy. Anti-RANKL therapy is generally used as second-line therapy for patients with bone pain not responding to bisphosphonates or for patients who are not candidates for bisphosphonates because of renal insufficiency. Vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty is noted for refractory pain associated with vertebral compression fractures in selected patients. Footnotes specify that an FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any recommended systemic biologic therapy in the NCCN Guidelines and that, if peginterferon alfa-2a is unavailable, other available pegylated interferons (eg, ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft) are appropriate. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Chapter 4.2: Treatment of abnormal PTH levels in CKD-MBD

Guideline 4.2.1

We suggest that CKD G3a-G5 patients with progressively rising or persistently elevated PTH levels should be evaluated for modifiable factors, which now includes high phosphate intake and vitamin D deficiency; treatment decisions should not be based on a single elevated value.

Guideline 4.2.2

The updated guideline no longer recommends routine use of calcitriol or its analogs in non-dialysis CKD patients. We suggest that clinicians should reserve their use for severe and progressive SHPT, starting at low dose and avoiding hypercalcaemia.

Guideline 4.2.4

We suggest that calcimimetics, calcitriol and vitamin D analogues are all acceptable therapies for CKD G5D patients requiring PTH lowering therapy. Individual treatment choice should continue to be guided by considerations of concomitant therapies as well as calcium and phosphate levels.

For those patients with severe hyperparathyroidism that fail to respond to medical or pharmacological therapy, we suggest parathyroidectomy.

Chapter 5: Evaluation and treatment of kidney transplant bone disease

Guideline 5.5

As with CKD G3a-G5D, we suggest that DXA may be a useful tool to assess fracture risk in kidney transplant recipients (G5T). Unfortunately, even when in possession of that knowledge, there is a paucity of evidence regarding interventions that reduce future fractures in transplanted patients.

Guideline 5.6

This group suggests considering vitamin D, calcitriol/alfacalcidol, and/or antiresorptive agents in the first year post transplant in patients with a reduced BMD and eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73m 2. However, as there remains no consensus on the optimal treatment strategy for mineral metabolism abnormalities, initiation of antiresorptive agents is likely to remain guided by local practice in this population.

Paediatric specific recommendations

We suggest a calcium-based phosphate binder as the first-line phosphate reduction therapy in children and either combining with, or switching to, sevelamer if a series of serum calcium measurements shows a trend towards the age-adjusted upper limit of normal.

### Update of current therapeutic options for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis [^115rmPnJ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is a common chronic condition in elderly women and is associated with decreased bone strength and an increased risk for fractures. As the incidence of osteoporotic fractures continues to rise, it is important to identify the most effective therapies for reducing patients' risk of fracture.

Objective

This article reviews the medication classes commonly used for treating osteoporosis and the efficacy, tolerability, and drug-interaction potential of specific medications. The evidence for the use of combination therapies is summarized, as are the agents under investigation.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified through a search of MEDLINE (August 1985-August 2005) using the terms osteoporosis, postmenopausal, fracture, and efficacy combined with drug therapy, calcium, vitamin D, estrogen, progesterone, selective estrogen modulators, calcitonin, strontium ranelate, bisphosphonates, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, pamidronate, parathyroid hormone, combination therapy, and zoledronic acid. The identified articles were reviewed for suitability, with priority given to meta-analyses.

Results

Among the therapeutic options for the treatment of osteoporosis, the bisphosphonates appear to provide the greatest antiresorptive efficacy, with some bisphosphonates providing 7% to 8% increases in bone mineral density and 60% to 70% decreases in markers of bone resorption. Bisphosphonates also may reduce the incidence of new vertebral fractures by 50% to 52%.

Conclusions

Bisphosphonates are currently the first choice for the treatment of osteoporosis. Use of intermittent regimens of the newer bisphosphonates appears to be a promising alternative to administration of daily or weekly treatment.

### The role of calcium in peri-and postmenopausal women: consensus opinion of the North American Menopause Society [^114e1H1A]. Menopause (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) established a goal to review the published medical data and develop an evidence-based consensus opinion regarding the role of calcium in peri- and postmenopausal women.

Design

In building this consensus opinion, NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines. As part of that process, NAMS appointed a panel of clinicians and researchers acknowledged to be experts in the field of calcium. Their advice was used to assist the NAMS Board of Trustees in developing this consensus opinion.

Results

Adequate calcium intake (in the presence of adequate vitamin D intake) has been shown to prevent bone loss and reduce fracture risk in peri- and postmenopausal women. Although calcium is not as effective as antiresorptive agents (e.g., estrogen, selective estrogen-receptor modulators, or bisphosphonates), it is an essential component of antiresorptive agent therapy for osteoporosis. Calcium has also been associated with beneficial effects in several nonskeletal disorders, primarily hypertension, colorectal cancer, obesity, and nephrolithiasis, although the extent of those effects and mechanisms involved have not been fully explored. Estimates of adequate intakes of calcium for peri- and postmenopausal women are based on evidence relating to osteoporosis prevention. At least 1,200 mg/day of calcium is required for most women; levels greater than 2,500 mg/day are not recommended. To ensure adequate calcium absorption, a daily intake of 400–600 IU of vitamin D is recommended, either through sun exposure or through diet or supplementation. Since no accurate test to determine calcium deficiency exists, clinicians should focus instead on ensuring that a woman consumes enough calcium to meet the recommended levels.

Conclusion

Although the most definitive role for calcium in peri- and postmenopausal women is in bone health, it is clear that adequate calcium intake has implications that encompass a woman's overall health. Based on the available evidence, a strong statement can be made regarding the importance of ensuring adequate calcium intake in all women, particularly those in peri- or postmenopause.

### Drug insight: existing and emerging therapies for osteoporosis [^116D3kWt]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is a major public health problem that is characterized by microarchitectural deterioration, low bone mass, and increased risk of fractures. Currently, many women and men affected with this disease are not diagnosed or treated. As osteoporosis is often clinically silent, risk-factor assessment and measurement of BMD are needed to identify those who may benefit from osteoporosis therapy. Although adequate daily intake of calcium and vitamin D, and regular weight-bearing exercise are important for skeletal health, they are not adequate treatments for individuals with osteoporosis. Therapies approved for treatment and/or prevention of osteoporosis in the United States include oral bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate and risedronate), calcitonin, estrogens, teriparatide (parathyroid hormone fragment [1–34]), and raloxifene. For most patients, oral bisphosphonates are the treatment of choice, given the large-scale randomized-trial data demonstrating efficacy in fracture reduction, although bisphosphonates that reduce spine and nonspine fractures (e.g. alendronate and risedronate) are preferred. For high-risk patients (those with very low bone density, or with fractures), teriparatide therapy for 2 years should be considered. The treatment paradigm for osteoporosis will evolve further as promising new treatments progress through clinical development.

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^111g2eu7]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients with advanced prostate cancer develop bone metastases, which often result in painful and debilitating skeletal-related events. Inhibitors of bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, can each reduce the incidence of skeletal-related events and delay the progression of bone pain. However, these agents are associated with an increased risk of hypocalcaemia, which, although often mild and transient, can be serious and life-threatening. Here we provide practical advice on managing the risk of hypocalcaemia in patients with advanced prostate cancer who are receiving treatment with bone resorption inhibitors. Relevant references for this review were identified through searches of PubMed with the search terms 'prostate cancer', 'bone-targeted agents', 'anti-resorptive agents', 'bisphosphonates', 'zoledronic acid', 'denosumab', 'hypocalcaemia', and 'hypocalcemia'. Additional references were suggested by the authors.

Main Text

Among patients with advanced cancer receiving a bisphosphonate or denosumab, hypocalcaemia occurs most frequently in those with prostate cancer, although it can occur in patients with any tumour type. Consistent with its greater ability to inhibit bone resorption, denosumab has shown superiority in the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumours. Consequently, denosumab is more likely to induce hypocalcaemia than the bisphosphonates. Likewise, various bisphosphonates have differing potencies for the inhibition of bone resorption, and thus the risk of hypocalcaemia varies between different bisphosphonates. Other risk factors for the development of hypocalcaemia include the presence of osteoblastic metastases, vitamin D deficiency, and renal insufficiency. Hypocalcaemia can lead to treatment interruption, but it is both preventable and manageable. Serum calcium concentrations should be measured, and any pre-existing hypocalcaemia should be corrected, before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption. Once treatment has started, concomitant administration of calcium and vitamin D supplements is essential. Calcium concentrations should be monitored during treatment with bisphosphonates or denosumab, particularly in patients at high risk of hypocalcaemia. If hypocalcaemia is diagnosed, patients should receive treatment with calcium and vitamin D.

Conclusion

With preventative strategies and treatment, patients with prostate cancer who are at risk of, or who develop, hypocalcaemia should be able to continue to benefit from treatment with bisphosphonates or denosumab.

Common oral regimens are alendronate 70 mg weekly and risedronate 35 mg weekly or 150 mg monthly, taken after a prolonged fast, with a full glass of water and at least a 30-minute wait before other intake. Contraindications to oral use include inability to remain upright for 30 to 60 minutes, esophageal abnormalities delaying tablet transit, and documented or potential GI malabsorption. A delayed-release risedronate formulation (Atelvia) can be taken with or after food for upper-GI problems, but upper-GI adverse events are not lower versus conventional preparation.

### Patient information: bisphosphonates for postmenopausal osteoporosis… [^1156o7Am]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Women at highest fracture risk, such as women with osteoporosis diagnosed by bone density testing or women with a personal history of hip or spine fracture, are most likely to benefit from osteoporosis medications. Women receiving osteoporosis medications should have an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D. Most women being treated for osteoporosis receive a bisphosphonate such as alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate, or ibandronate. Because bisphosphonates reside in bone for a long time, they continue to have effects on bone even after they are discontinued. Alendronate and risedronate are taken orally, ibandronate is available as an oral medication or as an intravenous injection, and zoledronate is administered as an intravenous injection. Oral bisphosphonates need to be taken first thing in the morning with a full 8-oz glass of plain water.

After taking an oral bisphosphonate, one should remain upright and wait 30 to 60 minutes before lying down, drinking, or eating. This helps ensure that the medication is absorbed and reduces the chance of side effects. All bisphosphonates lower the risk of spine fractures. Alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronate are most commonly recommended because they also lower the risk of nonspine fractures, including hip fractures. Stomach upset is a possible side effect of oral bisphosphonates, but the risk of this problem is markedly reduced by closely following the medication instructions. Very rare potential harms include loss of blood supply to the jawbone and an unusual fracture of the thigh bone.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw most commonly occurs after invasive dental procedures such as tooth extraction; women taking bisphosphonates should consult their doctor to determine whether to stop the medication before having this type of procedure. Taking bisphosphonates for more than 5 years may increase risk of having an atypical femoral fracture. For many women, limiting the treatment period to 5 years or less maximizes the benefits of taking bisphosphonates in reducing the chance of having typical osteoporotic fractures while minimizing the risk of having an atypical femoral fracture.

Key Points for Practice
- Bisphosphonates, for up to five years orally or three years intravenously, are first-line therapy for osteoporosis.
- Denosumab injections every six months improve bone density more quickly than bisphosphonates, although bone density improvements fade within months after discontinuation unless bisphosphonates are started.
- Parathyroid hormone analog therapy for up to two years dramatically improves bone density and reduces fractures but requires subsequent bisphosphonate use to maintain benefit.
- One year of treatment with romosozumab, a sclerostin-binding analog, followed by one year of alendronate reduces fracture risk more than two years of alendronate therapy alone. Indications for Medical Treatment Medication is recommended for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who have any of the following: T-score of −2.

5 or less for hip, lumbar spine, femoral neck, or distal third of radius History of fragility fracture, including incidental or asymptomatic vertebral fracture T-score between −1. 0 and −2. 5 and increased risk of fracture based on results from a clinical risk assessment tool, such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool. Although teriparatide and abaloparatide improve bone density and reduce vertebral and nonvertebral fracture, abaloparatide increases bone density more than teriparatide and more effectively reduces new vertebral fracture. Romosozumab use increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death, and there is a U. S. Food and Drug Administration boxed warning against use in patients with myocardial infarction or stroke within one year. Romosozumab is contraindicated in patients with hypocalcemia and rarely can lead to osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fracture.

CALCIUM AND VITAMIN D Whereas osteoporosis studies nearly always include calcium and vitamin D supplementation, a review by the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force found no benefit from supplementation in average-risk adults. In postmenopausal women, dietary calcium intake of 1, 000 to 1, 200 mg daily with vitamin D intake of 800 international units daily appears to reduce hip fracture but not vertebral fracture. COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS Soy isoflavones slightly increase bone density. Flax seeds, green tea extract, and the herbal treatment fufang are not beneficial.

### Safety and efficacy in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis… [^116Qy5qJ]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The bisphosphonates are a class of chemicals that share a basic phosphate-carbon-phosphate core and bind strongly to calcium. Over the past two decades, these drugs have assumed a significant role in the treatment of osteoporosis because of their strong avidity for the skeleton and their relative ease of use. Although the precise mechanism of action is not completely understood, these agents strongly inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Based on the recently published guidelines of the National Osteoporosis Foundation, it is most cost effective to consider treating women with a bisphosphonate if they are older than 65 years; have multiple risk factors for osteoporosis and a T-score of lower than –1. 5; and are not currently using HRT.

32 Although these guidelines may change, identification of high-risk patients is the first step in cost-effective treatment of osteoporosis with these newer agents. Safety and Tolerability of Long-Term Bisphosphonate Therapy Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a chronic medical condition that requires long-term treatment. Because of their relative safety, bisphosphonates have been labeled for the treatment of metabolic bone disorders such as Paget's disease. Cyclical etidronate has not been associated with systemic or bone toxicity. The bisphosphonates have minimal non-skeletal toxicity because they bind to bone and are not taken up by other tissues. The reduction in renal function that occurs in animal models with administration of high-dosage parenteral bisphosphonate has not occurred in clinical practice.

However, because bisphosphonates are excreted through glomerular filtration, intravenous administration of large dosages of pamidronate to patients with severe chronic renal failure or patients on dialysis may be accompanied by marked hypocalcemia and/or hypophosphatemia with associated tetany. 28 but, in clinical practice, GI side effects are often noted. The reasons for this difference are not clear. Oral bisphosphonates seem to induce serious esophagitis in some patients, may result in gastritis and cause diarrhea. 40 When used as recommended, serious esophageal complications are few. Patients with known esophageal disease should avoid taking oral bisphosphonates.
