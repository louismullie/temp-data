## Question

Anticoagulation strategies in atrial fibrillation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anticoagulation strategies in atrial fibrillation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why anticoagulation matters. Then, I should verify the risk stratification framework and thresholds for treatment. Next, I will examine agent selection, including DOACs versus warfarin and special populations. After that, I need to check peri-cardioversion and peri-ablation anticoagulation strategies. I will then review bleeding risk assessment and mitigation, followed by monitoring and reassessment cadence. Finally, I should consider special scenarios like subclinical AF, device-detected AF, and post-cardiac surgery AF, and close with a concise decision algorithm summary anchored in shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and rationale. Atrial fibrillation confers a four- to fivefold increased risk of ischemic stroke, and AF-related strokes are more severe and disabling, so stroke prevention is a core pillar of AF care alongside rate or rhythm control, and this mandates a structured, risk-based approach to anticoagulation rather than a one-size-fits-all rule [^116HNC7f] [^111113pp].

> I need to verify the risk stratification framework. Contemporary guidelines endorse CHA2DS2-VASc to estimate annual thromboembolic risk and to guide therapy. Importantly, anticoagulation decisions should be based on stroke risk regardless of AF pattern (paroxysmal, persistent, permanent), and risk should be reassessed periodically because patient risk and preferences evolve over time [^111113pp] [^113dzXfy]. Hold on, I should verify the thresholds: ACC/AHA recommends initiating anticoagulation when the estimated annual risk is at least 2% (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women), and to consider anticoagulation in the 1–2% range (CHA2DS2-VASc 1 in men or 2 in women) through shared decision-making given the more nuanced net benefit in this group [^113zvGVi] [^114sKXey]. I should double-check that ESC aligns with this risk-based approach and emphasizes periodic reassessment, which it does [^1137EyoX].

> Next, I should review agent selection. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy: DOACs are preferred over warfarin for most patients with nonvalvular AF because of superior efficacy-safety profiles, fewer interactions, and no routine laboratory monitoring, with apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban all reasonable options tailored to patient factors and comorbidities [^116oV7Wb] [^111c9caA]. I need to ensure I capture exceptions: warfarin remains indicated for mechanical heart valves and moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, where DOACs are not appropriate, and for these patients the INR target is 2.0–3.0 with attention to time in therapeutic range [^113NEQ5v] [^111ieGBo]. Hold on, I should verify dosing cautions: avoid non–evidence-based DOAC dose reductions because they increase thromboembolism without improving bleeding outcomes, and in ESRD or dialysis the evidence base is limited, so warfarin is often favored when anticoagulation is indicated [^11394PWx] [^113NEQ5v].

> I will now examine peri-cardioversion anticoagulation. For AF of unknown duration or duration greater than 48 hours, anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after cardioversion is recommended, or a TEE-guided strategy with heparin bridging if no thrombus is seen, followed by at least 4 weeks of anticoagulation after restoration of sinus rhythm; if a thrombus is seen, cardioversion should be deferred and anticoagulation continued indefinitely with repeat TEE before attempting conversion [^112AkTaH]. But wait, what if AF is clearly less than 48 hours and the patient is hemodynamically stable? In that scenario, cardioversion without prolonged anticoagulation may be reasonable, though initiating heparin at presentation is a reasonable precaution when no contraindications exist [^114Xzh5h]. I should confirm that atrial flutter follows the same anticoagulation principles as AF, which it does [^115zyyay].

> Next, I should review peri-ablation anticoagulation. Uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation is recommended for catheter ablation to mitigate periprocedural stroke risk, with a warfarin INR goal of 2.0–3.0 if used, and long-term anticoagulation after ablation should be decided by the patient's stroke risk rather than apparent rhythm status, since silent AF may persist and stroke risk does not normalize immediately after ablation [^1165kZWx] [^114QEgYk]. Let me verify that ESC concurs with uninterrupted OAC and imaging in high-risk patients to exclude thrombus; yes, both are endorsed [^111Fia6z] [^114EgSS1].

> I need to check bleeding risk assessment and mitigation. HAS-BLED helps identify modifiable bleeding risks and should not be used in isolation to deny anticoagulation; instead, it should prompt risk-factor modification such as blood pressure control, minimizing NSAIDs, addressing alcohol excess, and improving INR control to keep TTR above 70% when warfarin is used [^116BpMDt] [^116oV7Wb]. Hold on, I should verify the principle that bleeding risk often tracks with stroke risk; indeed, high bleeding risk often coexists with high stroke risk, and population data suggest net clinical benefit of anticoagulation even in patients labeled high bleeding risk, reinforcing the need to mitigate rather than withhold therapy [^116BpMDt].

> Let me consider monitoring and reassessment cadence. I should confirm that guidelines advise periodic reassessment of stroke and bleeding risk, medication adherence, renal function, and drug interactions, typically annually but more frequently with clinical changes; this ensures dosing appropriateness and alignment with evolving risk and preferences [^111113pp] [^1112Nufz]. I need to ensure I emphasize that AF pattern does not alter anticoagulation decisions, which remains a key principle across contemporary guidance [^111113pp].

> Now, special scenarios. For subclinical or device-detected AF, evidence is evolving and decisions should be individualized. Short, infrequent episodes confer lower risk than clinical AF, and ongoing trials are clarifying thresholds for anticoagulation, so shared decision-making and consideration of burden and comorbidities are prudent while we await stronger evidence [^111nTirW] [^1131Vrwd]. For post-cardiac surgery AF, I should double-check duration guidance: anticoagulation is generally continued for at least 60 days after onset, with reassessment of rhythm before discontinuation, and rate or rhythm control strategies are acceptable in stable patients [^115HUpQn]. For hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or cardiac amyloidosis, ESC recommends anticoagulation regardless of CHA2DS2-VASc score due to elevated thromboembolic risk, which I should not overlook [^115gwwYh].

> I should confirm antiplatelet policy. Aspirin or clopidogrel should not be used as alternatives to anticoagulation for stroke prevention in AF, and adding antiplatelet therapy to anticoagulation increases bleeding without improving stroke prevention, so dual therapy should be avoided unless there is a separate compelling indication such as recent coronary stenting, where the shortest feasible triple or dual pathway is preferred [^111dttGL] [^1151gUee] [^111gh54c]. Hold on, I should verify that this stance is consistent across major guidelines; yes, contemporary ACC/AHA and ESC documents align on this point [^111dttGL] [^114YXRMm].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm while keeping shared decision-making front and center. First, calculate CHA2DS2-VASc and estimate annual stroke risk. If risk is at least 2%, recommend anticoagulation, and if risk is 1–2%, engage in shared decision-making considering AF burden, BP control, and patient preferences, ideally with decision aids to improve decisional quality and satisfaction [^113zvGVi] [^114sKXey] [^117FxfZi]. Second, select an agent: prefer a DOAC for most nonvalvular AF, reserving warfarin for mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis and ensuring appropriate dosing without non–evidence-based reductions [^113NEQ5v] [^11394PWx]. Third, assess bleeding risk with HAS-BLED to identify modifiable risks and mitigate them rather than withhold anticoagulation, and plan peri-procedural strategies for cardioversion or ablation as indicated [^116BpMDt] [^112AkTaH] [^111Fia6z]. Finally, schedule periodic reassessment of stroke and bleeding risk, renal function, adherence, and interactions, adjusting therapy as the patient's profile changes over time [^111113pp] [^1112Nufz].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the approach remains dynamic and patient-centered. Anticoagulation in AF is a moving target that requires continuous integration of evolving risk, agent selection tailored to comorbidity, rigorous peri-procedural protocols, and iterative reassessment. Embedding shared decision-making and addressing social determinants improves uptake and outcomes, which is why guidelines increasingly emphasize comprehensive, equitable care pathways for stroke prevention in AF [^111dwEui] [^116HNC7f].

Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation (AF) prevents ischemic stroke and systemic embolism [^113zvGVi], with **DOACs preferred over warfarin** for most patients with nonvalvular AF because of superior efficacy, safety, and convenience [^111c9caA] [^116oV7Wb]. Use **CHA2DS2-VASc** to guide therapy: anticoagulate when the score is ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women [^113zvGVi]; consider anticoagulation at 1 in men or 2 in women via shared decision-making [^114sKXey] [^114ahcis]. Avoid aspirin or antiplatelet monotherapy for stroke prevention [^111dttGL] [^114YXRMm]. Reassess stroke and bleeding risks periodically [^1112Nufz] and adjust therapy as needed [^1112Nufz].

---

## Risk stratification and indications for anticoagulation

- **CHA2DS2-VASc score**: standard for stroke risk stratification; anticoagulate when ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women [^113zvGVi] [^113dzXfy].

- **Intermediate risk**: consider anticoagulation for 1 in men or 2 in women via shared decision-making [^114sKXey] [^114ahcis].

- **Low risk**: no anticoagulation when score is 0 in men or 1 in women (female sex alone) [^116oV7Wb].

---

## Choice of anticoagulant therapy

| **Attribute** | **Doacs (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban)** | **Warfarin** |
|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | Superior or noninferior to warfarin for stroke prevention [^114oW1yB] | Effective but requires INR monitoring [^115A6bqs] [^117CMVg2] |
| Safety | Lower intracranial bleeding risk [^notfound] | Higher bleeding risk; INR monitoring required [^117CMVg2] |
| Convenience | No routine lab monitoring [^112FikNY] | INR monitoring required [^117CMVg2] |
| Special indications | Not for mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis [^113NEQ5v] | Preferred for mechanical valves and moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis [^113NEQ5v] |

---

DOACs are **preferred for most nonvalvular AF** [^111c9caA]; warfarin is reserved for mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis [^113NEQ5v].

---

## Special clinical scenarios

- **Peri-cardioversion**: anticoagulate ≥ 3 weeks before and ≥ 4 weeks after if AF > 48 hours or duration unknown; TEE-guided strategy is acceptable [^112AkTaH].

- **Catheter ablation**: perform with uninterrupted oral anticoagulation [^111Fia6z] [^1165kZWx].

- **Acute coronary syndrome**: minimize triple therapy; use DOAC plus single antiplatelet when possible [^notfound].

---

## Bleeding risk assessment and management

Use **HAS-BLED** to identify modifiable bleeding risks and guide monitoring [^116BpMDt] [^116oV7Wb]. Mitigate bleeding risk by controlling blood pressure, avoiding NSAIDs, and correcting renal dysfunction [^116oV7Wb]. If major bleeding occurs, stop anticoagulation and treat the cause [^113BrHz8].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess stroke and bleeding risks periodically — typically annually or with clinical changes [^111113pp] [^1112Nufz]. Ensure **adherence** and monitor for adverse effects and interactions [^112FikNY].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

NOAC reversal agents (**andexanet alfa, idarucizumab**) enable rapid reversal when needed [^notfound]. Left atrial appendage occlusion (**LAAO**) is an option for patients unsuitable for long-term anticoagulation [^113NEQ5v]. Digital health tools may improve **adherence and monitoring** [^notfound].

---

Anticoagulation in AF centers on **DOACs for most**, risk-guided initiation, and periodic reassessment to balance stroke prevention with bleeding risk [^111113pp].

Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation — synopsis and supportive text — states that prevention "is important in patients with AF to maximize survival, health, and QOL", and therapy selection "should be guided by the patient's risk of stroke, risks of bleeding with therapy, and individual preferences". Decisions "should" be based on stroke risk "regardless of the pattern of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent)" and "should be periodically reassessed since a patient's risk, eligibility, and preferences can change over time". Supportive text adds that although risk is higher with more persistent AF, therapy "should be based on the risk of stroke and not the pattern of AF", and that "Treatment effects with oral anticoagulation are consistent across AF patterns". Ongoing follow-up is emphasized: "Typically, periodic assessment should be performed once a year but might need to be performed more frequently" with clinical changes such as "reduction in renal function or development of additional risk factors".

Atrial fibrillation — recommendations for managing anticoagulants emphasize interaction management, appropriate warfarin intensity, and avoiding off‑label DOAC dosing: For patients with AF receiving direct oral anticoagulants, optimal management of drug interactions is recommended for those on concomitant interacting drugs; for patients with AF receiving warfarin, a target international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3 is recommended along with interaction management, consistent vitamin K intake, and routine INR monitoring to improve time in therapeutic range and minimize preventable thromboembolism or major bleeding; for patients with AF, non–evidence‑based doses of DOACs should be avoided to minimize preventable thromboembolism or major bleeding and to improve survival.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — epidemiology and scope of guideline: AF is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disturbance, increasing in prevalence with age, and it is often associated with structural heart disease, although a substantial proportion of patients with AF have no detectable heart disease; hemodynamic impairment and thromboembolic events related to AF result in significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. These guidelines present a comprehensive review of AF definition, classification, epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and clinical characteristics; review management including prevention of AF, control of heart rate, prevention of thromboembolism, and conversion to and maintenance of sinus rhythm; describe treatment algorithms including pharmacological and nonpharmacological antiarrhythmic approaches and antithrombotic strategies; and are a consensus document that attempts to reconcile evidence and opinion from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common outpatient arrhythmia. The recent ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines outline a variety of approaches to the management of AF, but their implementation into clinical practice requires multi-faceted patient evaluations and assessments for optimizing patient care. Using a case-based approach, issues such as rate versus rhythm control, anticoagulation, cardioversion, pharmacological and catheter ablation for maintenance of sinus rhythm, and the pathophysiology of AF are discussed. These data were originally presented at a satellite symposium titled Case Studies with the Experts: Management Decisions in AF, held on May 10, 2007, during the annual Heart Rhythm Society meeting.

Atrial fibrillation — Class IIb percutaneous coronary intervention: Following percutaneous coronary intervention or revascularization surgery in patients with AF, low-dose aspirin (less than 100 mg per d) and/or clopidogrel (75 mg per d) may be given concurrently with anticoagulation, but these strategies have not been thoroughly evaluated and are associated with an increased risk of bleeding (Level of Evidence: C). In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, anticoagulation may be interrupted to prevent bleeding at the site of peripheral arterial puncture, the vitamin K antagonist should be resumed as soon as possible and the dose adjusted to achieve an INR in the therapeutic range; the maintenance regimen should then consist of clopidogrel, 75 mg daily, plus warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) with clopidogrel for a minimum of 1 mo after a bare metal stent, at least 3 mo for a sirolimus-eluting stent, at least 6 mo for a paclitaxel-eluting stent, and 12 mo or longer in selected patients, and when warfarin is given with clopidogrel or low-dose aspirin the dose intensity must be carefully regulated (Level of Evidence: C).

Atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery — supportive text on rate/rhythm control and anticoagulation states that "The use of beta blockers to control heart rate is well documented" and that "Calcium channel blockers are an option for rate control when beta blockers are ineffective". Rate control or rhythm control "are both acceptable options in hemodynamically stable patients" because "neither has a distinct clinical advantage over the other based on a randomized study that included 529 patients", and "patients in the rhythm-control group received amiodarone". "Cardioversion of patients with sustained postoperative AF is regularly performed", "routinely combined with pharmacological therapy, especially amiodarone". A review of "8 observational studies that included 15 335 patients found a protective impact on the mortality rate at 5 years but no differences in thromboembolic events" with anticoagulants. "In general, the duration of anticoagulation is a minimum of 60 days"; in a randomized trial, if AF "remained" or "recurrent" "48 hours after randomization, anticoagulation was recommended to be continued for 60 days, unless complications occurred", and "Patients should be evaluated before discontinuation to determine underlying rhythm". Postdischarge, "The need for a rhythm-control strategy should be evaluated", as patients on rate control "often convert spontaneously after 6 to 8 weeks", with "earlier discharge" for hemodynamically stable patients; those not converting "can be managed accordingly with rhythm-control strategy". For poorly controlled AF, "cardioversion is reasonable", and for those with " > 48 hours" of AF, "imaging of the LA (even if surgically closed) should be considered".

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116oV7Wb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA₂DS₂-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥ 1 non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor(s).

Atrial fibrillation — Class IIb low-risk and treatment intensification: In patients with AF younger than 60 y without heart disease or risk factors for thromboembolism (lone AF), the risk of thromboembolism is low without treatment and the effectiveness of aspirin for primary prevention of stroke relative to the risk of bleeding has not been established (Level of Evidence: C). In patients with AF who sustain ischemic stroke or systemic embolism during treatment with low-intensity anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0), rather than add an antiplatelet agent, it may be reasonable to raise the intensity of anticoagulation to a maximum target INR of 3.0 to 3.5 (Level of Evidence: C).

### Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation [^111Dw8YH]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, which is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The use of oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate or high risk of stroke, estimated by established criteria, improves outcomes. However, to ensure that the benefits exceed the risks of bleeding, appropriate patient selection is essential. Vitamin K antagonism has been the mainstay of treatment; however, newer drugs with novel mechanisms are also available. These novel oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors) obviate many of warfarin's shortcomings, and they have demonstrated safety and efficacy in large randomized trials of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. However, the management of patients taking warfarin or novel agents remains a clinical challenge. There are several important considerations when selecting anticoagulant therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation. This review will discuss the rationale for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation; risk stratification for treatment; available agents; the appropriate implementation of these agents; and additional, specific clinical considerations for treatment.

### Screening for atrial fibrillation: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116BhRnZ]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation treatment or intervention — care generally has 2 components (managing symptomatic arrhythmia and preventing stroke); symptomatic arrhythmia can be managed by rate control or restoring normal rhythm, with methods including electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion and surgical or catheter ablation; to reduce stroke risk, oral anticoagulants include warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants; guidelines recommend anticoagulant therapy for persons at high risk of stroke; and stroke risk stratification instruments such as CHA2DS2-VASc, which include age ≥ 75 years [doubled] and age 65–74 years among factors, were developed from clinically diagnosed rather than screen-detected AF populations.

### Effectiveness of shared decision making strategies for stroke prevention among patients with atrial fibrillation: cluster randomized controlled trial [^116HNC7f]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia in adults and one of the most common preventable causes of ischemic stroke. Atrial fibrillation affects more than 37 million people worldwide and is projected to affect more than 62 million people by 2050. People with atrial fibrillation are four to five times more likely to have a stroke than those without atrial fibrillation, and atrial fibrillation related strokes are associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared with non-atrial fibrillation related strokes. In patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulants, including warfarin or direct acting oral anticoagulants, can effectively prevent strokes (class I, level of evidence A recommendation). Despite their effectiveness, oral anticoagulants are historically underused, with as many as 50% of at risk patients with atrial fibrillation who are given a prescription for an oral anticoagulants do not start therapy, and 30–50% of those who start therapy discontinue it within one year.

The benefit of oral anticoagulants for prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation is well established, but so are the harms — namely, major bleeding events. Decisions about stroke prevention treatment with oral anticoagulants require understanding and careful consideration of factors such as the risk of thromboembolic events due to inadequate anticoagulation concentrations, the inherent risk of bleeding events, cost considerations, and the necessity for monitoring.

Shared decision making is increasingly recognized as an important part of stroke prevention by prescribing oral anticoagulants in every major clinical practice guideline for atrial fibrillation worldwide. Shared decision making is a process by which clinicians and patients arrive at a healthcare decision together through discussion of risks and benefits in addition to patients' related preferences and values. Several shared decision making tools, or decision aids, have been developed for atrial fibrillation, including patient decision aids designed for use by patients before a clinical encounter and encounter decision aids designed for use by clinicians and patients during a clinical encounter. Evidence has shown the effectiveness of a patient decision aid or encounter decision aid in improving shared decision making outcomes in a clinical setting; however, no reliable estimate exists of the comparative effectiveness of these different types of decision aids in supporting shared decision making in practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a patient decision aid and an encounter decision aid in promoting high quality shared decision making for stroke prevention in the care of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation at risk of stroke.

Anticoagulation risk assessment — Recommendations for anticoagulation are now made based on yearly thromboembolic event risk using a validated clinical risk score, such as CHA2DS2-VASc, and for patients at an intermediate annual risk score who remain uncertain about the benefit of anticoagulation, consideration of other risk variables or other clinical risk scores can improve prediction, facilitate shared decision making, and incorporate into the electronic medical record.

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: current status and near-future directions [^112cgGni]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Prevention of atrial fibrillation-related stroke is an important part of atrial fibrillation management. However, stroke risk is not homogeneous and varies with associated morbidities and risk factors. Risk stratification schemes have been developed that categorize patients' stroke risk into classes based on a combination of risk factors. According to the calculated level of risk, guidelines recommend patients with atrial fibrillation receive antithrombotic therapy either as a vitamin K antagonist or aspirin. Despite recommendations, however, many patients with atrial fibrillation do not receive adequate thromboprophylaxis. We will discuss some of the underlying reasons, in part related to the drawbacks associated with vitamin K antagonists. These highlight the need for new anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation. The novel oral anticoagulants in development may overcome some of the limitations of vitamin K antagonists and address their underuse and safety concerns.

Conclusions

We found that the use of oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with AF newly recommended for anticoagulation under the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines did not result in a reduction in the composite risk of stroke, SE, and death; yet, it was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. These results do not support the changes to anticoagulant therapy recommended by the 2014 guidelines; however, further research is needed to evaluate the benefit/risk ratio of oral anticoagulation in this cohort with low to moderate risk.

Anticoagulation intensity targets in atrial fibrillation (AF) — For patients with nonvalvular AF, an INR of 1.6 to 3.0 is efficacious and relatively safe; for primary prevention in most AF patients under age 75 y and for secondary prevention, an INR of 2.5 (target range 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended, whereas a target INR of 2.0 (target range 1.6 to 2.5) seems reasonable for primary prevention in patients older than 75 y at high risk of bleeding. Maximum protection against ischemic stroke in AF is probably achieved at an INR range of 2.0 to 3.0, whereas an INR range of 1.6 to 2.5 is associated with incomplete efficacy, estimated at approximately 80% of that achieved with higher-intensity anticoagulation; trials targeting INR 1.4 to 2.8 (estimated mean achieved 2.0 to 2.1) found the largest relative risk reductions, but among AF patients with prior stroke or TIA, targeting 2.2 to 3.5 versus 1.5 to 2.1 found a greater rate of major hemorrhage with the higher intensity. Low-intensity anticoagulation requires special efforts to minimize time below the target range because stroke protection is sharply reduced; major bleeding across 5 randomized trials was 1.2% per year, and contemporary intracerebral hemorrhage rates are typically 0.1% to 0.6%.

Atrial fibrillation trial corpus — Since then, 24 randomized trials in nonvalvular AF included 20 012 participants with an average follow-up of 1.6 y, totaling about 32 800 patient-y; patient age averaged 71 y and 36% were women. Trials originated mainly in Europe (14 trials, 7273 participants) and North America (7 trials, 8349 participants). Most evaluated oral vitamin K inhibitors or aspirin in varying doses/intensities, with additional testing of low-molecular-weight heparin, ximelagatran, and antiplatelet agents such as dipyridamole, indobufen, and triflusal. Nine trials had double-blind designs for antiplatelet and anticoagulation comparisons. Five large randomized trials published between 1989 and 1992 evaluated oral anticoagulation mainly for primary prevention, and a sixth trial focused on secondary prevention among patients who had survived nondisabling stroke or TIA.

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [^114oW1yB]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest sustained cardiac rhythm disorder associated with an increased risk of stroke and systemic embolic events. The prevention of stroke using oral anticoagulants has been a pivotal component of AF management. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances in the treatment and prevention of stroke in AF over the last 5 years. We performed a comprehensive structured literature search using MEDLINE for publications from 11 th March 2015 through to 31 st December 2020. We focused mainly on primarily published research articles and systematic reviews including updates in different international guidelines. We found that improved awareness and detection of AF and use of clinical risk stratification are central to the identification of patients at risk of stroke who would benefit from oral anticoagulation. The recommendation of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants over warfarin in both efficacy and safety perspective is represented in all international guidelines. Beyond stroke prevention, there is a move to more holistic or integrated care management of AF, which has been shown to improve outcomes. We conclude that stroke prevention remains a dominant part of the management of patients with AF. Not all stroke risk factors carry equal weight, and many require additional scrutiny (e.g. severity of CAD, type of diabetes, duration of hypertension). The utilization of clinical risk scores to help decision-making should take into account that these scores are mere simplification tools to aid decision-making and the additional clinical benefit with more complex risk scores and addition of biomarkers is limited. Also, stroke and bleeding risks are dynamic and require regular review. Instead of arbitrarily categorizing patients into (artificial) low, moderate, and high stroke risk strata, anticoagulation should be offered to all patients with AF unless they are low risk with no risk factors for stroke. Stroke prevention is also part of the proactive, integrated care approach to holistic management of patients with AF, which can be simplified in the ABC (Atrial fibrillation Better Care) pathway: 'A' Avoid stroke/Anticoagulation; 'B' Better symptom management emphasising patient-centred symptom directed decisions on rate or rhythm control strategies; and 'C' refers to Cardiovascular risk and comorbidity optimization, including lifestyle changes and attention to patient values and preferences, as well as the psychological morbidity associated with AF.

Atrial fibrillation — risk stratification for thromboembolism includes four directives: Patients with AF should be evaluated for their annual risk of thromboembolic events using a validated clinical risk score, such as CHA2DS2-VASc; patients with AF should be evaluated for factors that specifically indicate a higher risk of bleeding, such as previous bleeding and use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, in order to identify possible interventions to prevent bleeding on anticoagulation; patients with AF at intermediate annual risk by risk scores (eg, equivalent to CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 in men or 2 in women) who remain uncertain about the benefit of anticoagulation can benefit from consideration of factors that might modify their risk of stroke to help inform the decision; and in patients deemed at high risk for stroke, bleeding risk scores should not be used in isolation to determine eligibility for oral anticoagulation but instead to identify and modify bleeding risk factors and to inform medical decision-making, labeled "1 B-NR", "1 B-NR", "2a C-LD", and "3: No Benefit" respectively.

### Anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation… [^116sNBcB]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Although anticoagulation decreases the risk of stroke by about two thirds in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, this therapy continues to be significantly underused. Current guidelines for clinical practice are complex and may appear confusing and inconsistent to physicians. Thomson and colleagues used a systematic literature review to develop a decision analysis model for the use of anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and applied the model to data on more than 200 patients. Published studies were identified through MEDLINE and other databases, and were appraised using the criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group. When possible, original data were reanalyzed to meet objective end points. Overall, the data indicated that anticoagulated patients had 42 percent of the stroke risk of placebo-treated patients. Large community-based studies were used to calculate risk of death, disability and subsequent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Interviews with 57 patients with atrial fibrillation were used to provide data on quality of life associated with different health states. Finally, cost estimates were formulated for stroke and for anticoagulant therapy and its complications. The treatment decisions were modeled as a Markov process using a hypothetic cohort of patients followed over several time cycles. All assumptions were made to replicate, as closely as possible, a real practice situation. If necessary, a group consensus model was used to make or validate these assumptions. The model indicated that warfarin should be used in all patients with atrial fibrillation who had three or more risk factors for stroke. In men with atrial fibrillation, warfarin should be used whenever left ventricular hypertrophy and at least one other risk factor are present. Aspirin therapy should be considered in patients with atrial fibrillation who have contraindications to warfarin or anticoagulation.

The authors also prepared a set of decision tables to help physicians determine the risks and likely benefits of warfarin therapy in individual patients based on age, sex, blood pressure and risk factors such as smoking or diabetes.

Proposed management strategies — Management of patients with AF requires knowledge of its pattern of presentation (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent), underlying conditions, and decisions about restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm, control of the ventricular rate, and antithrombotic therapy, and these issues are addressed in the various management algorithms for each presentation of AF.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter — pericardioversion anticoagulation: Anticoagulation is recommended for 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after cardioversion for patients with AF of unknown duration or with AF for more than 48 h, and when acute AF produces hemodynamic instability, immediate cardioversion should not be delayed, but intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous injection of a low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated before cardioversion. Pooled data indicate that 98% of clinical thromboembolic events occur within 10 d, supporting administration of an anticoagulant for at least 4 wk after cardioversion and that continuation for a considerably longer period may be warranted even after apparently successful cardioversion. In a multicenter randomized study (n = 1222), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided and conventional strategies using anticoagulation 3 wk before and 4 wk after cardioversion showed comparably low risks of stroke (0.81% with the TEE approach and 0.50% with the conventional approach). For patients with atrial flutter undergoing cardioversion, anticoagulation should be considered with either strategy, and anticoagulation can be beneficial according to the recommendations as for patients with AF.

Atrial fibrillation — pharmacological management of recurrent persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation is organized by symptoms and rhythm strategy. Minimal or no symptoms are managed with anticoagulation and rate control as needed, while disabling symptoms in AF proceed from anticoagulation and rate control to electrical cardioversion as needed, followed by continuation of anticoagulation as needed and therapy to maintain sinus rhythm; consider ablation for severely symptomatic recurrent AF after failure of greater than or equal to 1 AAD plus rate control. For permanent AF, anticoagulation and rate control as needed are used. Initiate drug therapy before cardioversion to reduce the likelihood of early recurrence of AF, and AAD indicates antiarrhythmic drug.

Neurologists and stroke physicians will be familiar with atrial fibrillation as a major cause of ischaemic stroke, and the role of anticoagulation in preventing cardioembolic stroke. However, making decisions about anticoagulation for individual patients remains a difficult area of clinical practice, balancing the serious risk of ischaemic stroke against that of major bleeding, particularly intracranial haemorrhage. Atrial fibrillation management requires interdisciplinary collaboration with colleagues in cardiology and haematology. Recent advances, especially the now-widespread availability of direct oral anticoagulants, have brought opportunities to improve stroke care while posing new challenges. This article gives an overview of the contemporary diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation, and the associated evidence base. Where there is uncertainty, we describe our own approach to these areas, while highlighting ongoing research that will likely guide future practice.

Atrial fibrillation — decision-making for patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 (2 in women) notes that treatment discussions may be needed and that single-point risk estimates are simplistic. The decision to treat with oral anticoagulants "may at times require additional discussion" because the recommendation strength is "less robust (2a)". The 1-point-concept is "simplistic", and other factors such as AF burden can be considered. In ARISTOTLE, "a single elevated BP measurement" was associated with a "50% increased risk of stroke", and additional patient-specific factors may influence risk but are "unclear" to incorporate into practice.

### Recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in the 2012 focused update of the ESC guidelines on atrial fibrillation: a commentary [^111XyVVA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide a commentary on the recommendations for stroke prevention from the 2012 focused update of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of atrial fibrillation and the evidence (or lack of it) supporting these recommendations. These guidelines strongly advocate a major clinical practice shift towards initially focusing on the identification of 'truly low risk' patients who do not need any antithrombotic therapy. After this initial decision-making step, effective stroke prevention - that is, oral anticoagulation therapy (whether as well-controlled adjusted dose warfarin or with one of the novel oral anticoagulants) - could be offered to patients with atrial fibrillation with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors. The 2012 focused update guideline also provides additional guidance on advances in stroke and bleeding risk assessment that are evident since publication of the 2010 guideline, as well as recommendations on the use of the novel oral anticoagulants and the left atrial appendage occlusion devices that have been increasingly used in European clinical practice over the last 2 years.

Atrial fibrillation oral anticoagulation efficacy — Meta-analysis using intention-to-treat shows adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation reduces all stroke versus placebo with a risk reduction of 62% (95% CI 48% to 72%). By on-treatment analysis excluding patients not undergoing oral anticoagulation at the time of stroke, the preventive efficacy of oral anticoagulation exceeded 80%. Among the randomized trials, 4 were placebo controlled; of the 2 that were double blinded with regard to anticoagulation, one was stopped early because of external evidence that oral anticoagulation was superior to placebo, and the other included no female subjects. In 3 trials dosing was regulated by prothrombin time ratio; 2 used INR target ranges of 2.5 to 4.0 and 2.0 to 3.0. Follow-up was generally between 1 and 2 y, with the longest 2.2 y.

### Update on medical management of atrial fibrillation in the modern era [^116UKMQL]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

The management of atrial fibrillation involves control of the ventricular response rate, anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke and attempts to maintain sinus rhythm. The approach to patients with atrial fibrillation has become increasingly complex as therapeutic options have expanded. The ultimate reasons to treat atrial fibrillation include improvement in symptoms, reduction in adverse outcomes and improvement in survival. Despite increasing interest in non pharmacological approaches to treat and potentially cure atrial fibrillation, drugs remain the primary method to treat most patients. This review updates the present state-of-the-art regarding medical management of atrial fibrillation based on present and emerging evidence.

ACC/AHA/ESC atrial fibrillation — newly discovered atrial fibrillation: When AF persists, one option is to accept progression to permanent AF with antithrombotic therapy and control of the ventricular rate, and the diagnosis of AF in a patient with risk factors for thromboembolism should prompt long-term anticoagulation. Although it may seem reasonable to make at least one attempt to restore sinus rhythm, the AFFIRM study showed no difference in survival or quality of life with rate-control compared with rhythm-control strategies, so the decision to attempt restoration of sinus rhythm should be based on the severity of arrhythmia-related symptoms and the potential risk of antiarrhythmic drugs, with anticoagulation and rate control important before cardioversion. In patients with AF present for more than 3 mo, early recurrence is common after cardioversion, and antiarrhythmic medication may be initiated before cardioversion (after adequate anticoagulation) to reduce the likelihood of recurrence, with the duration of drug therapy brief (e.g., 1 mo).

Anticoagulation thresholds in atrial fibrillation — intermediate risk: although risk stratification schemes identify patients who benefit most and least from anticoagulation, the threshold for use of anticoagulation is controversial, and opinion is particularly divided about anticoagulation for those at intermediate risk (stroke rate 3% to 5% per year); some advocate routine anticoagulation at this level, whereas others favor selective anticoagulation with weight given to bleeding risks and preferences, and the threshold of benefit at which AF patients choose anticoagulation varies, with some at intermediate risk electing anticoagulation whereas others do not.

In light of the limitations of available pharmacologic treatment options (suboptimal efficacy plus safety and tolerability issues), atrial fibrillation management should be individualized based on patient characteristics and comorbidities that could influence response to specific management approaches. The importance of adequate anticoagulation should not be overlooked. This review provides a practical guide for primary care physicians, internists, and cardiologists on current management strategies for atrial fibrillation, based on recent guidelines and current clinical data.

### Management of atrial fibrillation: updated guidance from the AHA… [^113NEQ5v]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Anticoagulation is recommended for AF at a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 2 for men and 3 for women without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical valve. The score has not been validated for mitral stenosis or mechanical valves.
- Direct oral anticoagulants are recommended over warfarin for AF without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical valve. Warfarin is still recommended for mitral stenosis and mechanical valves.
- Although CHA 2DS 2-VASc scores of 0 for men and 1 for women do not require treatment, scores of 1 for men and 2 for women are indeterminate and anticoagulation may be considered by shared decision-making. Key Recommendations HIGH-QUALITY EVIDENCE Based on high-quality evidence, oral anticoagulants should be prescribed for women with AF and a CHA.

Direct oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, are preferred to warfarin unless the patient has concomitant moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Based on new data, the recommended set-points for anticoagulation have been increased, and the previous recommendation to prescribe an anticoagulant for all patients with AF who have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack has been removed. Based on new evidence and FDA approval of a new appendage closure system, percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion is an option for patients with AF and a higher risk of stroke who are unable to take anticoagulants for a long duration because of bleeding risk or poor tolerance. Patients treated via this method have fewer hemorrhagic strokes than those treated with warfarin, but with a nonsignificant trend towards more ischemic strokes.

Based on expert opinion, patients with AF without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve who are taking warfarin, but whose international normalized ratio is not being maintained in a therapeutic range, should have their treatment regimen changed to a direct oral anticogulant. Because there are no data indicating that the benefits are greater than the harms, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban should be avoided in patients with AF and ESRD or on dialysis.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1131Vrwd]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS atrial fibrillation (AF) guideline — identified gaps and research priorities span ablation outcomes, devices, procedural standards, candidate selection, artificial intelligence, anticoagulation strategies, subclinical AF thresholds, risk scores, and LAA strategies. Historically, ablation failure has been defined as having 30 seconds of AF, yet this 30-second metric might not reflect meaningful burden reduction and patient-oriented outcomes are emphasized. Consumer wearable heart monitoring devices are widespread for AF diagnosis and therapy monitoring, but validation of accuracy and how best to use them, including for AF screening, must be better defined. Large practice variation in AF ablation persists; large registries and more data are required, the value of extra ablation lines remains uncertain, and best approaches to persistent AF and repeat ablation are poorly defined. Better criteria and clinical markers are needed to identify when catheter ablation is unlikely to benefit and to define candidacy for first-time and repeat procedures. Artificial intelligence could potentially tailor therapy choices such as anticoagulation versus left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO), rhythm versus rate control, or catheter ablation versus medical therapy. After ablation, ongoing trials are assessing anticoagulation strategies because it is unclear in whom anticoagulation can be discontinued; studies of intermittent or continuous rhythm monitoring to guide anticoagulation are underway, and "PITP" or "electrocardiographic-guided" approaches are investigational. For subclinical AF, the AF burden threshold that mandates stroke-prevention therapy must be better defined. Reliance on the CHA2DS2-VASc score may limit use of other potentially useful scores, and additional studies are needed for group-specific tools. Surgical left atrial appendage (LAA) exclusion has shown benefit but rigorous trials included concomitant anticoagulation; more evidence is needed for patients with anticoagulation contraindications and around rhythm-control interventions such as cardioversion.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — preventing thromboembolism (Class I) states that antithrombotic therapy to prevent thromboembolism is recommended for all patients with AF, except those with low risk or contraindications (Level of Evidence: A), and the selection of the antithrombotic agent should be based upon the absolute risks of stroke and bleeding and the relative risk and benefit for a given patient (Level of Evidence: A). For patients without mechanical heart valves at high risk of stroke, chronic oral anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin K antagonist is recommended in a dose adjusted to achieve the target intensity of an INR of 2.0 to 3.0, unless contraindicated, and factors associated with high risk include prior thromboembolism and rheumatic mitral stenosis (Level of Evidence: A). Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist is recommended for patients with more than 1 moderate risk factor, including age 75 y or greater, hypertension, HF, impaired LV systolic function (ejection fraction 35% or less or fractional shortening less than 25%), and diabetes mellitus (Level of Evidence: A). INR should be determined at least weekly during initiation of therapy and monthly when anticoagulation is stable (Level of Evidence: A). Aspirin, 81–325 mg daily, is recommended as an alternative to vitamin K antagonists in low-risk patients or in those with contraindications to oral anticoagulation (Level of Evidence: A). For patients with AF who have mechanical heart valves, the target intensity of anticoagulation should be based on the type of prosthesis, maintaining an INR of at least 2.5 (Level of Evidence: B). Antithrombotic therapy is recommended for patients with atrial flutter as for those with AF (Level of Evidence: C).

### Overview of the management of atrial fibrillation: what is the current state of the art? [^114VTEob]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

Management of Atrial Fibrillation. There are three fundamental approaches to the management of atrial fibrillation (AF): rate control, rhythm control, and anticoagulation. Selecting a course of treatment requires a thorough knowledge of these therapeutic alternatives. This article explores treatment options, including the relative benefits of rate control versus rhythm control, which are complicated by the lack of highly effective and safe antiarrhythmic drugs. Anticoagulation is also an important issue in AF management, and warfarin effectively reduces the incidence of thromboembolic events in AF patients. The use of warfarin, however, presents its own complications. We conclude that individualization of therapy is paramount when treating AF.

Atrial flutter — appendage flow and anticoagulation around cardioversion mirror atrial fibrillation patterns. LAA flow velocities are lower in patients with atrial flutter than are usually seen during sinus rhythm but higher than in AF. As in AF, atrial flutter is associated with low appendage emptying velocities following cardioversion with the potential for thromboembolism, and anticoagulation is similarly recommended.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Management overview — Management of patients with AF involves 3 objectives — rate control, prevention of thromboembolism, and correction of the rhythm disturbance, and these are not mutually exclusive. The initial management decision involves primarily a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy; under the rate-control strategy, the ventricular rate is controlled with no commitment to restore or maintain sinus rhythm, while the rhythm-control strategy attempts restoration and/or maintenance of sinus rhythm and also requires attention to rate control. Depending on the patient's course, the strategy initially chosen may prove unsuccessful and the alternate strategy is then adopted.

### Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^114Xzh5h]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Guidelines Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations indicate that most patients would make the same choice and Grade 2 suggests that individual patient's values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133[suppl]:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following (all vitamin K antagonist [VKA] recommendations have a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.5; range 2.0–3.0, unless otherwise noted). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who have had a prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin, because of the high risk of future ischemic stroke faced by this set of patients (Grade 1A). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who have two or more of the risk factors for future ischemic stroke listed immediately below, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1A). Two or more of the following risk factors apply: age > 75 years, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure. In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, with only one of the risk factors listed immediately above, we recommend long-term antithrombotic therapy (Grade 1A), either as anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin (Grade 1A), or as aspirin, at a dose of 75–325 mg/d (Grade 1B). In these patients at intermediate risk of ischemic stroke we suggest a VKA rather than aspirin (Grade 2A). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, age ≤ 75 years and with none of the other risk factors listed above, we recommend long-term aspirin therapy at a dose of 75–325 mg/d (Grade 1B), because of their low risk of ischemic stroke. For patients with atrial flutter, we recommend that antithrombotic therapy decisions follow the same risk-based recommendations as for AF (Grade 1C). For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1B). For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA at an intensity appropriate for the specific type of prosthesis (Grade 1B). See CHEST 2008; 133(suppl):593S-629S. For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration for whom pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion is planned, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin, for 3 weeks before elective cardioversion and for at least 4 weeks after sinus rhythm has been maintained (Grade 1C). For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration undergoing pharmacological or electrical cardioversion, we also recommend either immediate anticoagulation with unfractionated IV heparin, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or at least 5 days of warfarin by the time of cardioversion (achieving an INR of 2.0–3.0) as well as a screening multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). If no thrombus is seen, cardioversion is successful, and sinus rhythm is maintained, we recommend anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks. If a thrombus is seen on TEE, then cardioversion should be postponed and anticoagulation should be continued indefinitely. We recommend obtaining a repeat TEE before attempting later cardioversion (Grade 1B addressing the equivalence of TEE-guided vs non-TEE-guided cardioversion). For patients with AF of known duration < 48 h, we suggest cardioversion without prolonged anticoagulation (Grade 2C). However, in patients without contraindications to anticoagulation, we suggest beginning IV heparin or LMWH at presentation (Grade 2C).

### The 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112FikNY]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The current manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA. Additional information and downloads of the text and anticoagulation cards in different languages can be found on an EHRA website (www.NOACforAF.eu).

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^116XDtfT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

### Viewpoint: stroke prevention in recent guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: an appraisal [^113G6AX5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Formal guidelines play an important role in disseminating the best available evidence knowledge and are expected to provide simple and practical recommendations for the most optimal management of patients with various conditions. Such guidelines have important implications for many disease states, which thereby could be more professionally managed in everyday clinical practice by clinicians with divergent educational backgrounds, and also more easily implemented in wards or outpatient clinics, eliminating inequalities in health care management. In this brief Viewpoint we provide an appraisal on the recommendations pertinent to the prevention of atrial fibrillation-related stroke or systemic thromboembolism, as provided in recently published guidelines for the management of this arrhythmia.

### Practical management of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation [^115AJ6uG]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation has become more complex due to the introduction of new anticoagulant agents, the number and kinds of patients requiring therapy, and the interactions of those patients in the matrix of care. The management of anticoagulation has become a "team sport" involving multiple specialties in multiple sites of care. The American College of Cardiology, through the College's Anticoagulation Initiative, convened a roundtable of experts from multiple specialties to discuss topics important to the management of patients requiring anticoagulation and to make expert recommendations on issues such as the initiation and interruption of anticoagulation, quality of anticoagulation care, management of major and minor bleeding, and treatment of special populations. The attendees continued to work toward consensus on these topics, and present the key findings of this roundtable in a state-of- the-art review focusing on the practical aspects of anticoagulation care for the patient with atrial fibrillation.

Atrial fibrillation with recent stroke or TIA — antithrombotic management: Unless a clear contraindication exists, patients with a recent stroke or TIA should be treated with long-term anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet therapy, there is no evidence that combining anticoagulation with an antiplatelet agent reduces the risk of stroke compared with anticoagulant therapy alone, and for those who sustain cardiocembolic events while receiving low-intensity anticoagulation, anticoagulation intensity should be increased to a maximum target INR of 3.0 to 3.5 rather than routinely adding antiplatelet agents.

Current US guidelines strongly support the use of chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and ≥ 2 stroke risk factors, without regard of AF duration or burden. 1 Device‐detected AF of various durations, often referred to as subclinical AF, has been shown to be associated with increased stroke risk, though at a rate less than that of clinically detected AF. 2, 3, 4 Anticoagulation recommendations for clinical AF are based on studies of stroke risk in the clinical AF population. 1 While patients may have both clinical and subclinical AF, the increasing use of implantable and consumer‐grade technologies capable of detecting AF will likely increase the latter population significantly. There is, however, considerable clinical equipoise about the management of these episodes of subclinical AF, particularly those that are paroxysmal and of short duration. Even the 2019 update of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines noted that it is not yet clear what the optimal management strategy is in these patients with regards to anticoagulation. 1 There are trials currently being conducted to answer this question, but in the meantime, clinicians are presented with such clinical scenarios daily. 5, 6

A recent statement from the American Heart Association noted the considerable evidence gap in answering this clinical question. 7 Given the uncertainty of anticoagulation management in device‐detected AF and the absence of randomized trial results for guidance, it is of interest to determine the practice patterns of anticoagulation use in patients with device‐detected AF among US physicians.

Atrial fibrillation — preventing thromboembolism (Class IIa) specifies that for primary prevention of thromboembolism in patients with nonvalvular AF who have just 1 validated risk factor, antithrombotic therapy with either aspirin or a vitamin K antagonist is reasonable, based upon an assessment of bleeding risk, ability to safely sustain adjusted chronic anticoagulation, and patient preferences, listing age greater than or equal to 75 y, hypertension, HF, impaired LV function, or diabetes mellitus (Level of Evidence: A). For patients with nonvalvular AF who have 1 or more less well-validated risk factors, antithrombotic therapy with either aspirin or a vitamin K antagonist is reasonable for prevention of thromboembolism, including age 65 to 74 y, female gender, or CAD, and the choice of agent should be based upon bleeding risk, ability to safely sustain adjusted chronic anticoagulation, and patient preferences (Level of Evidence: B). It is reasonable to select antithrombotic therapy using the same criteria irrespective of the pattern (i.e., paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent) of AF (Level of Evidence: B). In patients with AF who do not have mechanical prosthetic heart valves, it is reasonable to interrupt anticoagulation for up to 1 wk without substituting heparin for surgical or diagnostic procedures that carry a risk of bleeding (Level of Evidence: C).

### North American thrombosis forum, AF action initiative consensus document [^113iLajR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The North American Thrombosis Forum Atrial Fibrillation Action Initiative consensus document is a comprehensive yet practical briefing document focusing on stroke and bleeding risk assessment in patients with atrial fibrillation, as well as recommendations regarding anticoagulation options and management. Despite the breadth of clinical trial data and guideline recommendation updates, many clinicians continue to struggle to synthesize the disparate information available. This problem slows the uptake and utilization of updated risk prediction tools and adoption of new oral anticoagulants. This document serves as a practical and educational reference for the entire medical community involved in the care of patients with atrial fibrillation.

Bleeding risk scores and anticoagulation decision-making — Unless an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation is present, bleeding risk scores have limitation in clinical decision-making because the most commonly used scores (HAS–BLED, HEMORR2HAGES, and ATRIA) are based on clinical factors that indicate higher risks of both stroke and bleeding, and patients with higher risk of bleeding also tend to have a higher risk of stroke. Furthermore, a bleeding risk score cannot be interpreted in isolation because it does not assess the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation or balance the risk of bleeding against the risk of stroke. Population-based studies suggest that the benefits of stroke prevention with anticoagulation generally outweigh the risks of bleeding, even in patients determined to be at high risk for bleeding. Decision-making about oral anticoagulation should be based on consideration of both benefits and harms, not by using bleeding risk scores in isolation, and the best utility of these scores may be identifying potential modifying risk factors.

### Risk stratification for stroke in atrial fibrillation: a critique [^115oLRn4]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite the demonstrable success of oral anticoagulants in reducing the rate of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, they continue to be seriously underutilized. Indications for their use as stated in the guidelines incorporate a number of risk score algorithms, the most widely used being the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Nonetheless there are several limitations to the various scores currently in clinical use and a critique of these is the focus of this review. In this review we discuss the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation and its role in thromboembolic stroke risk. We amalgamate this with the basis of major professional society anticoagulation recommendations with regards to the strengths and limitations of current risk stratification strategies and discuss gaps in our current evidence base and next steps to address those gaps.

### Aetiology, secondary prevention strategies and outcomes of ischaemic stroke despite oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation [^115cv98M]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral anticoagulation with either direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) or vitamin K-antagonists (VKA) reduces the risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). However, there is a substantial residual stroke risk in patients with AF despite anticoagulation ranging from 0.7% to 2.3% annually in primary and secondary prevention, respectively. Since the introduction of DOAC, the overall use of oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with AF has increased steadily, particularly in patients with AF at the highest stroke risk. Due to this development, the number of patients with AF suffering a stroke despite anticoagulation is expected to increase, too. Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with AF and stroke despite anticoagulation are at a higher risk for future recurrence than patients who were naive to anticoagulation treatment before stroke.

For stroke physicians, ischaemic stroke despite anticoagulation in patients with AF represents a challenge in everyday clinical practice, as its aetiology is not well-understood. Competing stroke mechanisms such as large artery and small vessel disease, as well as non-adherence or inappropriately dosed anticoagulation have been discussed as potential causes of stroke despite anticoagulation, but few data on their relative frequency exist. A better understanding of the aetiology of stroke despite anticoagulation is needed to inform strategies to prevent recurrence after a stroke despite anticoagulation. So far, limited data suggested no benefit from switching the anticoagulant type. Indeed, the optimal management of patients with stroke despite anticoagulation remains unclear, and the latest guidelines offer no recommendations on this.

We therefore sought to (i) describe the aetiology of stroke despite oral anticoagulation and (ii) investigate subsequent preventive strategies and outcomes in a large collaborative study of patients with AF and stroke despite anticoagulation from 11 experienced stroke centres.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation antithrombotic therapy — risk thresholds and number needed to treat — shows that patients with a stroke risk of 2% per year or less do not benefit substantially from oral anticoagulation because it would require treating 100 or more patients for 1 y to prevent a single stroke, whereas for high‑risk patients with stroke rates of 6% per year or greater the number needed‑to‑treat is 25 or fewer, strongly favoring anticoagulation; opinion remains divided about routine anticoagulation for patients at intermediate stroke risk (annual rate 3% to 5%).

Percutaneous coronary intervention in atrial fibrillation — postprocedure antithrombotic maintenance specifies that after any temporary interruption, the vitamin K antagonist should be resumed promptly and dosing adjusted to a procedure-range INR; aspirin may be given temporarily, but the maintenance regimen should consist of clopidogrel, 75 mg daily, plus warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) for 9 to 12 mo, after which warfarin may be continued as monotherapy if no subsequent coronary event occurs.
