## Question

Duration of antibiotics for uncomplicated uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal duration of antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection, considering different populations and antibiotic agents. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining uncomplicated UTI and the core stewardship principle. Then, I should verify first-line agents and their guideline-supported durations in nonpregnant adult women. Next, I will examine the evidence base supporting shorter courses, including Cochrane and network meta-analyses. After that, I need to check special populations such as men, older adults, pregnancy, and children. I will then review complicated UTI and pyelonephritis durations to avoid conflating syndromes. Finally, I should consider implementation gaps and synthesize a practical, agent-specific recommendation with caveats about resistance and patient factors.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and the overarching principle. Uncomplicated UTI in this context refers to acute cystitis in nonpregnant, immunocompetent women without structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities, and the stewardship principle is to use the shortest effective duration to minimize adverse effects and resistance while maintaining clinical cure, which is consistently endorsed by contemporary guidelines and reviews [^1132xnmk] [^1122cGCL].

> I will now examine first-line agents and their recommended durations in nonpregnant adult women. Wait, let me verify the exact durations: nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5 days, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg twice daily for 3 days, trimethoprim monotherapy 100 mg twice daily for 3 days, and fosfomycin 3 g as a single dose are all guideline-endorsed options, with the choice guided by local resistance and patient factors. Beta-lactams are generally less preferred for empiric therapy due to resistance and lower short-course efficacy, though they may be used when first-line options are unsuitable [^1132xnmk] [^1122cGCL].

> Next, I should review the evidence supporting 3-day regimens versus longer courses. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check both symptomatic and bacteriologic outcomes. The Cochrane review of 32 RCTs found no difference in short-term symptomatic failure between 3 days and 5–10 days, but a higher bacteriologic failure with 3 days in some comparisons, particularly at longer follow-up, which explains why some agents like nitrofurantoin are favored at 5 days despite 3-day symptom control being acceptable in many cases [^114RLvXD]. Let me verify the network meta-analysis signal as well; for several agents, shorter courses achieve comparable clinical cure, reinforcing the feasibility of abbreviated therapy when supported by agent-specific data [^117No2kf].

> Now, I should confirm the rationale for nitrofurantoin 5 days. Initially, I thought 3 days might suffice based on general short-course principles, but wait, I should double-check the comparative data. Evidence suggests 5-day nitrofurantoin achieves better bacteriologic eradication than 3 days while maintaining favorable tolerability, which aligns with guideline preference for a 5-day course despite the theoretical appeal of an even shorter regimen [^1132xnmk] [^1122cGCL].

> Let me consider men with lower UTI symptoms. I need to ensure I do not conflate cystitis with prostatitis. For afebrile men with suspected uncomplicated lower UTI, a 7-day course of TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone is reasonable and supported by a randomized trial showing 7 days was noninferior to 14 days for symptom resolution; however, if acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected, many experts favor 10–14 days given the risk of tissue penetration requirements and recurrence, acknowledging limited direct duration evidence in that subgroup [^115K5nfa] [^116wywDX].

> For older adults, I should confirm whether durations differ. Hold on, I should verify the geriatric data. Cochrane reviews in elderly women suggest that short-course therapy of 3–6 days can be sufficient and that extending to 7–14 days does not clearly improve clinical outcomes, supporting the application of standard short-course regimens in otherwise healthy older adults; however, frailty, comorbidities, or atypical presentations may necessitate individualized decisions and culture-guided therapy [^114giEYo] [^117TcBoR] [^1132xnmk].

> Pregnancy requires special caution. I need to check ASB and symptomatic UTI guidance. For asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, treat for 4–7 days rather than shorter, and for symptomatic cystitis, extend to 7 days to reduce the risk of progression; agent selection should prioritize beta-lactams such as amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin, or fosfomycin, avoiding TMP-SMX near term and fluoroquinolones throughout pregnancy [^116pPSDe].

> Children are a different category, so I should be careful not to overgeneralize adult durations. For febrile UTI or pyelonephritis, traditional guidance supports 7–14 days, but emerging pediatric data suggest that shorter courses, including 7 days, may be noninferior in selected children. For lower tract cystitis in children, some studies suggest 2–4 days can be as effective as 7–14 days, though this remains less established and should be individualized with attention to age, severity, and follow-up [^112KQckX] [^113TcUvx] [^112N8jzD].

> I should now distinguish complicated UTI and pyelonephritis from uncomplicated cystitis to avoid duration errors. For complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis, IDSA suggests shorter effective courses when patients are improving clinically: 5–7 days for fluoroquinolones or 7 days for non-fluoroquinolone agents, rather than 10–14 days, with the caveat that some subgroups may need longer therapy and that source control remains critical; for bacteremic cUTI, 7 days is reasonable if using agents with excellent oral bioavailability and the patient is improving, whereas 10 days may be needed when IV beta-lactams are continued without comparable oral step-down [^117Smpys] [^117G4Hrr] [^113kLr8k].

> Next, I should review implementation and real-world adherence, because evidence without uptake limits impact. Excessive durations remain common in practice, with studies showing many prescriptions exceed guidelines by 1–3 days, and stewardship interventions such as EHR defaults and audit-and-feedback can markedly improve adherence to recommended durations and reduce total antibiotic days without compromising outcomes [^111W8eDK] [^111oQFmd] [^113JiPeu].

> Let me synthesize a practical, agent-specific approach while keeping the shortest-effective principle front and center. For nonpregnant adult women with uncomplicated cystitis, use nitrofurantoin for 5 days, TMP-SMX or trimethoprim for 3 days, or single-dose fosfomycin, selecting based on local resistance and patient allergies. Avoid routine use of beta-lactams for empiric therapy unless first-line options are contraindicated, and reserve fluoroquinolones for resistance-driven scenarios given safety concerns and stewardship priorities [^1132xnmk] [^1122cGCL].

> Finally, I should confirm key caveats and follow-up. If symptoms persist beyond 48–72 hours or recur within 2–4 weeks, obtain a urine culture and reassess for resistant organisms, atypical pathogens, or anatomic issues. In patients with recurrent UTI, treat acute cystitis episodes as short as reasonable, generally no more than 7 days, and consider culture-directed adjustments to minimize collateral damage and resistance selection [^1132xnmk] [^117R5hjq].

For uncomplicated UTI in nonpregnant women, **3–5 days** is the recommended antibiotic duration [^1122cGCL] [^117No2kf]: nitrofurantoin for 5 days [^1132xnmk], trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 3 days [^1122cGCL], or fosfomycin as a single dose [^1122cGCL]. Shorter courses are effective [^114RLvXD], have fewer adverse effects [^114RLvXD], and reduce resistance risk [^113LH3ve]; longer courses are not superior and increase adverse events [^114RLvXD]. For men, **7 days** is recommended due to higher risk of prostatitis [^1132xnmk] [^115K5nfa]. In pregnancy, treat for 7 days with beta-lactams or nitrofurantoin [^notfound]. Adjust duration for immunocompromise, severe symptoms, or resistance risk [^111Hu8AB].

## Recommended antibiotic durations for uncomplicated UTI

| **Patient population** | **Recommended duration** | **Antibiotic options** |
|-|-|-|
| Nonpregnant women | 3–5 days | - Nitrofurantoin (5 days) [^1132xnmk] [^1122cGCL] <br/> - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (3 days) [^1122cGCL] <br/> - Fosfomycin (single dose) [^1122cGCL] |
| Men | 7 days | - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [^1132xnmk] <br/> - Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) [^115K5nfa] |
| Pregnant women | 7 days | - Beta-lactams (e.g. amoxicillin, cephalexin) [^notfound] <br/> - Nitrofurantoin |

## Evidence supporting shorter antibiotic durations

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses show that **shorter antibiotic courses (3–5 days)** are as effective as longer courses (7–14 days) for symptomatic cure in uncomplicated UTI [^114RLvXD] [^117No2kf]. They also result in fewer adverse effects, improved adherence, and reduced risk of antibiotic resistance [^114R1CdB] [^113LH3ve].

- **Nitrofurantoin**: 5-day regimens are as effective as 7–10 day regimens, with lower adverse event rates [^117RCSCu] [^114RLvXD].
- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole**: 3-day regimens are effective and associated with fewer adverse effects than longer courses [^114R1CdB].
- **Fosfomycin**: Single-dose regimens are effective, particularly for uncomplicated cystitis [^1122cGCL].

---

## Risks and benefits of shorter antibiotic durations

### Benefits

Benefits include **fewer adverse effects** — such as gastrointestinal disturbances, rash, and Candida infections — with shorter courses [^114RLvXD]. Shorter regimens also improve adherence and reduce early discontinuation, and reduced antibiotic exposure lowers selection pressure and resistance risk [^114R1CdB] [^112Axdyr].

---

### Risks

Risks include a slightly higher **bacteriologic recurrence** with very short courses (e.g. single-dose fosfomycin) in some studies, though clinical outcomes remain similar [^114RLvXD]. Clinical failure is uncommon but may occur in patients with complicated or recurrent infections [^117Smpys].

---

## Clinical factors influencing duration of antibiotic therapy

Several factors influence the **appropriate duration** of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated UTI:

- **Patient demographics**: Age, sex, and pregnancy status significantly influence duration recommendations [^1132xnmk].
- **Comorbidities**: Immunocompromised patients or those with diabetes may require longer courses due to increased risk of complications [^117Smpys] [^117WUogp].
- **Severity of symptoms**: Severe or persistent symptoms may necessitate longer treatment durations.
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Local resistance patterns and prior antibiotic exposure influence regimen selection and duration [^111s2fcA].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American College of Physicians (ACP), and American Urological Association (AUA) consistently recommend **short-course antibiotic therapy** (3–5 days) for uncomplicated UTI in nonpregnant women [^1122cGCL] [^113HmjFr]. They emphasize the importance of antibiotic stewardship, patient-specific factors, and local resistance patterns in determining optimal treatment duration [^113LH3ve].

---

## Special considerations and exceptions

- **Pregnancy**: Requires longer treatment durations (typically 7 days) due to increased risk of complications [^notfound].
- **Men**: Generally require longer courses (7 days) due to higher risk of prostatitis [^1132xnmk] [^115K5nfa].
- **Recurrent UTIs**: May necessitate individualized treatment durations based on patient history and risk factors [^114JpJPa].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Shorter antibiotic courses (**3–5 days**) are recommended for uncomplicated UTI in nonpregnant women, balancing efficacy with safety and resistance concerns [^1122cGCL]. Individualize duration based on patient-specific factors, comorbidities, and local resistance patterns [^111Hu8AB].

### Improvement in adherence to antibiotic duration of therapy recommendations for uncomplicated cystitis: a quasi-experimental study [^111oQFmd]. Family Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common diagnoses for which antibiotic treatment is prescribed in the outpatient setting. Despite the availability of national guidelines, there remains a wide pattern in prescriber choices for therapy. Recent data portray a picture of consistently longer durations than recommended prescribed in outpatient settings.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the effect of a system-based intervention on adherence to guideline-recommended durations of therapy for uncomplicated cystitis in the outpatient setting.

Methods

This quasi-experimental study included women aged 18–64 years who were seen at five family medicine clinics at an academic medical centre and were prescribed targeted antibiotics for uncomplicated cystitis (nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg or ciprofloxacin 250 mg). The intervention involved revising or adding pre-filled, but modifiable, default prescribing instructions in the electronic health record (EHR) for the targeted antibiotics. We evaluated adherence to guideline-recommended duration of therapy as well as days of therapy (DOT) before and after the intervention.

Results

A total of 787 pre-intervention and 862 post-intervention cases were included. Adherence to recommended duration of therapy increased from 29.4% to 76.3% (P < 0.01). The average DOT decreased by 23% from 6.6 to 5.1 (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

A stewardship intervention consisting of revising/adding default prescribing instructions to targeted antimicrobials in an EHR was associated with increased adherence to recommended durations of therapy for uncomplicated cystitis and reduction of unnecessary antibiotic exposure. More studies are needed to confirm effectiveness across multiple medical record platforms.

### Intravenous antibiotic durations for common bacterial infections in children: when is enough enough? [^117KNjXU]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections in hospitalized children sometimes extend well beyond clinical recovery and are often the primary determinants of length of stay. These durations, however, are not always based on solid evidence. Moreover, fixed durations are invariant to important individual factors. We review guidelines and the available evidence for durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for meningitis, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and osteomyelitis, conditions where intravenous antibiotics often extend beyond resolution of clinical symptoms. We propose a framework for the duration of therapy that is intended to serve as a guide when standards of care are either nonexistent, dated, conflicting, or contrary to evidence from published studies. This framework incorporates patient-centered factors such as severity of infection, response to therapy, ease of intravenous access, harms and costs of ongoing intravenous treatment, and family preferences.

### The best rules for antimicrobial stewardship in urogenital tract infections [^113LH3ve]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) belong to the most common community-acquired and nosocomial infections, but therapy of UTIs is limited by resistance of pathogens and nonoptimal using of antibacterials. Narrative review of recent (2020–2018) literature dedicated to antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in urological infections has been done.

Recent Findings

Analysis of recent 64 articles has shown following principles of AMS for UTIs: selecting the correct drug, correct dose, and shortest clinically effective duration of therapy whenever possible, is a base for optimal antimicrobial stewardship; symptomatic UTIs should be treated with antimicrobials to alleviate symptoms, and in the case of more serious infection, to prevent complications; in both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, quantitative culture is the gold standard for diagnosis; we have to avoid prescriptions of antibiotics when possible; we have to follow European and National Guidelines; we must avoid prescription of fluoroquinolones as empiric therapy for UTIs by many reasons, one of these is urogenital tuberculosis; the choice of antibiotic for UTI should be based on local level of resistance of uropathogens.

Summary

Studies of antimicrobial stewardship in urology are limited. Nevertheless, there are some golden rules, which may help to reduce inappropriate use of antimicrobials, improve patient outcomes, reduce side effects of antibiotic therapy, decrease the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant infections, as well as decrease total costs of the therapy.

### Association of antibiotic treatment duration with recurrence of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in pediatric patients [^113ZzB9t]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Gaps and inconsistencies in published information about optimal antibiotic treatment duration for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in pediatric patients pose a dilemma for antibiotic stewardship. Objective: Evaluate the association of antibiotic treatment duration with recurrence rates in children with new-onset cystitis or pyelonephritis. Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of patients aged 2 to 17 years with new-onset cystitis or pyelonephritis and without renal/anatomical abnormality was conducted using Truven Health MarketScan Database for 2013–2015. Results: Of 7698 patients, 85.5% had cystitis, 14.3% pyelonephritis. Duration of antibiotic treatment was as follows: 3 to 5 days for cystitis (20.4%) or 7 (33.6%), 10 (44.2%), or 14 (1.8%) days for any UTI. Recurrence occurred in 5.5% of patients. Covariates associated with increased recurrence risk included pretreatment antibiotic exposure (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.06–1.57), pyelonephritis on diagnosis date (OR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.03–2.00), follow-up visit during antibiotic treatment (OR = 3.21; 95% CI = 2.20–4.68), parenteral antibiotic (OR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.33–2.69), and interaction of pyelonephritis diagnosis with nitrofurantoin monotherapy (OR = 3.68; 95% CI = 1.20–11.29). After adjustment for covariates, the association between duration of antibiotic treatment and recurrence was not significant (compared with 7 days: 10 days: OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.85–1.33; 14 days: OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.45–1.78). Conclusions and Relevance: Antibiotic treatment duration was not significantly associated with recurrence of uncomplicated UTI in a national pediatric cohort. Results provide support for shorter-course treatment, consistent with antimicrobial stewardship efforts.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116fXk2s]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1124xoE5]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic prophylaxis evidence synthesis: the systematic review identified 28 trials evaluating antibiotics for prevention of rUTI, most were rated as medium to high risk of bias, and sample sizes ranged from 26 to 308 (total N = 2,758). These trials demonstrated that antibiotics perform better than placebo with consistent results across antibiotics, and the duration of preventive treatment ranged from 6 to 12 months. When comparing prophylactic antibiotic use to placebo or no antibiotics, antibiotics were associated with a decreased likelihood of experiencing ≥ 1 UTI recurrence (11 studies; RR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.37; I² = 14%; absolute risk difference [ARD]: −46%, 95% CI: −56% to −37%). Because most relevant randomized controlled trials were published prior to 1995, results should be interpreted in light of current resistance patterns.

### Selecting an antibiotic for acute UTI in women… [^112DC7dv]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women can be treated effectively with a one- to three-day course of antibiotics. However, the effectiveness of various regimens has not been well-studied. McCarty and colleagues compared the safety and efficacy of a three-day course of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of acute UTI in women. 3 colony-forming units per mL of urine, pyuria, dysuria and urinary frequency. Exclusion criteria included bacteriuria, urinary tract obstruction, neurogenic bladder or multiple causative organisms. Those who met the inclusion criteria were randomized to receive a three-day course of either 100 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily, 200 mg of ofloxacin twice daily or 160/800 mg of TMP/SMX twice daily. Patients were evaluated at baseline, on day three, between days three and 10, and four to six weeks after the study was completed.

Two thirds of the women had no previous history of UTI and had had symptoms for at least two days. Serial urine cultures were obtained to determine effectiveness, and adverse events were recorded. Clinical responses were defined as resolution of symptoms, failure, indeterminate or recurrence. A total of 688 women were enrolled in the study. Of these, 229 received ciprofloxacin, 231 received ofloxacin and 228 received TMP/SMX. Bacteria were eradicated in 94 percent of patients in the ciprofloxacin group, 97 percent in the ofloxacin group and 92 percent in the TMP/SMX group. Symptoms resolved in more than 90 percent of patients in all groups by the end of the treatment period. Recurrence occurred after four to six weeks in only 61 patients, with most instances of recurrence caused by E. coli and affecting patients in the TMP/SMX group.

Adverse events, including gastrointestinal disturbances, rash and fever, occurred more commonly in the ofloxacin and TMP/SMX groups than in the ciprofloxacin group. The authors conclude that each of the antibiotic regimens tested was effective in treating acute uncomplicated UTI in women. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are more expensive than TMP/SMX, but their side effect profiles are better. Because of increasing prevalence of TMP/SMX–resistant.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^111DGJZF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, ranking as the second most frequent indication for antibiotic prescribing in the outpatient setting. The majority of UTIs are "uncomplicated", occurring in non-pregnant adult women who are not immunocompromised and have normal genitourinary structure and function. Each year, 12.6% of women will have a UTI, and half of all women will have at least one UTI by age 32. The standard of care for uncomplicated UTI is oral antibiotic therapy, which typically leads to rapid symptom resolution and reduces the risk of complications such as pyelonephritis.

In recent years, growing antibiotic resistance has led to efforts to use antibiotics more judiciously. Specifically for uncomplicated UTIs, these initiatives have sought to reduce the amount — either duration or frequency — and spectrum of antibiotics. – Interviews with women indicate willingness to delay or avoid antibiotic prescriptions when safe to do so. Furthermore, some UTIs are self-limited without treatment and thus may not require antibiotic therapy. For example, a randomized controlled trial comparing nitrofurantoin with placebo for uncomplicated UTI demonstrated spontaneous symptomatic cure or improvement in over half of participants receiving placebo who had UTIs as proven by a combination of symptoms/signs and positive laboratory testing. While a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials found placebo to be inferior to antibiotics for resolution of UTI symptoms, it is unclear whether non-antibiotic treatment regimens for uncomplicated UTIs may be feasible as an outpatient antibiotic stewardship strategy. For example, cranberry extract was initially considered a potential antibiotic-sparing option; however, subsequent research has not supported its use in the treatment of UTI over antibiotics.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^113BEzPi]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Main outcome measures

The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit (short-term clinical cure). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with absence of fever and resolution of UTI symptoms (either absence of symptoms or at least 2 points improvement on a 0–5 point severity score scale), without additional antimicrobial therapy (for relapse of UTI). Secondary outcome measures were bacteriological cure through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit, clinical cure rate through the 70- to 84-day post-treatment visit (cumulative clinical cure), all-cause mortality, adverse event rate determined at 10–18 days and 70–84 days post-treatment, and rate of UTI relapses. In addition, outcome measures were analyzed as stratified by specific predefined subgroups (men, patients with complicated UTI, older age, patients with bacteremic UTI). Bacteriologic cure was defined as eradication of the study entry uropathogen with no recurrence of bacteriuria (pathogen growth < 10⁴ CFU/mL in women or < 10³ CFU/mL in men of a midstream urine culture combined with disappearance of leucocyturia).

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^117TcBoR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7 to 14 days) for older women, but the evidence for such recommendations is unclear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTI in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies, screened reference lists of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International and Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings without language restriction. Date of most recent search: 7 May 2008.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women were included. Whenever possible we obtained outcome data for older women included in studies with a broader age range. We excluded patients with fever, flank pain or complicating factors; studies with treatment durations longer than 14 days and prevention studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen studies (1644 elderly women) were included. Three studies compared single dose with short-course treatment (3 to 6 days), six compared single dose with long-course treatment (7 to 14 days) and six compared short- with long-course treatment. Methodological quality of all studies was low except for a more recent geriatric study. There was a significant difference for persistent UTI between single dose and short-course treatment (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.84) and single versus long-course treatment (RR 1.93, 1.01 to 3.70 95% CI), in the short-term (< 2 weeks post-treatment) but not at long-term follow-up or on clinical outcomes. Patients preferred single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88) to long-course treatments, but this was based on one study comparing different antibiotics. Short versus longer treatments showed no significant difference in efficacy. Rate of adverse drug reactions increased significantly with longer treatment durations in only one study.

Authors' Conclusions

Short-course treatment (3 to 6 days) could be sufficient for treating uncomplicated UTIs in elderly women, although more studies on specific commonly prescribed antibiotics are needed.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^112KQckX]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy duration for febrile UTI — the total course of therapy should be 7 to 14 days, and there is evidence that 1- to 3-day courses for febrile UTIs are inferior to courses in the recommended range; therefore, the minimal duration selected should be 7 days. Outcomes of short courses (1–3 d) are inferior to those of 7- to 14-d courses, and there are minimal harm and minor cost effects of antimicrobial choice and duration of therapy. Aggregate quality of evidence: A/B (RCTs), intentional vagueness notes that no evidence distinguishes the benefit of treating 7 vs 10 vs 14 days, and the policy level is Strong recommendation/ recommendation.

Patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens — recent antibiotic class exposure: In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest avoiding fluoroquinolones if the patient has been exposed to that class of antibiotic in the past 12 months (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that more recent antibiotic exposure may be a better guide than more distant antibiotic exposure.

### Duration of therapy for women with uncomplicated UTI… [^111NER75]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the most appropriate duration of therapy for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women. Evidence-Based Answer Three days of antibiotic therapy is as effective as longer courses for treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in women. Practice Pointers Uncomplicated UTIs in women are one of the most common indications for antibiotics. To prevent resistance, antibiotics should be used judiciously; thus, it is important to determine the minimum duration of antibiotic therapy required for treatment to be effective. Milo and colleagues reviewed 32 randomized controlled trials comparing three days of oral antibiotic therapy with longer courses for women 18 to 65 years of age. Pregnant women and women with symptoms that suggest upper UTI were excluded.

For short- and long-term resolution of symptoms, the reviewers found no difference between a three-day antibiotic course and a course lasting five to 10 days. Longer courses were more effective at clearing the bacteria on follow-up culture but also caused more adverse effects, and it is not clear that bacterial clearance results in improved patient-oriented outcomes. Although data were limited, organisms cultured were not more likely to be resistant to antibiotics after treatment in either group. For most women, a three-day course of antibiotics is sufficient to treat symptoms. The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement guideline 1 recommends treatment with double-strength trimethoprim/sulfa-methoxazole, one tablet twice per day for three days; or trimethoprim at a dosage of 100 mg twice per day for three days.

For women who are allergic to these first-line medications, the ICSI guideline 1 recommends ciprofloxacin at a dosage of 250 mg twice per day for three days, or nitrofurantoin at a dosage of 100 mg twice per day for seven days. Telephone screening and prescription of treatment is appropriate if there are no complicating factors. In the office, urinalysis is adequate for evaluating symptoms.

Regarding medical management for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, first-line therapy, ACP 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate a short course of antibiotics with either nitrofurantoin for 5 days, TMP/SMX for 3 days, or fosfomycin as a single dose in female patients with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis.

### Appropriate antibiotic treatment of genitourinary infections in hospitalized patients [^1113oSqY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The etiology of urinary tract infections (UTIs) that require hospitalization, whether they originate in the hospital or in the community, is changing, with increasing findings of gram-positive organisms. The Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) criteria recommend evaluating treatment choices on the basis of sound clinical evidence, potential for therapeutic benefits, safety, optimal duration of treatment, and cost-efficacy in order to improve antibiotic treatment. Evidence-based guidelines recommend fluoroquinolones for the treatment of patients with cases of pyelonephritis or bacterial prostatitis severe enough to warrant hospitalization. For other serious UTIs, fluoroquinolones are usually recommended either when traditional agents have failed or when resistance to traditional agents is high. Even in the context of rapidly changing antimicrobial resistance patterns, the fluoroquinolones have maintained consistent, well-tolerated efficacy against many of the principal organisms responsible for UTIs, and are generally considered safe for most patients. To increase the likelihood of treatment success with first-line therapy, an antimicrobial agent must attain sufficient concentrations in the target tissue or in the urine for an appropriate amount of time. Both levofloxacin and gatifloxacin are excreted unchanged in the urine in concentrations that far exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration of most uropathogens. Factors that affect cost-effectiveness that should be considered include acquisition costs as well as treatment success and ease of use for hospital staff.

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^113wS4eQ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^112WBDMH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent kidney damage. There remains uncertainty regarding the optimum antibiotic regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2003 and updated in 2005 and 2007.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of antibiotics used to treat children with acute pyelonephritis. The aspects of therapy considered were 1) different antibiotics, 2) different dosing regimens of the same antibiotic, 3) different duration of treatment, and 4) different routes of administration.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings without language restriction to 10 April 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This updated review included 27 studies (4452 children). This update included evidence from three new studies, and following re-evaluation, a previously excluded study was included because it now met our inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed as low for sequence generation (12 studies), allocation concealment (six studies), blinding of outcome assessors (17 studies), incomplete outcome reporting (19 studies) and selective outcome reporting (13 studies). No study was blinded for participants or investigators. The 27 included studies evaluated 12 different comparisons. No significant differences were found in duration of fever (2 studies, 808 children: MD 2.05 hours, 95% CI -0.84 to 4.94), persistent UTI at 72 hours after commencing therapy (2 studies, 542 children: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.41) or persistent kidney damage at six to 12 months (4 studies, 943 children: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12) between oral antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and intravenous (IV) therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly, no significant differences in persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment (4 studies, 305 children: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.55) or persistent kidney damage (4 studies, 726 children: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.29) were found between IV therapy (three to four days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy (seven to 14 days). No significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (1 study, 179 children, persistent clinical symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53). Adverse events were mild and uncommon and rarely resulted in discontinuation of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review increases the body of evidence that oral antibiotics alone are as effective as a short course (three to four days) of IV antibiotics followed by oral therapy for a total treatment duration of 10 to 14 days for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children. When IV antibiotics are given, a short course (two to four days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy is as effective as a longer course (seven to 10 days) of IV therapy. If IV therapy with aminoglycosides is chosen, single daily dosing is safe and effective. Insufficient data are available to extrapolate these findings to children aged less than one month of age or to children with dilating vesicoureteric reflux (grades III-V). Further studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of antibiotic therapy required for acute pyelonephritis.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^113TcUvx]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

National guidelines recommend treating children with pyelonephritis for 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy, yet data are lacking to suggest a more precise treatment duration.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes of children receiving a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective observational study using inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis of data from 5 hospitals in Maryland between July 1, 2016, and October 1, 2018. Participants were children aged 6 months to 18 years with a urine culture growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, or Proteus mirabilis with laboratory and clinical criteria for pyelonephritis.

Exposures

Treatment of pyelonephritis with a short-course (6 to 9 days) vs a prolonged-course (10 or more days) of antibiotics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Composite outcome of treatment failure within 30 days of completing antibiotic therapy: (a) unanticipated emergency department or outpatient visits related to urinary tract infection symptoms, (b) hospital readmission related to UTI symptoms, (c) prolongation of the planned, initial antibiotic treatment course, or (d) death. A subsequent urinary tract infection caused by a drug-resistant bacteria within 30 days was a secondary outcome.

Results

Of 791 children who met study eligibility criteria (mean [SD] age 9.2 [6.3] years; 672 [85.0%]) were girls, 297 patients (37.5%) were prescribed a short-course and 494 patients (62.5%) were prescribed a prolonged-course of antibiotics. The median duration of short-course therapy was 8 days (interquartile range, 7–8 days), and the median duration of prolonged-course therapy was 11 days (interquartile range, 11–12 days). Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups in the inverse probability of treatment weighted cohort. There were 79 children (10.1%) who experienced treatment failure. The odds of treatment failure were similar for patients prescribed a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics (11.2% vs 9.4%; odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.75–1.98). There was no significant difference in the odds of a drug-resistant uropathogen for patients with a subsequent urinary tract infection within 30 days when prescribed a short-courses vs prolonged-course of antibiotics (40% vs 64%; odds ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.09–1.43).

Conclusions and Relevance

The study findings suggest that short-course antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged-courses for children with pyelonephritis, and may mitigate the risk of future drug-resistant urinary tract infections. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^112XZiFX]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Blood cultures were obtained in 339 patients, of which 80 (24%) had bacteremia with growth of E. coli in the majority of the cases (n = 67, 84%).

Both treatment regimens resulted in a high clinical cure rate at short-term follow-up in the ITT population (90% vs. 95% in patients treated for 7 or 14 days, respectively) (Table 3). The difference in short-term clinical cure rate between both treatment arms was 4.5% (90% CI, –10.7 to 1.7, P non-inferiority = 0.072). Accordingly, the criteria for non-inferiority were not met as the 90% CI exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 10%. The median time to defervescence did not differ between the two groups: 2 (IQR, 1–2) days in 7-day antimicrobial treatment, 2 (IQR, 1–3) days in 14-day antimicrobial treatment. Short-term clinical cure was 85% in non-randomized patients, whereas median time to defervescence amounted to 2 (IQR, 1–3) days. Among all analysis performed, there were no significant differences between ITT and PP analysis. Therefore, within the following, only outcomes of ITT analysis are presented.

### Efficacy and safety of individualised versus standard 10-day antibiotic treatment in children with febrile urinary tract infection (INDI-UTI): a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in Denmark [^112amWAz]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

The optimal antibiotic duration for febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in children remains uncertain. We aimed to assess whether individualised treatment was non-inferior to standard 10-day treatment in terms of recurrent UTI and superior in reducing overall antibiotic exposure.

Methods

INDI-UTI was a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial conducted at eight Danish hospitals. Children aged 3 months to 12 years who were febrile (≥ 38°C), within 24 h of treatment start, and with significant growth of uropathogenic bacteria were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based module with randomly permuted blocks to individualised or standard 10-day treatment. Main exclusion criteria included known urinary tract abnormalities, complicated medical history, bacteraemia, and elevated serum creatinine. The individualised group stopped treatment 3 days after adequate clinical improvement (ie, absence of fever, flank pain, and dysuria), with a minimum treatment duration of 4 days. The primary outcomes were recurrent UTI within 28 days after treatment cessation (non-inferiority margin 7·5 percentage points) and total antibiotic days within 28 days of treatment initiation (superiority assessment). No sample size calculation was performed for the assessment of total antibiotic days. Safety was assessed in all included patients. Main analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05301023.

Findings

Between March 28, 2022, and March 3, 2024, 694 patients were assessed for eligibility and 408 patients were randomly assigned to individualised (n = 205; median antibiotic duration 5·3 days [IQR 4·8 to 6·5]) or standard 10-day treatment (n = 203; 10·0 days [10·0 to 10·0]). Median age was 1·5 years (IQR 0·7 to 5·4), and there were 326 (80%) female and 82 (20%) male participants. Recurrent UTI within 28 days occurred in 23 (11%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 12 (6%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 5·3 percentage points, one-sided 97·5% CI -∞ to 11·1, p non_inferiority = 0·24). Total antibiotic days within 28 days were 6·0 (IQR 5·3 to 7·5) in the individualised group and 10·0 (10·0 to 10·0) in the standard 10-day group (median difference -4·0 days [97·5% CI -4·5 to -3·7], p < 0·0001). The incidence rate of antibiotic-related adverse events within 28 days was 6·8 per 100 patient-days in the individualised group and 11·1 per 100 patient-days in the standard 10-day group (rate ratio 0·61 [95% CI 0·47 to 0·80], p = 0·0003). Serious adverse events occurred in 17 (8%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 15 (7%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 0·9 percentage points [95% CI -4·6 to 6·5], p = 0·79).

Interpretation

Children with febrile UTI assigned to individualised treatment duration had an increased risk of recurrent UTI (by 5·3 percentage points) but reduced antibiotic use and fewer adverse event days within 28 days compared with those assigned to standard 10-day treatment. These findings highlight the potential of individualised treatment strategies to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated harms in most children with febrile UTI, supporting antimicrobial stewardship goals. Further research is needed to identify those requiring 10-day treatment to avoid compromising care for most children with febrile UTI who respond well to shorter durations.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns for adult urinary tract infections within emergency department and urgent care settings [^112fHoxa]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a common reason for emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) visits. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) are frequently prescribed for treatment of UTI in the outpatient setting; however, data evaluating prescribing patterns after FDA safety warnings is limited, especially in UC. The study goal was to investigate and compare antimicrobial prescribing for UTIs in a single-site ED and an off-site UC in an urban, academic health system. This retrospective study included patients presenting with a UTI to the ED or UC between January and June 2018. Those 18 years or older with uncomplicated, complicated UTI, or pyelonephritis were included. Exclusion criteria were catheter-related UTI, urinary tract abnormalities, immunocompromised, or hospitalization. Primary outcome was FQ prescribing rate for all UTI in the ED and UC. Secondary outcomes were rates of non-FQ prescribing, re-presentation, bug-drug mismatch, and treatment durations. 184 patients were included. FQ prescribing rate was similar in ED and UC (21.2% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.4). Non-FQs prescribed in ED and UC were nitrofurantoin (20.2% vs 53.6%), beta-lactams (46.1% vs 22.6%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (12.5% vs. 5%). A longer than recommended duration was identified in 46.3% UC patients compared to 21.2% ED patients. Thirty-day re-presentation with persistent UTI symptoms occurred more frequently in the ED compared to UC (13.5% vs. 7.5%). Predictors of FQ prescribing on logistic regression were male, recurrent UTI, and malignancy. FQ prescribing rate for UTI treatment was low with no difference between ED and UC. Opportunity exists to improve treatment duration and antimicrobial choice.

### Effect of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy on resolution of… [^115K5nfa]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 272 men with presumed symptomatic UTI, resolution of initial UTI symptoms by 14 days after completion of active antibiotic therapy occurred in 122 of 131 participants in the 7-day group and 111 of 123 in the 14-day group, a difference that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 10%. The prespecified primary outcome was resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after completion of active antibiotic treatment. A noninferiority margin of 10% was selected. The as-treated population was used for the primary analysis, and a secondary analysis included all patients as randomized, regardless of treatment adherence. Secondary outcomes included recurrence of UTI symptoms and/or adverse events within 28 days of stopping study medication.

Conclusions and Relevance Among afebrile men with suspected UTI, treatment with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 7 days was noninferior to 14 days of treatment with regard to resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after antibiotic therapy. The findings support the use of a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as an alternative to a 14-day course for treatment of afebrile men with UTI. In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for afebrile men with UTI, 7 days of treatment was noninferior to 14 days for the primary outcome of symptom resolution. There was no statistically significant difference in the secondary outcome of participant-reported recurrence of UTI symptoms, and reported adverse events were not notably different between groups.

Among afebrile men with suspected UTI, treatment with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 7 days was noninferior to 14 days of treatment with regard to resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after antibiotic therapy. The findings support the use of a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as an alternative to a 14-day course for treatment of afebrile men with UTI. Corresponding Auth.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^113JiPeu]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Unlike upper respiratory infections, which typically involve viral infections for which antibiotics are not indicated, a symptomatic UTI merits treatment with antibiotics, as recommended by the IDSA guidelines. Thus, the focus in implementing antibiotic stewardship for UTI needs to be optimisation of antibiotic choice and duration, which may present a different cognitive challenge for practitioners than deciding whether a patient needs antibiotics or not. One evidence-based strategy shown to be effective in implementing an antimicrobial stewardship for UTI in acute and long-term care settings is audit and feedback. Multiple strategies have been employed for implementing stewardship such as feedback to prescribers on antimicrobial consumption and antimicrobial stewardship committee. Based on our prior successful experience with audit and feedback in acute and long-term care, we implemented a multifaceted antimicrobial stewardship intervention using audit and feedback to improve compliance with acute cystitis guidelines in a family medicine setting (general practice). The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted stewardship intervention on adherence to the evidence-based practice guidelines on treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in primary care. We hypothesised that our intervention would increase guideline adherence in terms of antibiotic choice and duration of treatment.

### A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials comparing short-and long-course antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infections in children [^111118Ux]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Short-course antibiotic regimens, ranging in duration from a single dose to 3 days, are the current standard of care for the treatment of acute lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adult women. Despite multiple small randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) showing no difference in efficacy between short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) therapy in children, concerns about occult pyelonephritis and renal scarring have prompted standard recommendations of 7 to 14 days of antibiotics for UTIs in children.

Objective

To determine whether long-course antibiotic therapy is more effective than short-course therapy for the treatment of UTIs in children, and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity in the results of existing studies.

Methods

We searched online bibliographic databases (Medline and Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry) for RCTs comparing short- and long-course therapy for the treatment of UTI in children, and examined the references of all retrieved articles. Candidate studies for meta-analysis were restricted to RCTs comparing short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) outpatient therapy for acute UTI in children age 0 to 18 years. We excluded studies that were restricted to children with recurrent UTI or included children with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was evaluated using a 9-item scoring system developed by the investigators. Data on the primary outcomes-treatment failure and reinfection rate-were extracted when available and reanalyzed based on intention to treat whenever possible. To determine whether anatomic level of infection (upper vs lower urinary tract) influenced the results, the meta-analysis was repeated on the subgroup of studies that attempted to restrict their participants to children with lower UTI. To determine whether there was a dose-response effect for the duration of short-course therapy, we performed separate subgroup analyses of studies of single-dose or single-day therapy and studies of 3-day therapy. To explore other potential sources of study result heterogeneity, such as study quality and patient age, we developed a random-effects regression model that included these variables as covariates.

Results

The pooled estimate for the relative risk (RR) of treatment failure with short-course antibiotic therapy was 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19–3.15) and for the RR of reinfection was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.39–1.47). When we excluded the 3 studies that did not attempt to restrict their participants to patients with lower UTI, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.74 (95% CI: 1.05–2.88) and of reinfection was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.32–1.52). For the subgroup of studies comparing single-dose or 1-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 2.73 (95% CI: 1.38–5.40) and of reinfection was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.12–1.18). For the subgroup of studies comparing 3-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.36 (95% CI: 0.68–2.72) and of reinfection was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.46–2.13). In the meta-regression, neither study quality nor mean participant age was significantly associated with the odds ratio of treatment failure or reinfection, in either the complete set of studies or the subset of studies restricted to patients with lower UTI.

Conclusions

In pooled analyses of published studies comparing long- and short-course antibiotic treatment of UTI in children, long-course therapy was associated with fewer treatment failures without a concomitant increase in reinfections, even when studies including patients with evidence of pyelonephritis were excluded from the analysis. Until there are more accurate methods for distinguishing upper from lower UTI in children, no additional comparative trials are warranted and clinicians should continue to treat children with UTI for 7 to 14 days.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116wywDX]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

### Uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1142cqa9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) present a significant problem for women and a challenge for the doctors who care for them. The diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI, which usually is not challenging, can be achieved best by a thorough assessment of patient symptoms with or without the addition of a urine dipstick test. Treatment should be based on the most recent Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, taking into account resistance patterns in the local community. The patient who suffers from recurrent UTIs can be treated safely and effectively with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or self-initiated treatment.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^111mp65f]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Study population

The study population included all patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis at the intervention and control sites. Inclusion criteria for uncomplicated cystitis required that participants be women ≥ 18 years who had International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes (N30.0, acute cystitis; N30.9, cystitis unspecified; and N39.0 UTI site not specified) for UTI listed as a diagnosis in the EMR system (Epic Clarity database). In addition to a UTI-related diagnosis, patients must have also been prescribed a UTI-relevant antibiotic during the same visit. UTI-relevant antibiotics included fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, trimethoprim alone or in combination with sulfamethoxazole, beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. The electronic algorithm, using ICD-10 UTI diagnosis codes paired with medication data to identify patients with UTI, was validated in the same setting. Visits that met criteria for complicated UTI or had recorded signs or symptoms of pyelonephritis were excluded (eg, an additional code for genitourinary abnormalities or recorded fever, defined as ≥ 100.4°F or 38°C). We also excluded five patients who had allergies to both nitrofurantoin and sulfa-containing antibiotics and those prescribed long-term antibiotics indicating prophylaxis for recurrent UTI (figure 1).

Figure 1
Selection process used to determine uncomplicated cystitis visits in the study period*. The study period was from July 2016 to February 2019. *Visits may have had more than one exclusion criteria. UTI, urinary tract infection; ICD, International Classification of Diseases.

For each eligible visit, we extracted the following variables: patient age, race, comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Score), antibiotic allergies, type of antibiotic prescribed and duration of treatment. If a patient returned to the clinic within 7 days of initial treatment due to UTI, the case was considered as a failure of previous treatment. In these cases, only the original visits were included in the study. We included women with diabetes because recent evidence suggests that diabetic women presenting with acute cystitis in primary care should be managed similarly to women without diabetes. We also included women aged ≥ 65 years, as treatment recommendations for otherwise healthy older women are similar to those for younger women. Each record was manually reviewed by a team member (GG or MG) to rule out the possibility of contraindication to all first-line antibiotics.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^1174z6KP]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

For two of the antibiotic indications we studied, treatment was frequently prescribed for shorter durations than recommended — both urinary tract infections in men: acute cystitis and acute prostatitis. This could arise because prescribers appreciate that recommendations for these conditions are based on expert opinion and historical precedent rather than evidence, and that treatment durations for urinary tract infections in women have declined considerably in recent years. It needs to be established whether shorter treatment durations are effective for men with urinary tract infections, as this is a small but important patient population with a risk of harm from under-treatment. Notably, the conditions for which course durations tended to be less than recommended in the guidelines were those for which evidence supporting duration of treatment is weak (supplementary figs S5-S7).

In general, the preference seemed to be for antibiotic prescriptions with durations of five or seven days or multiples thereof, without a clear evidence base for this preference. The preference for such durations has been observed previously in other settings and depended more on local practice and subspecialty than on clinical features such as fever, comorbidities, and severity. In addition, for conditions where guidelines recommend longer durations, the percentage of prescriptions beyond the recommendation is substantially lower than for conditions where guidelines recommend a relatively short duration.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^1173Bk4S]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

As UTIs are one of the most common indications for antibiotic therapy, the impact of a reduction of treatment duration could be enormous. This study provides evidence that guidance of antibiotic therapy in patients with a UTI by a PCT-pyuria algorithm for antibiotic guidance is feasible. The implementation of an algorithm into clinical workflows is practicable as shown by our group in respiratory tract infections. The efficacy of this approach is evidenced by the 90 day observation period for the primary endpoint, which included both the initial and any subsequent antibiotic treatments.

Overall and in most subgroups (except for the small subgroup of patients with uncomplicated simple UTIs), the PCT-pyuria algorithm led to shorter initial duration of antibiotic therapy. The tested algorithm can help to determine the optimal length of antibiotic therapy and avoid antibiotic overuse.

There was an imbalance in randomization of eight patients with uncomplicated simple UTI with only two being randomized to the PCT-pyuria group. Since all six patients in the standard guidelines group were treated according to our algorithm with single-dose fosfomycin, the median duration of the initial antibiotic therapy in this subgroup was similar between both groups.

Only one patient in the PCT-pyuria group, who relapsed with urosepsis and had to be hospitalized for 3 days and treated with intravenous antibiotics, was initially treated with NSAIDs according to the study protocol. Given the small number of outpatients, the safety of NSAIDs for simple uncomplicated UTIs cannot be determined based on our study. Despite recent data with promising results for this approach, a recent review emphasized the need for immediate antimicrobial therapy rather than delayed treatment or symptomatic management with ibuprofen alone.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112BXcnZ]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114AqSwd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — episode timing and management considerations indicate that episodes do not need to be in the immediate six months preceding presentation, and that recurrence burden should guide prophylaxis; expectant management may be less appropriate than active prophylaxis in an individual who has received more than three to four therapeutic courses of antibiotics in the past year. Patients with a long culture-proven history at lower-than-definition frequency (two episodes within six months within the previous year) may also be appropriate to include under the rUTI umbrella, and patients consistently presenting with one to two symptomatic infections per year for multiple years will likely benefit from a more proactive management strategy similar to that for rUTI.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^115EJrG2]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and associated Gram-negative bacteremia treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly included patients who were afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and had achieved source control (relief of any urinary obstruction) before transitioning to oral antibiotics. An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Efficacy and safety of quinolones for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: a network meta-analysis [^114yn3tR]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uUTI) is defined as the presence of pathogenic organisms in the urinary tract without anatomical and functional abnormalities, is accompanied by inflammatory leukocytes and cytokines and may or may not develop clinical symptoms. The frequency of uncomplicated urinary tract infection is higher in young women. Several quinolone treatment regimens are available; however, since we do not know which is the best antibiotic regimen for the treatment of this urinary infection, we analyzed the published evidence and conducted a systematic review with network meta-analysis. The aim was to compare and hierarchize quinolones according to their efficacy and safety and to identify the best treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women through a systematic review with network meta-analysis.

Methods

Medline, Embase, LILACS, Cochrane CENTRAL and other databases were searched for trials. Bias in the trials was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. To analyze efficacy and adverse events, for direct comparisons, we obtained risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals by applying a fixed-effects model using τ² and Q² tests to calculate the heterogeneity. For the network meta-analysis, we analyzed the indirect comparisons by Bucher's method.

Results

We included 18 trials (8765 women). For premenopausal women, ofloxacin had a 57% probability of achieving remission but an 83% frequency of adverse events. For postmenopausal women, ofloxacin was 82% more effective for remission, with a 49% frequency of adverse events, compared with other types of quinolones.

Conclusions

Compared with other quinolones, ofloxacin 200 mg once daily for a treatment duration < 3 days provides the highest clinical and bacteriological remission rates with the lowest relapse and resistance rates for the treatment of women with uUTIs. However, additional trials are needed to confirm our findings, especially when the treatment duration exceeds 3 days.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113bqtGg]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment — women with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI): Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Supporting evidence from a Cochrane review of studies published from 1977 to 2003 included 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 6,016) and found no differences between fluoroquinolones, β-lactams, or nitrofurantoin versus TMP-SMX in short-term (within two weeks of treatment) or long-term (up to 8 weeks) symptomatic or bacteriological cure, with risk ratio (RR) estimates close to 1.0; results were similar with treatment durations of 3 days or 7 to 10 days and across specific fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin). For harms, fluoroquinolones (2 trials; pooled RR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.43; I² = 0%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.76; I² = 0%) were associated with lower likelihood of rash than TMP-SMX, there was no difference in discontinuation due to adverse events though estimates favored fluoroquinolones (3 trials; RR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.12 to 1.14; I² = 39%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.41; I² = 0%), and there was no difference between β-lactams and TMP-SMX in rates of rash or other harms.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^114ch8sU]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Evidence about the contribution of excessive treatment duration to antibiotic overuse in primary care is limited. A recent study from the US showed that more than two thirds of antibiotic courses for acute sinusitis in adults were 10 days or longer, whereas the Infectious Disease Society of America recommends treatment of uncomplicated cases for five to seven days. A small study from the Manitoba region in Canada, that focused on urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, skin or soft tissue infections, and pneumonia estimated that 15% of prescriptions with the appropriate antibiotic were for treatments longer than guideline based recommendations.

An up-to-date picture on prescribed antibiotic durations for common infections in English primary care is lacking. Such an overview is especially relevant given the increasing evidence from randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses that shorter antibiotic courses clear infection comparable to longer courses, while minimising selection, proliferation, and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the likelihood of side effects from antibiotic use.

We therefore assessed the extent to which durations of antibiotic courses prescribed for common infections in English primary care are in line with relevant guidelines. If substantial proportions of antibiotic prescriptions are longer than recommended, this would indicate that there is potential to safely reduce total antibiotic use simply by better application of guidelines in clinical practice.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^111W8eDK]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

For most common infections treated in primary care, a substantial proportion of antibiotic prescriptions have durations exceeding those recommended in guidelines. This is most noticeable for most respiratory indications and acute cystitis among females. If all patients receiving antibiotics for the included indications received treatment for durations recommended by guidelines over the study period (three years in about 4.4% of the English population; included prescriptions captured around 20% of total antibiotic prescriptions in the included practices during the study period), this would equate to 1.1 million fewer days of antibiotics for respiratory tract indications and 100 000 fewer days for acute cystitis among females. Our findings indicate substantial scope for reducing antibiotic prescribing through better adherence to recommended durations of antibiotic treatment. In contrast, the duration of antibiotic prescriptions for pyelonephritis, acute cystitis among men, impetigo, and cellulitis generally did not exceed guideline recommendations, with only 4–18% of prescriptions exceeding them.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^113xzz7J]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this difference-in-differences study, we implemented a multifaceted stewardship intervention that targeted inappropriate antibiotic choice and duration of treatment. An increased proportion of guideline-adherent prescriptions was observed in the intervention period of both intervention and control sites. However, in the difference-in-differences analysis, the intervention site had a significantly larger increase in adherence than the control site.

The audit and feedback stewardship intervention was successful for UTI treatment in emergency departmentsand acuteand long-term care. In this study, we applied the audit and feedback intervention to primary care settings, where antibiotic stewardship is urgently needed. Our intervention was based on a treatment algorithm derived from the IDSA guidelines and AAFP recommendations on management of uncomplicated UTI. Our qualitative study showed that differentiating uncomplicated cystitis from other UTI syndromes is a challenge for providers; therefore, providing a set of diagnostic criteria for uncomplicated cystitis was important. This treatment algorithm describes steps that providers should take when encountered with a patient with UTI-relevant symptoms. We used this algorithm as a starting point to provide personalised, interactive, one-on-one feedback with providers to improve their capacity to distinguish between uncomplicated and complicated UTI and treat UTI appropriately. The content was individualised for each recipient, and specific information about the correct solution was included to maximise feedback effectiveness. Besides improvements in the clinical outcomes, we also observed that the intervention was received positively by feedback recipients.

Short-course therapy for uncomplicated acute UTI — Three-day regimens of TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones have comparable effectiveness with 79%–100% and 85%–98% cure rates and are widely accepted when there are no complicating factors. These regimens are as effective for symptomatic relief as longer 5- to 10-day regimens and have improved compliance, decreased costs, and lower adverse reaction rates. The efficacy of 5 days of nitrofurantoin is comparable to 3 days of TMP-SMX, and five days of nitrofurantoin has better efficacy than a 3-day regimen.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treating symptomatic uncomplicated urinary tract infections in non-pregnant adult women [^1152Doak]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Almost half of all women will have at least one symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime. Although usually self-remitting, 74% of women contacting a health professional are prescribed an antibiotic, and in rare instances, they may progress to more severe infections. Therefore, the standard of care for the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs is oral antibiotic therapy, which aims to achieve symptom resolution and prevent the development of complications such as pyelonephritis. Given that a number of UTIs are self-remitting, non-antibiotic treatments that may help reduce the severity or duration of symptoms or reduce the need for antibiotics may be of benefit.

Objectives

This review aims to investigate the benefits and risks associated with the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs in non-pregnant adult women.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 18 November 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at the effectiveness of NSAIDs in the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs in non-pregnant adult women. The outcomes of interest were: 1) short-term resolution of symptoms (days 1 to 4); 2) medium-term resolution of symptoms (days 5 to 10); and 3) incidence of adverse events (including progression to sepsis or complicated UTI, hospitalisation or need for intravenous antibiotics, gastrointestinal complications, or death) up to 30 days from randomisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening, abstract selection, and data extraction were carried out independently by two authors, and any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Six studies (1646 randomised women) published between 2010 and 2019 met our inclusion criteria. The mean age ranged from 28 to 50 years; previous UTIs were reported in 7.2% to 77% of participants. There were five multicentre studies, and studies were carried out in Denmark, Germany, Korea, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. Overall, the risk of bias was low or unclear. Compared to antibiotics, NSAIDs probably result in less short-term resolution of symptoms (4 studies, 1144 participants: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.91; I² = 75%; moderate certainty) and may also result in less medium-term resolution of symptoms (4 studies, 1140 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; I² = 78%; low certainty). NSAIDs probably make little or no difference to the number of adverse events by day 30 (4 studies, 1165 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33; I² = 64%; moderate certainty). NSAIDs may result in longer duration of symptoms (2 studies, 553 participants: MD 1.00 day, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.39; I² = 0%; low certainty). NSAIDs may result in a lower proportion of women experiencing microbiological resolution by day 10 compared to antibiotics (2 studies, 322 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I² = 0%; low certainty) and probably result in more women using rescue antibiotic treatment by day 30 (4 studies, 1165 participants: RR 3.14, 95% CI 2.23 to 4.42; I² = 49%; moderate certainty). Compared to placebo, NSAIDs may reduce the use of rescue antibiotic treatment (1 study, 183 participants: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; low certainty evidence) but may make little or no difference to adverse events at day 30. Compared to the herbal product Uva-Ursi, NSAIDs may make little or no difference to adverse events by day 30.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of NSAIDs for symptomatic management of uncomplicated UTIs probably results in less short-term resolution of symptoms and greater use of rescue antibiotics by day 30 compared to primary antibiotic treatment. Future studies should consider the various confounders such as degree of symptoms, microbiology, type and resistance patterns of bacteria involved and number of UTI episodes in the months prior to commencement of treatment.

### Reappraisal of the treatment duration of antibiotic regimens for acute uncomplicated cystitis in adult women: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of 61 randomised clinical trials [^117No2kf]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Background

Evidence from numerous randomised clinical trials suggest that shorter-term antimicrobial therapy is as effective as-and has other advantages over-longer-term antimicrobial regimens at achieving symptomatic cure for acute uncomplicated cystitis. Nevertheless, not all shorter regimens are adopted in clinical guidelines. This study was done to reappraise the treatment duration of each antibiotic in current guidelines for acute uncomplicated cystitis to investigate whether the regimen lengths of guideline approved antibiotics could be reduced.

Methods

We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant publications from inception of the databases until Dec 31, 2019. Only randomised clinical trials of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis that assessed antibiotic therapy and reported clinical or microbial response outcome values were included. A network meta-analysis was done and the quality of evidence of all of the included studies was rated. Clinical response was the primary outcome, defined as the complete disappearance of all baseline symptoms at the test-of-cure visit. Bayesian hierarchical random-effects model for dichotomous outcomes was used to compare the efficacy of each antibiotic treatment regimen directly and indirectly. This systematic review is registered in PROSPERO, CRD42018093529.

Findings

Overall, 61 randomised clinical trials-which included 20780 patients-were assessed in our systematic review. For the third-generation and fourth-generation fluoroquinolones, a 3-day regimen had similar effect to a single-dose regimen for clinical response (risk ratio [RR] 0·994 [95% credible interval 0·939–1·052] vs 1·024 [0·974–1·083]), with moderate quality of evidence. For pivmecillinam, 5-day and 7-day regimens were similar to a 3-day regimen for clinical response, with moderate quality of evidence (RR 1·041 [0·910–1·193] for the 5-day regimen and 1·095 [0·999–1·203] for the 7-day regimen). Meanwhile, for third-generation cephalosporins and amoxicillin and clavulanate, there was no difference between single-dose and 3-day regimens, but quality of evidence supporting this conclusion was low. For second-generation quinolones and co-trimoxazole, single-dose regimen was less effective than 3-day regimen in clinical response, with moderate quality of evidence.

Interpretation

Treatment duration of the third-generation and fourth-generation quinolones and pivmecillinam could be shorter than the currently recommended regimens for acute uncomplicated cystitis. For other antibiotics, shorter duration of regimens could be considered, but further research is needed because of the low quality of supporting evidence.

Funding

None.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^115Lxx2S]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment for respiratory tract infections to combat antimicrobial resistance

Most bacterial RTIs show equal efficacy with fewer adverse events in shorter compared to standard antibiotic courses in clinical trials. This is based on the principle of 'shorter is better', initially conceived one decade ago. However, there are two notable exceptions: otitis media among children under the age of two and streptococcal pharyngitis, in which shorter first-line antibiotic courses are less effective than standard antibiotic courses.

Over the last few decades, most guidelines have recommended standard antimicrobial therapy durations of seven to ten days for lower RTIs. However, few randomised clinical trials have been conducted to determine the minimal effective treatment durations. Despite the low number of patients included in some of these studies, shorter treatment durations, such as two to three days, have been demonstrated not to be inferior to longer durations in terms of clinical efficacy. Initially advocated for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the early 2000s, an increasing body of evidence suggests that shorter durations of antibiotics are also effective in treating most RTIs (Table 2). Some recent clinical guidelines, like the WHO AWaRe antibiotic book, advocate for five-day courses of antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis, COPD exacerbations, and community-acquired pneumonia. Despite this evidence, most clinicians still use standard or longer courses.

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^11389yui]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans. Women are significantly more affected than men: one in three women will have at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24, and roughly 50% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime.

UTIs are classified according to the site of infection (pyelonephritis, cystitis, urethritis and prostatitis) and the presence of risk factors for complications. While asymptomatic UTIs are left untreated in most cases according to guidelines, the high incidence of symptomatic UTIs that require antibiotics (ATBs) emphasises the need to ensure appropriate therapy with agents that maximise success and minimise the risk of resistance.

According to the WHO, rational drug use requires that patients receive drugs appropriate to their clinical condition, in doses that suit their needs, for an adequate period of time and at the lowest cost for themselves and their community.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^112KZnaP]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Box 1
Audit and feedback script (example)

Table 2
List of activities at intervention and control sites

The audit and feedback component of the intervention (based on feedback intervention theory)was a highly personalised, interactive, one-on-one intervention with primary care providers to improve their capacity to distinguish between uncomplicated cystitis and other UTI syndromes and to encourage them to prescribe a guideline-concordant antibiotic regimen. We also included information about first-line antibiotics recommended by the IDSA guidelines and AAFP and determined whether the antibiotic regimen prescribed by the providers was in accordance with the guidelines (box 1).

In the intervention period, we distributed guidelines at both sites (intervention and control). Distributing the guidelines addressed awareness, but we did not expect guideline dissemination alone to be an effective method to achieve behaviour change. At the intervention site, we also conducted a training session to help providers engage with and internalise guidelines content. Our educational session provided a detailed overview of the IDSA treatment guidelines; definitions for various UTI syndromes, including uncomplicated versus complicated UTI, and actual clinical examples. During our training session, we also taught the providers how to use the decision aid (figure 2). The investigators selected actual cases of UTI seen in the clinics to design both teaching cases to address the specific clinical scenarios that were problematic for the interview participants.

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^114mLbfd]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The only subtype of potentially suboptimal antibiotic treatment that was associated with the composite poor clinical outcome and CDI in our study was potentially suboptimal dose frequency. The risk of CDI was 2.42 times higher among those treated with a suboptimal dose frequency versus optimal treatment. Potentially suboptimal dose frequency was also associated with hospitalization/ED visits and all-cause mortality. In prior work, a dose-dependent increased risk of CDI has been observed, with increasing cumulative defined daily dose of antibiotics resulting in increasing risks of CDI. Our results suggest that dose frequency, in addition to drug choice and antibiotic duration, may also impact risk of CDI and other poor outcomes.

We found no difference in risk for UTI recurrence for residents treated with potentially suboptimal or optimal antibiotic treatment. Previous work has found that among women with UTI, longer courses of antibiotics may be associated with increased risk of recurrent UTI, possibly due to alterations in urogenital flora. However, among males with UTI treated in the outpatient setting, longer treatment duration was not associated with UTI recurrence, nor was antibiotic choice. Interestingly, for unclear reasons, among the subgroup of residents treated with initial beta-lactam therapy, suboptimal treatment was associated with a decreased hazard of UTI recurrence which requires further investigation.

It is possible that suboptimal initial treatment could lead to clinical failure, the consequences of which could be serious and may include bacteremia, urosepsis, acute care hospitalization, and potentially death. In our study, suboptimal treatment was not associated with mortality. It is possible that despite being suboptimal, an appropriate agent was ultimately used considering the susceptibility of the uropathogen causing the UTI. Three previous studies have similarly demonstrated that inappropriate empiric therapy for UTI was not associated with an increased risk of mortality. Excessive treatment duration versus optimal treatment was associated with a decreased hazard of mortality. The optimal duration of treatment of males with UTI is largely unknown. In females, durations as short as 3 days are recommended for those with uncomplicated infection, but for males longer durations between 7 and 14 days are generally recommended. Further investigation is needed to determine optimal treatment duration in males to decrease the risk of treatment failure.

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^111UXBQU]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge the limitations of this retrospective cohort study. First, our study was not designed to assess causality, and there are important differences (known and unknown) between residents who received suboptimal and optimal antibiotic treatment. While we did adjust for confounders of suboptimal treatment and clinical outcomes, our findings neither confirm nor deny a causal relationship, as our findings may be confounded by unmeasured factors which affect suboptimal treatment and clinical outcomes. As such, while we found an association between suboptimal antibiotic treatment and poor clinical outcomes even after adjusting for several resident and CLC characteristics, this association may be impacted by residual confounding. Second, we defined UTI based on a urine culture and antibiotic treatment, per recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. While we excluded patients with other positive cultures and only included those exposed to common antibiotics recommended by national guidance or with reliable urinary concentrations, the antibiotic treatment captured may have been targeting another non-urinary tract infection type or asymptomatic bacteriuria. Additionally, we did not capture UTIs in which a urine culture was not obtained. Urine culturing practices are not standardized across VA CLCs, and some facilities may only recommend obtaining UTI cultures in certain clinical situations, such as recurrent infection. However, our population was mostly a complicated, male population, in which urine cultures would be generally recommended. Third, no established definitions for suboptimal antibiotic treatment of residents with UTI have been developed. There is no IDSA guidance for the treatment of complicated UTIs in males, so we based suboptimal treatment definitions on available guidelines for uncomplicated infection in females and expert opinion. Suboptimal antibiotic treatment is multifactorial and as such we considered three elements of suboptimal treatment (drug choice, dose frequency, and longer duration). However, other elements, such as drug strength and route of administration may also be suboptimal. Insufficient treatment duration is also a clinical problem. We excluded those treated for 2 days or less, but some residents may have still been exposed to insufficient treatment durations. Future research should continue to investigate and operationalize the definition of suboptimal antibiotic treatment among residents with UTI. Additionally, while we conducted analyses by subtype of suboptimal treatment, comparative analyses are warranted to determine which individual aspects of suboptimal antibiotic treatment (the drug choice, dose frequency, or longer than recommended duration) are the most strongly associated with poor outcomes. Forth, we measured all-cause hospitalizations, ED visits, and mortality. Our frail older resident population is already at risk for these events and many of the events observed may have not been related to antibiotic use. Alternatively, we likely underestimated antibiotic-related adverse events, as these events may not have been coded or other codes were used. Adverse events are difficult to identify in large databases as they are often not recorded in health claims and reports. Fifth, while we investigated five potential harms of suboptimal antibiotic use, we did not assess the development of colonization or infection with resistance, which is a well-known harm of antibiotic use. Finally, the generalizability of our findings conducted in a largely older male population may be limited to other non-VA long-term care populations.

### Three versus five days of pivmecillinam for community-acquired uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial [^115DXrxa]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, a lower rate of eligible participants than anticipated and expiration of the study drug necessitated premature study termination when only 80% of the planned sample size had been recruited. However, the lost to follow-up rates was lower than expected. Thus, 97.5% of the 5-day group and 95% of the 3-day group projected for the primary clinical outcome analysis was reached. Secondly, no data were collected on previous antibiotic therapy (ongoing was an exclusion criteria), intra-cervical-devices, or hormonal therapy. Lastly, the study was designed to demonstrate superiority but not non-inferiority or equivalence between the two treatment arms. However, the boundaries of the 95% CI for clinical success of the 5-day course compare to the 3-day course at the end of treatment (13.5%), day-7 (4.4%) and day-28 (0.3%) were all within our pre-estimated 15% difference; thus, showing some evidence supporting a clinical relevant non-inferiority of the 3-day course compared to the 5-day course.

In summary, a 5-day course of pivmecillinam was not superior to a 3-day course of pivmecillinam for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection. Given the risk of adverse events, development of antimicrobial resistance and collateral damage associated with the length of antibiotic use, this study did not find evidence supporting that a 5 days course should be preferred over a 3 days course.

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: rapid evidence review [^1132xnmk]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract with no sign of systemic illness or pyelonephritis in a noncatheterized, nonpregnant adult with no urologic abnormalities or immunocompromise. In women, a self-diagnosis of a UTI with the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., frequency, urgency, dysuria/burning sensation, nocturia, suprapubic pain), without vaginal discharge, is accurate enough to diagnose an uncomplicated UTI without further testing. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be reserved for women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, history of resistant isolates, or atypical presentation to make a definitive diagnosis and guide antibiotic selection. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin for five days, fosfomycin in a single dose, trimethoprim for three days, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and delayed antibiotics may be considered because the risk of complications is low. Increased fluids, intake of cranberry products, and methenamine hippurate can prevent recurrent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also effective in preventing recurrence but has a risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Men with lower UTI symptoms should always receive antibiotics, with urine culture and susceptibility results guiding the antibiotic choice. Clinicians should also consider the possibility of urethritis and prostatitis in men with UTI symptoms. First-line antibiotics for men with uncomplicated UTI include trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin for seven days. Uncomplicated UTIs in nonfrail women and men 65 years and older with no relevant comorbidities also necessitate a urine culture with susceptibility testing to adjust the antibiotic choice after initial empiric treatment; first-line antibiotics and treatment durations do not differ from those recommended for younger adults.

### The current management strategies for community-acquired urinary tract infection [^117BsxsL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated UTI is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention and accounts for considerable morbidity and health care costs. Acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in the adult patient should be considered uncomplicated if the patient is not pregnant or elderly, if there has been no recent instrumentation or antimicrobial treatment, and if there are no known functional or anatomic abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. Most of these infections are caused by E. coli, which are susceptible to many oral antimicrobials, although resistance is increasing to some of the commonly used agents, especially TMP-SMX. In women with risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, or in the setting of a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens, a case can be made for using a fluoroquinolone or nitrofurantoin. Use of nitrofurantoin for the empiric treatment of mild cystitis is supportable from a public health perspective in an attempt to decrease uropathogen resistance because it does not share cross-resistance with more commonly prescribed antimicrobials. Beta-lactams and fosfomycin should be considered second-line agents for empiric treatment of cystitis. Acute pyelonephritis in an otherwise healthy woman may be considered an uncomplicated infection. Fluoroquinolone regimens are superior to TMP-SMX for empiric therapy because of the relatively high prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance among uropathogens causing pyelonephritis. TMP-SMX, effective for patients with mild to moderate disease, is an appropriate drug if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible. It is reasonable to use a 7- to 10-day oral fluoroquinolone regimen for outpatient management of mild to moderate pyelonephritis in the setting of a susceptible causative pathogen and rapid clinical response to therapy. Most women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are now managed safely and effectively as outpatients. Acute uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis in healthy adult men is very uncommon but is generally caused by the same spectrum of uropathogens with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile as that seen in women. The choice of antimicrobials is similar to that recommended for cystitis in women except that nitrofurantoin is not considered a good choice. Treatment duration should generally be longer than that recommended for women.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^112Axdyr]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common drivers of antibiotic use and hospitalizations. In the United States, almost 10 million outpatients are diagnosed with UTIs each year, and UTIs account for 16% of all infectious disease-related hospitalizations and 6% of all infectious disease-related deaths. Despite various prevention strategies, recurrent UTIs are very common.

Any reduction of antibiotic exposure is important to diminish selection pressure for antibiotic resistance, costs, and drug-related side-effects. Current guidelines for antibiotic treatment duration of febrile UTI/pyelonephritis largely reflect expert opinion, as only few intervention studies compared different durations. Most studies in this regard were performed to establish short-term therapy in uncomplicated simple UTIs. Motivated by the emerging antibiotic resistance of uropathogens and the ecological effects of antibiotics, the minimal effective duration of antibiotic therapy is being challenged, especially in the elderly, in whom UTIs are often over diagnosed and therefore over treated. The use of biomarkers might improve the management of patients with UTIs.

The biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) was established for antibiotic stewardship in respiratory tract infections and sepsis. As an indicator for systemic infections, it showed high prognostic value to predict bacteremia in patients with urosepsis. In the PRORATA trial, which documented a safe reduction of antibiotic usage through a PCT-guided strategy in patients with sepsis, UTIs were the source of infection in 7% of patients. In patients with lower UTIs, PCT may need to be complemented with inflammatory surrogates of local infection such as pyuria. Normalization of pyuria in the first days after initiation of therapy correlated with a successful outcome in women with lower UTIs. Therefore, we assumed that an algorithm based on PCT and pyuria could safely reduce the duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with UTIs.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112bPvv4]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Selection of definitive antibiotic therapy for complicated UTI — In patients with confirmed complicated UTI, we suggest selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

### Rural-urban differences in antibiotic prescribing for uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^113Quzdf]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine rural-urban differences in temporal trends and risk of inappropriate antibiotic use by agent and duration among women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI).

Design

Observational cohort study.

Methods

Using the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database (2010–2015), we identified US commercially insured women aged 18–44 years coded for uncomplicated UTI and prescribed an oral antibiotic agent. We classified antibiotic agents and durations as appropriate versus inappropriate based on clinical guidelines. Rural-urban status was defined by residence in a metropolitan statistical area. We used modified Poisson regression to determine the association between rural-urban status and inappropriate antibiotic receipt, accounting for patient- and provider-level characteristics. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate trends in antibiotic use by rural-urban status.

Results

Of 670,450 women with uncomplicated UTI, a large proportion received antibiotic prescriptions for inappropriate agents (46.7%) or durations (76.1%). Compared to urban women, rural women were more likely to receive prescriptions with inappropriately long durations (adjusted risk ratio 1.10, 95% CI, 1.10–1.10), which was consistent across subgroups. From 2011 to 2015, there was slight decline in the quarterly proportion of patients who received inappropriate agents (48.5% to 43.7%) and durations (78.3% to 73.4%). Rural-urban differences varied over time by agent (duration outcome only), geographic region, and provider specialty.

Conclusions

Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing is quite common for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI. Rural women are more likely to receive inappropriately long antibiotic durations. Antimicrobial stewardship interventions are needed to improve outpatient UTI antibiotic prescribing and to reduce unnecessary exposure to antibiotics, particularly in rural settings.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^112M3bSK]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pyelonephritis, an infection of the upper urinary tract, can lead to both short-term and long-term morbidity, including sepsis, acute kidney injury, renal scarring, and chronic hypertension. To alleviate symptoms during the acute phase of the infection and reduce the potential for long-term consequences, pediatric guidelines recommend treating pyelonephritis with a total of 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy.

A growing body of evidence supports the noninferiority of short durations of therapy (in the range of 5–7 days) compared with prolonged durations for producing clinical cure in adults with pyelonephritis. However, limited data explore this question in children. Moreover, there is a need for more robust evidence in children with urological abnomalities. The benefits of a short course of antibiotic therapy for pyelonephritis include improved patient convenience, a decreased likelihood of adverse drug events, a reduced risk of the emergence of antibiotic resistant organisms, and reduced abdominal discomfort.

Since 2016, The Johns Hopkins Hospital Pediatric Antibiotic Treatment Guidelines, accessible to clinicians at all 5 of the hospitals contributing data to the current study, recommend treating children with pyelonephritis with 7 days of antibiotic therapy (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). These guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary team including primary care clinicians, emergency medicine clinicians, hospitalists, urologists, nephrologists, intensivists, and infectious diseases clinicians based on a review of the available evidence in adult and pediatric populations and expert opinion where gaps in data were evident. However, despite the availability of local treatment guidelines, variability remains in prescribed treatment durations for children with pyelonephritis, providing an opportunity to investigate the association between varying durations of antibiotic therapy and patient outcomes. Our objective was to compare the clinical outcomes of children receiving a short-course (< 10 days) vs a prolonged-course (≥ 10 days) of antibiotics for the treatment of pyelonephritis.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^112nW2xn]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

The primary endpoint was analyzed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, including all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug (on the eighth day of UTI treatment), and on the per-protocol (PP) population, including all randomized patients who had been given the study drug for a minimum of 24 hours (in case of treatment failure) or who had taken at least 80% of the study drug (in case of clinical cure).

The study sample size was calculated on the basis of a clinical cure rate of 10 percentage points lower at short-term follow-up in the 7-day treatment arm with the assumption of a 90% clinical cure rate in patients treated for 14 days. We adopted 10% as the margin of non-inferiority as suggested previously. As we were only interested in non-inferiority and not in equivalence, the sample size calculation was based on a one-tailed alpha of 0.05. Assuming a non-inferiority margin of 0.10, 1-tailed alpha of 0.05, and a power of 0.90, the required sample size per group was 200. This implies that the 90% confidence interval of a two-tailed χ² test should not cross the predefined risk difference of 10% lower clinical cure rate, or equivalently, the one-sided P value is less than the 0.05 significance level. Interim analyses were done after randomization of 100 and 200 patients. After the second interim analysis, there was no reason to stop the trial for safety reasons. However, the principal investigators, who obviously were still blinded with respect to treatment allocation, noted that the overall cure rate was 92%. This is comparable with the results of a recently published similar trial in women comparing 73 to 83 patients treated over 7 or 14 days, respectively. As we had indeed included a larger sample size of 200 patients, we estimated that our study would likely have already met the criteria for non-inferiority while still having a power of 0.80 with a type 1 error of 0.05. As we were confronted with an almost empty budget and a dropping inclusion rate after almost 5 years of participation, we considered continuation of the trial was no longer realistic and thus we decided to stop the trial at this point.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115pdiDB]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The eligible trials of treatment duration in pyelonephritis involved diverse patient populations, durations of treatment, and outcome measures, and this explains the heterogeneity of outcomes with shorter durations of therapy. Recently, the results of several RCTs have demonstrated short-course (5 or 7 days) fluoroquinolone therapy to be equally as efficacious as 10 to 14 days of treatment with comparator medications. IDSA guidelines were accordingly amended to recommend therapy for 7 days, but the issue of bacteremia was not explicitly addressed. Our data suggest that patients with bacteremia secondary to uncomplicated pyelonephritis can be successfully treated with shorter-duration therapy.

The sole trial of treatment duration in SSTI demonstrated that, in a carefully selected healthy adult population, a short duration of therapy was associated with a cure rate equal to that of a long duration of therapy. However, the explicit exclusion of patients with more serious infections, argues that it is unlikely that these data can be directly extrapolated to critically ill patients with bacteremic soft tissue infections.

The present review has several important limitations. The prespecified search strategy excluded unpublished data and non-English language trials. Of eligible trials, bias may have been introduced by low rates of blinding and use of placebo controls. Some studies included only patients with early clinical improvement for randomization to short- or long-course therapy; consequently, the effect size and findings may not be generalizable to sicker patient populations. Other trials excluded patients post-randomization or presented only per-protocol analyses and so may have excluded bacteremic patients failing therapy. Treatment outcomes for patients with bacteremia in individual studies were derived from small post hoc subgroup analyses. Finally, within individual infectious syndromes, significant variability was encountered both in study design and in the durations of therapy employed (with 14 days even considered shorter-course therapy in one study). However, the lack of outcome heterogeneity between syndromes suggests that it is valid to pool BSI data from multiple infectious foci into a single meta-analysis or enroll such patients within a single RCT.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis [^116D2UjH]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in women. Most urinary tract infections are acute uncomplicated cystitis. Identifiers of acute uncomplicated cystitis are frequency and dysuria in an immunocompetent woman of childbearing age who has no comorbidities or urologic abnormalities. Physical examination is typically normal or positive for suprapubic tenderness. A urinalysis, but not urine culture, is recommended in making the diagnosis. Guidelines recommend three options for first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in regions where the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance does not exceed 20 percent). Beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime are not recommended for initial treatment because of concerns about resistance. Urine cultures are recommended in women with suspected pyelonephritis, women with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after completing treatment, and women who present with atypical symptoms.

### Defining effective durations of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infections in hospitalized children [^112SQDPL]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infections (UTI) are two common childhood infections often leading to hospital admission. National guidelines for CAP and UTI in children recommend durations of antibiotic therapy of 10 days and 7–14 days, respectively. Due to concerns of rising antimicrobial resistance and an increased awareness of harms associated with prolonged courses of antibiotics, there is a renewed emphasis on reevaluating commonly prescribed durations of antibiotic therapy across bacterial infections. We describe recent clinical trials and observational studies evaluating durations of therapy for CAP and UTI in adults and children and translate the findings to our suggested approach for selecting durations of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized children.

Recent Findings

There is a growing body of evidence, primarily in adults, that shorter durations of therapy than are commonly prescribed are just as effective as longer durations for CAP and UTIs.

Summary

Combining clinical trial data from adults with available data in children, we believe it is reasonable to consider 5 days of therapy for CAP, 3–5 days of therapy for cystitis, and 7 days of therapy for pyelonephritis for most hospitalized children with uncomplicated infections.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^115syJci]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that short courses of antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged courses for children with pyelonephritis. Given the high incidence of UTIs in children and the increasing concern for antibiotic resistance and other negative sequelae associated with antibiotic overuse, a shorter duration of therapy for pyelonephritis could have implications for public health.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^114giEYo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections, screened the reference list of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched the following data bases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or designed for prevention of urinary tract infection were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The quality of all selected trials was assessed and data extracted by the reviewers. Main outcome measures were persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status and adverse drug reactions. To compare the different treatment durations, we defined the following categories of duration: single dose, short course (3–6 days) and long course (7–14 days). Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial and outcome and were then combined using a random effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials were included in this review. Six trials compared single dose with short-term treatment (3–6 days), three studies single dose with long-term treatment (7–14 days) and four trials short-term with long term treatment. Eight trials also included younger patients, but provided a subgroup analysis for elderly women. The methodological quality of all trials was low. All trials reported results of bacteriological cure rate; less often clinical outcomes (e.g. improvement or cure of symptoms) were analyzed. Only five trials compared the same antibiotic given for a different length of time. We performed a separate analysis for these trials. The rate of persistent bacteriuria rate at short-term (two weeks post-treatment) was better in the longer treatment group (3–14 days) than in the single dose group (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.86). However, the rate of persistent bacteria at long term and the clinical cure rate showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients showed a preference for single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), however this was based on only one trial comparing the same antibiotic. The comparison of short (3–6 days) and longer treatments (7–14 days) did not show any significant difference, but the number of included studies and sample size were low.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review suggests that single dose antibiotic treatment is less effective but may be better accepted by the patients than longer treatment durations (3–14 days). In addition there was no significant difference between short course (3–6 days) versus longer course (7–14 days) antibiotics. The methodological quality of the identified trials was poor and the optimal treatment duration could not be determined. We therefore need more appropriately designed randomized controlled trials testing the effect, - on clinical relevant outcomes -, of different treatment durations of a given antibiotic in a strictly defined population of elderly women.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^117R5hjq]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation 10a — antibiotic duration for acute cystitis episodes in recurrent UTI: Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Supporting evidence includes a review of 15 trials (N = 1,644) where single-dose antibiotics increased short-term (< 2 weeks) bacteriological persistence versus short-course (3 to 6 days; RR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.05 to 3.84; I² = 36%) or long-course (7 to 14 days; RR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.01 to 3.70; I² = 31%) therapy, and another review of 32 trials (N = 9,605) showing three-day courses, irrespective of class, increased long-term (4 to 10 weeks) bacteriological failure (RR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.60; I² = 30%) versus more prolonged (5 to 10 day) therapy, with no differences in short-term (2 to 15 days) bacteriological failure (RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.44; I² = 0%).

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^1172okH4]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Women with fUTI can be successfully treated with antibiotics for 7 days, including those who initially were treated with β-lactams intravenously. In men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment for fUTI is inferior to 14 days when looking at short-term clinical cure. During long-term follow-up, even in men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment is non-inferior to 14 days.

Is should be considered that the primary outcome measures on future trials on antibiotic treatment duration of fUTI in men, should be set at 3 months instead of the traditional 2 weeks.

### Short-versus long-course antibiotic therapy for acute pyelonephritis in adolescents and adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114fQZsZ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the high incidence of acute pyelonephritis in the community setting, there is no consensus on the optimal duration of treatment. A potential reduction in the duration of the administered antibiotic regimens could contribute to avoiding further development of antimicrobial resistance.

Objective

The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare short-course (7- to 14-day) with long-course (14- to 42-day) treatment with the same antibiotic regimens, in terms of the effectiveness and tolerability, in acute pyelonephritis.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SCOPUS (January 1966-March 2008) to identify and extract data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness and toxicity of short- versus long-course regimens. Additionally, references of studies were searched. A publication was included if: it was an RCT; involved adult and/or adolescent patients with acute pyelonephritis; compared regimens with the same antibiotic, at the same daily dosage, that were administered for differing durations (a short course and a long course lie, no absolute time cutoff (in days) was employed; rather, the duration of one regimen compared with another defined short- vs long-course]); and reported data regarding clinical success, bacteriologic efficacy, relapses, recurrences, and adverse events and/or patient withdrawals due to adverse events. Trials with a mixed population, including patients with acute pyelonephritis as a subset, were also included in the meta-analysis. Efficacy was assessed by evaluating clinical success, defined as resolution of symptoms and signs at the test-of-cure visit, and bacteriologic efficacy, defined as yielding sterile urine cultures or positive cultures with < 10³ colony-forming units per milliliter of urine at the test-of-cure visit. Tolerability was assessed by extracting data for adverse events.

Results

According to our initial search, 205, 136, 179, and 73 potentially relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, and references of evaluable trials, respectively. Four RCTs were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Significant differences were not found between the short- and long-course treatment of acute pyclonephritis in terms of clinical success (odds ratio [OR], 1.27; 95% CI, 0.59–2.70), bacteriologic efficacy (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.13–4.95), and relapse (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.08–5.39). Also, significant differences were not found between the short- and long-course treatments regarding adverse events (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.33–1.25), withdrawals due to adverse events (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.28–1.55), and recurrences (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.63–3.06).

Conclusion

This meta-analysis failed to identify any significant differences, with regard to effectiveness and tolerability, between short- and long-course treatment with the same antibiotic.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^113HmjFr]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance is a well-recognised threat to global health, with the USA alone accounting for 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections and 35 000 deaths each year. Increasing realisation of the need to minimise this public health threat can be seen in the efforts of regulatory bodies such as the Joint Commission, which recently established requirements for antimicrobial stewardship for ambulatory healthcare organisations, effective at the beginning of 2020. The new requirements mandate that such organisations provide resources to practitioners to promote appropriate antibiotic prescribing practices.

Although most studies of outpatients have focused on implementing antibiotic stewardship for upper respiratory infections, there is also a high prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in primary care, including overuse of fluoroquinolones and longer duration of treatment than recommended by guidelines. A study in France found that only 20% of outpatient UTIs were treated with the guidelines-recommended drug, dose and duration. An Irish study found that only 55% of the antibiotic prescriptions for UTI in general practice were appropriate. Of 7738 outpatient encounters for UTI in Israel, 91% were treated with a longer duration of antibiotics than recommended by guidelines. A recent US study revealed that fluoroquinolones were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for uncomplicated UTI, comprising up to 49% of prescriptions. Inappropriate use of fluoroquinolones is especially concerning because it promotes the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strain sequence type 131. In addition, continued overprescribing of fluoroquinolones for uncomplicated cystitis in patients with other treatment options is occurring in the USAdespite two black-box warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for fluoroquinolones due to an association between their use and serious side effects. In addition, fluoroquinolones were associated with more central nervous system-related and gastrointestinal-related adverse events compared with other types of antimicrobials in a recent meta-analysis. Excessive treatment duration for uncomplicated cystitis is another common problem documented internationally. Current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelinesrecommend nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for 3 days and a single dose of fosfomycin as the first-line regimens for uncomplicated cystitis. In our previous study in the same setting, most prescriptions for trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin and fluoroquinolones had a treatment duration longer than recommended.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113zoJEq]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment — Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). In patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics, clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion).

### Short compared with standard duration of antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^112N8jzD]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the effectiveness of short course (2–4 days) with standard duration oral antibiotic treatment (7–14 days) for urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials using a random effects model. Ten trials were eligible, involving 652 children with lower tract UTI recruited from outpatient or emergency departments. Main outcome measures were UTI at the end of treatment, UTI during follow up (recurrent UTI), and urinary pathogens resistant to the treating antibiotic.

Results

There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive urine cultures between the short (2–4 days) and standard duration therapy (7–14 days) for UTI in children at 0–7 days after treatment (eight studies: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) and at 10 days to 15 months after treatment (10 studies: RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.33). There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).

Conclusion

A 2–4 day course of oral antibiotics is as effective as 7–14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI in children.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117RCSCu]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

First-line antimicrobial agents — IDSA-aligned options and nitrofurantoin regimen: In the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for premenopausal women, 3 first-line antibiotics for UTI treatment are recommended — nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and fosfomycin — and recommendations are extrapolated for rUTI, older women, and women with urogynecologic disorders. Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic and therapeutically active only in the lower urinary tract; it is effective against E. coli and many gram-negative species with low levels of resistance but is ineffective against some Proteus species and some strains of Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The duration of treatment is typically 7 to 10 days; a meta-analysis of women ranging from 12 to 70 years old concluded that 5-day regimens are as effective (not necessarily generalizable to women with rUTI), and the 2010 "International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women" recommends a 5-day regimen of 100 mg orally twice daily. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and most gram-negative bacteria.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^116BZRkH]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Randomization, antimicrobial treatment, and microbiological methods

Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified per center and sex, to receive either a 7-day or a 14-day regimen of antimicrobial treatment. A computer-generated randomization list, including the numbers 1 to 500, with 125 permuted blocks of four was made. The list and corresponding treatment (placebo or ciprofloxacin) was saved in an independent database with restricted access by an independent pharmacist. Randomization, and thus treatment allocation, was done once the results of the urine culture became available at the third or fourth day after inclusion. The first week of treatment was open label. In the second week, treatment was continued double-blinded, with either ciprofloxacin 500 mg or placebo orally twice daily (identical capsules for placebo and ciprofloxacin were used), according to randomization code. In inpatients, the treating physician could administer discretionary empirical intravenous antibiotics at the start of treatment according to local guidelines (in all participating centers: a β-lactam antibiotic ± aminoglycoside). These patients were switched as soon as deemed possible to open label oral ciprofloxacin (non-blinded) up to the seventh day after inclusion (equal to day of presentation with febrile UTI and start of antibiotic treatment). The decision whether to treat as outpatient or inpatient was made by the attending physician based on clinical judgment. In case the urine culture was negative or contaminated, patients were only randomized if the attending physician indicated the patient should be further treated for fUTI and no alternative diagnosis was made. Cultures were analyzed according to standard microbiological methods at local certified laboratories. For urine cultures, 10 μL of uncentrifuged urine was inoculated onto culture media. Plates were investigated for growth after 18–24 h of aerobic incubation at 37 °C. The amount of growth was assessed and scored from < 100 CFU/mL (no growth) to > 10⁵ CFU/mL.

A positive urine culture was defined as ≥ 10⁴ CFU/mL of urine in women, or ≥ 10³ CFU/mL of urine in men, or ≥ 10² CFU/mL of urine collected during antibiotic treatment of UTI. Further details on randomization, trial medication, microbiological methods, and study procedures have been previously published.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^116h1STd]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In the last decade, treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) has become more complicated by the rising antimicrobial resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, the most common uropathogens. With a scarcity of new antimicrobial classes in the development pipe-line, it is essential to develop strategies to maintain effectiveness of the available antimicrobials. Therefore, among strategies to control resistance, the determination of an optimal duration of treatment is essential in addition to optimization of diagnostics to target treatment and antibiotic stewardship concerning antibiotic choice and dose. Shortening of antimicrobial therapy will lead to less selection pressure on the gut microbiome with benefits to both the individual patient as well as the ecological environment, including reduction of antibiotic resistance development. Therefore, the focus upon treatment duration of common infections should be that shorter is better. With respect to febrile UTI (fUTI) or acute pyelonephritis, trials upon treatment duration have usually focused on previously healthy young women and have addressed optimal treatment duration by comparing the same drug for different durations of therapy, or compared various treatment durations of different antimicrobial agents. As such, recommendations upon optimal treatment duration of UTIs in men, the elderly, hospitalized patients, and patients with comorbidities or bacteremia, remain unclear.

Recently, a randomized placebo-controlled trial showed that community-acquired acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women of all ages can be safely and efficaciously treated with oral ciprofloxacin for 7 days. Clearly, such findings need to be extended to men and patients with significant comorbidities. In the present investigator-initiated randomized trial of treatment duration, we use fUTI as the clinical syndrome of interest because this is a broadly recognized specific clinical presentation of patients. Consecutive patients with fUTI were included, including men and women with comorbidities, and treated with antibiotics for 7 or 14 days. The aims of the study were to compare clinical and bacteriological cure at both the short and long term.

### Urinary tract infection in children [^115WNT2u]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Up to 7 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys will have a symptomatic, culture-confirmed urinary tract infection by six years of age. Urinary tract infection may be suspected because of urinary symptoms in older children or because of fever, nonspecific symptoms, or failure to thrive in infants. Urine dipstick analysis is useful for ruling out urinary tract infections in cases with low clinical suspicion. However, urine culture is necessary for diagnosis of urinary tract infections in children if there is high clinical suspicion, cloudy urine, or if urine dipstick testing shows positive leukocyte esterase or nitrite activity. Despite current recommendations, routine imaging studies (e.g., renal ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography, renal scans) do not appear to improve clinical outcomes in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Oral antibiotics are as effective as parenteral therapy in randomized trials. The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy has not been established, but one-day therapies have been shown to be inferior to longer treatment courses.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — scope and treatment duration clarifies that the guideline addresses initial management of the first UTI in febrile infants 2 to 24 months of age. The text adds that some infants will have recurrent UTIs or be identified with VUR or other abnormalities and that further research on optimal management in specific situations would be valuable. It also states that the optimal duration of antimicrobial treatment has not been determined and calls for RCTs of head-to-head comparisons of various duration to limit antimicrobial exposure to what is needed to eradicate the offending uropathogen.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^114RLvXD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.

Objectives

TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5–10 day antibiotic regimen was seen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27). Comparison of the bacteriological failure rates showed that three-day therapy was less effective than 5–10 day therapy for the short-term follow-up, however this difference was observed only in the subgroup of trials that used the same antibiotic in the two treatment arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This difference was more significant at long-term follow-up (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002). Adverse effects were significantly more common in the 5–10 day treatment group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.0010). Results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Three days of antibiotic therapy is similar to 5–10 days in achieving symptomatic cure during uncomplicated UTI treatment, while the longer treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure. In spite of the higher rate of adverse effects, treatment for 5–10 days could be considered for treatment of women in whom eradication of bacteriuria is important.

### Three versus five days of pivmecillinam for community-acquired uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial [^115qwNjU]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection in otherwise healthy women with an annual incidence of about 10%. UTI causes considerable short-term morbidity and decreased quality of life, especially if the prescribed antimicrobial therapy is inappropriate.

Pivmecillinam (amdinocillin pivoxil) is the oral pro-drug of the antimicrobially active mecillinam (amdinocillin), a unique narrow-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic that is highly effective against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli that is the most common pathogen to cause UTI. Pivmecillinam is safe and effective in the treatment of UTI. Rates of resistance remain low (< 6%) in countries where pivmecillinam has been used for decades. Further, pivmecillinam has clinical effect against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae.

Current recommendations suggest pivmecillinam for 3 to 7 days for UTI and suggest that a 5- or 7-day course is probably superior to a 3-day course. However, this recommendation refers to a single randomised controlled trial that showed that a 7-day course was superior to a 3-day course in bacteriological effectiveness at day 8–10. Thus, a 5-day course has never been studied in a controlled trial and the claimed superiority over a 3-day course has not been investigated. There is little and insufficient evidence to inform the optimal dosage, frequency and duration of pivmecillinam for UTI. Therefore, we conducted a superiority study of pivmecillinam for 5-days compared to 3-days for UTI.

### Defining the optimal duration of therapy for hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infections and associated bacteremia [^113kLr8k]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data are available to guide effective antibiotic durations for hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs).

Methods

We conducted an observational study of patients ≥ 18 years at 24 US hospitals to identify the optimal treatment duration for patients with cUTI. To increase the likelihood patients experienced true infection, eligibility was limited to those with associated bacteremia. Propensity scores were generated for an inverse probability of treatment weighted analysis. The primary outcome was recurrent infection with the same species ≤ 30 days of completing therapy.

Results

1099 patients met eligibility criteria and received 7 (n = 265), 10 (n = 382), or 14 (n = 452) days of therapy. There was no difference in the odds of recurrent infection for patients receiving 10 days and those receiving 14 days of therapy (aOR: .99; 95% CI: .52–1.87). Increased odds of recurrence was observed in patients receiving 7 days versus 14 days of treatment (aOR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.40–4.60). When limiting the 7-day versus 14-day analysis to the 627 patients who remained on intravenous beta-lactam therapy or were transitioned to highly bioavailable oral agents, differences in outcomes no longer persisted (aOR: .76; 95% CI: .38–1.52). Of 76 patients with recurrent infections, 2 (11%), 2 (10%), and 10 (36%) in the 7-, 10-, and 14-day groups, respectively, had drug-resistant infections (P = 0.10).

Conclusions

Seven days of antibiotics appears effective for hospitalized patients with cUTI when antibiotics with comparable intravenous and oral bioavailability are administered; 10 days may be needed for all other patients.

### Differences in the pattern of antibiotic prescription profile and recurrence rate for possible urinary tract infections in women with and without diabetes [^117WUogp]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diabetes is an increasingly important endocrine disease. Incidence of infections is increased in diabetic (type 1 and type 2) patients compared with control subjects, and the urinary tract is the most prevalent site of these infections. Furthermore, diabetic patients with a urinary tract infection (UTI) more often develop severe and rare complications, such as emphysematous cystitis and papillary necrosis. Studies addressing differences in UTI recurrence rates between diabetic patients and control subjects show contradictory results for uncomplicated lower and upper UTIs. Currently, there are no controlled clinical trials investigating the optimal antimicrobial treatment strategy in diabetic patients with UTIs. Current recommendations rely on the opinion of experts. It is generally recommended to treat UTIs in diabetic patients with antibiotics with high tissue penetration for 7–14 days. Importantly, we lack data on the clinical practice of how diabetic patients with a UTI are actually treated, to assess recurrence rates.

The aims of this study are to describe the treatments (duration and agents) for uncomplicated UTIs in women with and without diabetes in the Netherlands and to analyze recurrence rates of these UTIs within 30 days after the last treatment.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (rUTI) antimicrobial therapy and stewardship — use of new agents and prescribing strategies: "Promising new antimicrobials such as the first oral carbapenem, sulopenem, may also provide outpatient therapies for patients with high multidrug resistance or antibiotic-intolerant individuals at high risk of infection progression", yet "these agents should still be reserved for those with high multidrug resistance". For prescribing practices, "It may be reasonable to consider collaboration with infectious disease specialists before prescribing to reduce unnecessary prescribing". Regarding prevention, "Preliminary data suggests that continuous prophylaxis with low-dose antibiotics leads to lower rates of antibiotic resistance and fewer adverse events than intermittent treatment of symptomatic episodes", while "little is understood about the short- and long-term consequences of antibiotic use, particularly intermittent, high-dose use".

Dosing and duration of prophylactic antibiotics — women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) most commonly receive daily dosing; fosfomycin used prophylactically is dosed every 10 days. Intermittent versus daily prophylaxis showed no difference in risk of ≥ 1 UTI (2 studies; RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.50, I² = 0%); in individual trials, single-dose exposures versus daily antibiotics had RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.51, and single-dose ciprofloxacin after sexual intercourse versus daily dosing had RR: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.29 to 5.32. Reported prophylaxis duration ranged from 6 to 12 months, while in practice it can be from three to six months to one year with periodic assessment, and continuing prophylaxis for years is not evidence-based. Continuous prophylaxis dosing options include: TMP 100 mg once daily; TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg once daily; TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg thrice weekly; Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 50 mg daily; Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg daily; Cephalexin 125 mg once daily; Cephalexin 250 mg once daily; Fosfomycin 3 g every 10 days.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^111Hu8AB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.
