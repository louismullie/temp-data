## Question

Positive Infection Control Screening due to:Acute Throat pain and splotches. next steps

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the next steps should be after a positive infection control screening in a patient with acute throat pain and "splotches". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate infection control and safety. Then, rapid triage for airway compromise and sepsis. Next, I'll apply validated decision rules for GAS pharyngitis. After that, I should choose targeted diagnostic tests based on risk. Then, I need to consider dangerous mimics. Next, I will outline evidence-based treatment pathways for GAS versus viral etiologies. I should also address special populations. Finally, I will set follow-up/complication monitoring and define when to de-escalate precautions, tying it together in a succinct decision flow.

> Let me first confirm infection control priorities; with a positive screening, I should implement standard and droplet precautions immediately, mask the patient, and use appropriate PPE given the aerosol-generating nature of oropharyngeal examination in ENT settings, while obtaining point-of-care COVID-19 testing per WHO first-contact screening recommendations [^114noaCu] [^115EyiTB] [^113T6U8d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before ensuring safety; I need to rapidly assess airway and hemodynamics for stridor, dyspnea, drooling, trismus, or a muffled voice that could signal epiglottitis or deep space infections, and I should also characterize the "splotches" to distinguish scarlatiniform rash from viral exanthems, petechiae, or urticaria while noting viral features such as cough or rhinorrhea and contemporaneous COVID-19-compatible symptoms that warrant testing and isolation decisions [^113HhDKt] [^114udGCG].

> I need to check the pretest probability methodically; using the McIsaac modification of Centor is appropriate to stratify GAS risk by age, fever, tonsillar exudate/swelling, anterior cervical nodes, and absence of cough, where scores 0–1 suggest no testing, 2–3 prompt RADT ± culture, and ≥ 4 allow consideration of empiric antibiotics while still advocating testing to avoid overtreatment, with the caveat that a scarlatiniform rash increases the likelihood of GAS and should be weighed carefully [^112sp57W] [^115dgucv].

> Next, I should review diagnostic testing aligned to risk; for McIsaac ≥ 2 or a concerning scarlatiniform rash, I will obtain a GAS RADT promptly, and in children and adolescents I should confirm a negative RADT with a throat culture due to lower sensitivity, whereas in adults routine back-up culture is not necessary, and I must integrate influenza testing during influenza activity if results will influence management while ensuring COVID-19 testing has been performed at first contact, correcting my pathway if positive [^1121sGnA] [^114Md5zD] [^1128DuC8] [^114jnFcB] [^11591Brc] [^114noaCu].

> Wait, let me verify the performance claims before I proceed; I initially thought RADTs are highly sensitive and specific, but I should correct that assertion because specificity is high while sensitivity can be imperfect, particularly in pediatrics, which is exactly why negative RADTs in children warrant culture confirmation and why clinical features alone are insufficient to distinguish viral from GAS pharyngitis outside of overt viral signs [^1121sGnA] [^1127DBRg] [^114Md5zD].

> For low-risk patients with clear viral features and McIsaac 0–1, I should avoid GAS testing entirely to prevent identifying carriers and to support antimicrobial stewardship, reserving broader panels or NAAT approaches for atypical presentations or outbreak contexts where results will change management, and considering EBV testing when posterior nodes, fatigue, or splenomegaly coexist, or CT/NG NAAT for pharyngeal exposure risks when clinically indicated [^1127DBRg] [^112Jhug4] [^notfound] [^114DxQzj].

> But wait, what if the "splotches" and throat pain are actually a mimic; I must actively exclude epiglottitis, peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess, Lemierre's syndrome, Kawasaki disease in children with prolonged fever and mucocutaneous findings, and severe mononucleosis, rapidly escalating to ED imaging and IV therapy if red flags such as drooling, trismus, severe neck pain, or sepsis appear, since these override routine sore throat pathways [^113HhDKt].

> Once GAS is confirmed or suspicion remains high with McIsaac ≥ 4, I should initiate antibiotics with penicillin or amoxicillin as first-line for 10 days, choosing weight-based amoxicillin regimens in children, and selecting cephalexin for non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy or macrolides for anaphylactic allergy, while recognizing comparative trials show only modest symptomatic benefit and supporting careful selection to reduce resistance and adverse effects [^116JcF45] [^115H7z7h] [^113xm9Qm].

> I need to ensure supportive care is optimized; acetaminophen or NSAIDs are appropriate for analgesia and fever, and for severe odynophagia I can consider a single low dose of dexamethasone as adjunctive therapy because meta-analyses show a higher likelihood of pain relief at 24–48 hours, though I should apply shared decision-making given variable guideline enthusiasm and avoid masking deteriorating airway symptoms [^113Le879] [^115rpVFB] [^113GTnrG].

> Hold on, I should verify macrolide dosing specifics when a severe beta-lactam allergy is present; clarithromycin 250 mg twice daily for 10 days in adults is FDA-supported, and azithromycin pediatric dosing at 12 mg/kg once daily for 5 days is acceptable, while noting local resistance patterns may influence macrolide choice and efficacy [^116jFBoA] [^112RQmLe].

> If the etiology is viral by testing or clinical synthesis, I must avoid antibiotics entirely, emphasize analgesics, fluids, and rest, and consider antivirals when influenza is confirmed and within therapeutic windows, reinforcing stewardship because unnecessary antibiotics are common in pediatric pharyngitis and can be reduced by test-guided strategies without harming recovery [^11591Brc] [^1112LqC2] [^116kid8P] [^113bY21x].

> Let me consider special populations carefully; in children under 3 years, GAS pharyngitis is uncommon and routine testing is discouraged unless there is a classic exposure or complications, and systems-level interventions can curb inappropriate testing, whereas in elderly or immunocompromised patients I should lower the threshold for testing, imaging, or broader coverage if systemic illness is present [^116gpCfG] [^116EnqZt] [^112Jhug4].

> Next, I should review follow-up and complication monitoring; I will advise return for breathing difficulty, inability to swallow liquids, worsening rash, or escalating neck pain, expect improvement within 24–48 hours after starting appropriate antibiotics for GAS, re-evaluate at 72 hours if not improving to rule out resistance, complications, or alternate diagnoses, and avoid routine post-treatment cultures except in recurrent symptoms, prior rheumatic fever, or high-risk settings [^112AUeiw] [^113Wsq9s].

> I will now examine when to de-escalate isolation; once COVID-19 is ruled out and an alternative diagnosis is secured, I can step down from enhanced precautions, maintaining droplet precautions for influenza during the infectious period and standard precautions for uncomplicated GAS after therapy is initiated and clinical improvement is evident [^114noaCu] [^11591Brc].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also summarize the decision path to ensure nothing is missed; start with PPE and COVID-19 screening, perform airway and sepsis checks, apply McIsaac to stratify GAS risk, test with RADT and culture back-up in children when indicated, exclude dangerous mimics and escalate urgently if red flags arise, treat confirmed or high-suspicion GAS with penicillin-class agents and consider a single-dose steroid for severe pain, reserve antibiotics when viral, tailor for special populations, and set clear follow-up and de-escalation criteria to align infection control with evidence-based care [^114noaCu] [^115dgucv] [^1121sGnA] [^114Md5zD] [^113HhDKt] [^116JcF45] [^113GTnrG] [^112AUeiw].

---

For a patient with acute throat pain and splotches who screens positive for infection control, the next steps are to **isolate the patient immediately** and use **droplet precautions** (mask, gown, gloves, eye protection) [^114noaCu]. Perform a focused exam to **assess airway, breathing, and circulation** [^112kFgVy], and obtain a rapid strep test [^114jnFcB] with backup culture if negative in children [^1121sGnA], plus COVID-19 and influenza testing if indicated [^11591Brc]. If rapid strep is positive, start penicillin or amoxicillin [^115H7z7h]; if negative, manage supportively and avoid antibiotics unless bacterial infection is confirmed [^116JcF45]. Escalate care for airway compromise, severe systemic illness, or suspected epiglottitis [^113HhDKt], and document all findings, tests, and treatments.

---

## Immediate infection control measures

Immediately **isolate the patient** and implement **droplet precautions**, including a mask, gown, gloves, and eye protection [^114noaCu]. Maintain strict hand hygiene before and after all patient contact [^115EyiTB] and post clear room signage to communicate the isolation status to staff and visitors.

---

## Clinical assessment

- **History**: Onset, duration, severity, fever, cough, dysphagia, dyspnea, rash, sick contacts, recent travel, immunization status, comorbidities [^115dgucv].

- **Physical exam**: Focused ENT exam; assess airway, breathing, circulation; look for tonsillar exudates, cervical lymphadenopathy, palatal petechiae, rash [^114Vz68L].

- **Airway assessment**: Evaluate for stridor, drooling, muffled voice, trismus, respiratory distress [^112kFgVy].

---

## Diagnostic testing

- **Rapid antigen detection test (RADT)**: Perform RADT for GAS [^1121sGnA]; if negative in children, obtain backup throat culture [^114jnFcB].

- **COVID-19 and influenza testing**: Test if symptoms or exposure history suggest these infections [^11591Brc] [^114udGCG].

- **Additional tests**: Consider CBC, CRP, ESR, or NAATs if severe illness or complications are suspected.

---

## Management based on test results

| **Test result** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Positive RADT or throat culture for GAS | - Initiate penicillin or amoxicillin [^116JcF45] [^115H7z7h] <br/> - If allergic, use azithromycin or clarithromycin [^112RQmLe] [^116jFBoA] |
| Negative RADT and culture | - Supportive care (analgesics, antipyretics, hydration) [^113Le879] <br/> - Avoid antibiotics unless bacterial infection is confirmed [^1127DBRg] |
| Positive COVID-19 or influenza test | - Follow respective guidelines [^114udGCG] <br/> - Consider antivirals for influenza if indicated [^11591Brc] |

---

## Indications for escalation of care

Escalate care immediately for signs of **airway compromise** — such as stridor, drooling, respiratory distress, or trismus — or for **severe systemic illness**, including high fever, hypotension, or altered mental status. Suspected epiglottitis or deep neck space infection warrants urgent ENT or critical care consultation [^112kFgVy].

---

## Documentation and communication

Record the history, exam, test results, treatments, and isolation measures, and **inform the healthcare team and infection control** of the patient's status and management plan [^114noaCu].

---

## Follow-up and reassessment

Monitor for **clinical deterioration** or complications, and arrange follow-up to ensure symptom resolution and adherence to **isolation precautions**.

---

## Patient education

Explain the **diagnosis**, **treatment**, **isolation precautions**, and when to seek medical attention [^115dgucv].

---

## Summary of next steps

1. **Immediate isolation and droplet precautions**.

2. **Focused clinical assessment and airway evaluation**.

3. **RADT for GAS with backup culture if negative in children**.

4. **COVID-19 and influenza testing if indicated**.

5. **Antibiotics if GAS positive; supportive care if negative**.

6. **Escalate care for airway compromise or severe illness**.

7. **Document and communicate clearly**.

8. **Arrange follow-up and provide patient education**.

---

These steps ensure prompt diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and **prevention of transmission** in patients with acute throat pain and a splotchy rash.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for laryngitis, more specifically with respect to viral testing (influenza, flu season), the IDSA 2018 guidelines recommend testing for influenza in patients presenting with acute respiratory symptoms (with or without fever) during influenza activity. This is especially important in cases of exacerbation of chronic medical conditions such as asthma, COPD, or heart failure, or when there are known complications of influenza, provided that the testing result will influence clinical management.

Regarding preventative measures for rheumatic fever, specifically in the context of primary prevention, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining a rapid antigen detection test for GAS pharyngitis in most patients with symptoms of acute pharyngitis. This is because clinical features alone do not reliably discriminate between group A streptococcal and viral pharyngitis, except when overt viral features, such as rhinorrhea, cough, oral ulcers, and/or hoarseness, are present.

### Review: Known, emerging, and reemerging pharyngitis pathogens [^112Jhug4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

**Diagnostic gaps: Points to ponder**: Pharyngitis may be caused by known pathogens such as GAS, but also by emerging and reemerging pathogens due to ever-evolving geopolitical and social paradigms. To effectively diagnose and treat pharyngitis and promote antibiotic stewardship, it is imperative that new diagnostic methods keep pace. Cutting-edge technologies such as nucleic acid amplification can simultaneously detect and quantify multiple pathogens, assisting in the appropriate diagnosis, management, and outcomes of individuals with pharyngitis. However, individuals may simultaneously be colonized with bacterial and viral pathogens, which can confound the interpretation of test results and lead to unnecessary antibiotic administration or inappropriate patient management. These new detection methods must be able to distinguish between these two conditions while remaining cost-effective. The second article of this supplement will elaborate on the state of laboratory and point-of-care diagnostic testing for pharyngitis and address these and other knowledge gaps.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^114udGCG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

The clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are highly variable. Some individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain asymptomatic, while the infection can cause mild to moderate COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia in others. This can lead to some requiring intensive care support and, in some cases, to death, especially in older adults. Symptoms such as fever, cough, or loss of smell or taste, and signs such as oxygen saturation, are the first and most readily available diagnostic information. Such information could be used to either rule out COVID-19 or select patients for further testing. This is an update of the review, the first version of which was published in July 2020.

- **Objectives**: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19.

- **Search methods**: For this review iteration, we conducted electronic searches up to 15 July 2020 in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the University of Bern living search database. Additionally, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were eligible if they included patients with clinically suspected COVID-19 or recruited known cases with COVID-19 and controls without COVID-19. Studies were considered eligible when they recruited patients presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies in hospitalized patients were only included if symptoms and signs were relevant.

### Clinical score and rapid antigen detection test to guide antibiotic use for sore throats: Randomised controlled trial of PRISM (primary care streptococcal management) [^116sPdqb]. BMJ (2013). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of clinical scores that predict streptococcal infection or rapid streptococcal antigen detection tests compared with delayed antibiotic prescribing.

- **Design**: Open adaptive pragmatic parallel group randomized controlled trial.
- **Setting**: Primary care in the United Kingdom.
- **Patients**: Patients aged ≥ 3 with acute sore throat.
- **Intervention**: An internet program randomized patients to targeted antibiotic use according to delayed antibiotics (the comparator group for analyses), clinical score, or antigen test used according to clinical score. During the trial, a preliminary streptococcal score (score 1, n = 1129) was replaced by a more consistent score (score 2, n = 631; features: fever during the previous 24 hours; purulence; attends rapidly (within three days after onset of symptoms); inflamed tonsils; no cough/coryza (acronym FeverPAIN)).

- **Outcomes**: Symptom severity reported by patients on a 7-point Likert scale (mean severity of sore throat/difficulty swallowing for days two to four after the consultation (primary outcome)), duration of symptoms, and use of antibiotics.

- **Results**: For score 1, there were no significant differences between groups. For score 2, symptom severity was documented in 80% (168/207 (81%) in the delayed antibiotics group; 168/211 (80%) in the clinical score group; 166/213 (78%) in the antigen test group). Reported severity of symptoms was lower in the clinical score group (-0.33, 95% confidence interval -0.64 to -0.02; P = 0.04), equivalent to one in three rating sore throat a slight versus moderate problem, with a similar reduction for the antigen.

### Pharyngitis [^116cRSaQ]. American Family Physician (2004). High credibility.

Sore throat is one of the most common reasons for visits to family physicians. While most patients with sore throat have an infectious cause (pharyngitis), fewer than 20 percent have a clear indication for antibiotic therapy (i.e.g.roup A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection). Useful, well-validated clinical decision rules are available to help family physicians care for patients who present with pharyngitis. Because of recent improvements in rapid streptococcal antigen tests, throat culture can be reserved for patients whose symptoms do not improve over time or who do not respond to antibiotics.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis: 2012 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112AUeiw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, specifically in the context of post-treatment throat culture, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend not obtaining routine follow-up post-treatment throat cultures or rapid antigen detection tests. These should only be considered in special circumstances.

### Reducing streptococcal testing in patients < 3 years old in an emergency department [^116gpCfG]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Although pharyngitis is common, group A Streptococcus is an uncommon etiology, and sequelae are rare in patients under 3 years old. Inappropriate testing leads to increased healthcare costs and unnecessary exposure to antibiotics. Rapid streptococcal tests (RSTs) for group A Streptococcus pharyngitis are not routinely indicated in this age group. At our urban, tertiary pediatric emergency department (ED), an average of 20 RSTs were performed each month for patients under 3 years of age. Our objective was to reduce RSTs in the ED for this age group by 50% over 18 months.

- **Methods**: We initiated this project in October 2016 at an urban, tertiary pediatric ED. We surveyed pertinent multidisciplinary stakeholders to identify factors leading to RSTs in children under 3 years. Multiple interventions were conducted, and we collected weekly data on the number of RSTs in children under 3 years (outcome measure) and the number of family complaints and return visits for complications of pharyngitis (balancing measure). Statistical process control was used for analysis.

- **Results**: The mean number of RSTs ordered per month in patients under 3 years declined by 52% in 10 months. The majority of tests during the study phase were ordered by nurse practitioners (62%) for patients aged 25 to 36 months (66%). There has been one family grievance and no patient complications attributable to the project.

- **Conclusions**: Our interventions led to a successful and sustained reduction of RSTs in patients under 3 years. A local clinical practice guideline was developed, and the project was expanded to other departments.

### Review: Known, emerging, and remerging pharyngitis pathogens [^112sp57W]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The McIsaac score, a modified Centor Score, is the most common decision rule used to clinically diagnose GAS pharyngitis and differentiate it from viral pharyngitis. It includes a point system (0–5) for specific criteria as follows:

- **Patient age**: 1 point for 3–14 years, 0 points for 15–44 years, −1 point for ≥ 45 years
- **Tonsillar swelling/exudate**: 1 point if present, 0 points if absent
- **Tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes**: 1 point if present, 0 points if absent
- **Temperature**: 1 point for > 38°C, 0 points for < 38°C
- **Cough**: 1 point if absent, 0 points if present

Point totals are used to recommend actions:

- **Score 0–1**: No testing or antibiotics
- **Score 2–3**: Perform rapid antigen and/or culture testing
- **Score ≥ 4**: Consider rapid antigen and/or culture testing and it is acceptable to prescribe empiric antibiotics

Outcome measures from a large meta-analysis (206,870 patients) found that for patients 3 years or older, 27% tested positive for GAS. McIsaac scores (95% confidence interval) of positive GAS patients were tallied by percent:

- **Percentage of positive GAS patients**:
	- **Score 0**: 8%
	- **Score 1**: 14%
	- **Score 2**: 23%
	- **Score 3**: 37%
	- **Score 4**: 55%

In another study validating the guidelines for the management of pharyngitis in both adults and children (n = 787), a McIsaac score of 3 or 4 was associated with a high rate of unnecessary antibiotic use when used without culture or RADTs. As a priority, the medical history and clinical exam should exclude signs/symptoms consistent with complicated GAS pharyngitis, including airway obstruction and invasive disease into neck tissues.

### Review: Known, emerging, and reemerging pharyngitis pathogens [^114miVT2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria represent the most commonly encountered etiological agents; yeast, fungi, and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these are predominantly observed in unique populations, such as immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals. This article (part 1 of 3) summarizes the impact of acute pharyngitis on the health care system and reviews the etiologic agents of acute pharyngitis, including both emerging and reemerging pathogens that health care providers should consider when evaluating their patients. Finally, it sets the stage for parts 2 and 3, which discuss the evolving state of diagnostic testing for acute pharyngitis.

### Infectious indications for tonsillectomy [^111rcuwg]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Tonsillectomy is the most common major surgery performed on children in the United States. Throat infections of either bacterial or viral etiology can cause significant morbidity and decreased quality of life, potentially leading to life-threatening complications. When performed on the appropriate patient, tonsillectomy can be a highly effective procedure. Recent clinical trials have sought to better define the appropriate infectious indications for surgery. Despite the improved understanding gained from these studies, the decision to operate must always be made on an individual basis with the primary care physician, surgeon, patient, and family all involved in the decision-making process.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^114dQPo6]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Objective: To estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat.

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials.

Data sources: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, and reference lists of eligible trials and related reviews.

Study selection: Randomised controlled trials of the addition of corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of sore throat were included irrespective of language or publication status.

Review methods: Reviewers identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence independently and in duplicate. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. A random effects model was used for meta-analyses, and the quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Results: Ten eligible trials enrolled 1,426 individuals. Patients who received a single low dose of corticosteroids, with the most common intervention being oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg, were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%; moderate quality evidence), and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%).

### Diagnosis of strep throat in adults: Are clinical criteria really good enough [^113aYefM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical manifestations of group A streptococcal and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis overlap quite broadly. For this reason, the updated Infectious Diseases Society of America practice guideline for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, published in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, recommends laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis by means of either throat culture or a rapid antigen detection test. However, a recently published guideline, developed by a subcommittee of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine (ACP-ASIM) in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, advocates the use of a clinical algorithm alone, in lieu of microbiologic testing, for confirmation of the diagnosis in adults for whom the suspicion of streptococcal infection is high.

In this discussion, we examine the assumptions of the ACP-ASIM guideline, question whether its recommendations will achieve the stated objective of dramatically decreasing excess antibiotic use, and suggest that its recommendations be confirmed by clinical trials before clinicians abandon long-held teachings regarding the diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.

### Application of biomaterials for the prevention of pharyngeal fistulae: A systematic review [^117QH6EE]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

Pharyngocutaneous fistulae (PCF) represent a significant clinical challenge in otorhinolaryngology practice. The use of biomaterials could improve outcomes or even replace the use of a flap in pharyngolaryngeal surgery. This systematic review included all studies evaluating the application of biomaterials for the prevention of PCF after pharyngeal surgery.

A total of 19 articles (12 clinical and 7 animal studies) were included. They assessed the use of a biomaterial to cover mucosal sutures (n = 15) or to replace a mucosal defect and guide secondary healing (n = 4). Most studies evaluated commercialized biomaterials (n = 11) rather than experimental devices (n = 5) or platelet‐derived autologous medical devices (n = 4).

There are already strong arguments to support the use of several biomaterials to cover pharyngeal sutures to decrease the rate of PCF after TL or TPL. Replacing a pharyngeal mucosal defect by a biomaterial is currently a more elusive goal.

### Levofloxacin [^1145gu11]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

Levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) using either 750 mg by mouth for 5 days or 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10–14 days. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high-dose, short-course regimen of levofloxacin, 780 outpatient adults with clinically and radiologically diagnosed ABS were assessed in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multicenter study. This study compared levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth once daily for five days to levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 days.

Clinical success rates, defined as the complete or partial resolution of pre-treatment signs and symptoms of ABS to the extent that no further antibiotic treatment was necessary, were observed in the microbiologically evaluable population. Success rates were 91.4% (139/152) in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 88.6% (132/149) in the levofloxacin 500 mg group at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [-4.2, 10.0] for levofloxacin 750 mg minus levofloxacin 500 mg.

- **Clinical success by pathogen**: In the microbiologically evaluable population with specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry, comparable results were observed for both the five- and ten-day regimens at the test-of-cure visit 22 days post-treatment.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: A retrospective study [^1112LqC2]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Treating children with antibiotics when not indicated generates unnecessary healthcare costs and exposes patients to the risks of antibiotic treatment without associated benefits, while contributing to increasing antimicrobial resistance. A recent AAP report on the use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections, including pharyngitis, emphasized the importance of judicious prescribing in order to slow the rise of resistance. Pharyngitis is an important target for antimicrobial stewardship efforts because of the large number of patients affected, and because cases caused by GAS are difficult to distinguish clinically from those with a viral etiology; such clinical uncertainty has been implicated in unnecessary antibiotic prescribing.

Prior studies have evaluated adherence to guidelines for the management of pharyngitis among pediatric care providers. Kronman et al. found that 57% of children received antibiotics during office visits for pharyngitis, significantly higher than the expected rate of GAS infection. However, this study did not evaluate patients' histories or GAS test results, so it was not possible to determine how many patients were prescribed antibiotics in the absence of GAS infection or to characterize patients' clinical presentations. In an analysis of pediatric outpatient visits for pharyngitis, Benin et al. found that a GAS test was ordered for 78% of patients and that the presence of pharyngeal exudate increased the likelihood of testing; 36% of patients prescribed antibiotics had a negative GAS test.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis: 2012 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115H7z7h]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, and more specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend initiating an appropriate antibiotic. Penicillin or amoxicillin is the drugs of choice if the patient is not allergic to these agents. The guidelines specify administering the antibiotic at an appropriate dose for a duration likely to eradicate the organism from the pharynx, which is usually 10 days.

### Clinical score and rapid antigen detection test to guide antibiotic use for sore throats: Randomised controlled trial of PRISM (Primary Care Streptococcal Management) [^115hwAUK]. BMJ (2013). High credibility.

We used two diagnostic studies in patients not involved in the trial (combined n = 1107) to develop the clinical scores to predict streptococcal infection with Lancefield groups C, G, and A. The initial plan was to follow a traditional "sequential" approach of developing a score in one cohort, then validating it in a second cohort to circumvent the problem of overfitting. The first part of the trial used a clinical score developed from the first diagnostic study (score 1) with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.76. However, the second diagnostic study showed considerably reduced discrimination for score 1 (AUC 0.65) due to inconsistent performance of the variables composing score 1.

Therefore, we used a modified approach to generate a second score (score 2; acronym FeverPAIN), drawing from both diagnostic studies and correcting for overfitting issues by using bootstrapping techniques. Variables were included in the second score only if they were significant in univariate analysis of both diagnostic studies and in the multivariate analysis of at least one of the two studies.

Score 2 demonstrated moderate discrimination in both cohorts (AUC first cohort 0.74, second 0.71), performing better than the Centor criteria (0.72 and 0.65, respectively). Unlike the Centor criteria, score 2 (FeverPAIN) effectively identified a substantial number of participants at low risk of streptococcal infection.

### Review: Known, emerging, and reemerging pharyngitis pathogens [^1153gQxv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria represent the most commonly encountered etiologic agents, while yeast/fungi and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these pathogens are predominantly observed in unique populations, such as immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals. This article (part 1 of 3) summarizes the impact of acute pharyngitis on the healthcare system and reviews the etiologic agents of acute pharyngitis, including both emerging and reemerging pathogens that healthcare providers should consider when evaluating their patients. Finally, it sets the stage for parts 2 and 3, which discuss the evolving state of diagnostic testing for acute pharyngitis.

### Corticosteroids as standalone or add-on treatment for sore throat [^113GTnrG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Sore throat is a common condition associated with a high rate of antibiotic prescriptions, despite limited evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics. Corticosteroids may improve symptoms of sore throat by reducing inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. This review is an update to the review published in 2012.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical benefit and safety of corticosteroids in reducing the symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2019), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 14 May 2019), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, 2002 to 2015), and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (inception to 2015). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared steroids to either placebo or standard care in adults and children (aged over three years) with sore throat. We excluded studies of hospitalized participants, those with infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included one new RCT in this update, for a total of nine trials involving 1319 participants (369 children and 950 adults). In eight trials, participants in both corticosteroid and placebo groups received antibiotics; one trial offered delayed prescription.

### Clinical practice guideline: Hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^114c5WSv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). High credibility.

Laryngitis can be associated with various conditions and symptoms, including throat pain, stridor, cough, and acute otitis media. Other related factors include aphonia, bisphosphonates, headache, sleep apnea, otitis media with effusion, dysphonia, and tobacco use. Hoarseness might also stem from allergic rhinitis, an immunocompromising condition, globus sensation, and corticosteroids. Additionally, dysphagia, voice overuse, GERD, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, recent intubation, ACE inhibitors, change in voice, antipsychotics, pharyngitis, acute rhinosinusitis, vocal cord nodules, and odynophagia may be involved.

### Analytical evaluation of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in rectal and pharyngeal swabs [^114DxQzj]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2020). Low credibility.

The clinical performance of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay in rectal and pharyngeal specimens was recently evaluated in a multicenter study of 2598 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, alongside two other assays that have now been FDA-approved for detection of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae at rectal and pharyngeal sites. The negative predictive value of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay was high: 98.7% and 99.0% for N. gonorrhoeae at pharyngeal and rectal sites, respectively, and 99.7% and 98.3% for C. trachomatis at pharyngeal and rectal sites, respectively. These estimates were similar to the other two assays tested and correspond to high sensitivity of the assays. The limit of detection findings also support the high sensitivity of the test.

The data presented herein demonstrate that the Abbott CT/NG RealTime assay is an accurate, sensitive, specific, and reliable assay in laboratory-derived rectal and pharyngeal specimens. These findings, alongside clinical performance data, support potential claims of use of the assay for detection of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infections in rectal and pharyngeal specimens.

### Tonsillectomy or adeno-tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis [^113zrmde]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Surgical removal of the tonsils, with or without adenoidectomy (adeno-/tonsillectomy), is a common ENT operation, but the indications for surgery are controversial.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effects of tonsillectomy, with and without adenoidectomy, in patients with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), bibliographies, and additional sources were searched for published and unpublished trials. The date of the last search was 11 April 2008.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy, with non-surgical treatment in adults and children with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis. We included trials which used reduction in the number and severity of tonsillitis and sore throat as main outcome measures.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors applied the inclusion/exclusion criteria independently.

- **Main results**: This review includes five studies: four undertaken in children (719 participants) and one in adults (70 participants). Good information about the effects of tonsillectomy is only available for children and for effects in the first year following surgery. Children were divided into two subgroups: those who are severely affected (based on specific criteria which are often referred to as the 'Paradise criteria') and those less severely affected. For more severely affected children, positive outcomes were observed.

### The association between laryngopharyngeal sensory deficits, pharyngeal motor function, and the prevalence of aspiration with thin liquids [^115rXWTB]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The study goal was to evaluate the association among laryngopharyngeal sensory deficits, pharyngeal motor function, and the prevalence of aspiration with thin liquids.

- **Study design and setting**: We conducted a prospective study of 204 consecutive patients undergoing flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with sensory testing and an assessment of pharyngeal motor function (pharyngeal squeeze). Patients were divided into six groups depending on the results of sensory and motor testing in the laryngopharynx. Subjects were given 5 mL of thin liquid, and the prevalence of aspiration in each group was compared.

- **Results**: The mean age of the entire cohort was 65 years (58% female). The prevalence of aspiration in patients with intact laryngopharyngeal sensation was 2% (3 of 137) in persons with intact pharyngeal motor function and 29% (2 of 7) when pharyngeal motor function was impaired (P < 0.05). The prevalence of aspiration in patients with a moderate decrease in laryngopharyngeal sensation was 0% (0 of 9) in persons with intact pharyngeal motor function and 67% (2 of 3) when pharyngeal motor function was impaired (P < 0.05). The prevalence of aspiration in patients with severely diminished or absent laryngopharyngeal sensation was 15% (5 of 33) in persons with intact pharyngeal motor function and 100% (15 of 15) when pharyngeal motor function was impaired (P < 0.05).

Patients with severely diminished laryngopharyngeal sensation and pharyngeal motor function are at an extremely high risk of aspirating thin liquids (100%). Moderate sensory deficits further increase the risk of aspiration when pharyngeal motor function is impaired.

### Clinical practice guideline: Adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, which is defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline's target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests, including nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing fields such as allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

- **Results**: The panel made strong recommendations that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113RvRFF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

The AAO-HNSF 2019 guidelines provide recommendations regarding surgical interventions for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, specifically in relation to indications for tonsillectomy. Pediatric patients with recurrent throat infections that do not meet the criteria for tonsillectomy should be evaluated for modifying factors that might favor the procedure, including but not limited to:

- **Multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance**: This may influence the decision towards surgical intervention.

- **Periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome (PFAPA)**: This condition may also lead to consideration for tonsillectomy.

- **History of more than one peritonsillar abscess**: This history can be a compelling reason to consider tonsillectomy.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: A retrospective study [^116kid8P]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

We found that 28% of antibiotic prescriptions for pediatric patients evaluated for pharyngitis were not recommended by guidelines, primarily due to the prescription of antibiotics despite negative GAS test results. Given the frequency of pharyngitis in children, further targeted antimicrobial stewardship education for providers should be emphasized to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. Studies assessing why adherence to guidelines for the management of pharyngitis in children appears to be greater than in adults may help elucidate which aspects of antimicrobial stewardship efforts have been most successful.

### Predicting streptococcal pharyngitis in adults in primary care: A systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs and validation of the Centor score [^114Vz68L]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Individual symptoms and signs offer only a modest ability to rule in or out a diagnosis of GABHS pharyngitis. The Centor score, which uses a combination of signs and symptoms, predicts the risk of GABHS pharyngitis. It is well calibrated across various countries and settings, demonstrating reasonably good specificity. The Centor score can enhance the appropriate prescribing of antibiotics but should be used with caution in low prevalence settings of GABHS pharyngitis, such as primary care.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115rpVFB]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

This study aims to estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat. The research design was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Data were sourced from Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, and reference lists of eligible trials and related reviews.

- **Study selection**: The focus was on randomized controlled trials involving the addition of corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged five or older in emergency department and primary care settings, displaying clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or sore throat syndrome. Trials were included regardless of language or publication status.

- **Review methods**: Reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. A random effects model was used for meta-analyses, and the quality of evidence was assessed utilizing the GRADE approach.

Results demonstrated that 10 eligible trials enrolled 1426 individuals. Patients who received a single low dose of corticosteroids (the most common intervention being oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg) were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%; moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%; high quality evidence).

### Clinical mimics: An emergency medicine-focused review of streptococcal pharyngitis mimics [^113HhDKt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pharyngitis is a common disease in the emergency department (ED). Despite a relatively low incidence of complications, numerous dangerous conditions can mimic this disease and are essential for the emergency physician to consider.

This article provides a review of the evaluation and management of group A β-hemolytic Streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis, as well as important medical conditions that can mimic this disease.

GABHS pharyngitis often presents with fever, sore throat, tonsillar exudates, and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. History and physical examination are insufficient for diagnosis. The Centor criteria or McIsaac score can help risk stratify patients for subsequent testing or treatment. Antibiotics may reduce symptom duration and suppurative complications, but the effect is small. Rheumatic fever is uncommon in developed countries, and shared decision-making is recommended if antibiotics are used for this indication. Oral analgesics and topical anesthetics are important for symptom management. Physicians should consider alternate diagnoses that may mimic GABHS pharyngitis, which can include epiglottitis, infectious mononucleosis, Kawasaki disease, acute retroviral syndrome, Lemierre's syndrome, Ludwig's angina, peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, and viral pharyngitis. A focused history and physical examination can help differentiate these conditions.

GABHS may present similarly to other benign and potentially deadly diseases. Diagnosis and treatment of pharyngitis should be based on thorough evaluation and consideration of these mimics.

### Efficacy and safety of rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat [^113bY21x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Sore throat is a common condition caused by viruses or bacteria and is a leading cause of antibiotic prescription in primary care. The most common bacterial species is group A streptococcus ('strep throat'). Between 50% to 70% of pharyngitis cases are treated with antibiotics, despite the majority of cases being viral in origin. One strategy to reduce antibiotic use is to utilize rapid tests for group A streptococcus to guide antibiotic prescriptions. Rapid tests can be employed alone or in combination with a clinical scoring system.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of strategies based on rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat in primary care settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS, as well as the trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP on 5 June 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid tests with management based on clinical grounds to guide the prescription of antibiotics for people with a sore throat in ambulatory care settings. We included trials that randomized individuals, as well as cluster-RCTs in which individual practitioners (or practices) or emergency departments were randomized.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data on the primary outcomes (number of participants provided with an antibiotic prescription; number of participants with an antibiotic dispensed) and secondary outcomes (duration of sore throat symptoms; duration of other symptoms; quality of life measures).

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^113xm9Qm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2021.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2023, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Elsevier, and Web of Science (Clarivate) up to 19 March 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews.

### Review: Known, emerging, and reemerging pharyngitis pathogens [^114VbJK6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both adults and children. It accounts for 1%–2% of all outpatient visits in the United States annually. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) alone causes an estimated 5.2 million outpatient visits and 2.8 million antibiotic prescriptions each year among US individuals aged 0–64 years with pharyngitis. As one of the most frequent reasons for primary care visits, pharyngitis is the leading diagnosis linked to antibiotic use in school-aged children. Individuals complaining of a sore throat frequently present to medical emergency departments. According to the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2017), there were more than 1.19 million visits to US emergency departments for acute pharyngitis.

In one study evaluating the medical and nonmedical costs of pediatric pharyngitis, children missed an average of 1.9 days of school or daycare, and 42% of parents missed work. Expanding the familial impact of pharyngitis, a second parent or caregiver missed an average of 1.5 days in 14% of families. Including indirect costs related to the loss of parents' wages while missing work, the estimated total cost in the United States was calculated to be between $224 and $539 million annually. In this review, we describe the key characteristics of GAS pharyngeal infections, as well as other causes of pharyngeal infections, and highlight emerging pathogens that clinicians must consider in both children and adults.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: A retrospective study [^1156R5ih]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial etiology of pharyngitis, accounting for approximately one-quarter of cases of pharyngitis that lead children to seek medical attention. Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and suppurative complications of GAS can be prevented by early antibacterial treatment; indeed, prevention of ARF is one of the primary goals of antibiotic treatment for GAS pharyngitis. However, GAS pharyngitis is difficult to distinguish clinically from viral pharyngitis. Treating children who have viral pharyngitis with antimicrobials is ineffective, generates unnecessary costs, exposes them to antibiotic side effects without benefit, and contributes to the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance.

To minimize prescription of antimicrobials for viral pharyngitis, clinical scoring systems have been developed to predict the likelihood of GAS infection. Among these is the McIsaac score, which was developed and validated in both children and adults. Such scores have low positive predictive values but help identify patients at low risk of GAS, in whom testing is not only unnecessary but may lead to the identification of chronic GAS carriers experiencing viral pharyngitis.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline on diagnosis and management of GAS pharyngitis recommends that patients whose clinical presentation is consistent with GAS pharyngitis be tested with a streptococcal rapid antigen detection test (RADT) or throat culture; treatment is indicated if either is positive. Testing is not recommended for patients whose presentation is not consistent with GAS pharyngitis.

### Performing otolaryngological outpatient consultation during the Covid-19 pandemic [^113T6U8d]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Low credibility.

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on otolaryngology outpatient clinical practice, which is at high risk of respiratory viral transmission due to the close contact between the examiner and the patient's airway secretions [1]. Moreover, most otolaryngological procedures, including oropharyngoscopy, generate droplets or aerosols from high viral shedding areas [1]. Thus, only non-deferrable consultations were performed during the outbreak's acute phase. Along with the reopening of elective clinical services and the impending second wave of the outbreak, a reorganization is necessary to minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission [1].

- **Methods**: This video (Video 1) shows how to safely conduct an outpatient otorhinolaryngological consultation, focusing on complete ear, nose, and throat examination, according to evidence from the published literature and otolaryngological societies' guidelines [2,3].

- **Results**: After telephonic screening, patients reporting Covid-19 symptoms or close contact with a Covid-19 case within the last 14 days are referred to telehealth services [1–3]. To avoid crowding, the patient is admitted alone, after body temperature control, except for underage or disabled people [1]. The waiting room assessment must guarantee a social distance of 6 ft [1–3]. The consultation room is reorganized into two separate areas: 1) a clean desk area, where an assistant wearing a surgical mask and gloves handles the patient's documentation and writes the medical report, keeping proper distance from the patient, and 2) a separate consultation area.

### Antibiotics for sore throat [^114zT1Nb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Sore throat is a very common reason for people to seek medical care. It is a disease that remits spontaneously, meaning 'cure' is not dependent on treatment. Nonetheless, primary care doctors commonly prescribe antibiotics for sore throat and other upper respiratory tract infections.

- **Objective**: To assess the benefits of antibiotics in the management of sore throat.

- **Search strategy**: A systematic search of the literature from 1945 to 2003 was conducted using electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2003), EMBASE (January 1990 to March 2003), and the reference sections of identified articles. No language restrictions were applied. Abstracts of the identified articles were used to recognize trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Trials of antibiotics against control with either measures of typical symptoms (throat soreness, headache, or fever), or suppurative (meaning forming pus) and non-suppurative complications of sore throat.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently screened potential studies for inclusion, resolving differences of opinion through discussion. The reviewers then independently extracted the data from the selected studies. The authors of three studies were contacted to acquire additional information not available in published articles. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers for studies selected by inclusion, with any disagreements resolved through discussion.

### Predicting streptococcal pharyngitis in adults in primary care: A systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs and validation of the Centor score [^111a2kGX]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The most widely recognized clinical prediction rule (CPR) for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis is the Centor score. The Centor score consists of four signs and symptoms and is recommended in clinical guidelines from the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine (ACP/ASIM) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US. The ACP/ASIM recommends:

- **Empirical antibiotic treatment**: For adults with at least three of the four Centor criteria and no treatment for all others. Alternatively, empirical treatment is advised for adults with all four criteria, a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for patients with three or two criteria, and subsequent treatment of those with positive test results, with no treatment for all others.

In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends that clinicians consider immediate treatment with antibiotics for patients who have three or more Centor criteria. A modified version of the Centor criteria is also used in New Zealand as part of a guideline for sore throat management.

Patients receive a point for the presence or absence of specific signs and symptoms, with each patient being assigned a score between 0 and 4. This score is associated with a post-test probability, as calculated by Centor and colleagues. The post-test probability values presented are the mean of the original probability intervals reported by Centor and colleagues.

The pretest probability of GABHS pharyngitis is reported to peak between the ages of 5 and 10 years. The prevalence in children is reported to be around 20% to 25%, while in adults it is between 5% and 10%.

### Review: Current laboratory and point-of-care pharyngitis diagnostic testing and knowledge gaps [^111jePND]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The landscape of diagnostic testing for pharyngitis is evolving with advanced technologies. Two tables were previously provided, illustrating FDA-approved nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for acute pharyngitis and their performance characteristics. Unfortunately, these tables have been removed. Nonetheless, understanding the available diagnostic options and their effectiveness remains crucial for improving patient outcomes.

Research indicates a need for significant improvements in rapid and accurate testing methods. Developing point-of-care tests with enhanced sensitivity and specificity can lead to quicker diagnoses and better-targeted treatments. Addressing existing knowledge gaps is essential for advancing diagnostic protocols and improving the management of pharyngitis in clinical practice.

### Review: Diagnostic potential for collaborative pharyngitis biomarkers [^1172hLM3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria represent the most commonly encountered etiologic agents; yeast, fungi, and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these are predominantly observed in unique populations, such as immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals. This manuscript (part 3 of 3) summarizes the state of biomarker diagnostic testing and highlights the expanding role they will likely play in the expedited diagnosis and management of patients with acute pharyngitis. Biomarkers, in conjunction with rapid antigen and/or nucleic acid amplification testing, will likely become the standard of care to accurately diagnose the etiologic agents of pharyngitis. This novel testing paradigm has the potential to guide appropriate patient management and antibiotic stewardship by accurately determining if the cause of pharyngitis is due to a viral or bacterial etiology.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^111SM6Ga]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Reviewers extracted data independently and in duplicate on general study information, including authors, publication year, and study location; study population details such as sample size, age, diagnosis, and the percentage of participants with confirmed group A β-haemolytic streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis or culture positive for bacterial pathogens; and the setting, whether primary care or hospital emergency department. They also noted details on the intervention and comparison, including type, form, duration, and dose of corticosteroids, and the type of control group; co-interventions, like the proportion of participants who received antibiotics and/or analgesics; and outcomes as listed above.

In randomised controlled trials with more than two arms, data were extracted from the arm closest to a single dose regimen or from the arm that received corticosteroids as an adjunct to standard care rather than replacing it. For trials with both oral and parenteral corticosteroids, oral data were used for the main analysis, while intramuscular data were used for appropriate subgroup analysis.

Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias using the modified Cochrane risk of bias instrument, which addresses random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of study participants, healthcare providers, and outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, and other potential sources of bias. Studies were classified as high risk of bias if at least one item was rated as high risk.

To assess the quality of evidence, the GRA tool was utilized.

### Tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection in moderately affected children [^111d8Dng]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

In previous clinical trials involving children severely affected by recurrent throat infections, defined as seven or more well-documented, clinically significant, and adequately treated episodes in the preceding year, or five or more such episodes in each of the two preceding years, or three or more such episodes in each of the three preceding years, we found that tonsillectomy was effective in reducing the number and severity of subsequent episodes for at least two years. The results supported the election of tonsillectomy for children meeting these stringent eligibility criteria, while also providing support for nonsurgical management.

We conducted the present trials to determine:

1. Whether tonsillectomy would offer equivalent benefits to children who were less severely affected than those in our earlier trials but still had indications for tonsillectomy that were comparable to general practices.
2. Whether, in such children, the addition of adenoidectomy would confer additional benefits.

We conducted two parallel randomized, controlled trials at the Ambulatory Care Center of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. To qualify, children needed to have a history of recurring throat infections that met standards slightly less stringent than those in our previous trials, in terms of frequency of previous episodes, their clinical features, or their level of documentation, but not less stringent in more than one of these parameters. These relaxed standards were still more rigorous than those in the official guidelines.

### Guideline for the management of acute sore throat [^111ncXxk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, specifically concerning corticosteroids, the ESCMID 2012 guidelines suggest offering corticosteroids for adult patients with more severe presentations, such as those exhibiting 3–4 Centor criteria.

### Intervention to improve interobserver agreement in the assessment of children with pharyngitis [^111MyvP3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of an intervention to improve interobserver reliability of clinical evaluation of children with pharyngitis.

This was a sequential trial performed in an academic children's hospital emergency department. Two sets of 100 children aged 2 to 18 years with a complaint of sore throat were independently evaluated by emergency department attending staff and residents for coryza, scarlatiniform rash, tonsillar enlargement, tonsillar erythema, tonsillar exudates, cervical adenopathy, and palatal petechiae. The first 100 subjects were evaluated according to the clinician's routine practice; the second set was evaluated using a visual-aid sheet showing pictorial gradations of each characteristic. All findings were scored dichotomously and analyzed by kappa statistics.

Both sets of patients were similar with respect to age, sex, race, and prior episodes of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Interobserver reliability without the visual aid was poor in all areas except tonsillar enlargement and tonsillar exudates, which had kappa values of 0.50 and 0.58, respectively. The use of the visual-aid sheet did not significantly improve reliability in any of the clinical evaluations, and all kappa scores remained below 0.50.

In conclusion, interobserver reliability in evaluating clinical signs of pharyngitis is fair to poor. The use of pictorial prompts does not improve interobserver reliability.

### Predictors of suppurative complications for acute sore throat in primary care: Prospective clinical cohort study [^111STbsy]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The study was designed for rapid recruitment to minimize selection bias using a simple clinical proforma to generate a large generalizable prospective cohort. Although a few practices also recruited patients for more intensive substudies (two diagnostic studies and a randomized trial), patients could be recruited to the study if they declined those studies, so there were minimal barriers to recruitment.

We adjusted for antibiotic prescribing in the analysis, and most of the variables predicting antibiotic prescriptions did not predict complications. Nevertheless, we may not have accurately controlled for the impact of antibiotics, since compliance in routine settings can be poor, and although evidence of confounding by indication was minimal — estimates changed little when controlling for antibiotic prescribing — residual confounding by indication may have attenuated predictive values.

Similarly, the use of steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be relevant to outcomes, but steroids were not used in this dataset. Since most use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs comes from over-the-counter purchases rather than as prescribed drugs, the impact of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cannot be estimated.

The type of antibiotic might have modified the outcome, but the study had limited power to assess this since most of the prescriptions were for phenoxymethylpenicillin. We recruited fewer patients than we originally anticipated due to funding limitations, and thus type 2 error is possible.

### Cough due to TB and other chronic infections: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115pTAzg]. Chest (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, specifically concerning the indications for testing, ACCP 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining Xpert MTB/RIF testing, where available, instead of sputum microscopy in patients with cough and suspected pulmonary tuberculosis who are at high risk of drug-resistant tuberculosis. This includes individuals with a prior history of treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, contacts of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases, and/or residents of countries with a high prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis. It is also recommended to obtain sputum mycobacterial cultures, perform drug susceptibility testing, and conduct a chest X-ray (CXR) when feasible and where resources allow.

### Predictors of suppurative complications for acute sore throat in primary care: Prospective clinical cohort study [^112FDPw1]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

- **Methods: Overall study design**: The concept of the study was to develop a simple, one-page paper or web-based clinical proforma documenting clinical features to facilitate the generation of a large prospective cohort to predict adverse outcomes among patients recruited consecutively, where time for consent in busy winter clinics allowed. Within the observational study, we nested smaller studies to develop and trial a clinical scoring method for bacterial infection. All the studies used the same baseline clinical proforma and the same outcome measures. The nested studies concerned two consecutive diagnostic cohorts (n = 1107) where a clinical score to predict bacterial infection was developed and a randomised trial (n = 1781) that compared the use of the clinical score and the targeted use of a rapid antigen detection test with delayed antibiotic prescribing (see supplementary appendix 1 for details).

- **Practitioner inclusion criteria**: To potentially explore the impact of antibiotics, we recruited general practitioners who reported prescribing immediate antibiotics in 50% or less of patients with tonsillitis. General practitioners had the option of using either paper or web-based clinical proformas. Initial recruitment was among six local networks (Southampton, Bristol, Birmingham, Oxford, Cardiff, and Exeter) but was extended nationally during the last 18 months of recruitment.

- **Patient inclusion criteria**: We included previously well patients aged 16 or more with acute uncomplicated illnesses (≤ 14 days), who presented with sore throat as the main symptom.

### Establishing a methodology for ultrasound evaluation of pharyngeal residue in the pyriform sinus and epiglottic vallecula [^1156sZQR]. Respiratory Care (2020). Low credibility.

Assessing the presence of pharyngeal residue in the pyriform sinus and epiglottic vallecula is important because insufficient pharyngeal clearance is a risk factor for aspiration pneumonia. Improvements in the performance of ultrasound to visualize the pyriform sinus and epiglottic vallecula are needed. The aim of this study was to establish a method to visualize the pyriform sinus and epiglottic vallecula with ultrasound to detect pharyngeal residue.

- **Methods**: We used real-time virtual sonography (i.e. a fusion of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound imaging) as the scanning method to visualize the pyriform sinus and epiglottic vallecula without residue in 4 healthy individuals. Using established ultrasound methodology and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, 35 subjects with dysphagia were studied to investigate the performance of ultrasound to detect pharyngeal residue.

- **Results**: The fusion ultrasound images showed that transverse scans at the level of the laryngeal prominence and above the hyoid bone using a linear array transducer can be used to visualize the pyriform sinus and the epiglottic vallecula, respectively. We obtained 238 ultrasound images of the pyriform sinus from 35 subjects and 82 images of the epiglottic vallecula from 26 of 35 subjects. The ultrasound images with fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing showed that areas of high echogenicity in the pyriform sinus and epiglottic vallecula are related to the presence of pharyngeal residue. The presence of high-echogenicity areas resulted in a sensitivity of 92.0% and specificity.

### Predictors of suppurative complications for acute sore throat in primary care: Prospective clinical cohort study [^117VB79F]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Severe earache and tonsillar inflammation in acute sore throat predict the development of complications, but most cases of complications of acute sore throat occur in the absence of either variable, so history taking and examination in primary care are of limited predictive value. The scores used to assess the risk of bacterial infection are also not useful in predicting complications. The most important suppurative complications are uncommon in a resource-rich setting.

### Review: Diagnostic potential for collaborative pharyngitis biomarkers [^117BaL6H]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Bacteria and viruses are the most common etiologic agents of pharyngitis. Clinical history and observed physical signs and symptoms cannot accurately determine the infectious agent, even when employed by experienced healthcare providers (HCPs). Additional factors such as coinfections, asymptomatic colonization, and subclinical infection further impede the ability of the HCP to accurately diagnose and treat the patient.

Using a combinatorial approach, HCPs integrate clinical scoring systems with laboratory data, including rapid antigen, culture, biomarkers, and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), to facilitate the correct diagnosis. These biomarkers and NAATs have advanced the diagnostic process by rapidly identifying specific pathogens with high analytical specificity and sensitivity. In addition, multiplex NAATs are being developed to simultaneously detect both common and less frequently encountered pathogens.

However, rapid antigen, culture, and NAATs all share similar disadvantages, including the inability to distinguish between asymptomatic colonization, subclinical infection, and coinfections, and, when excluding culture, viable versus nonviable organisms. New paradigms are needed to facilitate rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment when necessary.

### Clinical score and rapid antigen detection test to guide antibiotic use for sore throats: randomised controlled trial of PRISM (primary care streptococcal management) [^114VSSTs]. BMJ (2013). High credibility.

At baseline, the recruiting health professional completed clinical details including temperature (measured using Tempadot thermometers) and the presence and severity of baseline symptoms such as sore throat, difficulty swallowing, fever during the illness, runny nose, cough, feeling unwell, diarrhoea, vomiting, headache, muscle ache, abdominal pain, sleep disturbance, and interference with normal activities. These were assessed using 4-point Likert scales (none, a slight problem, a moderately bad problem, a bad problem), along with the presence of physical signs such as pus, nodes, tender nodes, and raised temperature.

Clinicians were required to complete non-recruitment logs; however, due to time constraints in acute clinics, compliance was poor. Additionally, clinicians documented the most common reasons why patients were not approached and why they declined participation in an end-of-study questionnaire.

After the baseline assessment, patients were individually randomised via a web-based computer randomisation service into one of three groups. Randomisation utilised permuted block sizes of 3, 6, 9, and 12, chosen randomly. Initially, the protocol included stratification by the clinician's belief in the likelihood of bacterial infection, but this was omitted after discussions with the funder. All patients were advised to use regular analgesia, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, or both.

### Inappropriate testing of streptococcal pharyngitis in children aged below 3 years: Application of statistical process control [^116EnqZt]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Group A strep tests in patients aged below 3 years are not recommended unless the patient has appropriate symptoms and a positive contact or signs of complications. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to increase the percentage of appropriately ordered strep tests among providers. Data were collected retrospectively and prospectively from 1,163 patient visits. Providers were exposed to educational interventions, an electronic medical record order change, and provider feedback. Proportional control charts characterized the providers' behaviors and determined significant improvement among testing. The result was an increase in appropriate tests from 13.7% to 37.8%, and the control charts showed sustainable results over time. This project demonstrates the efficacy of these methods to encourage antibiotic stewardship among providers. Furthermore, the interventions used here can be applied to other areas with low-value diagnostic testing. Future studies should investigate whether parental anxiety and educational programs influence testing and evaluate the efficacy of certain strategies.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117TWuXQ]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: According to the BMJ Rapid Recommendations process, a guideline panel provided critical oversight to the review and identified populations, subgroups, and outcomes of interest. The panel included clinicians, methodologists, and patients with experience of sore throat. Patients received personal training and support to optimize contributions throughout the guideline development process. The patients on the panel led the interpretation of the results based on what they expected the typical patient values and preferences to be, as well as the variation between patients. Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel and contributed to the selection and prioritization of outcomes, values and preferences assessments, and critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

- **Search strategy**: We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant published randomised controlled trials based on the strategy reported in the most recent Cochrane systematic review, modified under the guidance of a research librarian (appendix 1). We limited the search from 1 January 2010, which included a two-month overlap with the previous Cochrane review search, to 1 May 2017. There were no language restrictions. We reviewed reference lists from eligible new trials and related reviews for additional eligible trials.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis: 2012 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114Md5zD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). High credibility.

With respect to preventative measures for rheumatic fever, particularly in primary prevention, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend swabbing the throat and testing for GAS pharyngitis using a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) and/or culture. This approach is advised because clinical features alone do not reliably distinguish between GAS and viral pharyngitis, except when overt viral features, such as rhinorrhea, cough, oral ulcers, and/or hoarseness, are present. In children and adolescents, negative RADT tests should be confirmed by a throat culture.

### Approaching otolaryngology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic [^115EyiTB]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Otolaryngologists are, by the nature of their work, at high risk for exposure to respiratory pathogens. During routine evaluation and management of patients, otolaryngologists and their staff will inevitably come into direct contact with upper respiratory tract secretions or blood, which may become aerosolized during an inadvertent sneeze or cough. Such events can occur during nasal and upper airway endoscopy, while performing a nasal culture or nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, or simply during routine examination of the oral cavity and oropharynx, exposing the healthcare provider to potentially infectious agents.

Clinical data indicate that approximately half of the patients with COVID-19 do not have a fever during the early stages of the disease, with some patients presenting to the otolaryngologist with fairly innocuous symptoms such as nasal congestion, sore throat, and hyposmia. Other patients may present with or be followed for upper aerodigestive tract malignancies. These patients frequently complain of cough and sore throat, and coexisting COVID-19 infection may not be considered at presentation. This puts providers and other patients at high risk of infection due to insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) use unless a high level of clinical suspicion is maintained.

In the inpatient setting, critically ill patients with respiratory failure commonly require endotracheal intubation and/or a tracheotomy for respiratory support. In a previous study, 6.30% (15/238) of patients required tracheotomy during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks.

### Review: Diagnostic potential for collaborative pharyngitis biomarkers [^1146cEty]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Studies investigating acute respiratory infections (ARIs) may have implications for pharyngitis diagnoses. In a recent systematic review of 13 studies conducted in Europe, Russia, and Asia, Smedemark et al. investigated the use of CRP point-of-care tests (POCTs) for ARIs in the primary care setting. Twelve trials (10,218 total participants, 2,335 of whom were children) evaluated a CRP POCT, and 1 trial (317 adults) evaluated a PCT POCT. In their meta-analysis, the authors conclude that CRP POCT rapid results (2–3 minutes) likely reduced the number of individuals given an antibiotic prescription at the initial consultation. CRP POCT was unlikely to affect patient safety in regard to clinical recovery within a 7- or 28-day follow-up or to increase hospital admissions. Mortality within 28 days was also unlikely to occur. The authors cautioned that clinicians should be aware of different algorithms and cutoff points when using CRP tests. A CRP level < 20 mg/L has been suggested as a cutoff for antibiotic use but is not validated in the literature for children and older adults with comorbidities.

At the time of writing, only 1 study has investigated the role of rapid (20 minutes) PCT POCT in individuals with ARI in the primary care setting. Compared with usual care, PCT POCT led to a 26% reduction in the probability of 28-day antibiotic prescription without affecting patient safety. Therefore, in the previously mentioned meta-analysis, the authors felt they could not comment on PCT POCT's impact on antibiotic use or other primary and secondary patient outcomes due to a paucity of data.
