## Question

What is the best pharmacological management of a autistic child with violent tendencies

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best pharmacological management of an autistic child with violent tendencies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical target and whether "violence" maps to irritability or aggression in ASD. Then, I should verify the hierarchy of evidence and identify first-line pharmacologic options. Next, I will review dosing, monitoring, and safety, and consider second-line or adjunctive strategies. After that, I need to integrate behavioral interventions and functional assessment. Finally, I will tailor recommendations to developmental level, comorbidities, and acute versus chronic contexts, and close with a practical, stepwise algorithm and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the clinical target. "Violent tendencies" in ASD typically reflect irritability with aggression, tantrums, and/or self-injury, which are the FDA-labeled indications for risperidone and aripiprazole; I should ensure I'm not conflating this with core ASD symptoms, which are not medication-responsive, and I should remember that aggression is a behavior with a function, not a diagnosis, so I need to keep searching for precipitants and communicative drivers [^4fcaf618] [^88c5f02c] [^bd0b14b1].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check meta-analyses and guidelines. The strongest evidence supports risperidone and aripiprazole for irritability in youth with ASD, with large effect sizes around 1.1 SD versus placebo, whereas other classes like SSRIs, mood stabilizers, and stimulants have weaker or inconsistent effects for aggression per se, though they may help comorbid symptoms that can indirectly reduce aggression [^81dffdd9] [^d60187ad] [^e5e48b7e].

> I will now examine first-line pharmacotherapy. Risperidone and aripiprazole are the only FDA-approved agents for irritability in ASD; risperidone has more trials and longer-term discontinuation data, while aripiprazole may have a somewhat more favorable metabolic profile in some studies, though both can cause weight gain and metabolic changes; I should double-check that the benefit is maintained over time and that discontinuation increases relapse risk, which it does in randomized withdrawal studies [^4fcaf618] [^05ce30f8] [^ad934df4].

> Wait, let me verify dosing and titration principles. For risperidone, typical pediatric dosing starts low, around 0.25–0.5 mg/day, and is titrated by 0.5 mg increments every 1–2 weeks toward 1–2 mg/day, with some children requiring up to 3 mg/day; for aripiprazole, starting around 2–5 mg/day and titrating toward 5–10 mg/day is reasonable, again going slowly and reassessing frequently; I need to ensure we use the lowest effective dose and plan for periodic attempts to taper if stable [^bd0b14b1] [^a27ac187].

> I need to ensure a robust monitoring plan. Baseline and periodic weight, height, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose or HbA1c, and a lipid panel are essential; I should also monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, sedation, and prolactin-related effects, especially with risperidone; if weight gain emerges, metformin can be considered as an adjunct, and I should document objective behavioral change using the ABC-Irritability subscale and caregiver ratings to avoid relying on impressionistic change [^81dffdd9] [^4fcaf618] [^a27ac187].

> Hold on, I should verify second-line and adjunctive options when antipsychotics are contraindicated or not tolerated. Alpha-2 agonists such as guanfacine or clonidine can modestly reduce irritability and hyperarousal and are often better tolerated, though effects are smaller; stimulants or atomoxetine may help if ADHD symptoms are driving aggression, but I need to watch for increased irritability in some children; mood stabilizers like valproate have limited and inconsistent evidence for irritability in ASD and should be reserved for select cases with careful monitoring [^a27ac187] [^e8666f43] [^fcd7869b].

> But wait, what if the aggression is acute and severe, posing imminent safety risk? In emergencies, short-term benzodiazepines can be used cautiously for rapid calming, recognizing disinhibition risk and the need for close observation; antipsychotic monotherapy or combination with a benzodiazepine may be necessary in the ED, with a plan to de-escalate and transition to behavioral strategies as soon as feasible; I should confirm that physical restraints are minimized and used only when absolutely necessary with continuous monitoring [^0ee8a057] [^c89b6732].

> Next, I should review the foundational role of behavioral interventions. Functional behavioral assessment to identify antecedents, functions, and environmental contributors is essential; parent-mediated behavioral training, school-based supports, and communication enhancement reduce aggression more durably than medication alone; I need to ensure medication is framed as an adjunct to enable participation in these therapies, not a replacement, and that we reassess the need for ongoing pharmacotherapy as behavioral skills improve [^88c5f02c] [^4fcaf618] [^a27ac187].

> Let me consider developmental level and comorbidities. In children with ASD and intellectual disability, aggression is more common and pharmacotherapy may be necessary earlier, but I should confirm that we start low and go slow due to greater sensitivity to side effects; for co-occurring ADHD, stimulants or atomoxetine may reduce impulsive aggression; for anxiety or sensory overload, environmental modifications and, in select cases, SSRIs may help, though SSRIs do not treat aggression per se; I should also screen for pain, GI discomfort, sleep problems, and seizures, which can masquerade as aggression [^b7b0fe41] [^e8666f43] [^0d972a4d].

> I should double-check the long-term plan. Many children require months of treatment, and relapse is common after discontinuation; therefore, I need to plan periodic attempts to taper after 6–12 months of stability, continue behavioral supports, and monitor closely for recurrence; if multiple antipsychotic trials fail or adverse effects are prohibitive, I should reconsider the diagnosis, adherence, and environmental factors before escalating to polypharmacy or off-label combinations [^ad934df4] [^4fcaf618] [^c89b6732].

> Putting this together, my practical, stepwise approach is as follows: first, complete a functional behavioral assessment and address medical and environmental contributors; second, if aggression remains moderate to severe or unsafe, initiate risperidone or aripiprazole with informed consent and a monitoring plan; third, titrate every 1–2 weeks to effect while tracking ABC-I and adverse effects; fourth, integrate behavioral parent training and school supports; fifth, after 6–12 months of stability, attempt a gradual taper while maintaining behavioral strategies; sixth, if antipsychotics are not tolerated or contraindicated, consider guanfacine or address comorbid ADHD with stimulants or atomoxetine, reassessing aggression as a secondary outcome [^88c5f02c] [^4fcaf618] [^a27ac187].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit: risperidone and aripiprazole are the evidence-based first-line pharmacologic treatments for aggression/irritability in ASD, with large, clinically meaningful effects but meaningful metabolic and neurologic risks; behavioral interventions are essential and should precede and accompany medication; dosing should be conservative with vigilant monitoring; and long-term plans should include attempts to minimize or discontinue antipsychotics once behavioral control is durable [^81dffdd9] [^d60187ad] [^4fcaf618].

The best pharmacological management for an autistic child with violent tendencies is to **start with risperidone or aripiprazole** [^4fcaf618] after behavioral strategies have failed, as these are the only FDA-approved medications for irritability and aggression in autism [^4d03557e]. Use the lowest effective dose, titrate slowly, and monitor closely for side effects, especially weight gain and metabolic changes [^81dffdd9]. If these are ineffective or poorly tolerated, consider second-line options such as alpha-2 agonists (guanfacine, clonidine) [^a27ac187] or mood stabilizers (valproate) [^fcd7869b], but evidence is limited and they should be used cautiously. Always combine medication with behavioral interventions and regular monitoring of weight, BMI, glucose, and lipids [^81dffdd9].

---

## First-line pharmacological treatments

### Risperidone and aripiprazole

- **FDA approval**: Risperidone and aripiprazole are the only medications approved for irritability and aggression in autism [^4fcaf618] [^4d03557e].
- **Efficacy**: Both significantly reduce irritability, aggression, and self-injury in randomized controlled trials [^e5e48b7e] [^78139f5d].
- **Dosing**: Start low and titrate slowly to minimize side effects [^c5555e9a].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor weight, BMI, glucose, and lipids due to metabolic risks [^81dffdd9].

---

## Second-line pharmacological treatments

If risperidone or aripiprazole are ineffective or poorly tolerated, consider the following:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Evidence level** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Alpha-2 agonists | Guanfacine, clonidine | Moderate | Useful for hyperactivity and irritability; fewer metabolic effects than antipsychotics [^a27ac187] |
| Mood stabilizers | Valproate | Low | Limited evidence; consider if aggression is severe or refractory [^fcd7869b] |
| Antidepressants | SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine) | Low | Not for aggression; consider only if comorbid anxiety or depression is present [^0d972a4d] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Behavioral interventions first**: Use functional behavioral assessment and parent training before medication [^88c5f02c] [^4fcaf618].
- **Combine treatments**: Medication is most effective when combined with behavioral strategies [^4fcaf618] [^81dffdd9].
- **Regular monitoring**: Track weight, BMI, glucose, and lipids during treatment [^81dffdd9].
- **Discontinue if ineffective**: Stop medication if no benefit is observed after a reasonable trial [^38fdec85].

---

## Safety considerations and side effects

- **Metabolic effects**: Weight gain, dyslipidemia, and diabetes risk with antipsychotics [^81dffdd9].
- **Extrapyramidal symptoms**: Monitor for movement disorders, especially with risperidone [^notfound].
- **Sedation**: Common with antipsychotics; dose adjustments may be needed [^d60187ad].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Risperidone and aripiprazole are the **first-line pharmacological treatments** for aggression in autism, with careful dosing and monitoring [^4fcaf618]. Use the lowest effective dose, titrate slowly, and combine with behavioral interventions. Consider second-line options only if first-line treatments fail or are not tolerated, and always monitor for side effects [^a27ac187].

The optimal clinical management of aggression in children and adolescents involves both behavioral and pharmacologic intervention strategies. This article reviews medication treatments for youngsters with autistic disorder and conduct disorder, conditions for which the pharmacologic management of aggression is often necessary. Efficacy results and associated adverse effects from selected clinical trials of most classes of psychotropic medications are discussed. While preliminary progress has been made in the development of medication treatments for these serious disorders of youth, additional controlled research and longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the efficacy and tolerability of currently available compounds within each diagnostic group.

Background

Pharmacological interventions are frequently used for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to manage behaviours of concern, including irritability, aggression, and self-injury. Some pharmacological interventions might help treat some behaviours of concern, but can also have adverse effects (AEs).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and AEs of pharmacological interventions for managing the behaviours of irritability, aggression, and self-injury in ASD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 11 other databases and two trials registers up to June 2022. We also searched reference lists of relevant studies, and contacted study authors, experts and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of participants of any age with a clinical diagnosis of ASD, that compared any pharmacological intervention to an alternative drug, standard care, placebo, or wait-list control.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were behaviours of concern in ASD, (irritability, aggression and self-injury); and AEs. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, and tolerability and acceptability. Two review authors independently assessed each study for risk of bias, and used GRADE to judge the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 131 studies involving 7014 participants in this review. We identified 26 studies as awaiting classification and 25 as ongoing. Most studies involved children (53 studies involved only children under 13 years), children and adolescents (37 studies), adolescents only (2 studies) children and adults (16 studies), or adults only (23 studies). All included studies compared a pharmacological intervention to a placebo or to another pharmacological intervention. Atypical antipsychotics versus placebo At short-term follow-up (up to 6 months), atypical antipsychotics probably reduce irritability compared to placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.25 to -0.55, 12 studies, 973 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), which may indicate a large effect. However, there was no clear evidence of a difference in aggression between groups (SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.89 to 0.01; 1 study, 77 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Atypical antipsychotics may also reduce self-injury (SMD -1.43, 95% CI -2.24 to -0.61; 1 study, 30 participants; low-certainty evidence), possibly indicating a large effect. There may be higher rates of neurological AEs (dizziness, fatigue, sedation, somnolence, and tremor) in the intervention group (low-certainty evidence), but there was no clear evidence of an effect on other neurological AEs. Increased appetite may be higher in the intervention group (low-certainty evidence), but we found no clear evidence of an effect on other metabolic AEs. There was no clear evidence of differences between groups in musculoskeletal or psychological AEs. Neurohormones versus placebo At short-term follow-up, neurohormones may have minimal to no clear effect on irritability when compared to placebo (SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.00; 8 studies; 466 participants; very low-certainty evidence), although the evidence is very uncertain. No data were reported for aggression or self -injury. Neurohormones may reduce the risk of headaches slightly in the intervention group, although the evidence is very uncertain. There was no clear evidence of an effect of neurohormones on any other neurological AEs, nor on any psychological, metabolic, or musculoskeletal AEs (low- and very low-certainty evidence). Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-related medications versus placebo At short-term follow-up, ADHD-related medications may reduce irritability slightly (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.01; 10 studies, 400 participants; low-certainty evidence), which may indicate a small effect. However, there was no clear evidence that ADHD-related medications have an effect on self-injury (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -1.63 to 0.39; 1 study, 16 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for aggression. Rates of neurological AEs (drowsiness, emotional AEs, fatigue, headache, insomnia, and irritability), metabolic AEs (decreased appetite) and psychological AEs (depression) may be higher in the intervention group, although the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups for any other metabolic, neurological, or psychological AEs (very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for musculoskeletal AEs. Antidepressants versus placebo At short-term follow-up, there was no clear evidence that antidepressants have an effect on irritability (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.18; 3 studies, 267 participants; low-certainty evidence). No data for aggression or self-injury were reported or could be included in the analysis. Rates of metabolic AEs (decreased energy) may be higher in participants receiving antidepressants (very low-certainty evidence), although no other metabolic AEs showed clear evidence of a difference. Rates of neurological AEs (decreased attention) and psychological AEs (impulsive behaviour and stereotypy) may also be higher in the intervention group (very low-certainty evidence) although the evidence is very uncertain. There was no clear evidence of any difference in the other metabolic, neurological, or psychological AEs (very low-certainty evidence), nor between groups in musculoskeletal AEs (very low-certainty evidence). Risk of bias We rated most of the studies across the four comparisons at unclear overall risk of bias due to having multiple domains rated as unclear, very few rated as low across all domains, and most having at least one domain rated as high risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotics probably reduce irritability, ADHD-related medications may reduce irritability slightly, and neurohormones may have little to no effect on irritability in the short term in people with ASD. There was some evidence that atypical antipsychotics may reduce self-injury in the short term, although the evidence is uncertain. There was no clear evidence that antidepressants had an effect on irritability. There was also little to no difference in aggression between atypical antipsychotics and placebo, or self-injury between ADHD-related medications and placebo. However, there was some evidence that atypical antipsychotics may result in a large reduction in self-injury, although the evidence is uncertain. No data were reported (or could be used) for self-injury or aggression for neurohormones versus placebo. Studies reported a wide range of potential AEs. Atypical antipsychotics and ADHD-related medications in particular were associated with an increased risk of metabolic and neurological AEs, although the evidence is uncertain for atypical antipsychotics and very uncertain for ADHD-related medications. The other drug classes had minimal or no associated AEs.

At present, no evidence-based effective pharmacologic options are available for treating the core deficits of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), which are best addressed by behavioral and educational interventions. However, such evidence exists for several of the frequently associated/comorbid symptoms such as aggression and severe irritability, hyperactivity, and repetitive behaviors, which can become a major source of additional distress and interference in functioning. This article offers information on the psychopharmacology of ASD that is current, relevant, and organized in a user-friendly manner, to form a concise but informative reference guide for primary pediatric clinicians.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^88c5f02c]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — disruptive behaviors and management states that disruptive behaviors, such as aggression, self-injury, and tantrums, may complicate home and community management, and behavioral outbursts may occur in response to stressful events in the environment, in reaction to a medical condition, as functional communication, or as a symptom supporting diagnosis of a cooccurring mental health disorder. Functional behavioral analysis and implementation of behavioral strategies can be an important initial step in management, new onset of severe behaviors requires consideration of potential medical reasons, and pharmacologic treatment should be considered if no medical etiology is identified and if the behavior is associated with irritability, is not responsive to available behavioral interventions, or is related to a cooccurring diagnosable behavioral health disorder.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^4fcaf618]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) pharmacotherapy — Pharmacotherapy may be offered to children with ASD when there is a specific target symptom or comorbid condition [CG]. Pharmacologic interventions may increase the ability of persons with ASD to profit from educational and other interventions and to remain in less restrictive environments through the management of severe and challenging behaviors. Frequent targets for pharmacologic intervention include associated comorbid conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression) and other features, such as aggression, self-injurious behavior, hyperactivity, inattention, compulsive-like behaviors, repetitive or stereotypic behaviors, and sleep disturbances. Risperidone and aripiprazole have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of irritability, consisting primarily of physical aggression and severe tantrum behavior, associated with autism. There is a growing body of controlled evidence for pharmacologic intervention, and a summary of randomized controlled trials of medication in children with ASD is included. Combining medication with parent training is moderately more efficacious than medication alone for decreasing serious behavioral disturbance and modestly more efficacious for adaptive functioning. Individuals with ASD may be nonverbal, so treatment response is often judged by caregiver report and observation of specific behaviors, and several objective rating scales also are available to help monitor treatment response.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^ef96e47e]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder — aggression and self-injury: Aggressive behavior in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been reported in between 8% and 68%, and aggressive behaviors were reported on the Child Behavior Checklist for one-quarter of children attending an ASD clinic with similar rates from 2 to 16 years of age. Self-injurious behaviors are reported in 40% to 50% of individuals with ASD at some point across the lifespan and may occur more frequently in people with ASD who also have aggressive behaviors and sleep problems. Management of co-occurring sleep problems and hyperactivity may be helpful in a treatment plan that includes behavioral intervention to address aggression and targeted pharmacotherapy. In the case of aggressive, self-injurious, and disruptive behaviors, the primary care provider needs to assess the safety of the child and family in an ongoing fashion, and referral to community services and/or behavioral intervention should take place if behaviors are unsafe or if the patient is not responding to the treatment plan.

### The management of children and youth with pediatric mental and behavioral health emergencies [^0ee8a057]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Management of the acutely agitated or aggressive ED patient — Behavioral de-escalation techniques (including verbal de-escalation and environmental modification) are the first line of management. When verbal de-escalation techniques are not sufficiently effective, condition- and symptom-directed medications may be used with appropriate weight-based dosing, with considerations for special populations, such as children and adolescents with autism. If pharmacologic management fails to adequately protect the patient and staff, physical restraints or seclusion rooms (if available) may be necessary. For physical restraint, best practices include minimizing time in physical restraints, continuous monitoring, and ongoing de-escalation attempts using behavioral and pharmacologic measures.

### Pharmacological management of behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders [^2e5c7768]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neuropsychiatric condition that, based on recent CDC estimates affects an estimated 1 in 59 American children. Behavioral treatments remain the mainstay of treatment for the core symptoms of ASD including communication deficits, social interaction deficits and repetitive behavior. However, youth with ASD may also have severe behavioral challenges including irritability, aggression, and hyperactivity. Currently there are only two medications (risperidone and aripiprazole) approved by the FDA for the treatment of irritability associated with ASD in children. Psychiatric comorbidities are common in youth with ASD, affecting up to 70% of affected children and adolescents. Given the burden of co-occurring disorders, medications are often employed to target symptoms such as irritability, anxiety, and hyperactivity. Other common co-occurring conditions including gastrointestinal disorders and sleep disorders may be improved with pharmacologic management. Evidence for the efficacy of many commonly used psychotropic medications in ASD is limited by the lack of large placebo-controlled trials in youth with ASD. This paper reviews the current literature regarding use of medications to address co-occurring conditions in children and adolescents with ASD as well as areas of emerging research.

What are my pharmacological choices for the management of aggression in a child with ASD when standard options seem to have failed?

For some children, behavioural interventions combined with 'first line' medications such as those suggested above fail to alleviate symptoms. There may be several reasons for this, and it is crucial at the outset that these are explored. The diagnostic formulation may have missed an important aetiological factor, or previously identified triggers or perpetuating factors may have been inadequately managed. For example, an environment with certain characteristics, such as routine, predictability and appropriate level of stimulation, may not be made available. Or there may be an absence of adequately trained support staff and staff may fail to follow behavioural recommendations. In these circumstances it is crucial that medication does not become the perceived 'solution'. It is unethical for the psychiatrist to be expected to medicate where services are unable to meet needs.

On the other hand, there will be situations where challenging behaviour continues despite attention to all identified aetiological factors. Such situations are most likely to arise in the context of non-verbal autistic children who are severely or profoundly cognitively impaired. While it remains important to continue to work towards a great understanding of the behaviour's underpinning, this is often very challenging and medication may thus be considered as a least restrictive, best interest option in consultation with decision makers. Additionally, the psychiatrist should discuss treatment-resistant cases with their peer group, and consider seeking a second option.

Other medications than those already discussed above have much less evidence for efficacy. Other (so-called) antipsychotics such as quetiapine – receptor antagonist (D2 and 5-HT2) or olanzapine – D2 and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist – are certainly reasonable options, although they have not been studied robustly in this population. Consequently, these medications must be used with caution, including low initial dose, slow titration and regular monitoring. Alternatively, benzodiazepines such as lorazepam, diazepam or clonazepam may be considered, but the same caution is advised. The combination of an antipsychotic with a benzodiazepine may also be considered, but the aim must always be to achieve symptomatic relief without sedation, such that the child can continue to engage in activities. If a benzodiazepine is prescribed, it must always be only used in the short term.

### Psychopharmacology management in autism spectrum disorder [^9096f330]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have other psychiatric conditions that warrant treatment. Symptoms may not be easy to discern from rigidity or irritability that are sometimes considered to be constituent parts of ASD. Pathophysiology that involves hyperexcitable neurons and anomalous connectivity may provide justification for using psychopharmacologic agents, although nonmedical strategies may also be effective. Hyperactivity, irritability, and tantrums with or without aggression may be rational targets for psychopharmacological intervention. The best-studied drug class to date has been the second-generation antipsychotics targeting irritability.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^0d972a4d]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — depression and mood disorder assessment and treatment emphasizes that assessment of depression and other mood disorders must include family history, history of environmental stressors, the potential for toxic ingestions, and evaluation for comorbid conditions, and that interventions for depression include supportive therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and medication, if indicated, as coordinated interventions. Antidepressant use in people with ASD has not been demonstrated to address aggression and has inconsistent effect on anxiety, and medication recommendations are based on data from the general pediatric population and expert consensus.

### Psychopharmacology of autism spectrum disorder: evidence and practice [^4e42599f]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Children with autism spectrum disorder present with a high rate of maladaptive behaviors and comorbid psychopathology. Psychopharmacologic treatment is frequently used in this population and is particularly associated with comorbid mental illness and increasing age. Successful treatment of presenting problems, however, is most likely achieved through consideration of multiple potential etiologic factors, only some of which may respond to pharmacologic intervention. The evidence base for targeting specific symptoms and disorders with psychopharmacology in children with autism spectrum disorder is expanding rapidly and offers guidance for practicing clinicians. The current evidence for symptom-specific treatment is presented.

### Psychopharmacologic management of serious behavioral disturbance in ASD [^ea54019a]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often exhibit serious behavioral disturbance (irritability) including severe tantrums, aggression, and self-injury that requires pharmacologic management. Research focused on the treatment of severe irritability has primarily involved the atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone and aripiprazole. Anticonvulsants have also been investigated for targeting serious behavioral disturbance; however findings have been mixed. Advances in the pharmacotherapy of irritability in ASD continue to inform practice. Research is needed to develop safer and more effective drug treatments for serious behavioral disturbance in this population.

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^bd0b14b1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

What are my options in the management of aggression in a child with ASD?

Aggression is one of the most frequent reasons for referral to specialist services for a child with ASD, particularly among those children with ASD who have co-morbid intellectual disability. From the outset, a multidisciplinary approach is crucial in any such assessment to identify the relevant underlying factors so these can be managed. Aggression is not a diagnosis; instead, it is a mechanism for the communication of need, discomfort or distress. The clinical team must identify the relevant biological, psychological and social predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors so that these can be managed accordingly. In rare instances, major life events, or factors such as constipation or pain, are key, but more commonly multiple factors are relevant. Aggression may also be a symptom of an underlying psychiatric diagnosis such as depression or psychosis, which should be managed accordingly. Despite the recommendations made below, it is important to bear in mind that psychotropic medication can itself result in agitation, anxiety and mood disturbance, and so careful attention needs to be paid to the possibility that symptoms may be getting worse as a result of medication.

In the management of aggression, medication may be deemed an appropriate option in a number of different situations. For example, in the acute situation where it would be difficult or potentially unsafe to introduce behavioural therapy, medication can offer the possibility of reducing the severity of symptoms and thereby improving engagement in psychological interventions. Either risperidone (1–2 mg) or aripiprazole – a D2 and 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist (5–10 mg) can be used for this purpose, both having shown efficacy and safety among autistic individuals at lower doses compared to when they are used as antipsychotics (of note, at these lower doses, serotonergic antagonism, rather than dopamine antagonism, predominates). Both have FDA approval for agitation in ASD. If used for this purpose, it is important that it is discontinued once behavioural work is underway. Less is known about the acute (and maintenance) use of other (so-called) antipsychotics. Similarly, benzodiazepines – positive allosteric modulators of the GABA-A receptor-are sometimes used but there are no data.

### Pharmacologic treatment of severe irritability and problem behaviors in autism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e5e48b7e]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is increasingly recognized as a public health issue. Irritability and aggression (IA) often negatively affect the lives of people with ASD and their families. Although many medications have been tested for IA in ASDs in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), critical quantitative analyses of these trials are lacking in the literature.

Objectives

To systematically review and quantitatively analyze the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic treatments for IA in youth with ASD.

Data Sources

Studies were identified from Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, and review articles.

Methods

Original articles on placebo-controlled RCTs of pharmacologic treatments of IA in youth age 2 to 17 years with ASD were included. Data items included study design, study goals, details of study participants, details of intervention, study results, statistical methods, side effects, and risks of bias. The primary study outcome measure was the effect size of reduction in the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) scores in the medication group, as compared with placebo, in RCTs using parallel groups design.

Results

Forty-six RCTs were identified. Compared with placebo, 3 compounds resulted in significant improvement in ABC-I at the end of treatment. Risperidone and aripiprazole were found to be the most effective, with the largest effect sizes. Sedation, extrapyramidal sides effects, and weight gain were assessed quantitatively.

Conclusions

Although risperidone and aripiprazole have the strongest evidence in reducing ABC-I in youth with ASD, a few other compounds also showed significant efficacy with fewer potential side effects and adverse reactions in single studies.

### Pharmacologic treatment of behavioral symptoms in autism and pervasive developmental disorders [^53eb019a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Autism and other pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) are associated with various dysfunctional and problematic behaviors, in addition to the core features of language and social skills dysfunction that define these conditions. Although there is currently no pharmacologic cure for the core features of PDDs, some of the behavioral symptoms may be treated pharmacologically. In addition to relieving some of the daily stress in the lives of patients and their families, improvement of these behavioral symptoms, which include hyperactivity, aggression, tantrums, and self-injury, removes some of the hindrances to other rehabilitative efforts. This article discusses the efficacy and tolerability of various medications and alternative interventions in addressing the symptoms of autism and other PDDs.

Abstract

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social communication in conjunction with patterned behaviors. Often associated with emotional dysregulation, irritability, aggression, depression, and suicidality, ASD youth frequently present to the emergency department for behavioral and mental health evaluation. Psychiatric comorbidities, agitation, and depression are commonly encountered. During these visits, practitioners must thoughtfully consider organic etiologies for presenting symptoms, formulate plans to address risk of agitation, and understand how to effectively formulate disposition options in this patient population.

SSRIs do not have a role to play in the management of aggression, and their use should be limited to the management of mood disorders, anxiety and, in some circumstances, repetitive and ritualistic behaviours as discussed above. Clozapine-D2, 5-HT2 and NE alpha-2 receptor antagonist are sometimes used to manage aggressive behaviour in autistic people, but this is based on limited evidence in adults. There are no data available for its use for this purpose in the paediatric population. There is no evidence for other agents, such as mood stabilisers or GABAergic agents (pregabalin).

### Targeted treatments for symptom domains in child and adolescent autism [^6748d562]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

The number of people with autism spectrum disorders has dramatically increased over the past decade, and problem behaviours in autism are an increasing challenge to families, schools, physicians, and other health-care professionals. Pharmacological treatments can effectively target problem behaviours associated with autism.

Starting Point

Recently, L Namerow and colleagues (J Dev Behav Pediatr 2003; 24: 104–08) presented preliminary data in children and adolescents with autism treated with citalopram, which suggested that selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are useful in the reduction of symptom domains such as repetitive behaviours and mood disorders. J McCracken and colleagues (N Engl J Med 2000; 347: 314–21) showed that the atypical antipsychotic risperidone reduced serious behavioural problems, such as tantrums, aggression, or self-injury in children with autism and in children with below-average intelligence quotients. These and other studies show how developments in study design, selection of patients, and outcome measures have allowed treatment trials in autism to progress beyond anecdotal reports and case observations, and show reduction in the severity of specific symptom domains within these disorders. WHERE NEXT? In therapeutic intervention the risk of treatment toxicity must be balanced against the benefits of improved symptom severity. The newer methods enable informed decisions about which patients will benefit from which treatments. Other symptom domains within autism and effects on development need to be evaluated in adequately designed clinical trials. Future strategies include extending treatment to children as young as the preschool years.

### Navigating agitation in neurodevelopmental disorders: a comparative study of pharmacotherapies via network meta-analysis in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disabilities [^84b5f6e4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance:

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability often experience persistent challenges related to aggressive behaviour and agitation, highlighting the critical need for evidence-based pharmacological interventions among other strategies. Despite previous network meta-analyses (NMAs), the rapidly evolving landscape of treatment options necessitates ongoing and updated assessments.

Objective:

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of various pharmacotherapies in managing agitation in children and adults with ASD or intellectual disabilities (ID).

Methods:

Employing a systematic review and network meta-analysis methodology, we conducted an exhaustive search across multiple databases for double-blind, randomized controlled trials focusing on pharmacotherapies targeting agitation in these neurodevelopmental disorders. Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines, our assessment of study quality utilized the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool to ensure methodological rigour and accuracy in data synthesis. Primary outcomes encompassed measures of reduced agitation, as indicated by treatment response on standardized agitation scales, alongside dropout rates, providing a comprehensive overview of treatment efficacy and tolerability.

Results:

Our analysis included data from 38 eligible trials, involving 2503 participants across both pediatric and adult populations. Key pharmacological interventions, such as arbaclofen, risperidone plus buspirone, omega-3 fatty acids, risperidone plus palmitoylethanolamide, aripiprazole and risperidone, demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing agitation compared to placebo. Importantly, these treatments were generally well-tolerated, with no significant increase in all-cause dropouts compared to placebo, highlighting their suitability for clinical use in managing agitation in individuals with ASD or ID.

Conclusions:

This study underscores the efficacy and tolerability of several pharmacotherapies in managing agitation among children and adults with ASD or ID. Our findings provide robust evidence that specific treatments, such as arbaclofen, risperidone plus buspirone and omega-3 fatty acids, are both effective and well-tolerated, offering valuable therapeutic options for clinicians. The study emphasizes the need for ongoing research to ensure that treatment strategies remain aligned with the evolving clinical landscape, ultimately improving patient outcomes in this challenging population.

### Identification and support of autistic individuals within the UK criminal justice system: a practical approach based upon professional consensus with input from lived experience [^236cfadf]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological support

A comprehensive review of pharmacological options for autistic individuals is beyond the scope of this paper. However, we have identified some important considerations related to this topic.

It is important to state that there is no medication to support the core features of autism and pharmacology is not recommended for this purpose. Some behaviour that may be perceived as aggressive towards the self and/or others can be understood as the involuntary physical and emotional reaction to stressors that overload the nervous system. As such, situational and/or environmental changes ought to be the first response, prior to medication. However, in extreme cases pharmacology can be considered to manage aggressive and/or self-harming behaviour when other non-medical adaptations have not worked.

The primary role of medication for use with autistic individuals is to support them with associated difficulties and/or co-occurring conditions. For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be used for anxiety, low mood and repetitive behaviours, psychostimulant medication for associated hyperactivity, and atypical antipsychotics to manage irritability, aggression, self-injurious behaviour and 'meltdowns'. However, it should be noted that many drug trials specifically exclude autistic individuals or do not clearly identify them. Therefore, there is limited understanding as to the effectiveness of medication for autistic individuals.

### Predictors of placebo response in pharmacological and dietary supplement treatment trials in pediatric autism spectrum disorder: a meta-analysis [^4707b5e7]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 26 studies were assessed as eligible for quantitative analysis after 447 studies were identified in the initial search (Figure 1). One studyreported on secondary outcome measures not included in the initial study, resulting in 25 unique data sets. The data set comprised 1315 participants (N active treatment = 661, N placebo = 654). Male participants comprised 80% of the sample size, and age ranged from 3 to 18 years, with the exception of one studywhere the upper end of the age range was 20 years. Table 1 presents study characteristics from the placebo-controlled trials. Nine studies reported the target of the active intervention as behavior, whereas seven studies reported the target of intervention as irritability. The remaining studies reported the target of intervention as hyperactivity, repetitive behavior, disruptive symptoms, autism severity, aggressionand the core symptoms of autism. There were 107 data points measuring effect size, representing an estimate of the magnitude of the difference in outcome measure between baseline and end point, for active intervention and placebo treatment groups.

Using the Jadad scale, study quality scores varied between 8 and 13 with an average score of 11.6 (s.d. = 1.8). In all, 11 out of 25 studies scored a maximum of 13 points. Assessment of quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool found 18 out of 25 studies were judged to be 'low risk' overall. Supplementary Table S1 presents the risk assessment for each study across every domain. The proportion of studies within each risk level is shown in Supplementary Figure S1.

### An update on psychopharmacological treatment of autism spectrum disorder [^c5555e9a]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

General Principles in Using Pharmacological Treatment in ASD

Frequently, identification and management of psychiatric issues can be complex, especially for those with limited language repertoire, low cognitive function, and those experiencing uncertain symptoms. Diagnostic overshadowing is common (failure to identify other conditions in the presence of a certain diagnosis). A high level of clinical suspicion for co-occurring mental health conditions is required for children and adolescents with communication challenges. Managing clinicians should obtain information from the child, when possible, family and other providers including teachers and therapists. Environmental changes and lack of skills can be the source of undesired behaviors and should be considered in the plan of care.

Pharmacological interventions are sometimes indicated and may facilitate their participation in therapy and enhance their daily functioning. The principles used for psychopharmacological management are the same for children with ASD as for those with typical development. However, prescribers should keep in mind that children with ASD tend to be more sensitive to medication effects and more likely to have adverse effects than children without ASD. Therefore, pharmacological treatment should be started at lower doses, and adjusted more slowly than in neurotypical children. Obtaining objective symptom measures from different sources before and after the intervention is key to objectively evaluate the response of treatment in different settings.

Serotoninergic Medications

Serotoninergic medications regulate the levels of serotonin which is a key messenger specially involved in the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and the central nervous system (CNS). The serotonin level has been reported to be elevated in the autistic population, and it has been theorized that serotonin dysregulation is associated with symptoms frequently seen in autistic individuals ranging from repetitive behaviors to anxiety. PET studies have demonstrated that young children (under 5 years old) with ASD have lower levels of serotonin in the CSF. Studies of lymphoblastoid cell lines in patients with ASD compared to controls have demonstrated a deficit of enzymes that convert tryptophan to serotonin. These studies suggested that those with ASD would benefit from treatment with an SSRI to stimulate neurogenesis and neuroprotection. There are three different groups of medications that influence the serotonin levels: the SSRIs, SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), and tricyclic antidepressants. The SSRIs are one of the most commonly prescribed medications for autistic individuals to treat anxiety, mood issues, and irritability. However, results of available clinical trials have been inconsistent in the benefits of SSRI's for improving aggression and the core symptoms of ASD.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^fcd7869b]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — repetitive behaviors and irritability management describes pharmacologic options and limitations. Small studies are suggestive of improvement in irritability with anticonvulsant mood stabilizers (valproic acid and divalproex sodium), but a limited number of placebo-controlled studies either do not support or are inconclusive for irritability in ASD; modest improvement has been reported with divalproex sodium treatment. For serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine, the effect size of improvement was small and irritability was not the primary outcome. Atypical (second generation) antipsychotics (aripiprazole, risperidone) have multiple double-blind placebo-controlled trials documenting improvement in repetitive behavior with short-term treatment, with common adverse effects of increased appetite, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, and drooling, and are more effective for targets of tantrums, aggression, and SIB. Studies to date have not revealed effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications for repetitive behaviors related to ASD, although they may diminish anxiety; SSRIs may be effective for reducing symptoms of OCD and of anxiety when included in a comprehensive approach to treatment, and comprehensive behavioral approaches are needed to minimize repetitive behaviors.

### An update on psychopharmacological treatment of autism spectrum disorder [^19c10f70]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Classic medical management of medical conditions has largely revolved around pharmacological treatment. However, despite decades of research in ASD, current evidence has only established behavioral (non-pharmacological) treatments as the mainstay of management to address the core symptoms of ASD. Part of the reason for a lack of efficacy in many treatment studies stems from the heterogeneous etiology underlying the overall term of ASD. Some studies have subdivided enrolled patients either by their genetic etiology or phenotypic features to address this. The aim of this paper is to provide a current update on the pharmacological treatments available for ASD and therapeutic subtypes of ASD, covering both the established ones and upcoming/emerging treatments which have potential based on scientific evidence to become standard treatments in the next few years. A systematic literature search was completed on Medline, Scopus, and Embase with key search terms of "autism", "autism spectrum disorder", "targeted treatments", "pharmacological therapy", and "management" to identify relevant articles. Here we have highlighted the psychopharmacological treatments that have the most efficacy and are also, in most cases, available now or in the near future to clinicians. However, we also recognize the current mainstay of behavioral intervention in the management of ASD and will briefly review those which are supported by strong empirical evidence.

### Role of risperidone in children with autism spectrum disorder [^e256defe]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE/PubMed (1992-February 2006) were conducted, as well as an extensive manual review of journals, using the key words autism and risperidone.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Only double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were included for review.

Data Synthesis

ASD is the most common of the pervasive developmental disorders. The main characteristics (core symptoms) of autism are impairment in social skills, problems communicating, and stereotypical movements. Behavioral manifestations or maladaptive behaviors include aggression, irritability, hyperactivity, inattention, impulsivity, tantrums, and self-injurious behavior.

Conclusions

Based on the data examined, risperidone appears efficacious and safe for treating certain behavioral aspects of autism including irritability, aggression, hyperactivity, and stereotypy. It does not appear to be as effective for the treatment of the core symptoms of autism.

### Pharmacotherapy of irritability in pervasive developmental disorders [^cca08f76]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Children and adolescents diagnosed with autism and related pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) often sustain irritability, including aggression, self-injurious behavior, and tantrums. Research to date supports the use of the atypical antipsychotics as a first-line pharmacologic treatment for this target symptom domain in PDDs. Currently, the atypical antipsychotic risperidone is the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for irritability in youth with autism. Additional large-scale, placebo-controlled studies of other medications are needed to determine their efficacy for the treatment of irritability in this diagnostic group.

### Effectiveness of deep brain stimulation on refractory aggression in pediatric patients with autism and severe intellectual disability: meta-analytic review [^514b6df6]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aggressive, self-injurious and uncontrolled behavior usually occurs in a subset of pediatric patients with autism (ASD) and severe intellectual disability (SID). Dysfunctional behavior and aggressive and maladaptive responses are typical in these subjects. Severe forms of ASD and ID put the safety and well-being of patients at risk, creating a challenge for the family and caregivers. As a result, these subjects are subjected to direct mechanical coercive restraint measures, using protective helmets to avoid craniofacial fractures, gloves, and restraint belts to avoid self-mutilation and injuries to third parties. Moreover, the consequences of highly aggressive behaviors are aggravated by the ineffectiveness and refractoriness of symptoms to pharmacological and psychological treatment. The main medications to manage or reduce persistent aggression usually include antipsychotic drugs, with or without benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, antiepileptics, alpha-2 agonists, beta-blockers, lithium, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, among others. Unfortunately, despite the combination of drugs and doses used, due to the severity of the clinical symptoms, some of these patients remain refractory to treatment. Unfortunately, despite the combination of drugs and doses used, the severity of clinical symptoms forces to classify these patients as untreatable.

For this subset of patients with uncontrolled aggression, neurosurgical interventions have been developed. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) involves the implantation of electrodes in specific brain regions, where a neurostimulator applies electrical impulses to treat neurological and psychiatric pathologies refractory to conventional treatment. DBS is an effective, reversible, and safe treatment for a wide variety of intractable clinical conditions. It is especially effective for patients with dangerous, self-injurious or third-party injurious behaviors resistant to traditional treatment.

Due to the frustration and refractoriness of pharmacological and behavioral treatments, DBS is gaining particular interest among specialists and family members. Unfortunately, the evidence for the application of DBS in children and adolescents is progressing slowly. Therefore, the aims of this study were: 1) to summarize the current knowledge on the effectiveness and safety of DBS for aggressive and intractable behavior in pediatric patients with ASD and SID; 2) to analyze the technical aspects of DBS, and 3) to estimate the quality levels of available studies.

### An update on medication management of behavioral disorders in autism [^25fb0866]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder is often comorbid with behavioral disturbances such as irritability, aggression and hyperactivity. Throughout the mid 2000s, several large-scale controlled clinical trials were published leading to the approval of two medications (aripiprazole and risperidone) for treatment of irritability in this condition. This review serves as an update regarding new research findings regarding psychopharmacology for children and adolescents with ASD. In summary, the past five years have yielded no further approved medications with ASD as a primary indication. Important new research results include 1) long-term safety and efficacy data (52 week) regarding treatment with aripiprazole for irritability, 2) consensus regarding potential harm from SSRIs for treatment of repetitive behaviors in children/ adolescents with ASD, 3) a randomized controlled trial showing modest benefits from atomoxetine on hyperactivity, 4) many novel agents currently under investigation.

### Navigating agitation in neurodevelopmental disorders: a comparative study of pharmacotherapies via network meta-analysis in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disabilities [^0f78b915]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study represents the most exhaustive NMA to date for assessing pharmacotherapy targeting agitation symptoms in individuals with NDs. Given the proliferation of single-treatment RCTs and the scarcity of head-to-head RCTs, NMAs offer a distinct approach to synthesizing knowledge with the available data. While NMAs are potent tools for comparative effectiveness research, it is crucial to consider several limitations associated with these findings.

In this study, we acknowledge the nuanced differentiation between 'aggression' and 'agitation' as distinct behavioural constructs. Although our search strategy encompassed both terms, it is important to note that aggression can manifest independently of agitation in individuals with NDs. We have factored in this distinction during our data analysis and interpretation, recognizing potential variations in the presentation of these behaviours across the included studies.

A significant portion of the included trials did not provide detailed information about co-morbidities, and in some cases, co-morbid conditions were explicitly excluded from the trial criteria. Consequently, we were unable to systematically analyse the impact of co-morbidities on medication effects or responses in this study. Future research focusing on explicitly examining the influence of co-morbid mental illnesses on treatment outcomes in individuals with NDs would offer valuable insights into this aspect.

The bulk of evidence in our NMA relied on indirect treatment comparisons, which are more susceptible to bias compared to head-to-head comparisons. Moreover, the limited number of RCTs and small sample sizes resulted in imprecise and potentially underpowered estimates for certain medications. Although we opted to pool studies by medication classification and specific symptom clusters to enhance statistical power, our review's generalizability to other symptom clusters (e.g. depression, anxiety, psychosis) is limited. Consequently, there was notable heterogeneity in some outcomes, partly due to the lack of standardized protocols in some medication-based studies, which was an inherent limitation of this review.

### Navigating agitation in neurodevelopmental disorders: a comparative study of pharmacotherapies via network meta-analysis in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disabilities [^1fdc0667]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neurodevelopmental disorders (ND) encompass a spectrum of conditions rooted in the neurological system and brain functioning, often emerging early in life and persisting into adulthood, and significantly influencing daily functioning, social interactions and cognitive abilities. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities (ID) are among the most prevalent NDs, characterized by distinct yet interrelated challenges. ASD entails persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, coupled with restricted interests and repetitive behaviours, impacting social relationships and adaptability. Conversely, ID denotes significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour, hindering learning and practical application of knowledge.

One of the hallmark features shared by ASD and ID is the propensity for irritability and emotional dysregulation, often manifesting as tantrums, self-injurious behaviour and aggression. These behavioural challenges not only impact the affected individuals but also impose substantial stress and strain on their families, caregivers and broader support networks. It is important to distinguish between agitation and irritability, as these are related but not synonymous concepts. Agitation typically refers to a state of increased restlessness and heightened emotional arousal that may lead to aggressive behaviours, while irritability is characterized by a lower threshold for frustration and a predisposition to anger, which may or may not result in aggressive actions. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for accurately assessing and treating these symptoms.

In addressing the complex needs of individuals with ASD and ID, a multimodal approach combining behavioural interventions and pharmacotherapy is often employed. While behavioural therapies often aim to teach adaptive skills, coping strategies and social communication techniques, medications are utilized to manage specific symptoms such as aggression, agitation and emotional dysregulation.

Antipsychotic medications, particularly second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), have garnered significant attention in the treatment of irritability and aggression associated with ASD and ID. Compared to first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), SGAs are generally preferred because they tend to have a better safety profile compared to FGAs. This improved safety includes a reduced risk of extrapyramidal side effects, such as tremors and rigidity, and a lower potential for cognitive impairment, making them more suitable for long-term management of symptoms in individuals with ND. For example, the incidence of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal side effects is lower, and there is minor impairment of cognitive function and treatment-related negative symptoms. However, SGAs are not without drawbacks, as they are associated with adverse effects such as weight gain, metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular risks, necessitating careful consideration of risks and benefits in treatment decisions.

While the majority of the included studies were conducted in pediatric populations, the inclusion of a few studies focusing on adults allowed for a broader assessment of pharmacotherapy efficacy across age groups. However, due to the limited number of adult-focused studies, further research is warranted to confirm these findings in larger adult cohorts.

Furthermore, the risk of bias in individual RCTs was elevated due to various factors such as inherent challenges with blinding medication trials, response bias and social desirability, which could have biased self-reported, subjective measures, especially for agitation and aggression symptoms. Despite an extensive search, we might have missed relevant studies, as evidenced by the presence of publication bias in at least one of our outcomes. Although network-level publication bias was not detected for most other outcomes, individual medications might have been influenced by publication bias, particularly for pharmacotherapies with only one study available. Additionally, therapy-comparator differences might have been mitigated by some comparator conditions' active, therapeutic nature, further warranting cautious interpretation of our findings. Another limitation of our study is the inability to perform a separate sensitivity analysis for individuals with ID alone, as the number of studies available (n = 7) did not meet the Cochrane-recommended minimum of 10 studies, which precluded a reliable sub-analysis.

Lastly, the limited number of studies measuring longer-term outcomes adds another layer of complexity to our analysis.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^6b0ab28d]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The escalating prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in recent years has created an urgent need for additional medical providers capable of delivering autism-competent care. While the call for more medical providers could be justified across medical specialties, nowhere is the need greater than in managing co-occurring neuropsychiatric conditions. Individuals with ASD have a high prevalence of co-occurring neuropsychiatric conditions, with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and anxiety disorders being among the most common. Left untreated, these co-occuring conditions can have detrimental and potentially catastrophic impacts on ASD individuals and their families, such as decreased quality of life and increased stress, hindered educational and employment opportunities and increased risk of suicidality. While in some cases, the standard of care (SOC) for managing these conditions in an individual with ASD is comparable to the SOC for a non-autistic individual, treatment paths can differ significantly due to complex medical and behavioral profiles and differences in medication efficacy and tolerability. Currently, only two drugs have been approved by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the ASD population: risperidone and aripiprazole. Both drugs are approved for the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with ASD. Aside from these two exceptions, psychopharmacological treatments for ASD individuals are prescribed off-label. Navigating this treatment landscape can be challenging and time-consuming for providers who have not received specific training in ASD medical care but who nonetheless find themselves with ASD patients amidst the rising need.

### Toward actionable practice parameters for "Dual diagnosis": principles of assessment and management for Co-occurring psychiatric and intellectual / developmental disability [^7641c807]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Psychopharmacologic approaches to the management of aggression in individuals with IDD and PS are an important tool in the treatment of many patients but should be prescribed only after consideration of potential environmental precipitants, preceding or ongoing trauma, needs for functional communication training, and behavior support planning have been carefully considered. Typically pharmacological treatment proceeds similarly as it would for aggression in psychiatric syndromes exclusive of IDD; mood stabilizing agents (lithium, atypical neuroleptics, and anticonvulsant mood stabilizers) are most effective but carry a diversity of short and long term risks. Consequently, it may be prudent to consider stimulants and alpha agonists as first approaches, especially in IDD syndromes in which aggression may be attributable to ADHD or unspecified impulse control problems; this is particularly common in the autism spectrum disorders and represents a significant opportunity for safe, effective amelioration of disruptive behaviors. Anxiolytics can be considered for patients whose aggressive episodes occur in the context of unresolved anxiety, with the caveat that drugs in this class can be disinhibiting and thereby exacerbate aggression in some patients, requiring appropriate caution. There is extensive literature including multiple randomized controlled trials, suggesting that risperidone and aripiprazole have the strongest evidence in reducing aggression and irritability in IDD. These interventions can be combined with parent training and other relevant psychosocial interventions to particular advantage. For ASD patients who have not responded to other antipsychotics, clozapine has been reported to be an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment. As IDD syndromes are becoming increasingly specified by genetic origin through clinical genomic screening, more specified approaches to aggression in particular IDD syndromes are becoming possible, as in the case of Fragile X Syndrome, where several agents have been found to be effective, and new clinical trials involving glutamate receptor antagonists and other agents targeting molecular pathways affected by the condition are under way.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^417b7fff]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Irritability in the DSM-5 is defined as "persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters". Irritability is often used as an umbrella term for behavioral symptoms associated with various disorders, including ASD, which can consist of one or a combination of the following: extreme tantrums, aggression towards people or property, severe mood lability, and SIB. The DSM-5-TR lists irritability as a symptom of various mood and behavioral disorders such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Within the context of ASD, irritability may be a manifestation of an additional psychiatric condition such as ADHD or a mood disorder for example. Irritability may also be a symptom of underlying medical issues such as GI discomfort or related to difficulty communicating. Irritability is common in ASD. Parent reports of physical aggression in a cohort of 1,380 children and adolescents with ASD showed that 35% were currently exhibiting significant aggression towards a caregiver or another person and that 49% had demonstrated some form of aggression towards others in the past. A recent meta-study reported that prevalence rates of SIB in the ASD population may be as high as 42%. Severe irritability can impact relationships, access to educational programming and therapeutic/behavioral services, and work opportunities and can lead to stress and reduced quality of life for individuals, family members, and caregivers.

Irritability is a complex symptom domain, and it can be difficult to determine the underlying cause among the wide array of potential sources. Additional challenges are posed by balancing safety concerns related to irritability behaviors themselves and those related to pharmacological treatment options for irritability. Ideally, specialized medical experts, such as a psychiatrist, will be involved in the assessment and treatment of individuals with severe irritability, as irritability can be a symptom of multiple psychiatric conditions, including ADHD, depression, mania, psychosis, or a potential medication side effect. However, we recognize that access to specialized care is not always attainable, and there may be cases where the treatment of irritability through general practice providers is necessary and warranted. With this in mind, we include a brief section that offers insight into the ways that Lurie Center for Autism providers approach the treatment of irritability in ASD.

Table 10 — medication use considerations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — no current medication corrects core social and communication symptoms of ASD; medication is used to help manage coexisting behavioral health disorders and associated problem behaviors or symptoms causing significant impairment and distress; medication should only be considered after careful accounting of when the behavior started and what seems to exacerbate it and a functional behavioral assessment should guide development of a treatment plan in the school setting; consider referral to a behavior therapist outside of school to assess the reasons for the behavior, provide the family with strategies, and collaborate in care; obtain a careful history and physical to look for medical factors that may cause or exacerbate challenging behaviors; consider medication after treatable medical conditions and behavioral factors are assessed and intervention does not address the symptoms of concern; and include the family and patient in shared decision making that considers their goals and values.

### Pharmacologic treatment of severe irritability and problem behaviors in autism: a systematic review and meta-analysis… [^8b7eaafb]. publications.aap.org (2016). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder is increasingly recognized as a public health issue. Irritability and aggression often negatively affect the lives of people with ASD and their families. Although many medications have been tested for IA in ASDs in randomized controlled trials, critical quantitative analyses of these trials are lacking in the literature. To systematically review and quantitatively analyze the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic treatments for IA in youth with ASD. Studies were identified from Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, and review articles. Original articles on placebo-controlled RCTs of pharmacologic treatments of IA in youth age 2 to 17 years with ASD were included. Data items included study design, study goals, details of study participants, details of intervention, study results, statistical methods, side effects, and risks of bias.

The primary study outcome measure was the effect size of reduction in the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist–Irritability scores in the medication group, as compared with placebo, in RCTs using parallel groups design. Forty-six RCTs were identified. Compared with placebo, 3 compounds resulted in significant improvement in ABC-I at the end of treatment. Risperidone and aripiprazole were found to be the most effective, with the largest effect sizes. Sedation, extrapyramidal sides effects, and weight gain were assessed quantitatively. Although risperidone and aripiprazole have the strongest evidence in reducing ABC-I in youth with ASD, a few other compounds also showed significant efficacy with fewer potential side effects and adverse reactions in single studies.

### Management of children with autism spectrum disorders [^0a223e3d]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Pediatricians have an important role not only in early recognition and evaluation of autism spectrum disorders but also in chronic management of these disorders. The primary goals of treatment are to maximize the child's ultimate functional independence and quality of life by minimizing the core autism spectrum disorder features, facilitating development and learning, promoting socialization, reducing maladaptive behaviors, and educating and supporting families. To assist pediatricians in educating families and guiding them toward empirically supported interventions for their children, this report reviews the educational strategies and associated therapies that are the primary treatments for children with autism spectrum disorders. Optimization of health care is likely to have a positive effect on habilitative progress, functional outcome, and quality of life; therefore, important issues, such as management of associated medical problems, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic intervention for challenging behaviors or coexisting mental health conditions, and use of complementary and alternative medical treatments, are also addressed.

Methods

Protocol and registration

This review was registered with Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42021258641) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines along with the extension for NMAs. As a secondary analysis of published data, no ethics committee review was necessary.

Eligibility criteria

We employed the populations-interventions-comparators-outcomes-study design framework to define eligibility criteria. Patients with a primary diagnosis of ASD or intellectual disability (ID) were included, based on diagnostic criteria from any edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the International Classification of Diseases, as long as a validated diagnostic instrument was utilized. Any experimental study measuring the efficacy or safety of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood-stabilizing agents, psychostimulants, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists and other agents administered orally or parenterally for treating aggression or agitation in any age group was considered. Trials comparing medications to non-pharmacologic therapies were excluded.

The term 'agitation' encompassed a range of behaviour problems, including irritability, measured using validated instruments such as the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist, Irritability Subscale (ABC-I), the Overt Aggression Scale, the Clinical Global Impressions – Improvement (CGI-I) and Severity (CGI-S) scales, the Developmental Behaviour Checklist – Teacher Behaviour Problems Subscale and other equivalent tools. Eligible studies reported at least one measure of efficacy or safety. In the absence of information or, we calculated responses using a previously validated imputation method.

Primary outcomes were response (⩾50% reduction in agitation severity) and all-cause treatment discontinuation. Secondary outcomes included discontinuation due to adverse events, adverse events and reduction in irritability severity.

Search strategy

A comprehensive search strategy was developed and executed in multiple databases, including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and PubMed, from inception through 2022. Bibliographies of included records and previous reviews were also reviewed.

Study selection

Study selection was performed independently by pairs of investigators using Covidence, a web-based systematic review manager. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus.

Data collection

Data abstraction was conducted independently by three reviewers (AB, EF and AN) using a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet, including variables such as sample size, demographics, intervention details, outcome measures and study characteristics (Table 1).

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^81dffdd9]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Psychotropic medication options — irritability and severe disruptive behavior in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) include atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics (aripiprazole, risperidone), α-2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine, guanfacine), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; fluvoxamine, citalopram). Medication most effective if combined with behavioral strategies addressing identified environmental causes for the behavior and developing more appropriate responses for the child. DB/PCs strong support for 2 second-generation atypical antipsychotic medications (risperidone and aripiprazole) for reducing irritability, stereotyped or repetitive movements, self-injury, and hyperactivity, and risperidone and aripiprazole are currently the only medications with FDA-approved labeling specific to irritability in ASD. Adverse effects and monitoring are noted: common adverse effects include wt gain and dyslipidemia; Monitoring: periodic assessment for extrapyramidal symptoms; measurement of wt, height, and BMI; and laboratory monitoring of glucose and lipid levels; metformin might be a useful treatment to help control wt gain. Other agents in this class, such as olanzapine and quetiapine, may have utility on the basis of their adverse effect profiles but do not have current FDA package insert indication for use in children with ASD. For α-2 adrenergic agonists, small studies documenting beneficial effects on irritability; need larger trials; may have better adverse effect profiles than atypical antipsychotics. For SSRIs, few studies focused on irritability and/or aggression; some reporting improvement in irritability; insufficient evidence to advise practice.

### Toward actionable practice parameters for "Dual diagnosis": principles of assessment and management for Co-occurring psychiatric and intellectual / developmental disability [^a9f6ff15]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our review identified a number of recent translational advances in the management of specific psychiatric syndromes in individuals with autism — fewer in those with intellectual disability — and very few scientific articles in which comprehensive approaches to symptom identification/interpretation, diagnosis, and treatment of specific combinations IDD and PS were implemented and evaluated. The evidence base summarized here emphasizes the importance of tailoring the management of psychiatric syndromes to the unique context of a given intellectual or developmental disability, considering the widely varying consequences of such conditions on capacity for communication and engagement in intervention, the function of behavioral impairment, and the manner in which psychiatric symptoms manifest. Table 2 provides a listing of selected clinical trials and systematic reviews, published over the past 5 years, documenting evidence for specific intervention modalities for ASD/ID and aggression, depression, or addictions. Symptom identification must include careful consideration of precipitating factors for psychiatric symptoms that are accentuated in the context of developmental disability and the increased vulnerability to and impact of trauma. Factors that may be less easily communicated by IDD populations must be considered in diagnostic formulation, including traumatic experiences that may be viewed by the community as relatively trivial, medical conditions that incur pain, and the recognition of differences between individuals with IDD and their peers. Intervention strategies must cross the boundaries of what are typically applied to IDD versus PS, using comprehensive approaches such as positive behavior support planning, functional behavior assessments, applied behavior analysis-based interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, in-home therapeutic support, case management, and psychopharmacologic therapy. It is clear that more research is needed for understanding the impact of treatment and improving best practice in these common complex syndromes, as represented by combinations of IDD with three common, serious behavioral syndromes covered in relative detail here — aggression, depression, and addictions. As we await advances in evidence-informed approaches to these conditions, bridging gaps in knowledge across the respective IDD and PS service sectors should be of very high priority to empower clinicians, patients, and their families to seek treatments that cross traditional bureaucracies of care and integrate disparate intervention modalities (including positive behavior supports, pharmacotherapy, appropriately modified psychotherapy, and trauma-informed care). These intervention modalities should be advocated for implementation within the treatment plans for individual patients whose complex conditions are unnecessarily protracted or aggravated when there exists unrecognized opportunity for better treatment outcome, i.e. when comprehensive approaches harnessing all available evidence-informed interventions have not yet been considered and applied.

### Predictors of placebo response in pharmacological and dietary supplement treatment trials in pediatric autism spectrum disorder: a meta-analysis [^ba1dcda6]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by core deficits in social communication and interaction, and the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities. Prevalence is estimated to be as high as 1 in 68. There are currently no medication treatments approved for the core symptoms of ASD. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved two atypical antipsychotics for children with ASD, risperidone and aripiprazole, for irritability symptoms, including tantrums, aggression and self-injury behaviors. Established pharmacological and dietary supplement interventions have also been trialed as treatments for behavioral symptoms, such as repetitive behavior, aggression, hyperactivity and irritability, and for social impairment. However, little evidence exists to support the efficacy for most of these treatments. Notwithstanding the lack of established evidence for medications, it has been estimated that at least 25% of children with ASD take at least one medication.

The assessment of treatment response within clinical trials presents a major challenge to establishing efficacious interventions to treat core symptoms of ASD and associated social and behavioral impairments. Inconsistent results from clinical trials for core social and communication impairment in ASD have been a noted feature that has limited drug development. Although it is often assumed that core behaviors are unlikely to remit spontaneously in children with severe ASD, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have found that up to 30% of child ASD participants respond to placebo treatments. Outcome measures for children with ASD continue to be dependent on observer and informant ratings. Although it is widely recommended that both independent and caregiver ratings are employed to reduce rating biases, it is unclear how observer and informant ratings are independently influenced by placebo effects and impact on the evaluation of treatment outcome of trials in ASD. In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial treating children with autistic disorder, results for parent-rated outcome measures were nonsignificant, whereas statistically significant improvements were reported for clinician-rated scales. Conversely, in an RCT assessing the effects of oxytocin on social behaviors in adolescents with ASD, parental beliefs moderated outcome, regardless of whether the child was actually assigned the active drug condition.

### Antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and risk of violent crime [^8107f6fe]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Panel
Research in context

Systematic review

We searched PubMed for published studies about the violence-reducing effects of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers with the term "(antipsychotic* OR antimanic* OR mood stabiliser OR mood stabilizer OR antiepileptic*) AND (aggression OR violence OR crime OR offending)" from Jan 1, 1966, up to Nov 28, 2013. We did not use any language or date restrictions, and we used "clinical trial", "journal article", "review", and "humans" as filters. The search yielded 1310 publications; of particular interest were seven recent systematic reviews about adults, three about children and adolescents, and one multi-group randomised controlled trial of adults.

Existing evidence suggests that antipsychoticsand valproatemight reduce aggressive acts in patients with schizophrenia, but these studies are limited to aggression outcomes. Clozapine reportedly has stronger anti-aggressive qualities than other antipsychotics. Uncertainty exists about whether first-generation or second-generation antipsychotics are more effective, and regarding the use of depot versus oral medication in patients with schizophrenia. Antipsychotics and mood stabilisers reportedly reduced anger in some patients with borderline personality disorder. Risperidone might reduce aggression in young people to a greater extent than other antipsychotics in those with disruptive behaviour disorders, and autism spectrum disorder. In the general population, mood stabilisers might reduce aggression, but these effects have not been proven in high-quality studies.

Interpretation

To our knowledge, this Article is the first total population-based study to address the potential violence-reducing effects of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers with a within-individual research design. Although we cannot make direct causal interpretations, our findings suggest that the benefits of antipsychotics might include effects on various crime outcomes. This idea is consistent with the 83% relative reduction in aggression in schizophrenia reported in a recent synthesis of trial data. Furthermore, previous studies about whether pharmacological monotherapy with mood stabilisers reduces violence have been equivocal. However, we reported that men with bipolar disorder who take mood stabilisers have a reduced rate of violent crime, but we recorded no such associations with mood stabilisers in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders. Our findings need additional confirmation in clinical trials and experimental studies but might be able to help management decisions for patients with psychiatric disorders.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^997f7a2d]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research agenda — The committee's 2009 strategic plan, updated in 2017, identified 7 areas for research funding: (1) early detection, (2) underlying biology, (3) genetic and environmental risk factors, (4) treatments and interventions, (5) services and implementation science, (6) lifespan services and supports, and (7) epidemiological surveillance and infrastructure, and research in all of these areas is critical to move forward with early diagnosis, effective treatment, and evidence-based interventions at each age. The committee recommended that multiple levels of inquiry be pursued simultaneously to inform evidence-based clinical care, including basic and translational science in the areas of genetics and epigenetics, neurobiology, and psychopharmacology to develop ASD-specific behavioral and pharmacologic therapies and to identify and understand ASD risk factors; research into the underlying neurobiology of sensory symptoms and restricted interests and repetitive behaviors to inform development of targeted interventions; clinical trials to test focused interventions based on the underlying biological processes involved with ASD to determine if they are appropriate for community application; epidemiological surveillance to gather data important for planning for current and future needs, including screening, diagnosis, and lifespan health and mental health services; and health services research to provide guidance for comprehensive, accessible, and culturally appropriate medical, educational, and behavioral care for children, youth, adults, and families affected by ASD.

### Propranolol for treating emotional, behavioural, autonomic dysregulation in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders [^07080514]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To date, there is no single medication prescribed to alleviate all the core symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, 2016). Both serotonin reuptake inhibitors and drugs for psychosis possess therapeutic drawbacks when managing anxiety and aggression in ASD. This review sought to appraise the use of propranolol as a pharmacological alternative when managing emotional, behavioural and autonomic dysregulation (EBAD) and other symptoms.

Materials and Methods

Sixteen reports examined the administration of propranolol in the context of ASD.

Results

Sixteen reports broadly covered cognitive domains, neural correlates, and behavioural domains. From the eight single-dose clinical trials, propranolol led to significant improvements in cognitive performance - verbal problem solving, social skills, mouth fixation, and conversation reciprocity; and changes in neural correlates - improvement in semantic networks and functional connectivity. The remaining eight case series and single case reports showed improvements in EBAD, anxiety, aggressive, self-injurious and hypersexual behaviours. Additionally, propranolol significantly improved similar behavioural domains (aggression and self-injury) for those with acquired brain injury.

Conclusion

This review indicates that propranolol holds promise for EBAD and cognitive performance in ASD. Given the lack of good quality clinical trials, randomised controlled trials are warranted to explore the efficacy of propranolol in managing EBAD in ASD.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^418488d5]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Defining and recognizing irritability

Unlike the first four co-occurring conditions discussed in these guidelines, irritability is an umbrella term rather than a diagnosis. There are many terms and concepts related to irritability that have been used in clinical and research applications through the years, such as aggression, problem behaviors, maladaptive behaviors, and mood/emotional dysregulation. However, as the two drugs that have received FDA approval for use in ASD, risperidone, and aripiprazole, are both for the indication of "irritability", we chose this language for the purposes of our prescribing practices guidelines.

While irritability may be hard to define and interpret, the signs of irritability are more overt than many other interfering behaviors. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)-Irritability subscale can be helpful in identifying these signs including inappropriate yelling or crying, banging objects, deliberate self-injury, showing aggression towards others (either physical or verbal aggression), and tantrums/meltdowns. Self-injurious behavior may involve head banging, hair pulling, eye pressing, self-biting/scratching, and other behaviors individuals do to themselves that can result in physical injury. Patient, caregiver, and teacher reports, with subsequent clinician interviews/impressions, typically comprise the process of assessing if a patient has irritability.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^18b6f879]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder

International studies over the past two decades have documented a point prevalence of catatonia ranging from 12% to 20% in individuals with autism, with onset most commonly in adolescence and early adulthood. As the US Center for Disease Control estimated an incidence of autism as 1 in 44 children, it is likely that clinicians will care for individuals with autism and catatonia. It is theorised that shared neuronal circuitry and genetic susceptibility loci exist between autism and catatonia. Catatonia often encompasses the full range of psychomotor retarded and agitated clinical features in autism, and the latter may include dangerous repetitive self-injury with high risk for severe bodily harm.

Diagnosis of catatonia in autism is complicated by the overlap in clinical features between the two conditions. Therefore, several authors have suggested that diagnosis of catatonia in autism should entail a marked change from baseline presentation. This is important because no pharmacological or neuromodulatory therapies are indicated for the core symptoms of autism.

### The management of children and youth with pediatric mental and behavioral health emergencies [^42c39a4c]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder — Patients with intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and other chronic neurodevelopmental disabilities present unique challenges to emergency physicians, and in the emergency department (ED) it is important to evaluate potential organic causes for a patient's presentation; if none are identified, calming and quieting measures can be attempted, including observing the patient in a quiet area (if available) for a few hours for improvement in the behavior, and if severe behaviors do not improve with ED intervention, pharmacologic intervention, or involvement of a psychiatrist, consultation with a behavioral and developmental pediatrician may be necessary for safety; behavioral health emergencies in children with ID and ASD in the ED include increasing injurious and aggressive behavior toward self or family members, insomnia, refusal to eat or drink (if no underlying medical etiology can be identified), refusal to take medications (psychiatric or somatic), and emotional lability (often without the verbal skills necessary to communicate emotions).

### Navigating agitation in neurodevelopmental disorders: a comparative study of pharmacotherapies via network meta-analysis in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disabilities [^95de1016]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings have implications for the duration of treatment in clinical practice, which often extends to months or even years due to the lifelong nature of these disorders. However, prolonged use of SGAs poses risks of long-term side effects such as metabolic syndrome and weight gain, necessitating additional strategies to manage these side effects, such as diet, exercise and additional pharmacotherapies. For instance, in a longitudinal study of aripiprazole over 52 weeks, participants experienced a mean change in body weight of 6.3 kg, challenging the perception that aripiprazole causes less weight gain than risperidone. Similarly, recent research indicates comparable long-term treatment effects of risperidone and aripiprazole on body weight gain.

The use of antipsychotics in the pediatric population requires careful consideration due to potential risks, including the elevation of diabetes risk in children with or without ASD. Monitoring side effects, especially in this age group, is paramount. Additionally, the practice of polypharmacy, where patients receive multiple antipsychotic medications concurrently, is not uncommon and can significantly increase the risk of metabolic side effects, including weight gain, diabetes and life-threatening arrhythmias. Hence, caution is advised in combining multiple antipsychotics to minimize adverse outcomes.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by, published in Lancet Psychiatry, examined the efficacy of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for managing behaviours that challenge individuals with ID. The study analysed data from 82 RCTs, encompassing 4637 participants, and found that both types of interventions produced small but significant effects in reducing overall challenging behaviours, including self-injury, aggression and irritability. Interestingly, the study reported no significant differences in efficacy between pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for any of the behavioural topographies examined. These findings underscore the importance of integrating psychological therapies with pharmacological approaches, as both can play crucial roles in a comprehensive treatment strategy for managing challenging behaviours in individuals with ID and ASD.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^e8666f43]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Psychotropic medication options — hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, and distractibility in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) include psychostimulants (methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate, mixed amphetamine salts, lisdexamfetamine, dextroamphetamine), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; atomoxetine), α-2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine, guanfacine), and atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics (aripiprazole, risperidone). With other coexisting symptoms, medication may not appear as effective, and patients may be more sensitive to adverse effects. Steps emphasize behavioral approaches, then if problems persist a trial of medication management; start with a low-dose stimulant and increase as needed and tolerated. If there are adverse effects or if not effective, consider atomoxetine (especially if also with social anxiety) or consider α-2 agonists (eg, short- or long-acting guanfacine, clonidine). May be most effective in children without comorbid intellectual disability. Other medications (less evidence) note atypical antipsychotic medications may decrease hyperactivity; their primary use is for irritability and aggression. Adverse effects include for psychostimulants appetite suppression and insomnia; also irritability, depressive symptoms, and social withdrawal; it does not appear to worsen repetitive behavior or oppositional behavior. For guanfacine or clonidine, drowsiness, fatigue and irritability may occur and may also include appetite suppression, nausea, sleep disturbance, and decreased blood pressure and heart rate; rebound if not weaned.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^a27ac187]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Behavioral and educational strategies can be implemented to assist in the management of irritability. A functional behavioral assessment from a school behavioralist can offer helpful insight into the function of disruptive behaviors, such as escaping aversive stimuli like a loud room or accessing rewarding or soothing stimuli like getting caregiver attention. When the function of a behavior can be determined, a behavioral team can develop a plan to reduce the frequency of maladaptive behaviors through adjustments to the environment and caregiver response patterns that aim to decrease the persistence of the behavior. Parent training, namely targeted skill development for caregivers in addressing maladaptive behavior, has shown potential to reduce irritability. The RUBI Parent Training for Disruptive Behavior was specifically endorsed by Lurie Center providers and preliminary efficacy findings in recent feasibility studies are promising.

When behavioral options are ineffective, or irritability is in the moderate to severe range, providers may turn to pharmacological treatments for non-specific irritability (Fig. 5, Table 9). The ABC-Irritability subscale is important to obtain at baseline and throughout the course of treatment of irritability in ASD.

Table 9
Medication options and dosing for irritability in patients with ASD

ER Extended-release, IR Immediate-release

Medication management and dosing for irritability

When pharmacological treatments are appropriate, α 2 -adrenergic agonists such as guanfacine are a good option to begin with based on their safety and side effect profiles. For irritability, guanfacine IR tablets can be started at a daily dose of 1 mg, given as 0.5 mg (half of a 1 mg tablet) twice daily, and increased up to a maximum daily dose of 4 mg across two or more administrations. Guanfacine ER can be started at 1 mg daily and increased up to a maximum daily dose of 4 mg for irritability.

In extreme cases of irritability where behaviors pose a significant threat to the safety of an individual or others, one may consider beginning with the atypical antipsychotics, risperidone and aripiprazole, which are both FDA-approved for irritability in children and adolescents with ASD. While antipsychotic medications show efficacy and general tolerability, they can lead to serious physiological effects such as changes in bodyweight, body mass index, triglycerides, cholesterol, prolactin and heart rate, and thus require careful, frequent monitoring.

### Autism spectrum disorder: a review [^4d03557e]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characterized by deficits in social communication and the presence of restricted, repetitive behaviors or interests, is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting approximately 2.3% children aged 8 years in the US and approximately 2.2% of adults. This review summarizes evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of ASD.

Observations

The estimated prevalence of ASD has been increasing in the US, from 1.1% in 2008 to 2.3% in 2018, which is likely associated with changes in diagnostic criteria, improved performance of screening and diagnostic tools, and increased public awareness. No biomarkers specific to the diagnosis of ASD have been identified. Common early signs and symptoms of ASD in a child's first 2 years of life include no response to name when called, no or limited use of gestures in communication, and lack of imaginative play. The criterion standard for the diagnosis of ASD is a comprehensive evaluation with a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and is based on semistructured direct observation of the child's behavior and semistructured caregiver interview focused on the individual's development and behaviors using standardized measures, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition and the Autism Diagnostic Interview. These diagnostic measures have sensitivity of 91% and 80% and specificity of 76% and 72%, respectively. Compared with people without ASD, individuals with ASD have higher rates of depression (20% vs 7%), anxiety (11% vs 5%), sleep difficulties (13% vs 5%), and epilepsy (21% with co-occurring intellectual disability vs 0.8%). Intensive behavioral interventions, such as the Early Start Denver Model, are beneficial in children 5 years or younger for improvement in language, play, and social communication (small to medium effect size based on standardized mean difference). Pharmacotherapy is indicated for co-occurring psychiatric conditions, such as emotion dysregulation or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Risperidone and aripiprazole can improve irritability and aggression (standardized mean difference of 1.1, consistent with a large effect size) compared with placebo. Psychostimulants are effective for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (standardized mean difference of 0.6, consistent with a moderate effect size) compared with placebo. These medications are associated with adverse effects including, most commonly, changes in appetite, weight, and sleep.

Conclusions and Relevance

ASD affects approximately 2.3% of children aged 8 years and approximately 2.2% of adults in the US. First-line therapy consists of behavioral interventions, while co-occurring psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety or aggression, may be treated with specific behavioral therapy or medication.

and obsessive-compulsive disorder. 11, 12 The major psychotropic medication classes used in individuals with ASD include ADHD medications, 13, 14 antipsychotics, 15, 16 antidepressants, 17–20 mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, anxiolytics, and hypnotics.
2. Inattentive type ADHD was associated with a high proportion of patients taking amphetamine, atomoxetine, dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, and methylphenidate. In comparison, hyperactive type ADHD was associated with the following proportions of individuals taking ADHD medications: amphetamine, atomoxetine, dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, and methylphenidate.

The wide variety of medications prescribed to individuals with ASD may be driven by clinical trends in the management of ASD and co-occurring symptoms and conditions. repetitive behavioral patterns in ASD, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that clinicians consider medications in the management of common comorbid conditions, including seizures, ADHD, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and disruptive behavior disorders. 44 The evidence base for interventions for children with ASD has been changing rapidly, and meta-analyses have found that high-intensity behavioral interventions may not be appropriate for all patients with ASD. 46 Our findings suggest that clinicians may be increasingly using integrated approaches to treating patients with ASD and co-occurring conditions, and further work is necessary to determine the relative effects of pharmacotherapy vs behavioral interventions on outcomes in patients with ASD.

This estimate is higher than reports from prior longitudinal studies in solely pediatric populations with ASD. In children, reported estimates of psychotropic polypharmacy have ranged from 6. 7% to 22%, with prescription rates even greater in individuals with comorbid conditions, such as ADHD. 37, 47, 48 The higher rates of medication use in the present study may be secondary to the broader slate of common medications included in our analyses compared with prior studies. However, high rates of polypharmacy and medication transiency raise concerns about the efficacy of current medications in managing comorbidities as they occur in the context of ASD.

### Strategies for pharmacologic treatment of high functioning autism and asperger syndrome [^e5390cb5]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The treatment of complex, polymorphous disorders like HFA/AS always brings a particular challenge to pharmacotherapy. Additionally, the specific characteristics presented by HFA/AS introduce unique complications to patient care and place unusual demands on a clinician's skill and experience. To provide safe and effective treatment, the clinician must understand the core features of the disorder and the manifestations of the condition in his or her patient. Furthermore, a thorough understanding of the family, school, and community resources and limitations is necessary. Once an assessment has been made, focusing on target symptoms provides a crucial framework for care. Knowing manifestations of symptoms and characterizing their distribution and behavior in that patient is most important. For patients with HFA/AS it is particularly essential to coordinate behavioral and pharmacologic objectives. The target symptoms should be tracked carefully and placed into a priority system that is based on the risks and disability they create for the patient. The skill of pharmacotherapy also means setting out realistic expectations, keeping track of the larger systems of care at school and home, and collaboration with parents and care providers. There is an expanding range and pace of biologic and intervention research into HFA/AS. The genetic work has produced exciting leads that are likely to be helpful to future generations [82–84], but the task of clinicians is to tend to today's patients. As we discover more about the complex neural circuitry subserving repetitive behaviors, reward systems, and social cognition, there are good reasons to believe our treatments will become more sophisticated and specific. Psychopharmacology is also moving to design medications that target more specific populations of receptor and brain functions. This is likely to produce medicines that have fewer side effects, are more effective, and are more symptom-specific. Pharmacotherapy is not the ultimate treatment for HFA/AS but it has a definite place. Medication can be a critical element in a comprehensive treatment plan. There is a wider range of medications with more specific biologic effects than ever before. For patients with HFA/AS these newer agents are safer and less disruptive. When paired with clinicians who are becoming more skilled at recognizing and managing symptoms, patients have a greater opportunity to reach their potential and lead pleasurable lives.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^a51e5e26]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

When treating people with co-occurring ADHD and ASD, practitioners need to be particularly mindful of the following:
There is limited data on treating patients who have both ADHD and ASD with ADHD medications, and a careful and circumspect approach should be taken when treating children and adults with co-occurring ADHD and ASD (in comparison to prescribing for ADHD alone). Prescribers should 'start low and go slow' as people with the both conditions may be more treatment resistant and more sensitive to the effects of medication, especially with respect to side effects. Some individuals may have lower thresholds for experiencing side effects from medication, which include sleep difficulties, decreased appetite, tics, mood volatility and irritability.
In collaboration with the child and parents/carers, clear goals and outcome measures should be specified and monitored to determine the effectiveness of medications prescribed, including medication for aggression, anxiety and sleep problems.
Due to sensory issues and physical difficulties, individuals with ASD may experience difficulties with consumption of the medications in tablet form (e.g. difficulty swallowing, aversion to tablets). Many medications are available in liquid or sprinkle preparations.
Young people with ADHD are at higher risk of teenage pregnancy, and it is not advisable to treat pregnant females with stimulant medications. It is important that alternative support is set in place for those who are taken off medication for this reason (see non-pharmacological interventions section).
A medication management plan should be provided to the individual and/or parents/carers, as appropriate, detailing information about the individual's pharmacological treatments. This involves specifying the indication for the use of medication, the medication used, measures of effects and side effects, and the plan for stepwise adjustments of dosage and drug switching or augmentation, should that be necessary.

### Examination of aggression and self-injury in children with autism spectrum disorders and serious behavioral problems [^837f664c]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

This study identified subtypes of aggression in a sample of 206 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who participated in 2 risperidone trials. The narratives were derived from a parent interview about each child's 2 most pressing problems. Five subtypes of aggression emerged: hot aggression only, cold aggression only, self-injurious behavior (SIB) only, aggression and SIB, and nonaggressive. All groups showed a high rate of positive response to risperidone with no differences across subtypes. These study findings extend understanding of aggression in ASD and may be useful to guide further study on biological mechanisms and individualized treatment in ASD.

Autistic spectrum disorders are a group of neurodevelopmental conditions that are increasingly capturing the attention of clinicians and investigators. New insights from genetics and neuropathophysiology of autism will increasingly inform treatment. Presently, individualized treatment approaches typically include a mix of behavioral and, occasionally, pharmacotherapeutic strategies. Concerning the latter, exquisite sensitivity to medication is not uncommon in some children with autism.

### Current approaches to the pharmacologic treatment of core symptoms across the lifespan of autism spectrum disorder [^250c94ed]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

There are no approved medications for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) core symptoms. However, given the significant clinical need, children and adults with ASD are prescribed medication off label for core or associated conditions, sometimes based on limited evidence for effectiveness. Recent developments in the understanding of biologic basis of ASD have led to novel targets with potential to impact core symptoms, and several clinical trials are underway. Heterogeneity in course of development, co-occurring conditions, and age-related treatment response variability hampers study outcomes. Novel measures and approaches to ASD clinical trial design will help in development of effective pharmacologic treatments.

### Pharmacologic treatment of autism [^5e617e09]. Journal of Child Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Autism is a chronic and lifelong pervasive developmental disorder for which there is yet no effective cure, and medical management remains a major challenge for clinicians. In spite of the possible similarities with conditions that have an established pharmacotherapy, and despite improvements in some associated "problematic behaviors" following the use of available medications, effective medical treatment for the core symptoms involving language and social cognition remains elusive. The purpose of the present article is to review current biologic knowledge about autism in an attempt to correlate clinical trials with known mechanisms of disease. In addition, the need for controlled studies and for the creation of homogeneous subgroups of patients based on clinical and genetic characteristics is emphasized. The application of molecular genetic investigations and pharmacogenetics in the diagnostic work-up of autistic patients can lead to more effective individualized medical care.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)

Can I use SSRI medication to manage repetitive behaviours in a child with a diagnosis of ASD?

Repetitive behaviours are a core diagnostic component of ASD and, consequently, commonly observed among individuals with autism of all ages. These behaviours can take different forms: broadly speaking, while for some they comprise 'functional' behaviours, such as the pursuit of interests, for others they may be less purposeful, such as ritualistic and repetitive motor behaviours. The decision to treat is fundamentally determined by the degree to which the behaviour impacts on wellbeing and/or the ability to develop other skills.

Treatment of repetitive behaviours will largely be from a psychological/behavioural perspective. In some circumstances, however, these may be ineffective, or otherwise difficult to implement; in such cases, medication may be considered. The Cochrane Review of 2013, which considered the use of SSRIs in the management of 'core' symptoms of ASD, found no evidence to support their use for ritualistic behaviours. A more recent systematic review similarly concluded that there is no evidence for the use of SSRI or other medications in the management of ritualistic behaviours.

This notwithstanding, when examining individual studies, there is certainly some evidence to suggest that certain SSRIs, guanfacine, risperidone- a D2, 5-HT2 and NE alpha-2 receptor antagonist and buspirone – a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist may be effective. Given these data, it may be reasonable to consider an SSRI when other non-pharmacological treatment options have failed given that these are used widely in clinical practice and so safety data are available, although some ASD clinical trials have raised the higher risk of side effects in this population (see; and references to individual studies therein). If SSRI are ineffective, or poorly tolerated, risperidone, guanfacine or buspirone may be considered as an alternative; however, particular caution is advised in relation to their use, which must be under specialist supervision.

At the outset it is essential that any trial of medication has (i) a clear titration schedule and (ii) well-defined outcome measures. It is important to bear in mind that medication may take several months to alleviate symptoms. In accordance with the Stopping The Over-Medication of children and young People (STOMP with a learning disability, autism or both) and Supporting Treatment and Appropriate Medication in Paediatrics (STAMP) frameworks, medication should be discontinued if it does not help, and, among responders, should be monitored and discontinued when appropriate.

### Navigating agitation in neurodevelopmental disorders: a comparative study of pharmacotherapies via network meta-analysis in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disabilities [^7e3ee6de]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Future research

To build upon the insights gained from this study, larger, multicentred Phase III trials are imperative to replicate findings obtained from the small, single-site and underpowered studies. Longitudinal studies are also essential to elucidate the long-term efficacy, treatment response with varying doses, and the side effects associated with these medications. Moreover, conducting head-to-head trials would provide more robust evidence compared to placebo controls. The efficacy of newer antipsychotics such as brexpiprazole and paliperidone remains minimally explored, despite their availability in injectable formulations that allow for convenient dosing, particularly for individuals with swallowing difficulties in NDs.

Seizures are a prevalent issue in NDs, and antiepileptic drugs like valproic acid play a role in managing seizures and reducing irritability. However, our review identified only two studies focusing on the efficacy of valproic acid. Therefore, exploring trials involving other antiepileptics could be beneficial, especially in cases where the side effect profile of antipsychotics is unsuitable or contraindicated.

Efforts to standardize outcome measures and trial durations in future RCTs would facilitate comparisons of findings across studies. Additionally, there is a pressing need for studies that delve deeper into refining our understanding of the pathophysiology of agitation and aggression in NDs and their treatment modalities. Emphasizing functional outcomes over symptom-based assessments and incorporating biological measures may provide more meaningful insights and complement clinical data. Lastly, more research focusing on special populations, such as older adults and individuals with concurrent disorders like anxiety, ADHD, psychosis and substance abuse comorbid with NDs, is warranted.

### Amygdala and hypothalamus: historical overview with focus on aggression [^f1fa4e8a]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

As impulsive aggression is often a symptom of associated disorders, first-line treatments are initially chosen to address the primary underlying conditions. As shown in Table 1, pharmacological treatment of aggressive behavior may involve the use of different classes of medications, such as typical and atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, alpha 2 agonists, mood stabilizers, and anticonvulsants.

Table 1.
Pharmacological Treatment of Aggressive Behavior

Typical antipsychotics include dopaminergic antagonists and are effective in treating psychotic patients, children with conduct disorders, and cognitively impaired individuals. Atypical antipsychotics, particularly risperidone and aripiprazole, act on multiple neurotransmitter systems (eg, antagonists of the DA and 5-HT2A receptors) and are effective in the patient populations described above. Their effectiveness is particularly notable in ASD patients for which they are FDA approved.

Antidepressants, primarily selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are effective in reducing irritability and aggressive behavior in patients with unipolar depression, Alzheimer's disease, autism, mental retardation, psychosis, PTSD, and personality disorders. Mood stabilizers, such as lithium, have been shown to be effective in individuals with intellectual disabilities and physical handicaps, children with conduct-disordered and explosive behavior, and bipolar patients with excessive irritability and outbursts of rage.

When patients fail to respond to an adequate dose and duration of a standard monotherapy, a high-dose monotherapy or a polypharmacy strategy may be used. These include the use of typical antipsychotics (2 or more), atypical antipsychotics (2 or more), or a combination of both classes of drugs. However, this type of polypharmacy can increase the burden of side effects, including sedation, akathisia, and dystonia.

Study characteristics

The majority of trials were conducted in two primary regions, namely the United States and Iran, comprising 16 and 11 studies, respectively. While these regions represent different healthcare systems and populations, the focus on these areas limits the broader generalizability of the findings to a truly global context. The average sample size across the studies was 66 participants, with notable variability indicated by a standard deviation of 45. This variability underscores the heterogeneity in study designs and participant demographics, reflecting the diverse nature of individuals with NDs and their responses to pharmacotherapy. Among the participants, 1629 received pharmacotherapy as part of an intervention to address agitation, highlighting the common practice of combining multiple interventions to meet the multifaceted needs of individuals with NDs.

The mean age of participants across the studies was 13.6 years, with a standard deviation of 10.8 years, indicating the inclusion of a wide age range from childhood to adolescence and young adulthood. This broad age representation is crucial for understanding the developmental aspects of pharmacotherapy response and long-term treatment outcomes. The median duration of treatment was 10 weeks, ranging from 3 to 112 weeks, indicating the varying lengths of intervention periods evaluated in the studies. This diversity in treatment duration allows for insights into both short-term and potentially longer-term effects of pharmacotherapies on agitation in individuals with NDs.

Risperidone emerged as the most frequently studied pharmacotherapy, with 21 trials evaluating its efficacy and tolerability. This emphasis on risperidone underscores its widespread use and clinical relevance in managing agitation in individuals with NDs. Aripiprazole and baclofen followed as the next most studied drugs, reflecting the interest in exploring alternative pharmacological approaches beyond traditional (dopamine type-2 receptor antagonist) antipsychotics.

The clinical focus of the studies predominantly revolved around individuals with ASD, comprising 31 studies, or ID, encompassing seven trials. This targeted approach ensures a specific focus on populations with distinct neurodevelopmental challenges, enabling tailored insights into the effectiveness of pharmacotherapies for agitation within these particular diagnostic categories.

### Long-term effects of risperidone in children with autism spectrum disorders: a placebo discontinuation study [^05ce30f8]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The short-term benefit of risperidone in ameliorating severe disruptive behavior in pediatric patients with autism spectrum disorders is well established; however, only one placebo-controlled, long-term study of efficacy is available.

Method

Thirty-six children with an autism spectrum disorder (5–17 years old) accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior, started 8-week open-label treatment with risperidone. Responders (n = 26) continued treatment for another 16 weeks, followed by a double-blind discontinuation (n = 24; two patients discontinued treatment because of weight gain) consisting of either 3 weeks of taper and 5 weeks of placebo only or continuing use of risperidone. Relapse was defined as a significant deterioration of symptoms based on clinical judgment and a parent questionnaire.

Results

Risperidone was superior to placebo in preventing relapse: this occurred in 3 of 12 patients continuing on risperidone versus 8 of 12 who switched to placebo (p = .049). Weight gain, increased appetite, anxiety, and fatigue were the most frequently reported side effects.

Conclusions

This study indicates the effectiveness of risperidone during a period of several months, reducing disruptive behavior in about half of the children with autism spectrum disorders. The results provide a rationale for the continuing use of risperidone beyond 6 months, although considerable weight gain can limit the use of this agent.

### The role of psychosocial therapies in managing aggression in children and adolescents [^0a68f473]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Aggression in children and adolescents is a serious problem and is associated with various psychiatric disorders, not just conduct and oppositional defiant disorders, but in fact, most psychiatric disorders. Currently, while a growing base of data supports an important role for pharmacologic treatments in managing aggression, studies have also shown that psychosocial therapy in conjunction with medication may be more effective in treating aggression than medication alone in many patients. According to recently published treatment guidelines on the management of aggression, psychosocial approaches should always be implemented first, with pharmacotherapy added later if necessary. This article details the risk factors and protective factors associated with aggression in children and adolescents, describes the evidence base for the use of psychosocial therapy for the management of aggression, and discusses various psychosocial therapy approaches that may be effective in treating aggressive children and adolescents.

### Atypical antipsychotics for autism spectrum disorder: a network meta-analysis [^78139f5d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit a wide variety of symptoms related to social interaction and behaviour. Atypical antipsychotics have been widely evaluated and prescribed to treat distressing symptoms (e.g. irritability, aggression, obsessions, repetitive behaviours, etc.) in children and adults with ASD. Still, their effects and relative efficacy remain unclear.

Objectives

Primary: to assess the comparative benefits of atypical antipsychotics for irritability through network meta-analyses in children and adults with ASD at short-term follow-up. Secondary: to assess the benefits and harms of atypical antipsychotics, compared to placebo or any other atypical antipsychotic, for different symptoms (e.g. aggression, obsessive-compulsive behaviours, inappropriate speech) and side effects (e.g. extrapyramidal symptoms, weight gain, metabolic side effects) in children and adults with ASD at short-, medium- and long-term follow-up.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, 10 other databases, and two trial registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify studies for inclusion. The latest search was 3 January 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any atypical antipsychotic drug with placebo or another atypical antipsychotic drug for adults and children with a clinical diagnosis of ASD.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes included irritability, aggression, weight gain, extrapyramidal side effects, obsessive-compulsive behaviours and inappropriate speech.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias in the included studies.

Synthesis Methods

We performed statistical analyses using a frequentist network meta-analysis for combined estimates for the outcome irritability and a random-effects model for pairwise comparisons for other outcomes. We rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Included Studies

We included 17 studies with 1027 randomised participants. One study evaluated adults (31 participants); the remaining 16 studies evaluated children (996 participants). The interventions were risperidone, aripiprazole, lurasidone and olanzapine.

Synthesis Of Results

Comparative efficacy on irritability Based on the network meta-analysis, risperidone and aripiprazole may reduce symptoms of irritability compared to placebo in the short term in children with ASD (risperidone: mean difference (MD) -7.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.37 to -6.42; 13 studies, 906 participants; low-certainty evidence; aripiprazole: MD -6.26, 95% CI -7.62 to -4.91; 13 studies, 906 participants; low-certainty evidence). Lurasidone probably results in little to no difference in irritability compared to placebo in the short term (MD -1.30, 95% CI -5.46 to 2.86; 13 studies, 906 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Efficacy and safety on other outcomes We are very uncertain about the effects of atypical antipsychotics on aggression compared to placebo at short-term follow-up in children with ASD (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.17; 1 study, 66 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence was very low due to concerns about risk of bias and serious imprecision. We are very uncertain about the effects of atypical antipsychotics on the occurrence of weight gain (above predefined levels) compared to placebo in the short term in children with ASD (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.25 to 4.60; 7 studies, 434 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also very uncertain about the effects of atypical antipsychotics on weight gain (in kilograms) compared to placebo in the short term in children with ASD (MD 1.22 kg, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.88; 3 studies, 297 participants; very low-certainty evidence). In both, the certainty of the evidence was very low due to concerns about risk of bias and serious imprecision. We are very uncertain about the effects of atypical antipsychotics on the occurrence of extrapyramidal side effects compared to placebo in the short term in children with ASD (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.22 to 4.59; 6 studies, 511 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence was very low due to concerns about risk of bias and serious imprecision. Atypical antipsychotics may improve obsessive-compulsive behaviours compared to placebo in the short term in children with ASD (MD -1.36, 95% CI -2.45 to -0.27; 5 studies, 467 participants; low-certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence was low due to concerns about risk of bias and heterogeneity. Atypical antipsychotics may reduce inappropriate speech compared to placebo in the short term in children with ASD (MD -1.44, 95% CI -2.11 to -0.77; 8 studies, 676 participants; low-certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence was low due to concerns about risk of bias and heterogeneity. We were unable to evaluate the effects of other atypical antipsychotics. Furthermore, our findings on adults with autism were scarce due to the lack of available studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Risperidone and aripiprazole may reduce symptoms of irritability compared to placebo in children with ASD in the short term, but lurasidone probably has little to no effect on irritability compared to placebo. Other benefits and potential harms observed ranged from moderate- to very low-certainty evidence. The available data did not allow comprehensive subgroup analyses. New randomised controlled trials with larger sample sizes are needed to balance the efficacy and safety of interventions with enough certainty, which are currently scarce (or even absent in the case of the adult population). Authors should report population and intervention characteristics transparently, providing disaggregated or individual patient data when possible. Furthermore, consistent measurement methods for each outcome should be reported to avoid problems during the data synthesis process.

### Identification and support of autistic individuals within the UK criminal justice system: a practical approach based upon professional consensus with input from lived experience [^ca122547]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Psychosocial support and risk interventions

Non-pharmacological support is typically delivered across disciplines such as psychology, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, education, nursing, social work and psychiatry. Characteristics commonly associated with autism (such as cognitive inflexibility, difficulties working in groups and differences in empathy) can present challenges to effective engagement and positive outcomes for non-pharmacological support and risk reduction programmes. From the authors' knowledge and experiences, access to appropriate psychosocial support varies greatly between services. 'Alexithymia' refers to difficulties experiencing, identifying and expressing emotions. Research indicates that 40 to 65% of autistic individuals are alexithymic (e.g.), which is likely to contribute to and/or exacerbate core socio-emotional difficulties in autism. Alexithymia may impact on the accessibility and effectiveness of standardised programmes (for example, when individuals are encouraged to identify, address and self-regulate unhelpful or intense emotions related to their offending).

There are no pharmacological interventions for the core features of autism. In cases of extreme aggression against the self or others, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend anti-psychotic medication. However, it should be noted that the purpose of such medications is to manage behavioural difficulties rather than treating core features of autism. Medication may be prescribed for co-occurring conditions such as anxiety, depression, psychosis and ADHD, and indeed this may be central to risk reduction and rehabilitation in some autistic individuals with an offending history.

To the authors' knowledge, there have been no empirical studies investigating the rates of reoffending or extensions to the length of stay for autistic individuals in secure settings. This gap in our knowledge places significant limitations on our ability to define and determine the effectiveness of targeted support and current care strategies for this potentially vulnerable population.

Purpose of this consensus

Understanding and meeting the needs of autistic individuals within the CJS is essential for their care, public protection and for professionals working in forensic clinical practice. In order to develop understanding, it is important to examine and synthesise what is currently known, and to generate a professional consensus with input from lived experience on good practice when working with autistic individuals within the CJS. Given the variability of individual needs and service provisions, it is beyond the scope of this paper to provide specific recommendations. However, this paper provides general recommendations across different levels of the UK CJS.

### Risperidone treatment of autistic disorder: longer-term benefits and blinded discontinuation after 6 months [^ad934df4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Risperidone is effective for short-term treatment of aggression, temper outbursts, and self-injurious behavior in children with autism. Because these behaviors may be chronic, there is a need to establish the efficacy and safety of longer-term treatment with this agent.

Method

The authors conducted a multisite, two-part study of risperidone in children ages 5 to 17 years with autism accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, and/or self-injurious behavior who showed a positive response in an earlier 8-week trial. Part I consisted of 4-month open-label treatment with risperidone, starting at the established optimal dose; part II was an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-substitution study of risperidone withdrawal. Primary outcome measures were the Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability subscale and the Clinical Global Impression improvement scale.

Results

Part I included 63 children. The mean risperidone dose was 1.96 mg/day at entry and remained stable over 16 weeks of open treatment. The change on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability subscale was small and clinically insignificant. Reasons for discontinuation of part I included loss of efficacy (N = 5) and adverse effects (N = 1). The subjects gained an average of 5.1 kg. Part II included 32 patients. The relapse rates were 62.5% for gradual placebo substitution and 12.5% for continued risperidone; this difference was statistically significant.

Conclusions

Risperidone showed persistent efficacy and good tolerability for intermediate-length treatment of children with autism characterized by tantrums, aggression, and/or self-injurious behavior. Discontinuation after 6 months was associated with a rapid return of disruptive and aggressive behavior in most subjects.

### Autism spectrum disorder and complementary-integrative medicine [^ff20d1b2]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 0.6%-1.7% of children. The etiology of autism is hypothesized to include both biological and environmental factors (Watts, 2008). In addition to the core symptoms of social-communication delay and restricted, repetitive interests, co-occurring irritability/aggression, hyperactivity, and insomnia negatively impact adaptive functioning and quality of life of patients and families. Despite years of effort, no pharmacologic agent has been found that targets the core symptoms of ASD. The only FDA-approved agents are risperidone and aripiprazole for agitation and irritability in ASD, not for core symptoms. Though they effectively reduce irritability/violence, they do so at the expense of problematic side effects: metabolic syndrome, elevated liver enzymes, and extrapyramidal side effects. Thus, it is not surprising that many families of children with ASD turn to nonallopathic treatment, including dietary interventions, vitamins, and immunomodulatory agents subsumed under complementary-integrative medicine (CIM). Per recent studies, 27% to 88% of families report using a CIM treatment. In an extensive population-based survey of CIM, families of children with more severe ASD, comorbid irritability, GI symptoms, food allergies, seizures, and higher parental education tend to use CIM at higher rates. The perceived safety of CIM treatments as "natural treatment" over allopathic medication increases parental comfort in using these agents. The most frequently used CIM treatments include multivitamins, an elimination diet, and Methyl B12 injections. Those perceived most effective are sensory integration, melatonin, and antifungals. Practitioners working with these families should improve their knowledge about CIM as parents currently perceive little interest in and poor knowledge of CIM by physicians. This article reviews the most popular complementary treatments preferred by families with children with autism. With many of them having limited or poor quality data, clinical recommendations about the efficacy and safety of each treatment are discussed using the SECS versus RUDE criteria.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^e389756c]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) interventions — goals, principles, and policy — the goals of treatment are to (1) minimize core deficits and co-occurring associated impairments, (2) maximize functional independence by facilitating learning and acquisition of adaptive skills, and (3) eliminate, minimize, or prevent problem behaviors that may interfere with functional skills. Treatments should be individualized, developmentally appropriate, and intensive, with performance data relevant to treatment goals to evaluate and adjust intervention, and all interventions should be based on sound theoretical constructs, rigorous methodologies, and objective scientific evidence of effectiveness. Legal mandates in education law require the use of practices supported by scientifically based research or evidence-based practices, and early intervention services under part C of IDEA provide for assessment and intervention for children younger than 3 years with developmental delays, including ASD.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^4a70f4e1]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder pharmacotherapy — lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and atomoxetine — shows limited benefit for anticonvulsants and symptom improvement with atomoxetine. In 28 children 3–11 y old, lamotrigine showed no significant difference in irritability or social behavior on multiple instruments with insomnia and hyperactivity. In 20 children 5–17 y old, levetiracetam showed no significant difference in global functioning or irritability with aggression. Atomoxetine HCl for hyperactivity/inattention in 97 children 6–17 y old showed a significant difference in the ADHD-RS for active treatment group; no difference in CGI with nausea, anorexia, fatigue, early wakening.

### Psychopharmacologic control of aggression and violence in children and adolescents [^9883b950]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Aggression in children and adolescents is commonly displayed in the community and is even more commonly seen in clinical settings. As symptoms of an underlying disorder, aggressive behaviors should be comprehensively evaluated, and developmental, medical, and substance-use disorders should be identified and treated. This article reviews the most common psychiatric conditions associated with aggression and suggests appropriate psychopharmacologic interventions. Tables with recommended agents for each psychiatric disorder, as well as dosing ranges for each agent, are included.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^bba55cb9]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Co-occurring anxiety is common among children and adolescents with ASD. A prospective study from 2021 demonstrated that 69% of youth with ASD had clinically significant anxiety, compared to 8% of typically developing children. The anxiety signs and symptoms observed among children with ASD were highly varied, both corresponding and contrasting with the specified anxiety disorders of the DSM. Fear of change, uncommon phobias, and social fears are all ASD-specific presentations of anxiety that can significantly impact daily functioning. Fear of change can manifest as distress or anxiety, especially when routines or familiar environments are disrupted. People with ASD may develop uncommon phobias of stimuli that are atypical compared to those seen in the general population (i.e. fears of toilets or specific songs). Social fears in ASD tend to pertain more to underlying social performance challenges rather than to interfering thoughts of others' negative perceptions, as observed in non-autistic social anxiety. This confusion can arise due to challenges in understanding social cues, norms, and expectations. Psychosocial factors that lead to challenges in relationship development and academic and vocational success may play a role in anxiety disorders among individuals with ASD. According to a meta-analysis, 39.6% of youth with ASD have at least one co-occurring anxiety disorder based on the DSM-IV criteria. Specific phobia (29%), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) (17.4%), and social anxiety disorder (16.6%) were the three most commonly observed anxiety disorders in ASD youth. Anxiety levels are positively associated with ASD severity, and severe anxiety in ASD youth has also been associated with aggression, decreased participation in social activities, and poor social relationships.

### Autism spectrum disorder: consensus guidelines on assessment, treatment and research from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^d39b4c6a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

An expert review of the aetiology, assessment, and treatment of autism spectrum disorder, and recommendations for diagnosis, management and service provision was coordinated by the British Association for Psychopharmacology, and evidence graded. The aetiology of autism spectrum disorder involves genetic and environmental contributions, and implicates a number of brain systems, in particular the gamma-aminobutyric acid, serotonergic and glutamatergic systems. The presentation of autism spectrum disorder varies widely and co-occurring health problems (in particular epilepsy, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and irritability) are common. We did not recommend the routine use of any pharmacological treatment for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. In children, melatonin may be useful to treat sleep problems, dopamine blockers for irritability, and methylphenidate, atomoxetine and guanfacine for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The evidence for use of medication in adults is limited and recommendations are largely based on extrapolations from studies in children and patients without autism spectrum disorder. We discuss the conditions for considering and evaluating a trial of medication treatment, when non-pharmacological interventions should be considered, and make recommendations on service delivery. Finally, we identify key gaps and limitations in the current evidence base and make recommendations for future research and the design of clinical trials.

### Treatment of maladaptive aggression in youth: CERT guidelines II. treatments and ongoing management [^fb0719eb]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop guidelines for management and treatment of maladaptive aggression in youth in the areas of psychosocial interventions, medication treatments, and side-effect management.

Methods

Evidence was assembled and evaluated in a multistep process, including systematic reviews of published literature; an expert survey of recommended practices; a consensus conference of researchers, policymakers, clinicians, and family advocates; and review by the steering committee of successive drafts of the recommendations. The Center for Education and Research on Mental Health Therapeutics Treatment of Maladaptive Aggression in Youth guidelines reflect a synthesis of the available evidence, based on this multistep process.

Results

This article describes the content, rationale, and evidence for 11 recommendations. Key treatment principles include considering psychosocial interventions, such as evidence-based parent and child skills training as the first line of treatment; targeting the underlying disorder first following evidence-based guidelines; considering individual psychosocial and medical factors, including cardiovascular risk in the selection of agents if medication treatment (ideally with the best evidence base) is initiated; avoiding the use of multiple psychotropic medications simultaneously; and careful monitoring of treatment response, by using structured rating scales, as well as close medical monitoring for side effects, including metabolic changes.

Conclusions

Treatment of children with maladaptive aggression is a "moving target" requiring ongoing assimilation of new evidence as it emerges. Based on the existing evidence, the Treatment of Maladaptive Aggression in Youth guidelines provide a framework for management of maladaptive aggression in youth, appropriate for use by primary care clinicians and mental health providers.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^f800a799]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum comorbidity with obsessive-compulsive disorder — repetitive thoughts and behaviors are common in children and adults with autism or Asperger's syndrome, and one study reported that about 20% of OCD patients have autistic traits. SRIs have been effective for autism-associated repetitive thoughts and behaviors; in two studies with autistic children, clomipramine was more effective than either desipramine or placebo in reducing repetitive and compulsive behaviors, and one controlled study found fluvoxamine to be significantly better than placebo for decreasing repetitive behavior and aggression in adults with autistic disorder. In a randomized controlled trial in children with Asperger's syndrome, CBT reduced obsessive-compulsive symptoms and other forms of anxiety.

### Autism spectrum disorder: primary care principles [^cc713bbe]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by difficulty with social communication and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interest, or activities. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., created an umbrella diagnosis that includes several previously separate conditions: autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening for autism spectrum disorder in children 18 to 30 months of age in whom the disorder is not suspected; however, there is a growing body of evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention based on applied behavior analysis improves cognitive ability, language, and adaptive skills. Therefore, early identification of autism spectrum disorder is important, and experts recommend the use of a validated screening tool at 18- and 24-month well-child visits. Medications can be used as adjunctive treatment for maladaptive behaviors and comorbid psychiatric conditions, but there is no single medical therapy that is effective for all symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. Prognosis is heavily affected by the severity of diagnosis and the presence of intellectual disability. Children with optimal outcomes receive earlier, more intensive behavioral interventions and less pharmacologic treatment.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^961aa976]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder pharmacotherapy — risperidone trials in children/adolescents — report efficacy with notable adverse effects. In 79 children 5–12 y old, there was 64% improvement in ABC Irritability subscale on risperidone vs. 31% improvement on placebo; significant positive finding for hyperactivity with weight gain and somnolence. In 101 children 5–17 y old, risperidone produced significant response for repetitive behavior and stereotypy on risperidone with weight gain, increased appetite, fatigue, drowsiness, drooling, and dizziness. In Risperidone vs. haloperidol among 30 children 8–18 y old, risperidone reported superior to haloperidol only on ABC total score, no subscales reported with EPS, weight gain, and gynecomastia.

### Executive summary: identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder… [^e0a58f2b]. publications.aap.org (2020). Medium credibility.

o Early and effective intervention: Clinicians should respond appropriately to family or clinical concerns and results of screening to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment. Intervention for the communicative, adaptive, and behavioral deficits associated with ASD should take place as soon as the need becomes evident. Intervention is most effective if it is early, intense, and involves the family. Research has demonstrated that interventions using principles of behavioral intervention are associated with skill acquisition and improved outcome. There is evidence that training parents to support developmental skill building is helpful. Primary care providers should help families learn to interpret evidence about interventions so they can make informed decisions about their child's care. Many interventions, including many nutritional interventions, do not have evidence to support their use at this time.

Families should be referred to community support resources and be included in the shared decision-making process.
2. **Collaboration of Systems of Care o Evidence-based interventions**: Children and youth with ASD should be provided evidence-based interventions to address the core social communication and interaction and restricted and repetitive behavior symptoms as well as associated impairments. Attention to social skills development should be addressed in school, community, behavioral health, and family settings. The primary care provider should be aware of the recommendation for educational services in the least-restrictive environment and the hierarchy of educational interventions based on a student's needs in school rather than a medical diagnosis of ASD.

o Behavioral health interventions: Providers should be aware of the common behavioral challenges faced by children and youth with ASD and be prepared to provide parent counseling and initial management of sleep problems, food refusal, and disruptive behaviors, with referral to appropriate specialty and mental health care if needed. It is important to evaluate the medical and behavioral causes for behavior change. Pain and discomfort from medical conditions and behavioral modifications should be addressed. Medication may be a useful addition for management of attention, hyperactivity, anxiety, and disruptive behaviors as part of an overall treatment strategy. Actively addressing capacity building to care for children and youth with ASD requires initiatives directed at provider education and practice quality improvement and public health, educational, and social programs to support families in their journey from diagnosis to service provision to the transition to adult care.

o basic and translational science in the areas of genetics and epigenetics, neurobiology, environmental risk factors, and psychopharmacology to understand the typical and atypical brain development and function to develop ASD-specific behavioral and pharmacologic therapies; o clinical trials to test focused interventions informed by translational studies to provide the evidence necessary for community implementation;.

### Evaluation and management of children with acute mental health or behavioral problems. part II: recognition of clinically challenging mental health related conditions presenting with medical or uncertain symptoms [^8df1e252]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum and developmental disorders (ASD-DD) — evidence base and care resources for ED care emphasize limited proven therapies and multidisciplinary, family-guided support. Three evidence-based reviews of this topic conclude that there is adequate evidence for only a limited number of therapies (eg, pharmacotherapy), although several other strategies show promise (eg, early and intensive behavioral therapy, social skills training, and visual communication systems). Given these limitations, the strategies discussed below are based primarily on expert, consensus opinion. A wide range of ED health professionals can champion, organize, design, and coordinate ASD-sensitive ED care, including physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, social workers, and child life specialists, and non-ED professionals who may be helpful include developmental–behavioral pediatricians, child psychologists and psychiatrists, special education teachers, speech–language therapists, and occupational therapists. Often, the most important ASD-DD "experts" to consult are the child's parents, who know what strategies work with their children and can be "interpreters" for ED clinicians; spending some time asking parents about their child is likely to be a productive, efficient method for tailoring effective ED care for these patients.

### Navigating agitation in neurodevelopmental disorders: a comparative study of pharmacotherapies via network meta-analysis in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disabilities [^d867b43e]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our review underscores the efficacy of various pharmacotherapies such as arbaclofen, risperidone with buspirone, omega 3s, risperidone with palmitoylethanolamide, aripiprazole and risperidone in managing agitation in NDs. These interventions showed favourable response rates without a significant increase in dropouts compared to placebo. However, the limited strength of evidence for most agents calls for additional high-quality RCTs to establish a definitive treatment hierarchy. Future research should focus on larger multicenter trials, longitudinal studies, and head-to-head comparisons to validate and build upon our findings. Standardizing outcome measures, exploring newer antipsychotics and investigating the role of antiepileptics like valproic acid are also critical areas for further investigation. Addressing these gaps will enhance treatment options and improve outcomes for individuals with NDs.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^b5f14174]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder — psychopharmacologic approaches to management: Large national insurance-claims studies report psychopharmacology prescription rates for patients with ASD of 56% to 65%, with one or more psychotropic medications prescribed for 1% of children with ASD younger than 3 years, for 10% to 11% of children aged 3 to 5 years, for 38% to 46% of children aged 6 to 11 years, and for 64% to 67% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Reported polypharmacy rates range from 12% in a registry cohort recruited from diagnostic clinics to 29% to 35% in large studies of Medicaid claims data, and psychotropic medication use increases with increased age, lower range of cognitive skills and/or presence of intellectual disability, and higher prevalence levels of challenging behavior or coexisting psychiatric diagnoses; prescription of medication also appears to be affected by demographic factors, such as race, ethnicity, and geography. Clinicians should carefully weigh potential risks and benefits before prescribing medication for behavior and use psychotropic medications as part of a comprehensive treatment approach, and the prescribing clinician should understand the indications and contraindications, dosing, potential adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, and monitoring requirements. Prescribers should consider CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 metabolizer status in making medication decisions for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), despite limited data at present to guide practice; the limited data on the utility of pharmacogenomic testing limits insurance coverage for many plans, and recommendations for testing are expected to rapidly change with ongoing research.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^95753af3]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In the guidelines presented herein, experts in the field were asked to combine their years of highly specialized ASD medication management experience with findings from updated scientific literature reviews to educate all providers on specialty prescribing guidelines. Common co-occurring symptom domains were discussed, with ASD-specific prescribing recommendations and clinical considerations for each problem. The ambiguity of which patients to treat "in-house" was addressed by discussing specific thresholds of when to refer out to specialists.

It is important to recognize the limitations of these clinical guidelines. Our findings are based on the consensus among prescribers from a single site, many of whom have received similar clinical training or have mentored one another, thereby limiting the breadth of perspectives included in this study. Additionally, because we are a highly specialized ASD clinic, there may be a bias in the patient population that our providers have experience working with. Furthermore, due to the necessity of maintaining a manageable scope, this manuscript primarily focuses on psychopharmacology and does not encompass the extensive realm of behavioral and therapeutic treatment approaches which are a critical aspect of the treatment landscape. Our recommendations also do not encompass considerations of the additionally complex and unique needs of individuals with ASD and a co-occurring genetic disorder such as Rett Syndrome or Fragile X syndrome. In the future, we hope to adapt the content of this paper into educational materials and in doing so, would love to connect with outside experts in the field, to add to the diversity of perspectives and potentially incorporate a wider variety of treatment approaches.

### Consensus report on impulsive aggression as a symptom across diagnostic categories in child psychiatry: implications for medication studies [^63c8266d]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether impulsive aggression (IA) is a meaningful clinical construct and to ascertain whether it is sufficiently similar across diagnostic categories, such that parallel studies across disorders might constitute appropriate evidence for pursuing indications. If so, how should IA be assessed, pharmacological studies designed, and ethical issues addressed?

Method

Experts from key stakeholder communities, including academic clinicians, researchers, practicing clinicians, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, National Institute of Mental Health, industry sponsors, and patient and family advocates, met for a 2-day consensus conference on November 4 and 5, 2004. After evaluating summary presentations on current research evidence, participants were assigned to three workgroups, examined core issues, and generated consensus guidelines in their areas. Workgroup recommendations were discussed by the whole group to reach consensus, and then further iterated and condensed into this report postconference by the authors.

Results

Conference participants agreed that IA is a substantial public health and clinical concern, constitutes a key therapeutic target across multiple disorders, and can be measured with sufficient precision that pharmacological studies are warranted. Additional areas of consensus concerned types of measures, optimal study designs, and ethical imperatives.

Conclusion

Derived from scientific evidence and clinical experience, these consensus-driven recommendations can guide the design of future studies.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^2cf3703c]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Viloxazine received FDA approval for ADHD in children and adolescents in the general population in 2021. Currently, there are no published studies evaluating viloxazine in the management of ADHD symptoms in patients with ASD.

Both atomoxetine and viloxazine carry FDA black box warnings about the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults who are treated with antidepressants.

Atomoxetine is available in 10 mg, 18 mg, 25 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, 80 mg, and 100 mg capsules. For patients weighing ≤ 70 kg, the suggested starting dose is 0.5 mg/kg/day, administered once daily. After a week, the medication can be titrated to 1.2 mg/kg/day, usually divided into two daily doses. For patients in this weight class, we typically begin 10 mg daily, titrating by that amount every week or two as indicated. For patients > 70 kg, we recommend starting at 18 mg daily and increasing to 25 mg or 36 mg daily after one week. After two to three weeks, the dose can be titrated to 80 mg/day. The recommended maximum daily dose is 1.4 mg/kg/day, up to a total of 100 mg/day.

Viloxazine is available in 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg capsules. The starting dose for children ages 6 to 11 years is 100 mg daily. The dose can be titrated by 100 mg weekly until reaching a maximum of 400 mg/day. Older children and adolescents can start at 200 mg daily and increase after one week to 400 mg/day. For adult patients, the starting dose is 200 mg daily, and the maximum dose is 600 mg/day.

Some patients with ASD and significant inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity may not respond to typical ADHD medications. For these challenging cases, cautious use of atypical antipsychotics may be appropriate, particularly if they are targeting additional symptoms like irritability or behavioral dysregulation.

See Fig. 2 for pharmacological approaches to the treatment of ADHD in individuals with ASD.

### Navigating agitation in neurodevelopmental disorders: a comparative study of pharmacotherapies via network meta-analysis in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disabilities [^62b7d971]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of evidence

This review presents a comprehensive evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of pharmacotherapies in managing agitation within the context of NDs. We identified and analysed 38 trials meeting our eligibility criteria, with a collective sample size of 2503 participants and an average age of 13.6 years. The trials were primarily conducted in the United States and Iran, focusing predominantly on ASD. Risperidone emerged as the most frequently studied drug, followed by aripiprazole and baclofen. Notably, several pharmacotherapies, including arbaclofen, risperidone plus buspirone, omega 3s, risperidone plus palmitoylethanolamide, aripiprazole and risperidone, exhibited superior efficacy compared to placebo, with summary relative risks for treatment response ranging from 2.76 to 12.10.

Additionally, while none of the investigated therapies showed a significant increase in all-cause dropouts compared to placebo, it is important to note that all-cause dropout rates can be influenced by a variety of factors unrelated to the tolerability of the medication itself. Therefore, while the lack of a significant increase in all-cause dropouts suggests a favourable tolerability profile, this measure alone may not fully capture the complexity of treatment adherence and patient experience. In particular, certain medications did show higher dropout rates due to adverse events, which we have acknowledged and discussed in the context of their overall risk–benefit profile for managing agitation in individuals with ID and ASD.
