## Question

What are the causes of paralysis following surgery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of paralysis following surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and scope across central, peripheral, and neuromuscular junction levels. Then, I should categorize primary mechanisms of injury and map them to exemplar surgeries and incidences. Next, I will review patient susceptibility and equipment-related contributors. After that, I need to examine diagnostic blind spots and monitoring limitations. Finally, I will synthesize prevention and early recognition strategies into a pragmatic approach for clinicians at the bedside.

> Let me first confirm the problem definition and epidemiology. Postoperative paralysis ranges from focal mononeuropathies to segmental motor deficits and central injuries, and it may also reflect pharmacologic neuromuscular blockade; incidence varies from rare ulnar neuropathy after anesthesia at about 1 in 14,733 to more frequent segmental motor paralysis after anterior cervical procedures reported around 6.9%, underscoring the heterogeneity in mechanism and context [^113wJgGJ] [^116Pn437] [^113moESd].

> Now, I will examine positioning-related mechanical compression and stretch. Wait, let me verify the most implicated nerves: the brachial plexus is classically vulnerable to malpositioning and shoulder abduction/extension during spine cases, and ulnar neuropathy arises from compression at the cubital tunnel with arm pronation or insufficient padding; improvements in positioning and padding have likely driven down incidence over time, but risk persists in long cases or in patients with pre-existing vulnerability [^1164sRL1] [^113wJgGJ] [^114PWmse].

> Next, I should review direct surgical trauma and retraction injury. Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy after anterior cervical spine surgery is well described and mechanistically linked to endotracheal cuff–laryngeal wall interactions exacerbated by retractor placement; mitigation by cuff-pressure management during retractor manipulation is reasonable, though not foolproof [^113vGEEd]. I need to consider other procedure-specific patterns: C5 nerve root palsy after cervical decompression, often delayed, with variable incidence and generally favorable recovery but potentially severe deficits in a subset; intercostal nerve injury causing rectus abdominis paralysis after thoracic surgery; and vocal fold paralysis after cardiovascular surgery, typically neuropraxic with recovery usually evident within 6–12 months [^112tE2Xo] [^114qnjxs] [^11318VSV] [^114m7ogX].

> I will now examine ischemic and vascular mechanisms. Hold on, I should verify which perioperative factors matter most: hypotension, hypothermia, and venous congestion may predispose peripheral nerves to ischemic injury, while complex aortic procedures can risk central ischemic complications including spinal cord injury or stroke, albeit variably and influenced by surgical technique and patient factors; neuraxial hematoma in the context of anticoagulation and epidural or spinal procedures is a critical, time-sensitive cause of permanent paralysis if not rapidly recognized and decompressed [^115cjj89] [^113moESd] [^117LZWoE].

> Let me consider pharmacologic causes: residual neuromuscular blockade is common and often under-recognized. Residual paralysis upon PACU arrival occurs in 20–60% when nondepolarizing agents are used, with clinically important risks of upper airway obstruction, hypoxemia, and aspiration when TOF ratio is below 0.9; quantitative monitoring and appropriate reversal reduce risk, but even sugammadex does not fully eliminate residual block if extubation decisions are not guided by objective measurements [^116fuZmA] [^114EyQWs] [^114ahg4g]. I should confirm the role of reversal agents: neostigmine improves recovery when true block persists but can paradoxically worsen airway muscle function if given after full recovery, reinforcing that quantitative monitoring to TOFR ≥ 0.9–1.0 is essential for safe extubation decisions [^113Xs6em] [^113PS7ky] [^115bE32c].

> But wait, what about inflammatory and immune-mediated processes? Postsurgical Guillain-Barré syndrome, although rare, can present days to weeks after surgery with progressive, areflexic weakness requiring urgent immunotherapy; concurrently, the global surgical stress response alters neuroimmune and metabolic pathways and may modulate neurologic vulnerability, though causation is complex and multifactorial [^114zciJk] [^116jj5DS].

> Next, I should review patient-specific susceptibility. I need to ensure I correctly identify pre-existing subclinical neuropathy, which is surprisingly common and detectable by bilateral conduction studies; diabetes increases the severity of postoperative vocal cord paralysis; older age, male sex, and higher BMI increase the risk of segmental motor palsy after anterior cervical surgery; and longer disease duration in thoracic OPLL is associated with postoperative neurologic deterioration, all of which should inform consent and risk mitigation [^1131gWYq] [^117GeLmi] [^116Pn437] [^11133UEu] [^113wJgGJ].

> Hold on, I should verify equipment-associated injuries. Blood pressure cuffs, tourniquets, and even misplaced stimulating electrodes can compress nerves; endotracheal tube cuff overinflation or retractor-cuff interactions can contribute to RLN palsy; recognizing these modifiable contributors is essential in any root-cause analysis of postoperative deficits [^115cjj89] [^111Gj7V9] [^113vGEEd] [^113VPW5d].

> I will now examine diagnostic blind spots and monitoring limitations. Hmm, wait a minute, relying on somatosensory evoked potentials alone can miss motor pathway injuries; combining SSEP with motor evoked potentials provides a more complete picture during cervical procedures, yet even multimodal monitoring cannot eliminate risk entirely; similarly, qualitative tactile train-of-four assessment often misses low-level residual block, favoring quantitative acceleromyography for safer extubation thresholds [^111KQvRu] [^114qnjxs] [^114ahg4g].

> Let me correlate mechanisms with specific procedures and signals of incidence to avoid overgeneralization. Cervical spine operations carry a distinct risk of C5 palsy with delayed onset and variable severity; thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic work can yield cranial nerve deficits like vocal fold paralysis and, less commonly, central motor deficits depending on perfusion strategies; thoracic oncology procedures may rarely produce intercostal motor deficits manifesting as rectus abdominis paralysis; and across general anesthesia, residual neuromuscular weakness remains prevalent without quantitative monitoring and thoughtful reversal strategy [^112tE2Xo] [^114FGJ63] [^11318VSV] [^116fuZmA].

> Now, I need to lay out prevention strategies while sanity-checking each step. For spine surgery, a multimodal intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring approach (SSEP plus MEP) improves detection of emerging injury; meticulous positioning in an anatomically neutral alignment with systematic padding and periodic checks reduces compression neuropathies; quantitative neuromuscular monitoring with agent-specific reversal to achieve TOFR ≥ 0.9–1.0 at extubation decreases residual paralysis; and in anterior cervical approaches, managing endotracheal cuff pressure during retractor manipulation appears to mitigate RLN risk, although technique and vigilance remain key [^114qnjxs] [^113wJgGJ] [^114PWmse] [^114EyQWs] [^113PS7ky] [^114ahg4g] [^113vGEEd]. I should also confirm anticoagulation–neuraxial considerations and tourniquet stewardship as core elements of neuroprotection intraoperatively, particularly given the catastrophic nature of neuraxial hematoma and the dose–time relationship with tourniquet neuropathy [^117LZWoE] [^111Gj7V9].

> Next, I should review an immediate diagnostic pathway when postoperative paralysis is detected. Let me first confirm whether a direct, remediable surgical cause exists, especially in new motor deficits, since prompt re-exploration can be limb- or life-saving; if a compressive hematoma is suspected clinically, early imaging with ultrasound or MRI is appropriate; for suspected ulnar neuropathy without clear operative causation, early outpatient-directed management and timely referrals are reasonable while avoiding false reassurance from very early electrodiagnostics before Wallerian changes appear, and bilateral studies can unmask occult predisposition [^1114pvDt] [^1131gWYq]. I need to ensure I do not overlook neuraxial hematoma in anticoagulated patients with epidurals, as delayed recognition risks permanent paralysis and mandates immediate escalation and decompression considerations [^117LZWoE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about reported vocal cord paralysis rates across all aortic surgeries. I initially considered rates as high as roughly a third, but wait, I should verify the population: a prospective pediatric thoracic cohort demonstrated high postoperative VCP incidence after RLN-risk procedures, whereas adult aortic arch and descending thoracic series show variable rates with specific surgical predictors such as distal arch involvement and proximity to the left subclavian anastomosis; technique refinements like open stent-grafts may lower risk, so context and anatomy matter greatly when counseling patients [^115gsofi] [^114FGJ63] [^113DbXVd].

> Let me synthesize a practical causal framework to guide bedside reasoning. Postoperative paralysis most often emerges from the intersection of three domains: surgical and positioning factors that compress, stretch, or transect nerves or compromise cord perfusion; anesthetic and pharmacologic contributors including residual neuromuscular blockade and neuraxial hematoma risk in anticoagulated patients; and host or inflammatory factors such as subclinical neuropathy, metabolic disease, and rare post-surgical autoimmune neuropathies like GBS, each with distinct time courses and diagnostic/monitoring implications; anchoring recognition and prevention priorities to these domains is the most reliable way to reduce harm and expedite recovery [^113moESd] [^116fuZmA] [^117LZWoE] [^114zciJk] [^112tE2Xo].

Post-surgery paralysis arises from multiple mechanisms, including **direct nerve trauma** (transection, stretch, compression), **ischemic injury** (hypotension, vascular compromise) [^113moESd], and **residual neuromuscular blockade** (incomplete reversal of muscle relaxants) [^114EyQWs]. Additional causes include **spinal cord injury** from hematoma or infarction [^117LZWoE], inflammatory neuropathies (e.g. Guillain-Barré) [^114zciJk], and positioning-related nerve compression (e.g. ulnar [^113wJgGJ] or brachial plexus injury) [^1164sRL1]. Risk factors include prolonged surgery, hypotension, anticoagulation, and pre-existing neuropathy [^113moESd] [^113iEH37]. Prevention focuses on meticulous surgical technique [^113moESd], careful positioning, intraoperative neuromonitoring [^114qnjxs], and vigilant reversal and monitoring of neuromuscular blockade [^114EyQWs].

---

## Direct nerve trauma

- **Transection or laceration**: Accidental cutting of nerves during surgery can cause immediate paralysis [^113moESd].

- **Stretch or traction injury**: Excessive stretching or traction during surgical manipulation can damage nerves, leading to temporary or permanent paralysis [^117XTGFQ].

- **Compression injury**: Surgical instruments, retractors, or hematomas can compress nerves, causing ischemia and subsequent paralysis [^112tVAeg].

---

## Ischemic injury

Prolonged intraoperative hypotension or accidental ligation/occlusion of vessels supplying the nerves or spinal cord reduces perfusion, causing **ischemic injury and paralysis** [^111Gj7V9].

---

## Residual neuromuscular blockade

Residual paralysis can occur if **neuromuscular blocking agents** are not adequately reversed [^114EyQWs], leading to postoperative respiratory complications and muscle weakness [^114EyQWs] [^114cczZn].

---

## Spinal cord injury

- **Direct trauma**: Surgical procedures involving the spine or spinal cord can cause direct injury, resulting in paralysis [^113moESd].

- **Epidural or spinal hematoma**: Accumulation of blood in the epidural or spinal space can compress the spinal cord, causing paralysis [^117LZWoE].

- **Spinal cord infarction**: Interruption of blood supply to the spinal cord can cause infarction and subsequent paralysis [^113moESd].

---

## Inflammatory neuropathies

Inflammatory neuropathies are rare postoperative causes of paralysis; surgery can trigger conditions such as **Guillain-Barré syndrome** [^114zciJk], leading to acute paralysis.

---

## Positioning-related nerve injuries

Positioning-related nerve injuries result from improper intraoperative positioning [^114PWmse], including **ulnar nerve compression** causing postoperative ulnar neuropathy and paralysis [^113wJgGJ] or **brachial plexus injury** during spinal surgery leading to upper limb paralysis [^1164sRL1].

---

## Risk factors for postoperative paralysis

Risk factors for postoperative paralysis include prolonged surgery, **intraoperative hypotension**, **anticoagulation** (which increases the risk of epidural or spinal hematoma), and **pre-existing neuropathy** (which heightens susceptibility to perioperative nerve injury) [^113moESd] [^117LZWoE].

---

## Preventive measures

- **Meticulous surgical technique**: Careful dissection and avoidance of excessive traction or compression of nerves [^113moESd].

- **Intraoperative neuromonitoring**: Use of somatosensory and motor evoked potentials to detect and prevent nerve injury [^114qnjxs].

- **Proper patient positioning**: Ensuring anatomically neutral positions and adequate padding to prevent nerve compression [^113wJgGJ].

- **Adequate reversal of neuromuscular blockade**: Ensuring complete reversal of muscle relaxants before extubation [^114EyQWs].

---

Post-surgery paralysis can result from direct nerve trauma, ischemic injury, **residual neuromuscular blockade**, spinal cord injury, inflammatory neuropathies, and positioning-related nerve injuries. Prevention involves meticulous surgical technique, intraoperative neuromonitoring, proper patient positioning, and adequate reversal of neuromuscular blockade.

### Rocuronium [^114EyQWs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Rocuronium bromide has no known effect on consciousness, pain threshold, or cerebration. Therefore, its administration must be accompanied by adequate anesthesia or sedation.

- **Residual paralysis**: In order to prevent complications resulting from residual paralysis, it is recommended to extubate only after the patient has recovered sufficiently from neuromuscular block. Geriatric patients (65 years or older) may be at increased risk for residual neuromuscular block. Other factors which could cause residual paralysis after extubation in the post-operative phase (such as drug interactions or patient condition) should also be considered. If not used as part of standard clinical practice, the use of a reversal agent should be considered, especially in those cases where residual paralysis is more likely to occur.

- **Long-term use in an intensive care unit**: Rocuronium bromide has not been studied for long-term use in the intensive care unit (ICU). As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs, apparent tolerance to rocuronium bromide may develop during chronic administration in the ICU. While the mechanism for development of this resistance is not known, receptor up-regulation may be a contributing factor. It is strongly recommended that neuromuscular transmission be monitored continuously during administration and recovery with the help of a nerve stimulator. Additional doses of rocuronium bromide or any other neuromuscular blocking agent should not be given until there is a definite response (one twitch of the train-of-four).

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: A systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^113wJgGJ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

Postoperative ulnar neuropathy (PUN) is an injury manifesting in the sensory or motor distribution of the ulnar nerve after anesthesia or surgery. The condition frequently features in cases of alleged clinical negligence by anesthetists. We performed a systematic review and applied narrative synthesis with the aim of summarizing understanding of the condition and deriving implications for practice and research.

- **Methods**: Electronic databases were searched up to October 2022 for primary research, secondary research, or opinion pieces defining PUN and describing its incidence, predisposing factors, mechanism of injury, clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and prevention.

- **Results**: We included 83 articles in the thematic analysis. PUN occurs after approximately 1 in 14,733 anesthetics. Men aged 50–75 years with pre-existing ulnar neuropathy are at highest risk. Preventative measures, based on consensus and expert opinion, are summarized, and an algorithm of suspected PUN management is proposed based upon the identified literature.

- **Conclusions**: Postoperative ulnar neuropathy is rare, and the incidence is probably decreasing over time with general improvements in perioperative care. Recommendations to reduce the risk of postoperative ulnar neuropathy are based on low-quality evidence but include anatomically neutral arm positioning and padding intraoperatively. In selected high-risk patients, further documentation of repositioning, intermittent checks, and neurological examination in the recovery room can be helpful.

### Post-traumatic (and postsurgical) Guillain-Barré syndrome: A rare, but treatable entity [^114zciJk]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, monophasic, polyradiculoneuropathy usually provoked by a preceding infection. The cardinal features are progressive weakness in the upper and lower limbs accompanied by loss of deep tendon reflexes. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical history and examination findings, supported by typical cerebrospinal fluid and electrophysiology findings. Trauma and surgery are well-understood but rare precipitants of GBS, which clinicians should be aware of in order not to miss an opportunity to use immunomodulatory therapies. Furthermore, the presence of postsurgical or post-traumatic GBS should prompt careful assessment for underlying malignancy or autoimmune disease associated with an acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. Here, we present a case of post-traumatic GBS and discuss the potential mechanisms that might underlie this, as well as the investigations and treatment that should be considered.

### Long-term results of diaphragmatic plication in adults with unilateral diaphragm paralysis [^115mXwCJ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Careful evaluation of the disease is obligatory prior to surgical correction to differentiate other possible reasons that may lead to respiratory symptoms. Following the diagnosis of diaphragm paralysis, surgical treatment is indicated after excluding parenchymal lung disease, chronic heart failure, and neoplastic etiology, and if pulmonary symptoms still persist in spite of treatment for lung infections, physical therapy, and body weight control. Patients should be selected properly for plication surgery to prevent unnecessary operations. Exertional dyspnea severe enough to impair simple daily activity is the most common indication for surgery. However, the timing of surgery is still debated. Some authors recommend plication following a period of 3–6 months, while others recommend a longer waiting period, anticipating the potential for spontaneous recovery, especially in diaphragm paralysis due to cardiac surgery. Summerhill et al. reported that 11 of 16 patients (69%) functionally recovered from diaphragmatic paralysis, and the time for spontaneous recovery ranged from 5 to 25 months (mean 14.9 ± 6.1 months). Mouroux et al. suggested waiting 18–24 months before the plication surgery for diaphragm paralysis and eventration, although this is not an objective criterion.

The mean time to plication was 32.9 months in our series. This relatively long duration was due to the late diagnosis and late referral of most patients to our clinic rather than a long waiting period for surgery.

According to our clinical experience, the waiting period should be at least 12 months depending on the etiology of paralysis.

### The story of enhancing recovery after surgery [^116jj5DS]. Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

The multimodal approach to controlling postoperative pathophysiology and rehabilitation emphasizes understanding and managing the surgical stress response. Major surgery is still associated with undesirable sequelae such as pain, cardiopulmonary, infective and thromboembolic complications, cerebral dysfunction, nausea and gastrointestinal paralysis, fatigue, and prolonged convalescence. The key pathogenic factor in postoperative morbidity, excluding failures of surgical and anesthetic techniques, is the surgical stress response, which subsequently increases demands on organ function.

These changes in organ function are thought to be mediated by trauma-induced endocrine metabolic changes and the activation of several biological cascade systems such as cytokines, complement, arachidonic acid metabolites, nitric oxide, and free oxygen radicals, among others. To understand postoperative morbidity, it is necessary to comprehend the pathophysiological role of the various components of the surgical stress response and to determine whether modifying such responses may improve surgical outcomes. While no single technique or drug regimen has been shown to eliminate postoperative morbidity and mortality, multimodal interventions may lead to a major reduction in the undesirable sequelae of surgical injury, improved recovery, and reduction in postoperative morbidity and overall costs.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: A systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^115cjj89]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

Certain perioperative conditions increase the susceptibility of the ulnar nerve to ischaemic damage, including hypothermia and hypotension. Analysis of individual cases of postoperative ulnar neuropathy (PUN) usually cannot identify with certainty a specific causative link between a single pre- or intraoperative clinical circumstance and subsequent presentation with neuropathy.

By way of illustration, a published case series of eight patients developing ulnar neuropathy after renal transplantation at a single centre over a short period of time speculatively identified multiple possible causative factors. These included external pressure on the cubital tunnel applied by the surgeon while operating, blood pressure cuff monitoring pressure, venous congestion induced by arteriovenous shunting, and pre-existing but subclinical uraemic polyneuropathy.

Occasionally, a definite (and usually avoidable) single causative factor is identified. For example, the electrode from a cutaneous nerve stimulator to assess neuromuscular block was applied to the ulnar nerve at the elbow, and the arm was inappropriately positioned in such a way that compressive force was transmitted from the device to the cubital tunnel, leading to a PUN after appendicectomy. A 1990 report generated from the ASA Closed Claims Database identified a specific injurious mechanism for PUN in only 6% of cases.

Uncertain aetiology continues to typify this condition. A recent report of isolated ulnar neuropathies presenting after COVID-19 infection acknowledged this uncertainty and speculated that patient positioning during acute illness, the prothrombotic underlying state, or other related factors might play a role.

### Neuromuscular paralysis as a pharmacodynamic probe to assess organ function during liver transplantation [^115M2uej]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2000). Low credibility.

The potential for assessing liver function during liver transplantation surgery by monitoring muscle paralysis from nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers that are hepatically cleared is critically assessed. Rocuronium is strongly favored as a promising pharmacodynamic probe for predicting allograft liver function because it is predominantly eliminated via the liver and its putative metabolites are not active. Prolongation of recovery from rocuronium paralysis is closely correlated with allograft liver function postoperatively.

Vecuronium, pancuronium, and perhaps pipecuronium may also prove to be useful probes; however, the two former blockers have active metabolites. Further prospective studies are necessary with more precise measurement of neuromuscular function to confirm the predictive value of this method. Alterations in neuromuscular blocker plasma concentrations that are correlated with changes in liver function, and either the dose required or the intensity or duration of paralysis, need to be demonstrated for this technique to be clinically useful.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: A systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^114PWmse]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). High credibility.

- **Editor's key points**: Preventing ulnar and other pressure-related nerve injuries is an important part of safe anaesthetic care for an unconscious patient. This evidence synthesis suggests perioperative ulnar nerve injury is rare, but good anaesthetic care is likely to be an important reason for this. The authors provide useful guidance on the prevention and treatment of this important problem.

The prevention of physical injury to patients whilst under the effects of sedation, regional or general anaesthesia is a fundamental duty of anaesthetists. Mechanical, thermal, and electrical injuries to soft tissues, including skin, muscles, and nerves, have all been described whilst patients undergo surgery. Injury to the ulnar nerve is a feared adverse event after anaesthesia and was traditionally viewed by clinicians, patients, and legal professionals as a preventable complication arising from surgical or anaesthetic care. The ascription of liability for ulnar nerve injury has often followed the legal doctrine of res ipsa loquitur ('the thing speaks for itself'; in other words, that the event would ordinarily not occur in the absence of negligence), even though it has been acknowledged for at least 30 years that postoperative ulnar neuropathy (PUN) is not always preventable. Although few cases of PUN progress to successful civil litigation, during their career anaesthetists are very likely to be asked to review cases of possible PUN and must therefore understand how to assess and manage the condition.

### Incidence of complications in the post-anesthesia care unit and associated healthcare utilization in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery requiring neuromuscular blockade 2005–2013: A single center study [^115YXy4a]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Use of neuromuscular blockade agents (NMBA) has been associated with significant residual post-operative paralysis and morbidity. There is a lack of clinical evidence on the incidence of postoperative complications within the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in patients exposed to intraoperative NMBAs. This study aims to estimate the incidence of post-operative complications associated with the use of NMBAs and assess its association with healthcare resource utilization.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort.

- **Setting**: Post-anesthesia care unit in a tertiary care center.

- **Patients**: Adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery and receiving NMBAs between April 2005 and December 2013.

- **Measurements**: We assessed:
	1. Incidences of major and minor PACU complications.
	2. Incidence of any postoperative complication in patients receiving an NMBA reversal (neostigmine) vs. those without.
	3. We secondarily assessed the relationship between PACU complications and the use of healthcare resources.

- **Main results**:
	- The incidence of any major complications was 2.1%, and that of any minor complication was 35.2%.
	- ICU admission rate was 1.3% in patients without any complications versus 5.2% in patients with any minor and 30.6% in patients with any major complication.
	- ICU length of stay was prolonged in patients with any major complications (52.1 ± 203 hours), compared to patients with any minor (6.2 ± 64 hours) and those with no complications (1.7 ± 28 hours).
	- Patients who received an NMBA and neostigmine, compared to those without neostigmine, had a lower incidence of any major complication (1.7% vs. 6.05%), rate of re-intubation (0.8% vs. 4.6%).

### Evidence-based approach to timing of nerve surgery: A review [^112NCzkc]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Events causing acute stress to the healthcare system, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, place clinical decisions under increased scrutiny. The priority and timing of surgical procedures are critically evaluated under these conditions, yet the optimal timing of procedures is a key consideration in any clinical setting. There is currently no single article consolidating a large body of evidence on the timing of nerve surgery. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were systematically reviewed for clinical data on nerve repair and reconstruction to define the understanding of timing and other factors affecting outcomes. Special attention was given to sensory, mixed/motor, nerve compression syndromes, and nerve pain. The data presented in this review may assist surgeons in making sound, evidence-based clinical decisions regarding the timing of nerve surgery.

### Defining postoperative C5 palsy and recovery: A systematic review [^112tE2Xo]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2023). High credibility.

Postoperative C5 palsy (C5P) is a well-recognized complication of cervical spine surgery, often delayed in onset. Most patients recover within six months, yet severe cases have a poor prognosis. The clinical significance and natural history of mild versus severe C5P appear to differ substantially, though palsy severity and recovery have been inadequately characterized in the literature.

- **Methods**: Due to varied prognoses and expanding treatment options like nerve transfer surgery to reconstruct the C5 myotome, this systematic review aims to describe the classification of C5P severity and the definitions of C5P and its recovery. The goal is to propose a postoperative C5P scale to aid clinical decision-making. The review involved a PubMed search of English articles since 2000 that clearly define postoperative C5P or its recovery. Inclusion was limited to studies focusing exclusively on C5 palsy in patients undergoing surgery for degenerative disease. Titles and abstracts were screened by a single reviewer, with a second reviewer providing consultation as needed. Collected data included definitions of postoperative C5P, classifications of C5P severity, and definitions/classifications of C5P recovery. A qualitative analysis was undertaken.

- **Results**: Of 272 articles identified and screened, full-text reviews were conducted on 98, with 43 meeting the inclusion criteria. Postoperative C5P was most commonly defined as a reduction in deltoid muscle strength by ≥ 1 grade using manual muscle testing (MMT), with potential biceps involvement.

### Neurological complications of cervical spine surgery: C5 palsy and intraoperative monitoring [^114qnjxs]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

The study is a review article aimed at examining the epidemiology, etiology, risk factors, prevention, and treatment of neurological complications associated with cervical spine surgery, specifically focusing on C5 palsy and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring.

Neurological complications are among the most dreaded by both patients and surgeons, although spinal cord injury remains rare. C5 palsy, however, is more common and perplexing. Though intraoperative monitoring is commonly used in cervical spine surgery, its effectiveness in preventing spinal cord or nerve root injury is not clearly established.

The study utilizes a narrative and review of the literature approach. Findings indicate that the incidence of new, severe motor weakness in two or more extremities occurring within 12 hours of surgery is 0.18%, with a rate in cervical spine surgeries of 3 per 1000. Isolated C5 palsy is more frequent, with incidence rates varying from 0% to 30%, depending on its definition and the patient group studied. Several theories exist regarding the pathogenesis of C5 palsy, and various preventative strategies have been discussed. Approximately 70% of patients recover fully without treatment within 4 to 5 months. Recovery is spontaneous, and no treatment has been shown to accelerate the recovery or improve outcomes. A systematic review of the literature presents high-level evidence that multimodal intraoperative monitoring is effective in detecting intraoperative neurological injury.

### Preparing for the unexpected: Special considerations and complications after sugammadex administration [^116fuZmA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Residual paralysis, caused by the use of muscle relaxants during surgery or incomplete neuromuscular reversal, is associated with postoperative complications such as hypoxemia and upper airway obstruction. It also has a strong association with pulmonary complications and morbidity in postoperative patients. Neuromuscular recovery to a train-of-four ratio (TOFR) ≥ 0.9 is important because, below this level of recovery, pharyngeal dysfunction remains, increasing the risk of pulmonary aspiration when TOFR values are 0.7–0.8, as measured at the adductor pollicis muscle. Therefore, recommendations include confirmation of sufficient neuromuscular recovery to a TOFR ≥ 0.9 by electromyography and acceleromyographic recovery of TOFR ≥ 1.0.

The incidence of residual paralysis is reported to be 20–60% of patients upon arrival in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) when non-depolarizing muscle relaxants were used during the surgery. Brueckmann et al. reported that all patients receiving sugammadex for neuromuscular blockade reversal had TOFR ≥ 0.9 at PACU admission, while 43% of patients treated with neostigmine/glycopyrrolate had a TOFR < 0.9 at PACU arrival. However, Unterbuchner and Todd have reported that the high incidence of residual paralysis after antagonism with neostigmine was likely due to inappropriate intraoperative neuromuscular monitoring in this study. Kotake et al. reported that the use of sugammadex did not eliminate the risk of residual paralysis (up to 9.4% of the patients showed TOFR < 0.9 after tracheal extubation) when the decision to extubate was made without appropriate neuromuscular monitoring.

### Recovery of vocal fold paralysis after cardiovascular surgery [^114m7ogX]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

To review the incidence and time course of recovery of vocal fold paralysis (VFP) in adult patients after cardiovascular surgery, a retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care academic medical center. Patients with VFP after cardiovascular surgery were identified from a database of hospitalized patients undergoing voice and swallow evaluation. VFP was confirmed using transnasal fiberoptic laryngoscopy within one week of surgery. Follow-up laryngoscopy was performed in those with VFP in the outpatient clinic. For those with persistent paralysis, the time course of recovery was noted.

Eighty-six adult postoperative cardiovascular surgery patients (ages 34 to 83 years, mean age 68) were identified from the inpatient voice and swallowing evaluation database. There were 20 patients (23%) with unilateral VFP. Thirteen patients followed up for outpatient laryngoscopy. Of these, ten (77%) ultimately had complete resolution of VFP. Three patients had persistent paralysis at a mean follow-up of 18 months. There was no obvious correlation between the type of cardiovascular surgery and the occurrence of VFP. Signs of recovery were generally evident prior to 6 months, and no recovery was seen beyond 12 months.

Most patients with VFP after cardiovascular surgery recover fully. In accordance with previous laryngeal electromyography findings, neuropraxia during cardiovascular surgery will usually recover within 6 months.

### Intermediate acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and risk of postoperative respiratory complications: Prospective propensity score matched cohort study [^115bE32c]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The pharmacological reversal of muscle relaxants using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in combination with glycopyrrolate at the end of the surgical procedure has been associated with a decreased risk of severe postoperative morbidity and mortality. In contrast, we found no beneficial, but rather a harmful, association of the use of neostigmine on respiratory complications. Reversal of neuromuscular blockade at the end of surgery is important for patients' safety but varies broadly between countries, medical centers, and anesthetists.

- **Routine reversal**: The routine reversal of the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents at the end of every surgical procedure is rarely promoted in Europe. However, antagonizing effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents is common practice in the United States, regardless of whether residual effects of the drugs can be shown. Routine reversal at the end of the surgical procedure has to be considered carefully and does not always ensure complete restoration of patients' muscle strength. On the contrary, neostigmine may cause a variety of side effects like arrhythmias, dry mouth, and bronchospasm. Its use may have little influence on partial paralysis. In fact, it has been shown to adversely affect neuromuscular function and cause muscle weakness in patients as well as healthy volunteers when given after complete recovery of neuromuscular transmission. More specifically, when given in the absence of neuromuscular block, neostigmine can impair upper airway dilator volume, genioglossus muscle function, and diaphragmatic function, which are important factors.

### Upper rectus abdominis paralysis after robot-assisted thoracic oncology surgery with cryoanalgesia: A rare complication [^11318VSV]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Low credibility.

Permanent rectus paralysis after lung surgery is rare but can have potential aesthetic repercussions. Patients could benefit from the early recognition of lesions responsible for postoperative discomfort. Intercostal nerve damage resulting in motor dysfunction is less frequent compared to sensory loss after thoracic surgery. Considering intercostal nerves as mixed-type nerves, the incidence of chronic pain is up to 50%, and there is a strong discrepancy in the presence of paralysis. Only a few case reports of paralysis after video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) have been published. We report the first case of rectus abdominis atrophy after robot-assisted VATS (RA-VATS).

### Impact of a positive end-expiratory pressure strategy on oxygenation, respiratory compliance, and hemodynamics during laparoscopic surgery in non-obese patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112Mqj32]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Mechanical ventilation with muscle paralysis during anesthesia causes atelectasis, airway closure, and hypoxemia as a result. These complications may lead to a higher risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC). An observational physiological study in anesthetized and paralyzed patients without lung disease showed an increase in pleural pressure and a decrease in lung compliance in obese patients compared to non-obese patients.

Laparoscopic surgery results in elevated intraabdominal pressure, which can lead to an elevation of pleural pressure around 50% of intraabdominal pressure. The use of higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during anesthesia with recruitment maneuvers could prevent the development of atelectasis, improve respiratory compliance, and prevent atelectotrauma.

Patients who undergo laparoscopic surgery are at high risk of postoperative pulmonary complications, including atelectasis, pneumonia, and hypoxemia. Thus, a higher PEEP strategy in these patients can probably decrease the frequency or degree of these complications. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between different PEEP levels, oxygenation, and respiratory mechanics during pneumoperitoneum (PNP) in non-obese laparoscopic surgery patients without lung diseases.

### Incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy in thoracic surgery in neonates [^115gsofi]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Postoperative vocal cord paralysis (VCP) is a known complication of thoracic surgeries that carry a risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury. The primary aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of postoperative VCP, identify associated risk factors, and assess the impact on feeding and length of hospital stay in pediatric thoracic surgery.

We conducted a prospective, interventional, single-center study from September 2020 to January 2022. Preoperative laryngeal fibroscopy was performed, and children with pre-existing laryngeal immobility were excluded. Postoperative laryngeal fibroscopy was systematically performed 15 days after surgery to assess the incidence of VCP. Data were compared between children with and without VCP to identify risk factors and evaluate the impact on feeding and hospital length of stay.

During the study period, 17 children (mean age 3.2 days; mean weight 2628 g) who underwent thoracic surgery at risk of RLN injury were included: 15 for esophageal atresia, 1 for ductus arteriosus ligation, and 1 for aortic arch surgery. Of these, 4 children were excluded because they could not undergo laryngoscopy at day 15. Postoperative fibroscopy was performed in the remaining 13 children, revealing VCP in 5 (38.5%). VCP was always symptomatic, with stridor requiring specific management in 2 patients. Weight and gestational age emerged as significant factors influencing the risk of postoperative VCP, while associated malformations did not impact VCP risk. No major effects on feeding or length of hospital stay were observed.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: A systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^1114pvDt]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

There is little published guidance to inform the management of postoperative ulnar neuropathy (PUN). The principles of management must, therefore, be extrapolated from the more extensive literature on the related fields of peripheral nerve injury caused by direct surgical trauma and suspected nerve injury after peripheral nerve block.

- **Management approach**: At presentation, it is usually impossible to determine which lesions will subsequently reveal themselves as neuropraxic and those of axonotmesis or neurotmesis. A practical approach at presentation is to determine whether or not in-patient investigative or surgical management is required. If direct surgical trauma is a likely cause of the injury, or if a motor deficit is present, help should be summoned to determine if in-patient remedial action, including surgical re-exploration, is required.

- **Imaging techniques**: MRI and ultrasound scanning can be performed if a compressive hematoma is a suspected cause of the patient's acute presentation.

- **Outpatient management**: In the absence of a direct surgical cause or a motor deficit, an outpatient approach to management may be advocated.

In cases of non-resolving symptoms, onward referral to a neurologist, plastic or peripheral nerve surgeon, and, if required, a pain specialist is important after PUN. The anesthetist is well placed to coordinate these referrals and to ensure that holistic support is provided to the affected patient. Prompt diagnosis and clear communication of a management plan are important to maintain patient–clinician trust.

### Postoperative paralysis from thoracic ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament surgery risk factor of neurologic injury: Nationwide multiinstitution survey [^11133UEu]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

The study design is a retrospective case-control study. The objective was to examine the factors of postoperative paralysis in patients who have undergone thoracic ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) surgery.

A higher percentage of thoracic OPLL patients experience postoperative aggravation of paralysis than cervical OPLL patients, which presents great difficulties in treatment. However, there are few reports aimed at preventing paralysis in thoracic OPLL.

A total of 156 patients who had received thoracic OPLL surgery were selected as the subjects of this study. The review items included the duration of disease, preoperative muscle strength (Muscle Manual Testing), OPLL levels (T1/2–4/5: high, T5/6–8/9: middle, and T9/10–11/12: low), the spinal canal occupancy ratio, the ratio of yellow ligament ossification as a complication, the ratio of transcranial-motor evoked potential (Tc-MEP) derivation, preoperative and postoperative kyphotic angles in the thoracic vertebrae, the correction angle of kyphosis, the duration of surgery, and the amount of bleeding. The subjects were divided into two groups based on the absence or presence of postoperative paralysis to determine the factors contributing to this condition.

Twenty-three patients (14.7%) exhibited postoperative paralysis. Multivariate analysis identified factors associated with postoperative paralysis: the duration of disease (odds ratio, OR = 3.3); the correction angle of kyphosis (OR = 2.4); and the ratio of Tc-MEP derivation (OR = 2.2).

### Commentary: Battle of the bulge [^113VnQPt]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Low credibility.

Rectus paralysis is a known complication after robotic thoracic surgery but is not well described. Although often temporary, patients should be informed of this potential postoperative issue.

- **Rectus bulge**: The infamous rectus bulge is an often seen but rarely reported complication after robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. While a key advantage of thoracoscopy is the lack of rib spreading, leading to less nerve trauma, transient neuralgia is frequently observed due to irritation of the intercostal nerves. An injury to the T7 through T12 intercostal nerves can cause paresthesia of the rectus. However, a low assistant or extraction port that irritates the lower intercostals (usually T9 and T10) can result in paralysis and flaccidity of the ipsilateral abdominal rectus muscle. Although often just an aesthetic concern, this bulge can cause significant distress in a patient. Wildemeersch and colleagues present a case of persistent rectus abdominis paralysis after robotic-assisted lobectomy, and they perform a thorough exploration of this troublesome protuberance.

- **Case report**: Wildemeersch and colleagues describe a 55-year-old male patient who underwent a robotic-assisted lobectomy. Ipsilateral rectus paralysis was identified within weeks of surgery, and it was still present at 1 year postoperatively. Quantitative measurements, including a computed tomography scan, showed decreased muscle thickness compared with the contralateral side at the level of T12 (0.52 vs. 1.2 cm), along with decreased muscle density (29 vs. 66 HU). An electromyography confirmed denervation of the upper two-thirds of the rectus.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: A systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^1131gWYq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

In conjunction with a neurophysiologist, a neurologist or peripheral nerve surgeon can advise on further clinical, electrophysiological, radiological, and tissue investigations. Patients with suspected postoperative ulnar neuropathy (PUN) should be investigated for previously undiagnosed diabetes and other common causes of peripheral neuropathy, such as B12 deficiency and thyroid dysfunction. Electrodiagnostic studies, including nerve conduction studies and needle motor and sensory EMG, are used to determine the site of the nerve lesion and estimate its severity. However, their timing, execution, and interpretation are beyond the scope of this review.

Bilateral nerve conduction testing should be undertaken since the contralateral (unaffected) nerve will display slowing of conduction in 85% of cases, suggesting a predisposition to neuropathy. The contralateral nerve cannot be considered a true 'control' as it will have been exposed to at least some of the same conditions of anaesthesia and surgery as the affected nerve. It is known that many patients with PUN have a pre-existing subclinical neuropathy that is brought to clinical attention by perioperative events.

The timing of electrodiagnostic studies is a complex area with no definitive guidance available to anaesthetists. EMG performed immediately postoperatively may assist in determining whether any neurological deficit was present before anaesthesia and surgery, as signs of denervation take more than two weeks to appear. However, tests undertaken within 7–10 days of presentation can be falsely reassuring since the processes of nerve degeneration will not yet be apparent.

### Neostigmine [^113Xs6em]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy of neostigmine methylsulfate for reversing the effects of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents after surgery is supported by the published literature. Randomized, spontaneous-recovery or placebo-controlled studies, utilizing similar efficacy endpoints, evaluated a total of 404 adult and 80 pediatric patients undergoing various surgical procedures. Patients experienced reduced recovery times from neuromuscular blockade with neostigmine methylsulfate treatment compared to spontaneous recovery.

### Hypoglossal nerve palsy after airway management for general anesthesia: An analysis of 69 patients [^1163dSeH]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2015). Low credibility.

Isolated hypoglossal nerve palsy (HNP), or neurapraxia, is a rare postoperative complication following airway management, leading to ipsilateral tongue deviation, dysarthria, and dysphagia. We reviewed the pathophysiological causes of hypoglossal nerve injury and discussed the associated clinical and procedural characteristics of affected patients. Furthermore, we identified procedural factors potentially affecting HNP recovery duration and proposed several measures to reduce the risk of HNP.

While HNP can occur after various surgeries, most cases in the literature were reported after orthopedic and otolaryngology operations, typically in males. The diagnosis is often missed by the anesthesia care team in the recovery room due to the delayed symptomatic onset and often requires evaluations by neurology and otolaryngology specialists to exclude serious etiologies. Signs and symptoms of HNP are self-limited, with resolution occurring within 2 months in 50% of patients and 80% resolving within 4 months. Currently, there are no specific preventive or therapeutic recommendations available. We found 69 cases of HNP after procedural airway management reported in the literature from 1926 to 2013.

### Examining timing of periorbital interventions in patients with upper division facial paralysis [^113dJkc5]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

Our results suggest that the timing of surgical interventions for permanent upper facial paralysis, whether immediate or delayed, does not have a significant impact on complications or revision rates. Additionally, there is no significant relationship between the type of intervention and whether the procedure is performed immediately or delayed. Thus, clinicians and patients can work together to form treatment plans that work best for specific circumstances without concern for the timing of the surgery.

### Perioperative factors related to the severity of vocal cord paralysis after thoracic cardiovascular surgery: A retrospective review [^117GeLmi]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

After adjusting for potential confounding factors in our multivariable analysis, type 2 diabetes mellitus [odds ratio (OR) 1.853, P = 0.009], intubation period (OR per 24 h 1.136, P = 0.014), ascending aortic arch surgery with BCA reconstruction (OR 8.708, P < 0.001), and VAD implantation surgery (OR 3.460, P = 0.005) remained independent predictors for the severity of VCP.

- **Results for independent predictors of vocal cord paralysis severity**:
	- In postcardiovascular surgery patients, the following factors emerged as key predictors for the severity of vocal cord paralysis:
	- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 1.853, P = 0.009)
	- Intubation period per 24 hours (OR 1.136, P = 0.014)
	- Ascending aortic arch surgery with BCA reconstruction (OR 8.708, P < 0.001)

### Pathophysiology and etiology of nerve injury following peripheral nerve blockade [^113iEH37]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

This review synthesizes anatomical, anesthetic, surgical, and patient factors that may contribute to neurologic complications associated with peripheral nerve blockade. Peripheral nerves have anatomical features unique to a given location that may influence the risk of injury. Peripheral nerve blockade-related peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is most severe with intrafascicular injection. Surgery and its associated requirements, such as positioning and tourniquet, have specific risks. Patients with preexisting neuropathy may be at increased risk of postoperative neurologic dysfunction. Distinguishing potential causes of PNI requires clinical assessment and investigation; a definitive diagnosis, however, is not always possible. Fortunately, most postoperative neurologic dysfunction appears to resolve with time, and the incidence of serious long-term nerve injury directly attributable to peripheral nerve blockade is relatively uncommon. Nonetheless, despite the use of ultrasound guidance, the risk of block-related PNI remains unchanged.

- **What's new**: Since the 2008 Practice Advisory, new information has been published, furthering our understanding of the microanatomy of peripheral nerves, mechanisms of peripheral nerve injection injury, toxicity of local anesthetics, the etiology, and monitoring methods, and technologies that may decrease the risk of nerve block-related peripheral nerve injury.

- **Incidence**: The first description of postoperative peripheral nerve injury arising from anaesthesia was published in 1894, and ulnar neuropathy after anaesthesia was described in 1901. The ulnar nerve is disproportionately affected by perioperative neuropathy in comparison with other major peripheral nerves of the upper limb. In a prospective cohort study of 1502 adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery under general, spinal, or regional anaesthesia and followed up with questionnaires and neurological examination for the first seven postoperative days, sensory or combined sensory/motor PUN was identified in seven patients: an incidence of 0.52% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2–1.0%) or approximately one in 200 cases. A retrospective analysis of 1,129,692 episodes of noncardiac anaesthesia over the period 1957–91 identified an incidence of PUN with sustained motor impairment persisting more.

### Arixtra [^117LZWoE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Neuraxial anesthesia and post-operative indwelling epidural catheter use**: Spinal or epidural hematomas, which may result in long-term or permanent paralysis, can occur with the use of anticoagulants and neuraxial (spinal/epidural) anesthesia or spinal puncture. The risk of these events may be higher with the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or concomitant use of other drugs affecting hemostasis, such as NSAIDs [see Boxed Warning]. In the postmarketing experience, epidural or spinal hematoma has been reported in association with the use of ARIXTRA by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Optimal timing between the administration of ARIXTRA and neuraxial procedures is not known. Monitor patients undergoing these procedures for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment, such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs), and bowel or bladder dysfunction. Consider the potential risks and benefits before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or who may be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.

- **Hemorrhage**: ARIXTRA increases the risk of hemorrhage in patients at risk for bleeding, including conditions such as congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, diabetic retinopathy, or shortly after brain, spinal, or ophthalmological surgery. Cases of elevated aPTT temporally associated with bleeding events have been reported following administration of ARIXTRA (with or without concomitant administration).

### Surgical interventions for the early management of Bell's palsy [^1167Myd5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Bell's palsy is an acute unilateral facial paralysis of unknown etiology and should only be used as a diagnosis in the absence of any other pathology. As the proposed pathophysiology involves swelling and entrapment of the nerve, some surgeons suggest surgical decompression of the nerve as a possible management option; this is ideally performed as soon as possible after onset. This is an update of a review first published in 2011 and last updated in 2013. This update includes evidence from one newly identified study.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of surgery in the early management of Bell's palsy.

- **Search methods**: On 20 March 2020, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. We hand-searched selected conference abstracts for the original version of the review.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs involving any surgical intervention for Bell's palsy. Trials compared surgical interventions to no treatment, later treatment (beyond three months), sham treatment, other surgical treatments, or medical treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, evaluated risk of bias, and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome was complete recovery of facial palsy at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included complete recovery at three and six months, synkinesis and contracture at 12 months, psychosocial outcomes at 12 months, and side effects.

### On the incidence, cause, and prevention of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsies during anterior cervical spine surgery [^113vGEEd]. Spine (2000). Low credibility.

A retrospective review of contemporaneously acquired clinical data supplemented by experimental cadaver dissection was conducted. The objective was to establish the incidence and mechanism of vocal cord paralysis after anterior cervical spine surgery and to determine whether controlling for endotracheal tube (ET)-laryngeal wall interactions induced by the cervical retraction system could decrease the rate of paralysis. Vocal cord paralysis is the most common otolaryngologic complication after anterior cervical spine surgery; however, the quoted frequency of this varies considerably, and the cause of injury is not clearly defined. As a result, various, sometimes contradictory, recommendations are presented to prevent this without data to support their effectiveness.

Data was gathered at the time of surgery and during follow-up visits on 900 consecutive patients who underwent anterior cervical spine surgery with plating during a 12-year interval. This information was entered into a computerized database and reviewed for complications and procedural risk factors. After the first 250 cases, an intervention consisting of monitoring ET cuff pressure and releasing pressure after retractor replacement or repositioning was used, allowing the ET to recenter within the larynx. The ET-laryngeal wall relation was also studied in fresh intubated cadavers using videofluoroscopic images, before and after retractor placement.

Thirty incidences of vocal cord paralysis consistent with recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury were identified: 27 temporary and 3 permanent.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: A systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^112tVAeg]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). High credibility.

Because many of the aforementioned factors are elicited as part of preoperative anaesthetic assessment, anaesthetists are in an excellent position to undertake a patient-specific consent discussion, disclosing the likely risk of PUN and the steps taken perioperatively to mitigate risk.

- **Mechanism of injury**: Mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of ulnar neuropathy can be derived from patients who do and do not undergo surgery. Compression neuropathy of the ulnar nerve at the elbow was first systematically described by Sir William Gowers in his 1886 book, "A Manual of Diseases of the Nervous System". Causes of non-surgical entrapment at the elbow include anatomical abnormalities, rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, medial epicondylitis, diabetes mellitus, trauma, and habitual leaning on the elbow arising from occupations. In a number of cases, no single cause is found to explain the neuropathy, and such cases are usually described as idiopathic.

As a specific phenomenon, postoperative ulnar nerve injury has been ascribed to direct nerve trauma before or during upper-limb surgery (e.g. supracondylar humeral fracture or implantable contraceptive device removal); trauma from peripheral nerve block; nerve infarction during transposition surgery; and, finally, arising from injudicious patient positioning under anaesthetic. Complete section of the ulnar nerve is unlikely to arise solely from anaesthetic care. In one analysis of iatrogenic peripheral nerve injuries presenting to a single neurosurgical service over a 10-year period, direct intraoperative factors were identified.

### Examining timing of periorbital interventions in patients with upper division facial paralysis [^113NqxPG]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

Facial paralysis is a life-altering condition that may arise from various etiologies, ranging from trauma to malignancy. Permanent facial paralysis may occur secondary to facial nerve sacrifice or irreversible damage to the nerve. In these particularly devastating cases, protection and maintenance of eye function are paramount. There are many effective lagophthalmos corrective surgical procedures available for these patients. While placement of eyelid weights and lid tightening surgeries are the cornerstone of eyelid rehabilitation, limited information exists on whether the timing of eyelid interventions in the setting of permanent facial paralysis impacts outcomes, including the need for revision surgery.

- **Methods**: A single-center retrospective chart review was performed for patients with irreversible facial paralysis treated with an upper eyelid weight between 2013 and 2022. Electronic health records were acquired to obtain facial paralysis etiology, associated clinical characteristics, the type of intervention, and the timing of intervention. Patients were classified as immediate if the eyelid weight operation occurred within 29 days of the initial facial paralysis, and delayed if the surgery occurred 30 days or more after initial presentation. Outcomes were assessed in terms of revision procedures and surgical complications.

- **Results**: There were 70 patients in total, with 35 patients in the immediate category and 35 patients in the delayed category. The most common etiology related to parotid gland pathology, and 58.6% of patients had facial paralysis from cancer.

### Evidence-based approach to timing of nerve surgery: A review [^111YfERX]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

In addition to the timing of the repair, various factors may influence both the planning of the operative case and the methodology used for the repair. The availability of personal protective equipment, sterile surgical supplies, anesthesia supplies, and staffing will impact the ability to achieve appropriate timing in nerve repair. Exposure risks for both the clinical team and the patient should also be taken into consideration. The scope and scale of exposure risks should not be limited to the surgery itself but should include efforts to minimize recovery room time, days of hospitalization, rehabilitation, and any steps that can be appropriately taken to reduce the staging of procedures and the overall episodes of care.

There is evidence to support a variety of reconstructive options. Optimal treatment is determined using available clinical data on safety, efficacy, and utility. Common repair methods for peripheral nerve injuries include direct suture, autograft, allograft, conduit, or nerve transfer.

- **Management of peripheral nerve transection**:
	- Ability to achieve a tension-free repair
	- Operative time required for each repair approach
	- Ability to reduce anesthesia acuity and duration

For example, although local regional anesthesia and monitored anesthesia care carry less risk of airway irritation, they may increase aerosol production (and viral spread in the present scenario) compared with tracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway.

### Neurological complications related to elective orthopedic surgery: Part 2: Common hip and knee procedures [^117Q9ijb]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Many anesthesiologists may not be familiar with the rate of surgical neurological complications in hip and knee procedures for which they are providing local anesthetic-based anesthesia and/or analgesia. Part 2 of this narrative review series on neurological complications of elective orthopedic surgery describes the mechanisms and likelihood of peripheral nerve injury associated with some of the most common hip and knee procedures, including arthroscopic hip and knee surgery, as well as total hip and knee replacement.

- **What's new**: As the popularity of regional anesthesia continues to increase with the development of ultrasound guidance, anesthesiologists should have a thoughtful understanding of the nerves at risk of surgical injury during elective hip and knee procedures.

### Identifying factors for predicting postoperative segmental motor paralysis in patients undergoing anterior cervical spine surgery: A multicenter study [^116Pn437]. Spine (2025). Low credibility.

This retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate the incidence of and risk factors for segmental motor paralysis after anterior cervical spine surgery. Segmental motor paralysis is a potential complication following both anterior and posterior cervical decompression procedures. Previous studies investigating risk factors for segmental motor paralysis after anterior cervical spine surgery were limited by small sample sizes. Consequently, the exact pathogenesis and risk factors for this complication remain poorly understood, highlighting the need for larger-scale investigations focused exclusively on anterior cervical spine surgeries.

We retrospectively reviewed the clinico-demographic and operative factors and postoperative outcomes of 1,428 patients undergoing anterior cervical spine surgery at three spine centers in Japan. Postoperative segmental motor paralysis was defined as deterioration of upper extremity muscle strength by ≥ 1 grade; recovery was defined as a return to preoperative muscle strength levels. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors.

Ninety-nine patients (6.9%) developed segmental motor paralysis, mostly involving the C5 segment (81.8%). The incidence was highest in patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and those undergoing anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion or hybrid fusion (discectomy + corpectomy). Older age, male sex, higher body mass index, OPLL, and cervical corpectomy were identified as independent risk factors.

### Surgical effect of lateral rectus muscle paralysis: A case series study [^111v4SU1]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle can be categorized as either complete or partial. Complete paralysis denotes a total loss of its contraction capability, leading to the incapacity of the affected eye to move outward past the midpoint during monocular gaze examination. Patients afflicted with this condition commonly manifest sudden symptoms, such as diplopia or visual confusion. Clinical assessment may unveil esodeviation in the affected eye, accompanied by compensatory head positioning.

When conservative treatments fail to yield results over a period exceeding six months, strabismus surgery emerges as an effective recourse for rectifying eye misalignment. In the clinical management of individuals grappling with complete lateral rectus muscle paralysis, the judicious selection of a suitable surgical approach assumes paramount importance. Traditional methods such as strengthening procedures like folding surgery, shortening surgery, and anterior transposition have exhibited limited effectiveness. However, the literature suggests that superior rectus transposition (SRT) surgery stands out as a straightforward and efficacious intervention for addressing strabismus resulting from complete paralysis. Superior rectus transposition with augmented suture (SRTA) could further improve the strabismus and motor function.

This study endeavors to observe the amelioration of esodeviation, the eradication of diplopia, the correction of head positioning, and the augmentation of lateral gaze functionality in lateral rectus muscle panplegia patients pre- and post-SR.

### Neurological complications after regional anesthesia: Contemporary estimates of risk [^116EiCKy]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Regional anesthesia (RA) provides excellent anesthesia and analgesia for many surgical procedures. Anesthesiologists and patients must understand the risks, in addition to the benefits of RA, to make an informed choice of anesthetic technique. Many studies that have investigated neurological complications after RA are dated and do not reflect the increasing indications and applications of RA nor the advances in training and techniques. In this brief narrative review, we collate the contemporary investigations of neurological complications after the most common RA techniques.

- **Methods**: We reviewed all 32 studies published between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2005, where the primary intent was to investigate neurological complications of RA.

- **Results**: The sample size of the studies that investigated neurological complications after central and peripheral (PNB) nerve blockade ranged from 4,185 to 1,260,000 and 20 to 10,309 blocks, respectively. The rate of neuropathy after spinal and epidural anesthesia was 3.78:10,000 (95% CI: 1.06–13.50:10,000) and 2.19:10,000 (95% CI: 0.88–5.44:10,000), respectively. For common PNB techniques, the rate of neuropathy after interscalene brachial plexus block, axillary brachial plexus block, and femoral nerve block was 2.84:100 (95% CI 1.33–5.98:100), 1.48:100 (95% CI: 0.52–4.11:100), and 0.34:100 (95% CI: 0.04–2.81:100), respectively. The rate of permanent neurological injury after spinal and epidural anesthesia ranged from 0–4.2:10,000 and 0–7.6:10,000, respectively. Only one case of permanent neuropathy was reported among 16 studies.

### Evidence-based approach to timing of nerve surgery: A review [^113qmNfX]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

When making decisions regarding the timing of nerve procedures, it is critical to use a multifactorial approach. The trends described previously are broad and do not account for variables such as gap length, mechanism of injury, proximal versus distal location, and other considerations to be discussed in later sections. These factors may compound the negative effects of delayed repairs.

- **Take-home messages**:

	- **Sensory-only**: Sensory-only nerve injuries should be considered acutely, ideally within 14 days of injury, to prevent painful neuroma formation. Once a neuroma occurs, overcoming psychological impairment and, in some instances, narcotic dependency becomes an additional task in returning patients to functional activities. In cases where the initial presentation is delayed, it is suggested to repair within 14 days of clinical presentation if the injury occurred less than six months prior. After six months, reconstruction may still be undertaken but with consideration for possible adjunctive techniques to optimize outcomes based on individual prognostic factors.

Functional sensory return is not as time-sensitive as muscle reinnervation. Although sooner is better, evidence points to functional sensory return being achievable for several years after complete transection. However, the quality of such delayed recovery might remain less predictable. Additional preoperative factors to be considered in sensory-only nerves include gap length, injury level, the ability to identify proximal and distal stumps, and concomitant vessel or tendon injuries.

### Electrophysiological guidance of epidural electrode array implantation over the human lumbosacral spinal cord to enable motor function after chronic paralysis [^1115Cd1W]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Low credibility.

Although the results we presented from these two subjects suggest that intra-operative EES-evoked motor responses foreshadow EES-enabled motor activity performance post-surgery, they do not directly demonstrate how these single evoked potentials can serve as a biomarker of the most effective stimulation parameters to perform step-like behavior. There are multiple factors that contribute to the complexity of interactions between EES and the dynamic state of sensorimotor spinal network excitability. This complex state of excitability prohibits a direct correlation of EES-evoked motor potential characteristics to EES-enabled motor functions.

For example, changing the stimulation from a single pulse to a train of pulses or adjusting the stimulus frequency cannot readily define the optimal stimulation parameters for generating a desired motor function. Another factor that makes the translation from evoked potentials to motor outcomes difficult is that the responsiveness of the spinal network intraoperatively and soon after implantation is likely to change substantially as motor function improves. One of the most obvious differences when stimulating single evoked responses versus continuous stimulation is that the spinal networks activated in these two conditions are dramatically different, both quantitatively and qualitatively. For example, the behavioral responses reflect the engagement of proprioception and a return of supraspinal connectivity.

With our currently limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the functional connections that generate a motor behavior, it cannot be fully defined.

### Vocal cord paralysis after aortic arch surgery: Predictors and clinical outcome [^114FGJ63]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

This study is a retrospective cohort study of data on vocal cord paralysis after aortic arch surgery, collected over 14 years at a general hospital. We investigated factors in the development of vocal cord paralysis after aortic arch surgery and the effect of vocal cord paralysis on clinical course and outcome.

Methods: We reviewed data for 182 patients who underwent aortic arch surgery for aortic arch aneurysm and aortic dissection between 1989 and 2003. Among them, 58 patients had proximal aortic repair, 62 had distal arch repair, and 62 had total arch repair. We assessed factors associated with the development of vocal cord paralysis and examined in detail the clinical outcome of patients with vocal cord paralysis.

Results: Postoperative vocal cord paralysis occurred in 40 patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed the following risk factors with odds ratios (OR) for vocal cord paralysis: extension of procedures into distal arch (OR, 17.0), chronic dilatation of the aorta at the left subclavian artery (OR, 9.14), and total arch repair (OR, 4.24). Adoption of open-style stent-grafts reduced the incidence of vocal cord paralysis (OR, 0.031). The postoperative occurrence of vocal cord paralysis itself emerges as an independent predictor of pulmonary complications (OR, 4.12) and leads to a longer duration of hospital stay.

Conclusions: The risk of vocal cord paralysis after aortic arch surgery depends on surgical factors, such as aneurysmal involvement of the distal arch or the application of newer, less invasive surgical procedures.

### Surgical reconsideration of traumatic facial paralysis [^1114tS8G]. Otology & Neurotology (2022). Low credibility.

Despite the different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying Bell's palsy, in assessing severe traumatic facial paralysis, many surgeons rely on electrophysiological criteria to determine whether facial nerve exploration is warranted. To assess the value of preoperative electroneurography (ENoG) and the timing of surgery, we analyzed data from three tertiary medical centers.

- **Materials and methods**: The records of 517 patients with a degenerative ratio (DR) greater than 80% on ENoG were collected, and two groups were defined: Group A (90% DR ≤ ENoG) and Group B (80% DR ≤ ENoG < 90% DR). The difference in effectiveness of surgery versus conservative treatment was analyzed based on the postoperative outcome determined by the House-Brackmann grading system. The independent-samples t test was used to compare surgery with conservative treatment for each day of surgical exploration.

- **Result**: In groups A and B, the average recovery time from facial paralysis was better in patients who had undergone surgical exploration than in those who had been treated conservatively. In Group A, the difference was significant only for patients who underwent surgery within 8 days. In Group B, a significant difference was found for patients who underwent surgery within 16 days but also for surgery performed 20 and 30 days after the onset of facial paralysis.

- **Discussion**: In the surgical treatment of facial paralysis, the criteria for trauma patients should be distinguished from those of patients with Bell's palsy. In traumatic facial paralysis, some axons are more vulnerable to external factors.

### Vocal cord paralysis after surgery to the descending thoracic aorta via left posterolateral thoracotomy [^113DbXVd]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Vocal cord paralysis is frequently encountered as a complication after aortic surgery. However, reports of its occurrence following aortic surgery have been limited. In a retrospective cohort study at a general hospital, factors related to the development of vocal cord paralysis after surgery to the descending thoracic aorta via left posterolateral thoracotomy were examined. Data from 69 patients, who underwent such surgeries between 1989 and 1995, were reviewed to assess factors associated with the development of vocal cord paralysis and postoperative complications.

Postoperative vocal cord paralysis was observed in 19 patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified two risk factors: chronic dilatation of the aorta at the left subclavian artery (odds ratio = 8.67) and anastomosis proximal to the left subclavian artery (odds ratio = 17.7). The duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly prolonged for patients with vocal cord paralysis. Certain surgical factors related to the left subclavian artery increase the risk of vocal cord paralysis after surgery on the descending thoracic aorta. While vocal cord paralysis did not increase the incidence of aspiration pneumonia, it was associated with other pulmonary complications.

### Intermediate acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and risk of postoperative respiratory complications: Prospective propensity score matched cohort study [^114ahg4g]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Strategies to prevent postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade involve two common approaches to avoid the adverse effects of muscle relaxants and their consequences: intraoperative monitoring of neuromuscular transmission and pharmacological reversal of neuromuscular blockade. In our study, intraoperative qualitative monitoring of neuromuscular transmission — specifically visual or tactile identification of a fade of contraction after train-of-four stimulation of a peripheral nerve — was used by about 50% of the clinicians but did not help prevent postoperative respiratory complications associated with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents.

In contrast, other researchers reported that quantitative intraoperative monitoring of neuromuscular transmission — such as identification of a train-of-four fade through acceleromyography monitoring — reduces the risk of residual neuromuscular blockade and adverse respiratory events in the post-anesthesia care unit. Acceleromyography monitoring uses a small piezoelectric transducer attached to the stimulated muscle to objectively measure the force produced by a muscle after nerve stimulation. While visual or tactile observation of fade may enable a clinician to predominantly identify distinct levels of partial paralysis, another study supports the view that quantitative monitoring of neuromuscular transmission may be required to adequately detect low but clinically meaningful levels of residual neuromuscular blockade.

### Measuring patient-reported outcomes after facial paralysis reconstruction surgery using the FACE-Q [^113q8CoX]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Patients affected by facial paralysis often experience significant psychosocial impairment; therefore, it is essential to incorporate their perspective when assessing surgical outcomes. The objective of the study was to examine the effect of various patient- and treatment-specific factors on patient satisfaction after facial paralysis reconstruction, as measured by the FACE-Q.

- **Methods**: Seventy-two patients who underwent facial paralysis procedures by our senior author from 2000 to 2020 received the FACE-Q by email. Patient characteristics, duration of paralysis before surgery, type of surgery, complications, and secondary procedures were recorded.

- **Results**: Forty-one patients successfully completed the questionnaire. The study found that men were significantly more satisfied with the decision to undergo surgery. Older patients had significantly lower satisfaction scores concerning their face and psychosocial well-being, while uninsured patients had higher satisfaction scores regarding their face and social and psychosocial well-being. Conversely, these satisfaction scores were significantly lower in patients with long-standing facial paralysis. No differences were found between static and dynamic techniques, the presence of complications, or the need for secondary procedures. The study concluded that decreased patient satisfaction was associated with older age, female sex, insured patients, and longer duration of paralysis before treatment for facial paralysis reconstruction.

### Bilateral vocal cord paralysis secondary to head and neck surgery [^113VPW5d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Even endotracheal intubation could be considered safe in operations under general anesthesia; rarely, it could cause recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis as a complication. As mentioned in the literature, a possible reason for this is that anterior branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve in the larynx could suffer from compression between the posteromedial part of the thyroid cartilage and the cuff of the tube. In the literature, unilateral vocal cord paralysis due to endotracheal intubation occurs more frequently compared to bilateral vocal cord paralysis. These types of palsies usually completely improve in approximately six months.

A patient who experienced bilateral vocal cord paralysis in the early postoperative period after undergoing endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia and primary partial lip resection and supraomohyoid neck dissection due to lower lip carcinoma is presented in our article. Although vocal cord paralysis occurring after head and neck surgery is often thought of as a complication of the surgery, endotracheal intubation should be considered as a possible cause of this paralysis. In relation to this patient, causes, clinical symptoms, and treatment procedures of vocal cord paralysis due to endotracheal intubation are discussed with guidance from the literature.

### Neurologic complications after lumbar spine surgery [^117XTGFQ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

With the increasing complexity and number of lumbar spine operations being performed, the potential number of patients who will sustain perioperative complications, including those that involve neural structures, has also increased. Neurologic complications after lumbar spine surgery can be categorized by the perioperative time period during which they occur and by their mechanism of injury. Although the overall incidence of neurologic complications after lumbar surgery is low, the severity of these injuries mandates careful preoperative planning, awareness of risk, and meticulous attention to perioperative details.

### Pathophysiology of peripheral nerve injury during regional anesthesia [^111Gj7V9]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Despite attention to technical details in the performance of regional anesthetics, damage to nerves continues to be a concern. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms may aid in decreasing the incidence and severity of such injuries.

- **Methods**: Studies from both clinical and basic science perspectives are reviewed.

- **Results**: Exposure of peripheral nerves to local anesthetics may result in axonal damage, particularly if the solution is injected intrafascicularly, if the concentration is high, and if the duration of exposure is prolonged. Disruption of numerous cellular functions may contribute to neuronal damage by local anesthetics, but elevated intracellular calcium levels may play a central role. Needle penetration of a nerve results in minimal lasting damage unless this is combined with local anesthetic administration within the nerve fascicle. Direct compression by a prolonged tourniquet application may damage axons, particularly of large myelinated fibers. Ischemia may also contribute to neuronal injury in proportion to the duration of blood flow interruption.

The relative importance of these pathogenic factors in cases of nerve injury after regional anesthesia is not resolved.

### What is the risk of postoperative neurologic symptoms after regional anesthesia in upper extremity surgery? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^111cj3o1]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). High credibility.

The risk of neurologic symptoms after regional anesthesia in orthopedic surgery is estimated to approach 3%, with long-term deficits affecting 2 to 4 per 10,000 patients. However, estimates are derived from large retrospective or observational studies that are subject to important systemic biases. Therefore, to harness the highest quality data and overcome the challenge of small numbers of participants in individual randomized trials, we undertook this systematic review and meta-analysis of contemporary randomized trials.

- **Questions/purposes**: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials, we asked: (1) What is the aggregate pessimistic and optimistic risk of postoperative neurologic symptoms after regional anesthesia in upper extremity surgery? (2) What block locations have the highest and lowest risk of postoperative neurologic symptoms? (3) What is the timing of occurrence of postoperative neurologic symptoms (in days) after surgery?

- **Methods**: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2008 and 2019 that prospectively evaluated postoperative neurologic symptoms after peripheral nerve blocks in operative procedures. Based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation guidance for using the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool, most trials registered a global rating of a low-to-intermediate risk of bias.

### Preoperative muscle weakness as defined by handgrip strength and postoperative outcomes: A systematic review [^117DNNcf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Impaired preoperative handgrip strength may be associated with increased postoperative morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospital stay following surgery. Given the robust predictive power of this inexpensive, objective bedside test beyond the perioperative population, further studies of its role in predicting postoperative outcomes appear to be warranted, provided prospective, objectively defined measures of morbidity are employed.

### Conceptual and technical insights into the basis of neuromuscular monitoring [^113PS7ky]. Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Unrecognised postoperative residual neuromuscular block remains a frequent occurrence in recovery rooms. Evidence indicates that practice continues to perpetuate the status quo, in which 10–40% of patients experience postoperative residual weakness. A departure from the practice requires small efforts on the clinicians' part. This review addresses several selected core questions regarding neuromuscular blockade monitoring and provides a framework to rationally discuss and develop basic guidelines for the use of neuromuscular blocking agents in patient care.

### Two cases of quadriparesis following anterior cervical discectomy, with normal perioperative somatosensory evoked potentials [^111KQvRu]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Two cases illustrate an uncommon failure of perioperative somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) monitoring to detect iatrogenic lesions causing temporary quadriparesis during straightforward cervical surgery. In both cases, anterior cervical discectomy at one or two levels was undertaken with bone graft and titanium implants, and cortical SEP were monitored to alternate stimulation of the left and right median or ulnar nerves. The SEP showed only minor changes during surgery, not considered pathologically significant, and were normal when recorded postoperatively. Both patients, however, experienced marked postoperative limb weakness or paralysis. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) recorded postoperatively to transcranial magnetic stimulation were absent. The clinical motor deficits resolved over the ensuing months. Despite the normally low incidence of "false negatives", in these two cases SEP monitoring failed to detect an iatrogenic lesion causing moderate to severe, though temporary, motor impairment. Monitoring of MEP may be considered as an alternative to SEP during anterior cervical procedures, while combined monitoring of SEP and MEP may be the ideal.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^116neao9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Bell's palsy, named after the Scottish anatomist Sir Charles Bell, is the most common acute mono-neuropathy, or disorder affecting a single nerve, and is the predominant diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness or paralysis. It presents as a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause. The condition leads to the partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side of the face. Although typically self-limited, facial paresis or paralysis resulting from Bell's palsy may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and an inability to close the eyelid, leading to potential eye injury.

- **Treatment and outcomes**: Treatments are generally designed to improve facial function and facilitate recovery. There are numerous treatment options for Bell's palsy, and some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of these options, resulting in variations of care.

- **Diagnostic evaluation**: Numerous diagnostic tests are available for evaluating patients with Bell's palsy, though many are of questionable benefit.

- **Differential diagnosis**: Patients enter the healthcare system with facial paresis or paralysis as the primary complaint, but not all have Bell's palsy. Concerns arise that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed, leading to unnecessary delays in diagnosis. These quality concerns underscore the importance of accurate diagnosis and effective treatment strategies.
