## Question

labs for pt with concussion and muscle twitching

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what laboratory tests are appropriate for a patient with concussion who is also experiencing muscle twitching. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether muscle twitching fits typical concussion symptomatology or signals another process. Then, I should verify if any concussion-specific serum biomarkers are recommended in routine clinical care. Next, I will assess whether imaging is indicated before labs based on decision rules. After that, I will outline a focused, reversible-cause laboratory work-up for muscle twitching. Finally, I should confirm non-laboratory concussion care elements and create a practical plan with escalation criteria and documentation needs, ensuring I align with high-credibility guidelines that emphasize concussion as a clinical diagnosis and advise against routine serum biomarkers outside research settings [^113so4BG] [^1135sA1v].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: muscle twitching (fasciculations) is not a classic primary feature of mild traumatic brain injury; this atypical symptom nudges me to consider concurrent injuries and non-TBI etiologies such as cervical radiculopathy, metabolic derangements, medication/substance effects, or an unmasked neuromuscular condition, while still performing a complete concussion history and exam that screens comorbid medical and mental health contributors to symptoms [^112SaQBK] [^1161pb2o] [^1147XNGn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ordering concussion blood tests; I need to check whether serum biomarkers like S100B, GFAP, UCHL1, NSE, or tau are recommended in routine practice, and the high-credibility guidance is consistent: avoid serum biomarkers for diagnosis or management of mTBI outside research protocols, so these should not be ordered in standard clinical care [^1135sA1v] [^115UA9xb] [^114Nqyfs].

> Before I move to labs, I should verify whether imaging is indicated using validated rules because red flags would trump lab work: for acute presentations, apply the Canadian CT Head Rule to decide on head CT (e.g. GCS < 15 at 2 hours, suspected skull fracture, basal skull signs, vomiting, age > 65, anticoagulation, dangerous mechanism), consider delayed CT or MRI if progressive neurologic signs evolve in the subacute phase, and obtain cervical spine imaging if neck pain, tenderness, or focal neurologic signs point toward possible radiculopathy or structural injury [^115DPvsf] [^112H1iXX] [^112NVNBq] [^114Lbksa].

> Now, for the laboratory evaluation, wait, let me verify that I'm targeting reversible causes of twitching rather than "concussion labs" per se; a focused metabolic work-up is appropriate: start with a basic metabolic panel to assess sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, renal function, and glucose; add serum calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus given their central roles in neuromuscular excitability; consider creatine kinase if there is traumatic muscle pain or concern for muscle injury; add TSH if hyperthyroid features are present; check vitamin B12 when neuropathy or deficiency risk is suspected; include a complete blood count if infection or systemic illness is possible; and pursue hepatic function and a toxicology screen if alcohol, medication, or substance effects are in the differential, which aligns with concussion guidelines emphasizing thorough history, physical examination, and evaluation of comorbid medical conditions rather than non-evidence-based biomarkers [^112SaQBK] [^117GCZrq] [^11687uGt].

> Next, I should review the core non-laboratory concussion assessment to ensure we're not missing the forest for the trees: perform a detailed neurologic examination, use standardized symptom inventories and structured tools (e.g. SCAT5 or Rivermead) to track domains, and screen for mental health comorbidity because anxiety and mood symptoms can amplify somatic complaints; also examine cervical and vestibulo-ocular systems because cervicovestibular drivers commonly perpetuate symptoms and may coexist with head injury mechanisms that could also explain twitching if cervicogenic or radicular [^112SaQBK] [^115GcEJ3] [^114PR36J] [^112KBEQW].

> I need to ensure I'm clear on what not to order: serum biomarkers remain research tools and should not be sent; EEG is not recommended to establish mTBI or direct care in typical cases; and routine comprehensive neuropsychological testing is not advised in the initial evaluation of mTBI, although I initially thought neuropsych testing might help, but wait, I should verify nuance — VA/DoD advises against routine NP testing in typical cases, whereas in pediatric sport-related concussion, the AAP notes neurocognitive testing can be considered as an adjunct for tracking recovery when administered by trained providers, so I should not use NP testing as a standalone diagnostic tool or order it reflexively in this scenario [^1135sA1v] [^1157VhDB] [^115BtFiY] [^1137rUGV].

> For management and follow-up, let me consider the trajectory: treat based on symptom clusters, counsel on a gradual return to cognitive and physical activity with close monitoring and step-wise progression, document symptom burden serially using validated scales, and address mental health conditions with evidence-based care and adequate treatment duration; if muscle twitching persists beyond several weeks, worsens, or is accompanied by weakness, atrophy, or focal deficits, I should confirm referral to Neurology for further evaluation, which may include EMG, and consider cervicovestibular rehabilitation if examination implicates these systems in symptom maintenance [^1161JYbm] [^1114VpnP] [^113GiJeW] [^111E7KUa] [^111yGzZz] [^112KBEQW].

> Key takeaway, and I should double-check this aligns with guidelines: do not order concussion serum biomarkers in routine care; prioritize imaging only when decision rules or evolving neurologic features warrant it; and when muscle twitching accompanies concussion, focus labs on reversible metabolic and systemic causes while anchoring overall care to a high-quality clinical assessment, symptom tracking, and targeted rehabilitation and referrals as indicated [^1135sA1v] [^115DPvsf] [^112SaQBK].

In concussion with muscle twitching, **routine labs are not required for concussion itself** [^1135sA1v] [^114Nqyfs], but the twitching warrants targeted testing to exclude metabolic, endocrine, or medication-related causes [^112SaQBK] [^113so4BG]. Obtain **CBC, CMP, magnesium, phosphate, TSH, and CK** to screen for electrolyte, renal/hepatic, thyroid, or muscle injury causes. Consider a **toxicology screen** and check **antiepileptic drug (AED) levels** if relevant, and consider EEG or MRI only if seizures or structural lesions are suspected [^1157VhDB] [^112vZbkZ]. Laboratory tests are not diagnostic for concussion, but they help identify treatable contributors to twitching.

---

## Recommended laboratory tests

### Basic laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Screen for infection, anemia, or systemic illness that could contribute to muscle twitching [^112SaQBK].

- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: Evaluate electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium), renal, and hepatic function; electrolyte disturbances or organ dysfunction can cause muscle twitching.

- **Magnesium and phosphate levels**: Hypomagnesemia or hypophosphatemia can cause neuromuscular irritability and twitching.

---

### Endocrine evaluation

Assess **thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**, as hyper- or hypothyroidism can cause neuromuscular symptoms, including muscle twitching.

---

### Muscle injury markers

Measure **creatine kinase (CK)**; elevated levels may indicate muscle injury or rhabdomyolysis, which can present with muscle twitching.

---

### Medication and substance screening

If medication or substance use is suspected, consider a **toxicology screen**, as certain drugs (e.g. stimulants, antidepressants, antipsychotics) can cause muscle twitching. If the patient is on AEDs, check **antiepileptic drug (AED) levels** to ensure therapeutic dosing and to exclude toxicity or subtherapeutic levels.

---

## Additional diagnostic considerations

### Electroencephalography (EEG)

EEG is **not routinely indicated** for concussion, but consider it if seizures or epileptiform activity are suspected in the context of muscle twitching [^112ta3Gd] [^1157VhDB].

---

### Neuroimaging

MRI is **not routinely indicated** for concussion, but consider it if structural brain lesions are suspected or if symptoms persist beyond the expected recovery period [^112vZbkZ] [^114Lbksa] [^112NVNBq].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **VA/DoD guidelines**: Routine laboratory testing is not recommended for concussion alone; labs should be guided by clinical suspicion of alternative diagnoses or complications [^1135sA1v].

- **EAST guidelines**: Routine biochemical markers (e.g. S100, NSE, serum tau) are not recommended for concussion evaluation outside research settings [^115UA9xb].

- **CDC guidelines**: Biomarker measurements are not recommended outside research settings for pediatric mTBI [^114Nqyfs].

## Summary table of recommended laboratory tests

| **Laboratory test** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| CBC | Infection, anemia, systemic illness [^112SaQBK] |
| CMP | Electrolyte imbalance, renal/hepatic dysfunction [^113so4BG] |
| Magnesium, phosphate | Electrolyte imbalance causing neuromuscular irritability [^113so4BG] |
| TSH | Thyroid dysfunction [^112SaQBK] |
| CK | Muscle injury or rhabdomyolysis [^113so4BG] |
| Toxicology screen | Medication or substance-induced twitching |
| AED levels | Therapeutic dosing, toxicity, or subtherapeutic levels |

---

Laboratory testing is **not routinely indicated for concussion alone** [^1135sA1v] [^114Nqyfs], but muscle twitching warrants a **targeted evaluation** to exclude metabolic, endocrine, or medication-related causes [^112SaQBK]. Recommended tests include CBC, CMP, magnesium, phosphate, TSH, CK, a toxicology screen, and AED levels if applicable. **EEG and MRI** are reserved for specific clinical suspicions [^1157VhDB] [^112vZbkZ].

### Fluid biomarkers for mild traumatic brain injury and related conditions [^111mFdDj]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), also known as concussion, remain a major unmet clinical need. Moderate to severe TBI can be diagnosed definitively by clinical assessment and standard neuroimaging techniques that detect the gross damage to the brain parenchyma. However, diagnostic tools for mild TBI are lacking, and currently, the diagnosis has to be made on clinical grounds alone because most patients show no gross pathological changes on CT. Most patients with mild TBI recover quickly, but about 15% develop an ill-defined condition called postconcussive syndrome (PCS).

Repeated concussions have been associated with a chronic neurodegenerative disorder called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which can currently only be diagnosed post mortem. Fluid biomarkers are needed to better define and detect mild TBI and related conditions. Here, we review the literature on fluid biomarkers for neuronal, axonal, oligodendrocytic, astroglial, and blood-brain barrier injury, as well as markers for neuroinflammation and metabolic dysregulation, in the context of mild TBI, PCS, and CTE. We also discuss technical and standardization issues and potential pathways to advance the most promising biomarker candidates into clinical laboratory practice.

### Brain vital signs detect concussion-related neurophysiological impairments in ice hockey [^1153Wzbi]. Brain (2019). Low credibility.

Concussion in sport is a global public health issue. There are between 1.6 million and 3.8 million sport-related concussions per year in the United States alone. Concussions occur frequently in collision sports such as ice hockey, where players routinely sustain both direct head contact and indirect force transmission to the brain as a result of body checking, incidental or illegal collisions, and fighting. There is a growing concern because a history of concussion is potentially associated with persistent mental health and cognitive impairments later in life in some athletes and may result in an increased risk of progressive neurodegenerative disease.

- **Subconcussive impacts**: Recent evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts can accumulate over time to create functional and structural brain impairment, historically thought to occur only in acute concussive injuries. There is no known objective assessment designed specifically to measure the effects of subconcussive impacts. Indeed, concussion protocols are based on an affirmative concern of injury.

- **Need for objective evaluations**: Accurate clinical decision-making is important for sport-related concussion management to achieve the goal of safely returning an athlete to play as soon as possible. Neural tissue requires sufficient time to heal after injury, and athletes are susceptible to potentially far more severe re-injury if cleared to return before fully recovered. However, there is mounting evidence demonstrating that neurophysiological impairments persist even after the observable clinical signs.

### Expert opinion and controversies in sports and musculoskeletal medicine: Concussion in the young athlete [^113jufZq]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Concussion is a common injury in young athletes and can be very challenging for clinicians to diagnose and manage. Debate exists not only over the incidence of long-term risks of multiple concussions but also the potential for catastrophic outcomes after sports-related head injury. Decisions on returning athletes to competition can be difficult, and there are limited prospective data on which to make these decisions. This has resulted in numerous published guidelines and consensus statements on the management of concussion in athletes. Athletes sustaining a concussion need appropriate on-field care and structured follow-up. Baseline cognitive assessments can be helpful, but clinicians must be aware that head trauma may result in a wide array of clinical signs and symptoms. Delivery of care and decisions on return to play need to be based on an individual assessment of the affected athlete.

### Post-concussion symptoms rule: Derivation and validation of a clinical decision rule for early prediction of persistent symptoms following a mild traumatic brain injury [^113oed6d]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Low credibility.

Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), commonly known as concussion, is a frequent problem. The Public Health Agency of Canada recently reported more than 5 million emergency department (ED) visits for head injuries between 2002 and 2017, 70% of which were due to concussions or mTBI. This situation is similar elsewhere; in the United States, approximately 2 million people suffer an mTBI each year, and worldwide, mTBI represents approximately 70–80% of all TBIs. Patients with mTBI often suffer from post-concussion symptoms such as headache, dizziness, and concentration problems, which can impede the return to normal function.

Although post-concussion symptoms are usually transient, prevalence rates of persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) have been reported in between 13 and 62% of patients, depending on diagnostic criteria. Prolonged symptoms lead to time lost from work, social costs, and adverse impact on quality of life. Early interventions, individualized neuropsychological interventions, and interdisciplinary interventions seem to reduce the frequency, intensity, and duration of PPCS and may facilitate the recovery of daily activities and return to work. Unfortunately, predicting long-term mTBI symptoms is challenging in the ED since emergency physicians' diagnostic accuracy for predicting full recovery or PPCS at 3 months post-injury is no better than chance.

### Implementation of the 2017 Berlin concussion in sport group consensus statement in contact and collision sports: A joint position statement from 11 national and international sports organisations [^114PRxb9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The fundamental starting point for the clinician is to make the diagnosis of concussion. Accurate and timely diagnosis may help facilitate earlier recovery, reduce the risk of early complications, and avoid further head and musculoskeletal injuries. Making an accurate diagnosis is both important and challenging because of concussion's varied and sometimes subtle presentation. Symptoms overlap with other musculoskeletal, psychological, and neurological diagnoses, and a lack of definitive investigations or diagnostic markers raises challenges. Because of these issues, concussion remains a clinical diagnosis.

The first step in diagnosing concussion is to identify the potential injury and evaluate the athlete. At all playing levels of all collision sports, a concussion evaluation is triggered when an athlete is identified as having experienced a forceful impact, directly or indirectly, transmitted to the head and associated with:

- **Symptoms reported by the athlete**: Immediate symptoms such as headache or dizziness.
- **Visible signs**: Observable indicators like confusion or unsteady posture.
- **Any clinical suspicion by medical staff**: Initial assessment by medical professionals based on observed or reported symptoms.

Match officials may also report possible concussion to team clinicians. Some sports have implemented education programmes aimed at training match officials to recognize possible concussion, prompting them to stop the game and notify the appropriate team clinicians.

In community-level sport, there may not be adequately trained medical staff present. In this situation, any suspicion by a match official, coach, athletic trainer, first aider, or dedicated observer should result in the removal of the athlete from the field.

### Sideline concussion assessment: The current state of the art [^11537mX9]. Neurosurgery (2020). Low credibility.

More than 200 million American adults and children participate in organized physical activity. Growing awareness has highlighted that concussions, especially when repeated, may be associated with prolonged neurological, cognitive, and/or neuropsychiatric sequelae. Objective diagnosis of concussion remains challenging. Although some concussion symptoms may be apparent even to nonmedical observers, diagnosis and removal from play for evaluation depend on validated assessment tools and trained, vigilant healthcare personnel.

Over the past two decades, sideline concussion measures have undergone significant revision and augmentation to become more comprehensive batteries. These batteries are designed to detect a wide spectrum of symptomatology, such as neurocognitive function, postconcussive symptoms, gait/balance, and saccadic eye movements. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art concussion evaluation instruments, ranging from the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) to tools that may enhance concussion detection, to near-term blood-based biomarkers and emerging technology (e.g. head impact sensors, vestibulo-ocular/eye-tracking, and mobile applications).

- **Feasibility, utility, generalizability, and challenges**: Special focus is directed at the feasibility, utility, generalizability, and challenges to implementation of each measure on-field and on the sidelines. This review finds that few instruments beyond the SCAT provide guidance for removal from play. Establishing thresholds for concussion detection and removal from play in the qualification/validation of future instruments is of high importance. Integration of emerging sideline concussion evaluation measures remains critical to improving the standard of care.

### Time trends in concussion symptom presentation and assessment methods in high school athletes [^115JB9fA]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Concussion rates have increased significantly over the past decade. This may reflect an increase in the knowledge and diagnosis of the symptoms of a concussion rather than a true increase in incidence. Assessing trends in the way that concussions are presenting to and being identified by clinicians over the same period may provide additional insight into the apparent rise in concussions.

- **Purpose**: To evaluate patterns of change in concussion symptom presentation, diagnostic/evaluation methods, and symptom resolution time reported for United States high school athletes from the 2007–2008 through 2014–2015 academic years.

- **Study design**: Descriptive epidemiology study.

- **Methods**: This study is a retrospective analysis of a web-based longitudinal high school sports injury surveillance database (High School RIO [Reporting Information Online]) collected from 2007–2008 through 2014–2015. For each concussion, athletic trainers entered data regarding symptom presentation, resolution time, and diagnostic/evaluation tools utilized. Academic year was the primary exposure in assessing each aim. Time trends were then assessed using linear regression or the Cochran-Armitage test for trends, depending on the outcome distribution.

- **Results**: The proportion of concussed athletes presenting with amnesia, loss of consciousness (LOC), and tinnitus significantly decreased from 2007–2008 through 2014–2015, while the proportion presenting with drowsiness, irritability, light sensitivity, and noise sensitivity increased significantly. The use of diagnostic radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computerized tomography was examined.

### Concussions and their consequences: Current diagnosis, management and prevention [^1161pb2o]. CMAJ (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on concussion:

- **Definition**: Concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) induced by direct or indirect biomechanical force transmitted to the head. It is characterized by reversible symptoms such as dizziness, headache, nausea, imbalance, and loss of consciousness.

- **Pathophysiology**: Concussion results from biomechanical force transmitted to the head, occurring in settings such as the work environment, motor vehicle crashes, sports and recreational activities, and falls at home among the elderly.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include dizziness, headache, nausea, imbalance, loss of consciousness, and occasionally malignant brain swelling. Repeated concussions may cause post-traumatic epilepsy, postconcussion syndrome, and delayed post-traumatic brain degeneration, leading to dementia and movement disorders.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Concussion is associated with increased mortality risk in the elderly, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16–1.34).

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^1145sWrh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

We developed a list of key findings in 'Summary of findings' tables and determined the certainty in the summary estimates for each test and findings, using the GRADE approach (Schünemann 2020a; Schünemann 2020b). Starting at high certainty, we downgraded meta-analyses by one level when at least half of the studies had a high risk of bias on one or more domains. We downgraded for indirectness when at least half of the studies in the meta-analyses had high concerns regarding applicability on at least one domain. We downgraded for imprecision when fewer people with the target condition were included than would have been needed to achieve the sensitivity estimates listed, with a confidence interval width of at most 10 percentage points. Additionally, we downgraded for inconsistency when study estimates differed more than 20 percentage points from each other; however, we did not consider publication bias to be a problem.

We will undertake weekly searches of published literature, preprints, and new test approvals. Depending on the number of new and important studies found, we will consider updating each review with each search if resources allow.

### Concussion management in combat sports: Consensus statement from the Association of Ringside Physicians [^114bg5kN]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In addition to the above-mentioned periods of suspension, we recommend that a combat sports athlete's suspension continue until a specialist physician trained in concussion management clears the fighter. Specialist physicians trained in concussion management include neurologists, neurosurgeons, and primary care sports medicine physicians.

- **Other baseline testing**: We recommend that all combat sports athletes undertake a validated NP evaluation with the initial test serving as a baseline. If possible, vestibular/ocular and balance baseline testing are also recommended. Repeat baseline testing should occur annually. If there is any decline, it is recommended that a physician trained in brain injuries and concussion management evaluate the athlete.

- **Education**: We recommend that all combat sports athletes and their coaches/trainers be educated and trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of concussion. If a combat sports athlete experiences any signs or symptoms of a concussion during training or competition, they should remove themselves from contact activities and seek immediate evaluation by a healthcare professional.

### Recent advances in pediatric concussion and mild traumatic brain injury [^113so4BG]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). High credibility.

Concussions following a head injury among children continue to be a substantial public health concern. An increasing number of concussions are being managed initially by primary care physicians. The diagnosis of concussion remains a clinical diagnosis despite the availability of ancillary tests such as computerized neuropsychological testing, advanced imaging, and blood biomarkers. Clinically, overlooking other injuries and comorbidities may lead to prolonged recovery for the patient. Addressing concussions with a multidisciplinary approach may help in reducing recovery time for patients. Retirement from sport in the pediatric population remains a controversial issue lacking evidence-based studies.

### Sensitivity of the concussion assessment battery [^111sWRmp]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Sports medicine clinicians commonly use multiple tests when evaluating patients with concussion. The specific tests vary but often include symptom inventories, posturography, and neurocognitive examinations. The sensitivity of these tests to concussion is vital in reducing the risk for additional injury by prematurely returning an athlete to play. Our study investigated the sensitivity of concussion-related symptoms, a postural control evaluation, and neurocognitive functioning in concussed collegiate athletes.

- **Methods**: From 1998 to 2005, all high-risk athletes completed a baseline concussion-assessment battery that consisted of a self-reported symptom inventory, a postural control evaluation, and a neurocognitive assessment. Postconcussion assessments were administered within 24 hours of injury to 75 athletes who had physician-diagnosed concussion. Individual tests and the complete battery were evaluated for sensitivity to concussion.

- **Results**: The computerized Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing and HeadMinder Concussion Resolution Index (neurocognitive tests) were the most sensitive to concussion (79.2% and 78.6%, respectively). These tests were followed by self-reported symptoms (68.0%), the postural control evaluation (61.9%), and a brief pencil-and-paper assessment of neurocognitive function (43.5%). When the complete battery was assessed, sensitivity exceeded 90%.

- **Conclusion**: Currently recommended concussion-assessment batteries accurately identified decrements in one or more areas in most of the athletes with concussion.

### Implementation of the 2017 Berlin concussion in sport group consensus statement in contact and collision sports: A joint position statement from 11 national and international sports organisations [^117FgJHC]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A number of sporting codes refer to mandatory or discretionary visible signs of concussion, which may guide the immediate course of action. Mandatory and discretionary signs may differ, as may the course of action. In some sports, such as AFL, NFL, NRL, and rugby, mandatory signs indicate immediate removal from the field of play. Conversely, in sports like the NHL, mandatory signs require a mandatory off-field evaluation.

A mandatory or discretionary sign, when combined with a mechanism of injury involving head contact, significantly increases the likelihood of diagnosing a concussion.

It is possible to diagnose concussion immediately; however, due to delayed presentation, excluding a diagnosis of concussion may take up to 48 hours following head contact. During this period — whether the athlete continues to play or not — serial evaluations, as described in the Berlin Consensus Statement, should be conducted by a medical practitioner. The Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT5), either complete or in part, and the Concussion Recognition Tool (CRT5) should be used to initiate or conduct initial evaluations. The SCAT5 should be used for serial evaluations, as described in the 'Management on and around the field of play' section.

The 'stunned' athlete, who has very short-lived temporary signs or symptoms that fall within the definition of concussion, could have a pathologic condition.

### Concussion management in combat sports: consensus statement from the Association of Ringside Physicians [^115Yi5Zf]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

For phases 1 and 2, there should be at least 24 hours or longer for each step of the progression. If any symptoms worsen during exercise, the athlete should go back to the previous step. Phase 3 should be started when concussion symptoms have resolved, and the athlete has completed phases 1 and 2. If symptoms are persistent (e.g. more than 10 days), the athlete should be referred to a healthcare professional who is an expert in the management of concussion.

The majority of non-combat sports concussion protocols at both amateur and professional levels require evaluation and clearance by a healthcare provider trained in concussion management before returning to contact or competition. The Association of Ringside Physicians also believes such a practice should be applied in combat sports. If a combat sports athlete is experiencing concussion signs and symptoms 30 minutes after their bout or lost their bout by knockout via strikes to the head, it is most likely the athlete has sustained a concussion. Accordingly, they should be evaluated and cleared by a healthcare provider skilled in concussion management before returning to contact or competition. The specialist clearance should be in addition to the recommended minimal day suspensions.

Neuropsychological (NP) baseline testing is a helpful tool in making decisions regarding a return to fighting in combat sports athletes who have sustained a concussion. NP testing is also helpful for screening for neurological decline over the course of a combatant's career. Computerized NP baseline testing is now widely available.

### Concussions and their consequences: Current diagnosis, management and prevention [^113tzw2x]. CMAJ (2013). High credibility.

Concussions, a complex disease, can be associated with various symptoms and conditions.

- **Symptoms in children and adolescents**: Retinal hemorrhage, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, headache, anxiety, seizure, agitation, anisocoria, neck pain, slurred speech, depression, emotional lability, and vomiting.

- **Cognitive and behavioral effects**: Memory impairment, aggressive behavior, dizziness, confusion, loss of balance, difficulty concentrating, irritability, impulsivity, numbness, and disorientation.

- **Physical and sensory symptoms**: Fatigue, nausea, blurred vision, diplopia, photophobia, phonophobia, tinnitus, hearing loss, insomnia, and sleeping disorders.

- **Associated factors**: Alcohol consumption, sports participation, head injury, cervical spine injury, scalp laceration, and falls.

Proper understanding of these symptoms and associated factors is crucial for effective diagnosis, management, and prevention of concussions.

### Diagnostic predictive values for sport-related concussions: A systematic review and diagnostic meta-analysis [^1179xhUJ]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2024). Low credibility.

Sport-related concussions (SRCs) can cause significant neurological symptoms, and approximately 10%-15% of athletes with SRC experience a prolonged recovery. Given the lack of visible injury on brain imaging and their varied presentations, concussions can be difficult to diagnose. A variety of tests and examination methods have been used to elicit a concussion diagnosis; however, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are variable. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of standardized tests and visible signs like balance and vision changes in the diagnosis of SRC.

- **Methods**: A PRISMA-adherent systematic review of concussion diagnostic examinations was performed using the PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases on December 1, 2022. Search terms included "concussion", "traumatic brain injury", "diagnosis", "sensitivity", and "specificity". Each method of examination was categorized into larger group-based symptomatologic presentations or standardized tools. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of concussion. Pooled specificity and sensitivity for each method were calculated using a meta-analysis of proportion and were hierarchically ranked using P-scores calculated from a diagnostic frequentist network meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Thirty full-length articles were identified for inclusion, 13 of which evaluated grouped symptomology examinations (balance and overall clinical presentation) and 17 of which evaluated established formalized tools (ImPACT, King-Devick, etc).

### Central nervous system trauma management of concussions in athletes [^113ATDsU]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The care of athletes with concussions is challenging because each patient presents different symptoms. An athlete should never be returned to play until completely asymptomatic. Classification systems for concussions are not based on scientific evidence and represent some practitioners' best guess at what is safe for young athletes.

Many experienced team physicians believe they can safely allow an athlete to play if there are no symptoms at rest and none with increasing intensity of exercise. Abbreviated neuropsychological testing and balance tests show promise for use in the field to increase the sensitivity of neurological evaluation for injured athletes. Any neuropsychological or balance evaluation is more helpful if baseline data is collected on athletes before they are injured.

### Sport-related concussion [^115FnDqy]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Sport-related concussion is a common injury in children and adolescents. Athletes seldom report concussive symptoms, making diagnosis a challenge. The management of sport-related concussion has evolved significantly over the years. Previously used grading systems and return-to-play guidelines have been abandoned for more individualized assessment and management. Neuropsychological testing is being used more frequently to aid in management.

Proper assessment and management of a sport-related concussion are crucial because repeat concussions can lead to decreased neurocognitive functioning, increased symptomatology, and, at times, catastrophic outcomes. After recovery, it is recommended that an athlete's return-to-play progress in a gradual, stepwise fashion while being monitored by a healthcare provider.

### Diagnostic accuracy and reliability of sideline concussion evaluation: a prospective, case-controlled study in college athletes comparing newer tools and established tests [^113kzb49]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

To assess the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of sideline concussion tests in college athletes, athletes completed baseline concussion tests. These included the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale, Standardised Assessment of Concussion (SAC), modified Balance Error Scoring System (m-BESS), King-Devick test, and EYE-SYNC Smooth Pursuits. Testing was repeated in athletes diagnosed acutely with concussion and compared to a matched teammate without concussion.

Data were collected on 41 concussed athletes and 41 matched controls. Test-retest reliability for symptom score and symptom severity, assessed using control athletes, was 0.09 (-0.70 to 0.88) and 0.08 (-1.00 to 1.00) (unweighted kappa), respectively. Intraclass correlations were as follows: SAC 0.33 (-0.02 to 0.61), m-BESS 0.33 (-0.2 to 0.60), EYE-SYNC Smooth Pursuit tangential variability 0.70 (0.50 to 0.83), radial variability 0.47 (0.19 to 0.69), and King-Devick test 0.71 (0.49 to 0.84).

- **Sensitivity and specificity**:
	- The maximum identified sensitivity/specificity of each test for predicting clinical concussion diagnosis was: symptom score 81%/94% (3-point increase), symptom severity score 91%/81% (3-point increase), SAC 44%/72% (2-point decline), m-BESS 40%/92% (5-point increase), King-Devick 85%/76% (any increase in time), and EYE-SYNC Smooth Pursuit tangential variability 48%/58% and radial variability 52%/61% (any increase).

- **Adjusted area under the curve**:
	- Symptom score 0.95 (0.89, 0.99), symptom severity 0.95 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.99), SAC 0.66 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.79), m-BESS 0.71 (0.60, 0.83), King-Devick 0.78 (0.69, 0.87), radial variability 0.47 (0.34, 0.59).

### Living concussion guidelines: Guideline for concussion & prolonged symptoms for adults 18 years of age or older: 2017 April update [^115GcEJ3]. ConcussionsOntario (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for concussion, specifically with respect to the assessment of cognitive difficulties, the LCG 2017 guidelines recommend assessing for the presence of cognitive difficulties in patients with a history of concussion. It is important to consider the impact of these difficulties on functional areas, such as performance at work or school and completing tasks within the home and community. Conducting a focused clinical interview about symptoms is advised, along with the use of a validated post-concussion questionnaire. Suggested questionnaires include the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms, the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale, or the SCAT5, to assess and track symptoms.

### Ocular motor assessment in concussion: Current status and future directions [^11137UyL]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2016). Low credibility.

Mild head injuries, such as concussions and subconcussive repetitive impacts, may lead to subtle changes in brain function. It is imperative to find sensitive and reliable tests to detect such changes. Tests involving the visual system, particularly eye movements, can incorporate higher cortical functioning and involve diffuse pathways in the brain, including many areas susceptible to head impact.

With concussions, the clinical neuro-ophthalmic exam is important for detecting abnormalities in vergence, saccades, pursuit, and visual fixation. On the sidelines, the King-Devick test has been used as a visual performance measure that incorporates eye movements and increases sensitivity in detecting possible concussions, in conjunction with standard sideline tests of cognition, symptom checklists, and balance. Much promise lies in the eye movement laboratory to quantify changes in saccades and pursuit with concussions using video-oculography.

A combination of eye movement tasks coupled with neuroimaging techniques and other objective biomarkers may lead to a better understanding of the anatomical and physiological consequences of concussion and the natural history of this condition.

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC / mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: A consensus statement [^112ta3Gd]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Electrophysiological tests evaluate electrical activity in the brain using EEG and evoked potentials. While this is an area of active research, there is currently not enough evidence to recommend their utility in the diagnosis and treatment of SRC.

It is essential that the team physician understand that:

- **Diagnosis of SRC**: The diagnosis of SRC remains a clinical diagnosis. There are tools and tests that may aid in its assessment but are not to be used as standalone measures.

- **Neuroimaging**: The indications for neuroimaging in athletes.

It is desirable that the team physician understand:

- **Neurocognitive testing**: Formal neurocognitive testing is not required but can provide useful information for baseline and post-injury assessment, and aid in making return-to-learn (RTL) and return-to-play (RTP) decisions.

- **Testing indications and limitations**: Indications for and limitations of neurocognitive and neuropsychological testing, and the difference between the two.

- **Oculomotor function impairment**: Impairment in oculomotor function may occur in SRC.

- **Video review utility**: The data from the spotter/video review process have been shown to be helpful in elite adult male athletes.

- **Research tools**: Serum biomarkers, genetic testing, advanced neuroimaging, and electrophysiologic testing are research tools.

- **Education**: The need to educate the athletic care network on the various testing paradigms that exist in the diagnosis of concussion.

Neurological sequelae of brain injury include some medical conditions that may be of concern to the team physician and may or may not be related to SRC. These conditions include:

- Concussive convulsion
- Second-impact syndrome/diffuse cerebral oedema
- Repeat SRC
- Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)

### Implementation of the 2017 Berlin concussion in sport group consensus statement in contact and collision sports: a joint position statement from 11 national and international sports organisations [^113cy8Ez]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). High credibility.

The timing of return to sport is often the most important issue for athletes, coaches, and parents. Clinicians face the challenge of helping the athlete return at the appropriate time that does not compromise the athlete's health or performance.

At all participation levels (professional, elite, community/recreational), an athlete who is diagnosed with a concussion should not be permitted to return to sport on the day the concussion is sustained. All athletes diagnosed with a concussion should undergo serial clinical evaluations in the days following the injury.

Athletes participating at the elite level, who are removed from the playing arena with a suspected head injury but are not diagnosed with a concussion following a multifaceted, SCAT5-based assessment performed by an experienced clinician, may return to the game.

Even if no diagnosis of concussion has been made, athletes removed from sport with suspected concussion should undergo serial re-evaluations for up to 48 hours due to the possibility of delayed symptom onset. For the athlete who is diagnosed with a concussion, monitoring should continue at regular intervals until the athlete is cleared to return to sport.

- **Criteria for return to sport after concussion in team collision sport**: Athletes who have been diagnosed with a concussion may only return to sport after:
	- Concussion-related symptom scores, at rest and with match-intensity exercise, have returned to baseline levels.
	- Neurological examination (including balance testing) is normal.
	- Cognitive testing (computerised assessment) is complete.

Concussion in youth athletes is a growing problem worldwide. During the past decade, significant progress has been made in the standardization of the assessment of young athletes. A growing appreciation of metabolic vulnerability, activity, and cognitive challenges has led to guidelines and suggestions for rest from the field, as well as cognitive rest from school. Outcome data have begun to establish groups linked to symptom class, genetics, and sex who are at risk of worse outcomes from concussions. Decisions regarding return to activity are now based on at-rest symptoms, graded increases in activity, and neuropsychological testing. Using the case of Ms. X, a 15-year-old otherwise healthy high school student who fell while skiing, evaluation, prognosis, and management of concussion are discussed.

- **Premorbid history**: A history of prior mTBI may affect recovery time.
- **Cognitive ability**: Lower cognitive ability, especially in patients with an intracranial lesion, may result in a prolonged recovery.
- **Neurological or psychiatric disorder**: The presence of such disorders can delay recovery.
- **Learning difficulties**: These can interfere with the recovery process.
- **Pre-injury symptoms**: Increased pre-injury symptoms can contribute to a prolonged recovery period.
- **Family and social stressors**: Stressors in the family or social environment may impact recovery.

It is essential that both patients and their families understand these factors to better manage expectations and recovery strategies.

### Implementation of the 2017 Berlin concussion in sport group consensus statement in contact and collision sports: A joint position statement from 11 national and international sports organisations [^117KbUzk]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). High credibility.

An advanced care setting is an enhanced, well-resourced clinical environment where individualized management of athletes can occur. Such a setting should be in place when contemplating a faster return to sport and is the most appropriate environment for managing more complicated cases.

- **Key characteristics of an advanced care setting include access to**:
	- A medical doctor experienced in concussion management (specializations in sport medicine, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology, or neurosurgery).
	- Computerized and/or formal neuropsychological evaluation.
	- Oculomotor and cervicovestibular evaluation and rehabilitation.

Where advanced care settings are not available, some sports advise compulsory, age-specific stand-down periods where physical activity is limited to below the symptom threshold.

- **Specialist testing that may characterize advanced care settings**:
	- Neuropsychological testing is a useful adjunct to the medical evaluation of concussion.
	- Formal neuropsychological testing conducted by a neuropsychologist is the gold standard in certain situations:
		- An accelerated return to sport within one month.
		- Complex cases, such as athletes with a history of multiple concussions.
		- Athletes with pre-existing comorbidities, such as psychological or psychiatric conditions.
		- Decisions regarding athlete retirement for the season or career.

If a specialist neuropsychologist is not available, supervised computerized testing batteries and additional expert clinical opinion should be employed for concussed athletes who return to sport in fewer than seven days.

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC|mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: a consensus statement [^116iiS8q]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Obtain a more detailed history and perform a more detailed physical examination. A distraction-free environment optimizes the evaluation. Assess for cognitive, somatic, and affective signs and symptoms of SRC with particular attention paid to the number and severity of symptoms because of their prognostic significance. Perform and repeat neurological assessments, with particular emphasis on cognitive function, cranial nerve, and balance testing until the athlete is stable (e.g. SCAT).

Athletes with suspected SRC should be immediately removed from practice or competition. If no licensed healthcare provider is present to evaluate the athlete with suspected SRC, there is no return to play (RTP) even if symptoms resolve. If SRC is confirmed by a licensed healthcare provider, there is no same-day RTP. If evaluated by a licensed healthcare provider who determines an SRC did not occur, same-day RTP is an option. The athlete should not be left unsupervised until a disposition decision is made. Determine disposition for symptomatic and asymptomatic athletes, including serial assessments and post-injury follow-up (options include home with observation or transport to hospital). Provide post-event instructions to the athlete and others (e.g. medications, driving, alcohol, physical and cognitive exertion, and medical follow-up). Final determination regarding SRC diagnosis and management is a medical decision based on clinical judgment.

It is essential the team physician:

- **Know the signs and symptoms** of suspected SRC.
- **Recognize red flags** (signs and symptoms and a protocol for emergency hospital transport).

During the preseason period, prior to any practice or competition, the emergency action plan (EAP) should be developed or reviewed, and preparticipation assessment should be performed. The EAP and assessments should include protocols and policies for the recognition and acute management of SRC.

Each organization should develop SRC protocols and policies including:

- **Definition of SRC**: Clear criteria for what constitutes a sport-related concussion.

- **Education**: Recognizing signs and symptoms of SRC and understanding the role of equipment. Strategies should be in place to avoid high-risk play behaviors, such as leading with the head.

- **Diagnosis**: Only a licensed healthcare provider can diagnose an SRC.

- **Acute sideline and post-injury management** should be outlined.

- **Return to learn (RTL) and return to play (RTP)**: Establish guidelines for returning to academics and sports.

Athletes, coaches, parents, administrators, referees, and healthcare providers should be educated about SRC. This education should be consistent with state law, governing body, and school district requirements.

Preparticipation assessments should include:

- **Personal history**: Consideration of prior SRC or brain injury, prior cervical spine injury, history of migraines, seizure disorder and other neurological diseases, learning disabilities, ADHD, depression or other mood disorders. Additionally, there should be consideration of medications, supplements, alcohol, and drug use.

The utility of, and necessity for, baseline assessments is still being researched. When performed, baseline assessments should include a symptom checklist, cognitive function evaluation, balance/postural stability assessment, and other components of the neurological examination, such as the most recent Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT).

### Post-concussion symptoms rule: Derivation and validation of a clinical decision rule for early prediction of persistent symptoms following a mild traumatic brain injury [^115QUKR1]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Low credibility.

To better identify patients who would most benefit from follow-up, some predictive models have been proposed, but to our knowledge, none were externally prospectively validated, and no evidence-based guidelines have been proposed. Consequently, there is a pressing need for ED clinicians to have access to a fast and reliable clinical decision rule (CDR) to predict PPCS in adults who sustained a mTBI.

The main objective of this study was to derive and validate a CDR, called the PoCS Rule (Post-Concussion Symptoms Rule), to predict PPCS 90 days after an mTBI. The secondary objectives were to validate the PoCS Rule for the prediction of PPCS, using other definitions and non-return to work/school at 90 days.

### Considerations for diagnosis and management of concussion [^11687uGt]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Concussion is an ongoing concern for health care providers. The incidence rates continue to be high, and the rate of recovery is variable due to potential risk factors. Without valid biomarkers, diagnosis and assessment of concussion remain a clinical challenge. The heterogeneity in presentation following injury provides an additional level of complexity, requiring the screening and evaluation of diverse body systems, including oculomotor, vestibular, autonomic, psychiatric, cervical, and cognitive symptoms.

While a few tools, such as the Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening and the Balance Error Scoring System, have been specifically developed for concussion, the vast majority of tests are adapted from other conditions. Further complicating the process is the overlapping and interactive nature of the multiple domains of post-concussion presentation. This commentary illustrates how clinicians can conceptualize the multiple profiles that present following concussion and describes tools that are available to assist with screening and evaluation of each area. The multifaceted nature of concussion warrants broad clinical screening skills and an interdisciplinary approach to management.

In regard to follow-up and surveillance for concussion, particularly concerning the evaluation of prolonged symptoms, the LCG 2023 guidelines recommend documenting prolonged symptoms following a concussion. This should be done using a standardized symptom assessment scale, such as the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire or the SCAT5, at follow-up appointments until concussion symptoms improve or stabilize.

### Implementation of the 2017 Berlin concussion in sport group consensus statement in contact and collision sports: A joint position statement from 11 national and international sports organisations [^117KDjAe]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Where independent medical personnel are present at the game, they may override team clinicians' decisions and immediately and permanently remove a player from the field (e.g. in rugby union). In other sports (e.g. NFL), the independent unaffiliated neurological consultant provides a second opinion, and the team clinician is responsible for the final decisions regarding diagnosis and removal from sport. The team clinician is recognized as the person most knowledgeable about the athlete's baseline status and may be in a more favorable position to recognize subtle signs of concussion. Such signs include changes in athlete behavior or attitude, which may not be detected by independent neurological consultants. The NFL recognizes that within every medical team, one expert must make a final decision regarding athlete care. In cases of concussion, the team clinician is the expert. The team clinicians' decisions regarding return to sport should not be interfered with or challenged by non-medical personnel.

At the professional and elite levels, team clinicians typically have the final say in return-to-sport decisions post-concussion, although they can choose to seek consultant support for shared decision-making. In all settings, even where theoretically the independent clinician's opinion may be overriding, communication and collaboration among clinicians is strongly encouraged and can be a benefit of the consultant system.

### Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline on the diagnosis and management of mild traumatic brain injury among children [^113m6apG]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for concussion, particularly in pediatric patients, the CDC 2018 guidelines recommend counseling patients and families. They should be informed that most (70–80%) pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) do not exhibit significant difficulties persisting for more than 1–3 months following the injury.

### Screening for orthostatic intolerance in symptomatic children presenting for concussion care [^113V4AD5]. Clinical Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Following a concussion, children often experience nonspecific symptoms that overlap with those of other common pediatric conditions, including orthostatic intolerance (OI). The primary goal of this study was to evaluate OI in youth presenting for clinical care for concussion and reporting symptoms frequently observed in OI. Eighty-two of 114 patients aged 10 to 22 years endorsed symptoms based on 8 screening questions, and 24 of those 82 patients met criteria for OI based on an active standing test. No screening question generated clinically useful likelihood ratios for predicting OI. The prevalence of OI in this cohort is considerably higher than estimates in the general pediatric population, suggesting a link between concussion and OI. Future work is needed to evaluate the best method of testing for OI, the natural history of OI symptoms in youth with concussion, and the response to intervention in children with both concussion and OI.

### Prevalence of invalid performance on baseline testing for sport-related concussion by age and validity indicator [^113NqRoF]. JAMA Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The estimated base rates of invalid performance on baseline testing (base rates of failure) for the management of sport-related concussion range from 6.1% to 40.0%, depending on the validity indicator used. The instability of this key measure represents a challenge in the clinical interpretation of test results that could undermine the utility of baseline testing.

- **Objectives**: To determine the prevalence of invalid performance on baseline testing and to assess whether the prevalence varies as a function of age and validity indicator.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included data collected between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2016, from a clinical referral center in the Midwestern United States. Participants included 7,897 consecutively tested, equivalently proportioned male and female athletes aged 10 to 21 years, who completed baseline neurocognitive testing for the purpose of concussion management.

- **Interventions**: Baseline assessment was conducted with the Immediate Postconcussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT), a computerized neurocognitive test designed for assessment of concussion.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Base rates of failure on published ImPACT validity indicators were compared within and across age groups. Hypotheses were developed after data collection but prior to analyses.

- **Results**: Of the 7,897 study participants, 4,086 (51.7%) were male. The mean (SD) age was 14.71 (1.78) years, 7,820 (99.0%) were primarily English speaking, and the mean (SD) educational level was 8.79 (1.68) years.

### Preliminary use of the Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs for detecting subtle motor signs in adolescents with sport-related concussion [^116LwAHq]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Sensitive examination tools are needed to optimize evaluation after sports-related concussion. The Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs was preliminarily examined for sensitivity to motor changes in a pilot cohort of adolescents aged 13–17 years with sports-related concussion. A total of 15 adolescents (5 female) with sports-related concussion were evaluated up to three times: within 2 weeks of injury, approximately 1 month later (mean, 35 days between visits), and, for those not recovered at the second visit, again after clinical recovery (mean, 70 days between the first and last visits for all participants). Comparison data were acquired from 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control athletes with no history of concussion who were evaluated twice (mean, 32 days apart).

Main effects of group, time, and interaction effects were evaluated with an analysis of covariance, which controlled for socioeconomic status, times tested, and days between testing sessions. Adolescents with concussion had poorer Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs performance than controls did at all time points. Performance improved between visits within the concussion group, with no change within the control group. These findings suggest that the Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs merits additional study in larger cohorts and in combination with other markers of injury to facilitate an enhanced understanding of sports-related concussion and recovery.

### Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline on the diagnosis and management of mild traumatic brain injury among children [^111oBKyK]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). High credibility.

Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, in children is a rapidly growing public health concern because epidemiologic data indicate a marked increase in the number of emergency department visits for mTBI over the past decade. However, at the time of writing, no evidence-based clinical guidelines were developed for diagnosing and managing pediatric mTBI in the United States.

The objective of this guideline is to provide a framework based on a previous systematic review of the literature. It aims to obtain and assess evidence towards developing clinical recommendations for healthcare professionals related to the diagnosis, prognosis, and management or treatment of pediatric mTBI.

The evidence review was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Board of Scientific Counselors, a federal advisory committee. They established the Pediatric Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Guideline Workgroup. This workgroup drafted recommendations based on evidence obtained and assessed within the systematic review, related evidence, scientific principles, and expert inference. The information includes selected studies published since the initial evidence review deemed relevant by the workgroup. The initial literature search dates were January 1, 1990, to November 30, 2012, and the updated search took place from December 1, 2012, to July 31, 2015.

The findings of the CDC guideline include 19 sets of recommendations on the diagnosis, prognosis, and management or treatment of pediatric mTBI.

### Concussion in combination with whiplash-associated disorder may be missed in primary care: Key recommendations for assessment and management [^1147XNGn]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Whiplash and concussion may have similar presenting symptoms, biomechanical mechanisms, and neurophysiological sequelae, but neither enjoys a gold standard diagnostic test. Guidelines for whiplash and concussion are developed and implemented separately. This disparate process may contribute to misdiagnosis, delay appropriate primary care management, and impair patient outcomes.

In our clinical commentary, we present three cases where signs and symptoms consistent with whiplash were identified in primary care. Symptoms in all cases included neck pain, headache, dizziness, and concentration deficits, raising suspicion of coexisting postconcussion syndrome. All cases were referred for specialist physical therapy. Characteristics consistent with poor recovery in both whiplash and postconcussion syndrome were confirmed, and multidisciplinary management, drawing from both whiplash and concussion guidelines, was implemented.

All patients reported improvement in activities of daily living after tailored management addressing both neck and head injury-related factors, suggesting that these conditions were not mutually exclusive. Self-reported outcomes included reductions in neck disability and postconcussion symptoms of between 20% and 40%. It may be appropriate for whiplash and concussion guidelines to be amalgamated, enhanced, and mutually recognized on a patient-by-patient basis. Primary health care professionals might consider minimum screening to identify postconcussion syndrome in patients following motor vehicle collision by administering questionnaires and assessing.

### American medical society for sports medicine position statement: concussion in sport [^111ivaas]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The purpose of the statement is to provide an evidence-based, best practices summary to assist physicians with the evaluation and management of sports concussion. It also aims to establish the level of evidence, identify knowledge gaps, and highlight areas requiring additional research.

- **Importance of an AMSSM statement**: Sports medicine physicians are frequently involved in the care of patients with sports concussion. They are specifically trained to provide care along the continuum of sports concussion, from the acute injury phase to return-to-play (RTP) decisions. The care of athletes with sports concussion is ideally performed by healthcare professionals with specific training and experience in assessing and managing concussion. Competence should be determined by training and experience, not dictated by specialty. While this statement is directed towards sports medicine physicians, it may also assist other physicians and healthcare professionals in the care of patients with sports concussion.

- **Definition**: Concussion is defined as a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function and involves a complex pathophysiological process. It is a subset of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), which is generally self-limited and at the less-severe end of the brain injury spectrum.

- **Pathophysiology**: Animal and human studies support the concept of postconcussive vulnerability, showing that a second blow before the brain has recovered results in worsening metabolic changes within the cell. Experimental evidence suggests that the concussed brain is less responsive to subsequent impacts, emphasizing the importance of proper recovery before returning to activity.

### Living Concussion Guidelines: Guideline for Concussion & Prolonged Symptoms for Adults 18 years of Age or Older: 2022 August Update [^1175cf2e]. ConcussionsOntario (2022). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for concussion, more specifically with respect to general counseling, recovery, LCG 2022 guidelines recommend to counsel patients with a history of concussion that most patients typically experience a full recovery and return to usual activities within 1 month, while some patients may experience prolonged symptoms beyond this timeframe. Provide information and reassurance through both written and verbal education.

### Natural history of concussion in sport: Markers of severity and implications for management [^111TBXtT]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence-based clinical data are required for safe return to play after concussion in sport.

- **Purpose**: The objective of this study was to describe the natural history of concussion in sport and identify clinical features associated with more severe concussive injury, using return-to-sport decisions as a surrogate measure of injury severity.

- **Study design**: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 3.

- **Methods**: Male elite senior, elite junior, and community-based Australian Rules football players had pre-season baseline cognitive testing (Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Trail-Making Test-Part B, and CogSport computerized test battery). Players were recruited into the study after sustaining a concussive injury while playing football. Concussed players were tested serially until all clinical features of their injury had resolved.

- **Results**: Of 1,015 players, 88 concussions were observed in 78 players. Concussion-associated symptoms lasted an average of 48.6 hours (95% confidence interval, 39.5–57.7 hours), with delayed return to sport correlated with ≥ 4 symptoms, a headache lasting ≥ 60 hours, or self-reported "fatigue/fogginess". Cognitive deficits using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test and Trail-Making Test-Part B recovered concomitantly with symptoms, but computerized test results recovered 2 to 3 days later and remained impaired in 35% of concussed players after symptom resolution.

- **Conclusion**: Delayed return to sport was associated with initially greater symptom load, prolonged headache, or subjective concentration deficits.

### Evaluation and management of mild traumatic brain injury: An eastern association for the surgery of trauma practice management guideline [^112H1iXX]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for concussion, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging such as head CT, EAST 2012 guidelines recommend considering the use of standardized criteria (such as the Canadian CT Head Rule and the New Orleans Criteria) to determine the need for CT in patients with mTBI in resource-limited settings.
