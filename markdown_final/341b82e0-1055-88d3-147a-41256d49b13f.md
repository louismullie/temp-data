## Question

Children dosing Tylenol by weight

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acetaminophen (Tylenol) dosing for children by weight, including single-dose ranges, maximum daily limits, age-related nuances, route-specific adjustments, and practical safety steps to avoid errors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core weight-based dose and frequency. Then, I should verify the maximum daily dose and how it varies by age and route. Next, I will examine route-specific adjustments, especially rectal and IV dosing. After that, I need to check age-related considerations, including infants and adolescents. Finally, I will review safety, overdose thresholds, and practical administration guidance to minimize errors, and I will reconcile any conflicting data before concluding with a concise, clinically usable summary.

> Let me first confirm the foundational weight-based dose. For children, the standard oral acetaminophen dose is 10–15 mg/kg per dose, given every 4–6 hours as needed, which is consistently supported by FDA labeling and high-credibility pediatric guidelines from the ADA and AAP-aligned sources, and this applies to both fever and pain indications [^116zFvcT] [^114F4tFR] [^115s7iRt] [^115s7iRt].

> Wait, let me verify the maximum daily dose because I recall seeing conflicting numbers. The ADA and most pediatric sources cap the total daily dose at 75 mg/kg/day, and importantly, never to exceed 4,000 mg/day regardless of weight, which aligns with best-practice safety ceilings. However, some FDA entries list 100 mg/kg/day for older children, which I should reconcile carefully [^115s7iRt] [^115s7iRt] [^117RaCZ5] [^114F4tFR]. Hold on, I should verify the age split: for children older than 1 year, some FDA materials allow up to 100 mg/kg/day, but for infants 1 year and younger, the maximum is 75 mg/kg/day; given the ADA's more conservative and contemporary pediatric guidance, I will prioritize 75 mg/kg/day with an absolute cap of 4,000 mg/day for all children to ensure safety and consistency [^117RaCZ5] [^114F4tFR] [^11344m4G].

> I need to check route-specific adjustments next. For rectal administration, absorption is slower and less predictable, so higher per-dose amounts are sometimes used, with typical ranges of 10–20 mg/kg per dose and a commonly cited maximum of 100 mg/kg/day in some references; however, given variability and the lack of standardized rectal formulations in the U.S. I should emphasize that rectal dosing should follow product-specific instructions and clinical judgment, and many U.S. pediatric sources still advise not exceeding 75 mg/kg/day total acetaminophen from all routes [^116zFvcT] [^114WWLuo] [^11344m4G]. For IV acetaminophen in children 2–12 years, the labeled regimen is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum of 75 mg/kg/day, which is a different context and should not be mixed with oral dosing totals without careful accounting of all sources [^116E2Cwg] [^114qdSfS].

> Let me consider age-related nuances. For infants 1 year and younger, I should confirm the stricter daily maximum of 75 mg/kg/day and ensure dosing intervals are respected; for neonates and young infants, IV dosing is further restricted to lower daily totals and longer intervals, underscoring developmental pharmacokinetic differences and the need for caution in this group [^117RaCZ5] [^116E2Cwg]. For adolescents, I should confirm that once children reach about 50 kg, adult fixed dosing principles often apply, with typical adult doses of 650 mg every 4–6 hours or 1,000 mg every 6 hours, not to exceed 4,000 mg/day, which aligns with adolescent-adult concordance seen in many FDA-reviewed products [^117RaCZ5] [^1159vpjH].

> Next, I should review safety and overdose thresholds to contextualize the limits. Therapeutic dosing up to 75 mg/kg/day is associated with extremely low rates of hepatotoxicity in large pediatric cohorts, and toxicity becomes a concern with acute ingestions around 150–200 mg/kg, prompting emergency evaluation; chronic supratherapeutic dosing also increases risk, so I need to ensure caregivers track total daily acetaminophen from all sources, including combination products [^112jU3fp] [^116SNeu4] [^113Pak9U]. Hold on, I should verify that these overdose thresholds are aligned with poison control guidance; yes, the AAPCC-aligned recommendations support ED referral for ingestions ≥ 200 mg/kg in a single 24-hour period or ≥ 150 mg/kg/day for 48 hours, which reinforces the conservative daily maximums I am recommending [^116SNeu4] [^113Pak9U].

> I will now examine practical administration guidance to reduce errors. I need to ensure dosing is based on current weight in kilograms, not age, and that caregivers use milliliter-only devices with oral syringes rather than household teaspoons; this reduces misdosing and is endorsed by the AAP and pediatric safety literature, and I should double-check that this principle is consistently applied across settings, including EMS and outpatient care [^114VhqCV] [^117AwRqJ] [^1114rZEk]. But wait, what if the product label uses age bands? I should counsel that weight-based dosing is more accurate because age-banded dosing can result in under- or overdosing across the weight spectrum, as shown in inpatient data and policy analyses, so I will prioritize weight-based calculations and provide clear, written instructions [^1122gBNv] [^115HMhu5].

> Let me reconsider the conflicting maximum daily dose one more time to avoid ambiguity. While some FDA entries list 100 mg/kg/day for older children, the ADA's 75 mg/kg/day with a hard 4,000 mg/day cap reflects contemporary pediatric safety practice and is the most defensible approach for routine outpatient care; I will therefore anchor on 75 mg/kg/day and 4,000 mg/day maximum, reserving higher rectal totals only when following specific product labeling and clinical protocols, and I will explicitly warn against exceeding 4,000 mg/day from all sources combined [^11344m4G] [^1146gUF9] [^117RaCZ5].

> Final synthesis: For a child, the standard oral acetaminophen dose is 10–15 mg/kg every 4–6 hours as needed, not to exceed 5 doses in 24 hours, with a maximum of 75 mg/kg/day and an absolute ceiling of 4,000 mg/day regardless of weight. For infants 1 year and younger, the same 10–15 mg/kg per dose applies, but the daily maximum is 75 mg/kg/day. Rectal dosing may use 10–20 mg/kg per dose with product-specific guidance and should still respect the 75 mg/kg/day total when combined with other routes. IV dosing in children 2–12 years is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, not to exceed 75 mg/kg/day. Always base dosing on current weight in kilograms, use milliliter-only syringes, and track total daily acetaminophen from all sources to avoid overdose [^11344m4G] [^1146gUF9] [^117RaCZ5] [^116E2Cwg] [^114VhqCV].

Tylenol (acetaminophen) dosing for children should be **weight-based** at 10–15 mg/kg per dose [^117RaCZ5] every 4–6 hours as needed [^114F4tFR], with a maximum of 5 doses in 24 hours and a daily limit of 75 mg/kg [^11344m4G] (not to exceed 4,000 mg/day) [^1146gUF9]. For infants ≤ 1 year, use the same 10–15 mg/kg per dose [^1167qeW9] but do not exceed 75 mg/kg/day [^117RaCZ5]. Always use the **child's current weight** to calculate the dose, and use the provided dosing device to ensure accuracy [^117AwRqJ]. Avoid exceeding the maximum daily dose to prevent hepatotoxicity [^1159vpjH].

### Are recommended doses of acetaminophen effective for children aged 2 to 3 years? A pharmacokinetic modeling answer [^116S3KrS]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Acetaminophen (APAP) elixir is a widely used pediatric antipyretic medication. It has been shown that up to 30% of febrile children presenting to a large urban pediatric emergency department received inadequate APAP dosages at home with errors primarily due to age-based dosing. Parental education material in the form of weight-based dosing guides has been proposed; however, validation of current recommended APAP dosages using pharmacokinetic models is needed. This study used a mathematical model of APAP absorption to predict plasma concentrations and to compare them with the range required to reach and achieve antipyresis (10–20 μg/mL).

Methods

A common APAP preparation (Children's Tylenol Elixir) was tested (children aged 2–3 years, 10.9–15.9 kg). The manufacturer's suggested dose of 160 mg was compared with the standard 10 to 15 mg/kg dose range.

Results

The model predicts a peak plasma concentration between 6.38 and 8.55 μg/mL for 10 mg/kg dose and 9.57 and 12.8 μg/mL for 15 mg/kg dose. The manufacturer's suggested dose of 160 mg was tested across the limits of the weight range (10.9–15.9 kg). A peak plasma concentration between 9.36 and 12.6 μg/mL was found for the lower weight limit (10.9 kg child) and 6.42 to 8.61 μg/mL for the upper weight limit (15.9 kg child).

Conclusions

With the use of this model, the 10 mg/kg dose does not reach the plasma concentration value for antipyresis (10–20 μg/mL), whereas 15 mg/kg is adequate only if assuming a greater absorption constant. The 160 mg dose is effective only for children weighing 10.9 kg. Individual differences in drug bioavailability, volume of distribution, and absorption/elimination constants undoubtedly exist, and future studies directly measuring plasma APAP concentration and pharmacokinetics are needed. However, these results indicate that dosages for APAP in children should be weight based and manufacturers should review their dosing recommendations.

### Dosing and antipyretic efficacy of oral acetaminophen in children [^11548f2L]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A standardized approach to dosing acetaminophen in pediatric populations was published in 1983. That review proposed specific weight-related dosing for infants and children weighing 6 through 95 lb and an age-based schedule for children aged < 4 months through 11 years. Subsequent clinical studies evaluating these and alternative doses of acetaminophen supported the recommended 10-15-mg/kg dose.

Objective

This article reviewed published and unpublished pediatric antipyretic data to provide a critical assessment of the 10-15-mg/kg oral dose and the current pediatric oral dosing schedules for acetaminophen.

Methods

Published literature and unpublished clinical trials that evaluated the antipyretic efficacy of acetaminophen in children were reviewed. The PubMed database was searched using the term acetaminophen or paracetamol, with study criteria limited to randomized, controlled trials; oral dosing; patient age < 12 years; and publication between 1982 and August 2012. All of the sponsor's unpublished antipyretic clinical studies completed between 1980 and August 2012 and involving at least 1 oral-formulation acetaminophen-only treatment arm were identified. Data from published literature containing sufficient detail to verify doses; dosing frequency; and, when necessary, estimates from figures, and from acetaminophen arms of the unpublished studies were analyzed.

Results

Thirteen unpublished trials enrolled 705 children to receive an oral dose of 10–15 mg/kg of acetaminophen. This dose resulted in a rapid onset of temperature reduction, with a maximum temperature decrement of ~3 hours following administration. Results from 40 published clinical trials in which 2332 children received oral acetaminophen for fever support these findings. The most common adverse events reported in any of the reported studies were gastrointestinal in nature and generally mild in intensity.

Conclusions

Data support the recommended 10-15-mg/kg oral dose and demonstrate that the age and weight schedules for over-the-counter acetaminophen proposed in 1983 remain appropriate.

2.1 General Dosing Information

Acetaminophen Injection may be given as a single or repeated dose for the treatment of acute pain or fever. No dose adjustment is required when converting between oral acetaminophen and Acetaminophen Injection dosing in adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg and above. Calculated maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is based on all routes of administration (i.e., intravenous, oral, and rectal) and all products containing acetaminophen. Exceeding the maximum mg/kg daily dose of acetaminophen as described in Tables 1 to 3 may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death. To avoid the risk of overdose, ensure that the total amount of acetaminophen from all routes and from all sources does not exceed the maximum recommended dose.

2.2 Recommended Dosage: Adults and Adolescents

Adults and adolescents weighing 50 kg and over: the recommended dosage of Acetaminophen Injection is 1,000 mg every 6 hours or 650 mg every 4 hours, with a maximum single-dose of Acetaminophen Injection of 1,000 mg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 4,000 mg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

Adults and adolescents weighing under 50 kg: the recommended dosage of Acetaminophen Injection is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum single-dose of Acetaminophen Injection of 15 mg/kg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 75 mg/kg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

2.3 Recommended Dosage: Children

Children 2 to 12 years of age: the recommended dosage of Acetaminophen Injection is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum single-dose of Acetaminophen Injection of 15 mg/kg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 75 mg/kg per day.

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate (Tylenol with codeine) [^115ZXY4V]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of TYLENOL®with Codeine in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established.

Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine (see WARNINGS). In most of the reported cases, these events followed tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine (i.e., multiple copies of the gene for CYP2D6 or high morphine concentrations). Children with sleep apnea may be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine.

Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:

TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets are contraindicated for all children younger than 12 years of age (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets are contraindicated for post-operative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
Avoid the use of TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as post-operative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression (see WARNINGS).

Geriatric Use

Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system depression (see WARNINGS).

These drugs are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

### Preventing home medication administration errors [^114VhqCV]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Milliliter-only dosing and caregiver dosing challenges — The AAP has endorsed milliliter-only dosing, and electronic health record (EHR) systems can be leveraged to support milliliter-only dosing. Caregivers may struggle to appropriately select medications, including recognizing that 2 or more medications with the same active ingredient should not be given at the same time, and may fail to recognize that dosing should generally be based on child weight rather than age; confusion between kilograms and pounds is noted, and consistent provider use and communication of weight in kilograms could reduce inadvertent caregiver dosing errors. Dosing charts may omit guidance for the youngest children; for children younger than 2 years, the dosing chart for acetaminophen states "ask your doctor", contributing to caregiver confusion.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen (Lortab) [^114heBmB]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of the pain and the response of the patient. However, it should be kept in mind that tolerance to hydrocodone can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related.

The usual adult dosage is 11.25 milliliters every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. The total daily dosage for adults should not exceed 67.5 milliliters.

The usual dosages for children are given by the table below, and are to be given every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. These dosages correspond to an average individual dose of 0.20 mL/kg of LORTAB ELIXIR (providing 0.135 mg/kg of hydrocodone bitartrate and 4.0 mg/kg of acetaminophen). Dosing should be based on weight whenever possible.

The total daily dosage for children should not exceed 6 doses per day.

It is of utmost importance that the dose of LORTAB ELIXIR be administered accurately. It is strongly recommended that care givers obtain and use a calibrated measuring device. Health care providers should recommend a dropper that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and instruct care givers to use extreme caution in measuring the dosage.

### British national formulary for children: the risk of inappropriate paracetamol prescribing [^112TBirF]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Paracetamol is the most commonly prescribed medicine for children. Age-based dosing guidelines can lead to inappropriate dosing.

Methods

A review of age-based guidelines for paracetamol in the British National Formulary for Children (BNFC) 2011–2012 was undertaken. Single and cumulative daily doses of paracetamol for boys and girls at 9th, 50th and 91st centiles for weight were calculated for the age groups 1–3 months, 3–12 months, 1–6 years and 6–12 years.

Results

For children at the 9th centile, aged 3 months and above, doses were above recommended single and cumulative daily dose therapeutic limits when given the highest dose specified for their age. For children at the 91st centile at all ages, doses were below recommended single and cumulative daily dose therapeutic limits when given the lowest dose specified for their age.

Conclusions

Underweight and overweight children are at risk of inappropriate paracetamol administration based on BNFC age-based dosing instructions.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of acute dental pain: postoperative pain after 1 or more simple or surgical Tooth extractions in children [^114tXeoH]. ADA (2024). High credibility.

Postoperative pain after tooth extractions in children — acetaminophen dosing lists single-dose amounts by age and weight, usual dosing, and safety limits. Dosing based on child's age and weight includes: 0–3 months (6–11 lbs [2.7–5.3 kg]) 40 mg; 4–11 months (12–17 lbs [5.4–8.1 kg]) 80 mg; 1–2 years (18–23 lbs [8.2–10.8 kg]) 120 mg; 2–3 years (24–35 lbs [10.9–16.3 kg]) 160 mg; 4–5 years (36–47 lbs [16.4–21.7 kg]) 240 mg; 6–8 years (48–59 lbs [21.8–27.2 kg]) 320 mg; 9–10 years (60–71 lbs [27.3–32.6 kg]) 400 mg; 11 years (72–95 lbs [32.7–43.2 kg]) 480 mg. Usual oral dosage is: Infants and children up to and including 11 years: 10–15 mg/kg/dose every 4–6 hours as needed (maximum 75 mg/kg/24 hours, but not to exceed 4,000 mg/24 hours). Both short- and long-term doses are associated with hepatotoxicity, and products are limited to 325 mg per dosage unit.

---

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate (acetaminophen and codeine) [^1176uEr2]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the patient. The usual adult dosage is:

The usual dose of codeine phosphate in children is 0.5 mg/kg.

Doses may be repeated up to every 4 hours.

The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.

It should be kept in mind, however, that tolerance to codeine can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg fail to give commensurate relief of pain but merely prolong analgesia and are associated with an appreciably increased incidence of undesirable side effects. Equivalently high doses in children would have similar effects.

---

### Hydrocodone bitartrate, acetaminophen (hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen) [^116YX4sZ]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of the pain and the response of the patient. However, it should be kept in mind that tolerance to hydrocodone can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related.

The usual adult dosage is one tablespoonful every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. The total daily dosage for adults should not exceed 6 tablespoonfuls.

The usual dosages for children are given by the table on the next page, and are to be given every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. These dosages correspond to an average individual dose of 0.27 mL/kg of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen oral solution (providing 0.135 mg/kg of hydrocodone bitartrate and 5.85 mg/kg of acetaminophen). Dosing should be based on the weight whenever possible.

The total daily dosage for children should not exceed 6 doses per day.

It is of utmost importance that the dose of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen oral solution be administered accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device, especially when one-half or three-fourths of a teaspoonful is to be measured. Given the inexactitude of the household spoon measure and the possibility of using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon, which could lead to overdosage, it is strongly recommended that caregivers obtain and use a calibrated measuring device. Health care providers should recommend a dropper that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and instruct caregivers to use extreme caution in measuring the dosage.

Acetaminophen (suspension, tablet, oral disintegrating tablet, caplet, rectal suppository) — pediatric dosing provides a usual oral dosage for infants and children up to and including 11 years: 10–15 mg/kg/dose every 4–6 hours as needed (maximum 75 mg/kg/24 hours, but not to exceed 4,000 mg/24 hours). Weight-band examples include 6–11 lbs (2.7–5.3 kg) at 0–3 months: 40 mg; 24–35 lbs (10.9–16.3 kg) at 2–3 years: 160 mg; and 48–59 lbs (21.8–27.2 kg) at 6–8 years: 320 mg. Both short- and long-term doses of acetaminophen are associated with hepatotoxicity, and products are limited to 325 mg per dosage unit.

### Acetaminophen and ibuprofen dosing by parents [^116Sm8hy]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are two of the most commonly used medications in children. It is our experience that parents often misdose these medications. Misdosing may lead to unintended toxicity or inadequate symptomatic improvement. There are limited data on the extent of misdosing of these antipyretics. We sought to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for inaccurate dosing by parents seeking care for their children in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

A cross-sectional observational study was performed in an urban academic pediatric ED. Two hundred patients 10 years of age and younger who were given a known dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen in the 24 hours prior to the ED visit were enrolled. The treating physician completed a questionnaire for each patient. Caregivers were asked about quantity and frequency of antipyretic use prior to the ED visit, the source of information used to determine dosage, and which factor (eg, age, sex, height, weight, height of fever, severity of illness) they considered most important in determining the correct dosage of medication. Doses of 10 to 15 mg/kg for acetaminophen and 5 to 10 mg/kg for ibuprofen were considered accurate.

Results

Overall, 51% of patients received an inaccurate dose of medication, including 62% of patients given acetaminophen and 26% of patients given ibuprofen. Infants < 1 year old were more likely to receive an inaccurate dose (RR 1.40, P < 0.04, 95% CI = 1.06–1.86). Caregivers who stated that medication dosage was based on weight were less likely to give an inaccurate dose of medication (RR 0.71, P < 0.03, 95% CI = 0.52–0.97).

Conclusions

Over half of the caregivers surveyed gave an inaccurate dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen, particularly to infants. Caregivers who reported that antipyretic dosage was based on weight were less likely to misdose medication, suggesting a valuable role for patient education.

### Ofirmev (acetaminophen) [^114mx156]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

2.1 General Dosing Information

OFIRMEV may be given as a single or repeated dose for the treatment of acute pain or fever. No dose adjustment is required when converting between oral acetaminophen and OFIRMEV dosing in adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg and above. Calculated maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is based on all routes of administration (i.e., intravenous, oral, and rectal) and all products containing acetaminophen. Exceeding the maximum mg/kg daily dose of acetaminophen as described in Tables 1–3 may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death. To avoid the risk of overdose, ensure that the total amount of acetaminophen from all routes and from all sources does not exceed the maximum recommended dose.

2.2 Recommended Dosage: Adults and Adolescents

Adults and adolescents weighing 50 kg and over: the recommended dosage of OFIRMEV is 1000 mg every 6 hours or 650 mg every 4 hours, with a maximum single dose of OFIRMEV of 1000 mg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 4000 mg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

Adults and adolescents weighing under 50 kg: the recommended dosage of OFIRMEV is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum single dose of OFIRMEV of 15 mg/kg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 75 mg/kg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

### Acetaminophen, codeine phosphate (ACETAMINOPHEN with CODEINE) [^117CWmHL]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the patient.

Take (1–2) tablets orally every 6–8 hours as needed.

The usual dose of codeine phosphate in children is 0.5 mg/kg.

Doses may be repeated up to every 4 hours.

The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.

It should be kept in mind, however, that tolerance to codeine can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg fail to give commensurate relief of pain but merely prolong analgesia and are associated with an appreciably increased incidence of undesirable side effects. Equivalently high doses in children would have similar effects.

2.3 Recommended Dosage: Children

Children 2 to 12 years of age: the recommended dosage of OFIRMEV is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum single dose of OFIRMEV of 15 mg/kg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 75 mg/kg per day.

2.4 Recommended Dosage For Treatment of Fever in Neonates and Infants

Neonates, including premature neonates born at ≥ 32 weeks gestational age, up to 28 days chronological age: the recommended dosage of OFIRMEV is 12.5 mg/kg every 6 hours, to a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 50 mg/kg per day, with a minimum dosing interval of 6 hours.

Infants 29 days to 2 years of age: the recommended dosage of OFIRMEV is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours, to a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 60 mg/kg per day, with a minimum dosing interval of 6 hours.

2.5 Instructions for Intravenous Administration

For adult and adolescent patients weighing ≥ 50 kg requiring 1000 mg doses of OFIRMEV, administer the dose by inserting a vented intravenous set through the septum of the 100 mL vial or a non-vented intravenous set through the administration spike port of the 100 mL bag. OFIRMEV may be administered without further dilution. Examine the container contents before dose preparation or administering. DO NOT USE if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. Administer the contents of the container intravenously over 15 minutes. Use aseptic technique when preparing OFIRMEV for intravenous infusion. Do not add other medications to the OFIRMEV vial or infusion device.

### Initial and subsequent dosing of rectal acetaminophen in children: a 24-hour pharmacokinetic study of new dose recommendations [^113haUo1]. Anesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have determined that an initial rectal acetaminophen dose of approximately 40 mg/kg is needed in children to achieve target antipyretic serum concentrations. The timing and amount of subsequent doses after a 40-mg/kg dose has not been clarified for this route of administration. Based on the authors' previous pharmacokinetic data, they examined whether a 40-mg/kg loading dose followed by 20-mg/kg doses at 6-h intervals maintain serum concentrations within the target range of 10–20 microg/ml, without evidence of accumulation.

Methods

Children (n = 16) received rectal acetaminophen (40 mg/kg) and up to three additional doses of 20 mg/kg at 6-h intervals. Venous blood samples were taken every 30 min for 4 h, then every 60 min for 4 h, and every 4 h for 16 h. The authors assessed whether their published pharmacokinetic parameters predicted the acetaminophen concentrations in the present study. They also assessed their dosing regimen by determining the fraction of time each individual maintained the target concentration.

Results

All patients received the initial loading dose; 10 of 16 patients received three subsequent doses. Serum concentrations with the initial dose were in the target range 38 ± 25% of the time. With subsequent dosing, the target range was maintained 60 ± 29% of the time. The highest serum concentration with initial or subsequent dosing was 38.6 microg/ml. Pharmacokinetic parameters from the earlier study predicted the serum concentrations observed for both initial and subsequent doses.

Conclusions

A rectal acetaminophen loading dose of 40 mg/kg followed by 20-mg/kg doses every 6 h results in serum concentrations centered at the target range of 10–20 microg/ml. There was large interindividual variability in pharmacokinetic characteristics. There was no evidence of accumulation during the 24-h sampling period.

### Drug dosing in obese children: challenges and evidence-based strategies [^111vVzBw]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

With the alarming increase of obesity in children, pediatricians are increasingly being confronted with difficult dosing decisions. Many drug labels do not provide specific dosing instructions for children who are obese. In this article, we describe the physiologic parameters altered by obesity and their influences on drug disposition and effect. We review the principles of allometry, and the key pharmacokinetic parameters that can be used to derive age appropriate dosing regimens. Last, we illustrate how appropriate weight descriptors can be selected, and how important PK parameters can be extrapolated for dosing in obese children when pediatric pharmacokinetic information is available.

### Paracetamol plus ibuprofen for the treatment of fever in children (PITCH): randomised controlled trial [^115HMhu5]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

The pragmatism of the intervention changed with time, moving from efficacy in the first four hours to effectiveness in the second 24 hours. By 48 hours, considerably fewer study drugs were being given and this could partly explain the observed lack of effects on discomfort at this time. In the community, paracetamol and ibuprofen are usually dosed by age, and we recognise that calculating doses by weight means the results may inform primary and secondary care practice more than practice at home. We decided against a dose by age regimen, however, for two reasons. Firstly, given the recommendation of the children's national service framework to dose by weightand the dose by weight presentations in the British national formulary for children, we believe that in the future more medicines for children will be given by weight. Secondly, we wanted to ensure that heavier children for their age received a therapeutic dose and to avoid exceeding the normal recommended dose for children who were light for their age. Comparing dose by weight with dose by age shows that children can receive as much as 50% moreor 50% less paracetamol and 100% more ibuprofen.

Medicine bottles in the United States contain dosing advice by both age and weight and although healthcare professionals can clearly calculate dose by weight, we think two steps are needed before parents can routinely use weight to determine dose in other countries. Firstly, studies should investigate the safety implications of any differences between estimates of children's weights measured by parents using domestic scales (or recently recorded weights in parent held children's health records) and those measured by professionals using paediatric scales. Secondly, suppliers of antipyretics could consider routinely including dose by weight tables. Given that the complexity of using two drugs over a 24 hour period is more likely to lead to inadvertently exceeding the maximum recommended dose, we also believe that multiple blank charts should be supplied for parents to record when medicines have been given and how much.

### A multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-comparator trial to determine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ibuprofen for treatment of fever in hospitalized pediatric patients [^114WEYdq]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Limitations of this study involved the selection of the comparator drug. At the onset of this study, intravenous ibuprofen, was the only FDA approved antipyretic with an intravenous route of administration. While an IV form of acetaminophen is now commercially available (approved in 2010), it was not FDA approved or commercially available in the United States when the study was designed, initiated, or during early enrollment.

The use of oral or rectal acetaminophen as the comparator was not optimal given that at times absorption and utilization of oral or rectal preparations of medication can be unpredictable and lead to sub-therapeutic level of the medication. In practice, many pediatricians utilize acetaminophen at a dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight. Recommended acetaminophen dosing varies from 7.5 mg/kg every 6 h (for children ≤ 10 kg) to 15 mg/kg every 4 h (for children > 33 kg) to 12.5mg/kg every 4 h or 15mg/kg every 6 h for children ≥ 2 years of age (maximum daily dose of 75 mg/kg/day). The study was designed to allow for multiple doses at a frequency of every 4 h. For the acetaminophen dose, 10 mg/kg was chosen to stay consistent with acetaminophen recommendations and to limit potential renal and hepatic toxicities should repeated dosing of acetaminophen be administered during the treatment period.

Enrollment in the ibuprofen treatment arm was larger in the 6–16 years age group (ibuprofen – 57%, acetaminophen - 48%) when compared to acetaminophen than in the other age groups (6 months -2 years [ibuprofen -17%, acetaminophen 25%] and 2 years – 6 years [ibuprofen – 26%, acetaminophen – 27%]). Given that difference disease processes cause fever in infants compared to older children and adolescents and the different mean weight of the subjects in the groups, there potentially could be different pharmacokinetic responses based on these variables.

Other limitation of the study included the relatively small number of patients studied in children under the age of 6 months and a relatively short duration of exposure. The duration of exposure to ibuprofen is, however, consistent with the recommendation that intravenous ibuprofen should be at the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration possible. Additional research is needed in the less than 6 months age population to determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous ibuprofen in that age population.

### Pediatric readiness in emergency medical services systems [^1114rZEk]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Patient and medication safety in pediatric EMS — Dosage of medications for pediatric patients requires an accurate assessment of a child's weight to avoid significant over- and underdosing. Estimation of children's weight by using a specific pediatric validated tool for weight and documenting the weight in kilograms in the EMS record can enhance safety. Medication dosages are based on weight in kilograms, and adjuncts, such as smartphone applications that provide decision support for precalculated doses, can minimize dosing errors. Online medical direction from a physician with pediatric expertise can provide important guidance when EMS personnel have reached the limit of what is specified in their agency's protocols. A method to identify, prevent, and report medication errors, including a policy for timely reporting and tracking of adverse events, can enhance safety, and including pediatric weight measurement tools, use of weight-based dosing tools, education in the use of those tools, and developing QI projects surrounding the accuracy of pediatric-based medication dosing are important elements for an EMS agency to work toward reducing dosing errors in pediatric patients.

Minimum subject numbers – maximum information

Design of pediatric trials is very much a balancing act, keeping the numbers of children participating in the study to a minimum, but obtaining as much information as possible for deriving robust dosing recommendations in all age groups. Modeling and simulation play a key role throughout the program, eg, by using prior knowledge in adults to guide the selection of the first pediatric dose. Blood volumes drawn in pediatric trials are recommended not to exceed 3% of the total blood volume over a 4-week period and 1% of the total blood volume for a single draw. The restriction on blood volume limits the numbers of samples which can be taken from each child, particularly in neonates and young infants. Again, modeling and simulation are indispensable to design the optimal sparse sampling strategy to best characterize the concentration–time profile of the medication with the minimum numbers of patients and samples.

One key question is how many subjects are needed for achieving the objectives of the trial. Wang et alsuggested for trials with a primary pharmacokinetic objective to prospectively "target a 95% confidence interval within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean estimates of clearance and volume of distribution for the drug in each pediatric subgroup with at least 80% power". For efficacy trials, similar constraints on sample numbers apply: sample size must be as low as possible but still sufficient to determine efficacy with adequate power and to provide a robust safety database.

Sensitive bioanalytical methods

The bioanalytical method(s) need to work with the lowest possible plasma/serum volume. Prior to initiating pediatric trials, the available method(s) may therefore require optimization. Microsampling techniques (eg, dried blood spots) may also be considered as an alternative approach to addressing the constraints on blood volumes.

Blood samples taken in adult pharmacokinetic trials are generally venous samples. In our experience with postsurgical trials, most investigators strongly favor arterial sampling in the very young since an arterial line was already in place.

Maturation of body functions

The rates of maturation of body functions and biochemical processes vary widely between the different age groups and can change rapidly within even a few days in the early weeks of life. Thus, linear dosing based on body weight alone can never be assumed in this vulnerable population. All aspects of drug absorption (eg, gastrointestinal activity), distribution (eg, body composition), metabolism (eg, enzyme expression and maturation) and excretion (ADME) change with age.

### Emergency department patient knowledge concerning acetaminophen (paracetamol) in over-the-counter and prescription analgesics [^1174Ri8s]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to evaluate patient knowledge of the acetaminophen (paracetamol) content of commonly used pain medications and the maximum daily recommended dose of acetaminophen.

Methods

A prospective, convenience sample of emergency department patients were enrolled. Data were recorded using a standardised questionnaire over 4 months.

Results

1009 patients were enrolled. 492 patients (49%) did not know if Tylenol contained acetaminophen (paracetamol). The majority (66–90%) of patients did not know if Lortab, Vicodin, Percocet, non-aspirin pain reliever, ibuprofen, Motrin, or Advil contained acetaminophen. 568 patients (56%) reported not knowing the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen and only 71 patients (7%) reported the correct daily dose.

Conclusions

Patient knowledge of the acetaminophen content of commonly used analgesic medications and its maximum recommended daily dose is limited. This may contribute to unintentional repeated supratherapeutic ingestion (RSTI) of acetaminophen, or overdose.

### Metric units and the preferred dosing of orally administered liquid medications [^117AwRqJ]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Metric-based dosing and devices for pediatric liquid medications — practice considerations note that medication-dosing errors are significantly less common among parents using milliliter-only dosing compared with those using teaspoon- or tablespoon-based dosing, and recent studies have demonstrated that syringes achieve more precise dosing than dosing cups or dosing spoons. Unfortunately, household spoons are still commonly used to administer liquid medications, and pediatricians should cease prescribing liquid medications to children that use teaspoon or tablespoon volumes and advocate for the use of oral syringes with metric markings; notably, use of syringes combined with caregiver education on dosing has been shown to markedly improve dosing precision. Broader metric standardization is described, including advocacy that pediatric weights only be measured and documented in kilograms, that scales used to weigh pediatric patients can be configured to record weights in kilograms, and that e-healthrecords be standardized to allow only kilograms for pediatric weight entries; additionally, metric-only labeling was recommended for electronic prescribing systems, and a switch to exclusive metric dosing for orally administered liquid medications is consistent with other AAP recommendations for the use of metric units.

### National poison center calls before vs after availability of high-dose acetaminophen (paracetamol) tablets in Switzerland [^115nQMPQ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is an antipyretic and analgesic drug with a weak anti-inflammatory action. Since its clinical introduction in 1955, acetaminophen has become the most widely used analgesic-antipyreticand accounts for nearly half of all pain medication prescriptions in Switzerland. Worldwide, acetaminophen is widely available via prescription or over the counter (OTC), with the most common formulations being 500-mg and 1000-mg oral tablets. The therapeutic dose for those aged 12 years and older is 1000 mg every 4 to 6 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 4000 mg. Among children younger than 12 years, weight-based dosing is recommended (ie, 10–15 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours), with a maximum daily dose of 75 mg/kg. When used within this therapeutic dosage, acetaminophen is considered among the safest pain medications available. As such, it is indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain and/or fever. However, daily doses exceeding the therapeutic maximum can cause hepatoxicity, and severe toxic effects can occur with doses exceeding 10 000 mg in adults or 150 to 200 mg/kg in children.

In many Western countries, acetaminophen poisoning is the leading cause of liver failure, and researchers have identified that prolonged exposure to high daily doses can increase the risk of liver failure and death. Thus, in light of the limited evidence of a clinical benefit for musculoskeletal conditions, headache and migraine, or dental pain, concerns regarding the benefit-risk profile of acetaminophen have been raised. In August 2020, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) released draft guidance on chronic pain management, in which acetaminophen (paracetamol) is no longer recommended because of its unfavorable benefit-risk profile.

Access to high doses of acetaminophen may increase the risk of unintentional poisonings owing to a combination of underestimating the risks and lack of clinical effect in pain management, leading to up-dosing. Several studies have linked OTC acetaminophen availability to higher acetaminophen-related inquiries to poison information centers and acetaminophen-related mortality. As a result, many European countries — including the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden — have implemented pack size restrictions for OTC sales. However, changes in legislations for OTC restrictions have so far only identified modest reductions in mortality and poisonings in some regions, and the association with liver transplantation remains limited.

### Improving pediatric dosing through pediatric initiatives: what we have learned [^111qVGTn]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to review the impact of pediatric drug studies, as measured by the improvement in pediatric dosing and other pertinent information captured in the drug labeling.

Methods

We reviewed the pediatric studies for 108 products submitted (July 1998 through October 2005) in response to a Food and Drug Administration written request for pediatric studies, and the subsequent labeling changes. We analyzed the dosing modifications and focused on drug clearance as an important parameter influencing pediatric dosing.

Results

The first 108 drugs with new or revised pediatric labeling changes had dosing changes or pharmacokinetic information (n = 23), new safety information (n = 34), information concerning lack of efficacy (n = 19), new pediatric formulations (n = 12), and extended age limits (n = 77). A product might have had ≥ 1 labeling change. We selected specific examples (n = 16) that illustrate significant differences in pediatric pharmacokinetics.

Conclusions

Critical changes in drug labeling for pediatric patients illustrate that unique pediatric dosing often is necessary, reflecting growth and maturational stages of pediatric patients. These changes provide evidence that pediatric dosing should not be determined by simply applying weight-based calculations to the adult dose. Drug clearance is highly variable in the pediatric population and is not readily predictable on the basis of adult information.

### Acetaminophen pediatric dose selection: caregiver satisfaction regarding the antipyretic efficacy of acetaminophen in children [^1123tQG7]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen-associated liver toxicity remains a serious concern, but guidance regarding dose selection is ambiguous, and the literature describing acetaminophen efficacy and toxicity in pediatrics is limited. Clinical investigation and reporting are needed. This study investigates caregiver satisfaction with 2 commonly prescribed dose levels. This nonrandomized, open-label, outpatient study included 37 moderately febrile pediatric patients prescribed acetaminophen at either 10 or 15 mg/kg every 4 hours. Patient caregivers indicated how well the acetaminophen reduced fever by completing a 5-point Likert scale. A 2-sample t test determined whether a statistically significant difference in satisfaction scores existed. Sufficient statistical power was achieved, and the mean satisfaction scores for both groups were not significantly different. Although further studies using more precise and objective end points are needed to provide optimal evidence-based guidance for acetaminophen pediatric dose selection, the findings in this study suggest that prescribers should consider a starting dose of only 10 mg/kg for moderately febrile pediatric patients.

- ≥ 150 mg/kg per 24-hour period for the preceding 48 hours, or

### Single high-dose rectal acetaminophen in children [^113eMYyg]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the use of one-time high-dose (> 30 mg/kg) rectally administered acetaminophen to control postoperative pain in children.

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-May 2004) and bibliographic searches.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles identified from the data sources were evaluated and all studies regarding the use of greater than 30 mg/kg of acetaminophen in children were included for this review.

Data Synthesis

A single high dose of rectally administered acetaminophen has been used in children to control postoperative pain. Ten randomized controlled trials and pharmacokinetic studies evaluating the use of greater than 30 mg/kg of rectally administered acetaminophen in children were identified and reviewed. Each study had a unique objective. The studies also differed substantially in regard to design, study population, dosing, rectal formulation used, and monitoring.

Conclusions

Due to limited study data, wide study variability, and lack of standardization in terms of design, objectives, study population, dosing, rectal formulation, and monitoring, compounded by the fact that children often require additional doses of acetaminophen to control postoperative pain, the practice of using one-time, high-dose, rectally administered acetaminophen in children cannot be recommended at this time.

### Simplifying medicine dosing for children by harmonising weight bands across therapeutic areas [^117VEZda]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2025). High credibility.

Generally, dose recommendations for children are expressed as fixed dosing increments related to bodyweight, known as weight bands. The weight bands recommended in WHO treatment guidelines vary between diseases, leading to complexity and potential dosing errors when treating children for multiple diseases simultaneously. The introduction of a harmonised weight banding approach for orally administered drugs across disease areas could streamline dosing for young children, but implementing such an approach would require changes in current dosing recommendations. In this Health Policy, we describe the process we conducted to: identify therapeutic areas for harmonisation of weight bands; propose a harmonised weight-banding system to align with current use of weight bands in antibiotic guidance; and simulate the expected effect of dose adjustments due to weight-band harmonisation. Each step of this process, along with the effect and feasibility of weight-band harmonisation was discussed with clinical, policy, and pharmacology experts convened by WHO, representing four therapeutic areas: tuberculosis, HIV, malaria, and hepatitis C. Dosing according to harmonised weight bands across the targeted therapeutic areas was found to be feasible and should be considered for implementation by WHO disease programmes through their appropriate normative processes.

### Dosing variability in prescriptions of acetaminophen to children: comparisons between pediatricians, family physicians and otolaryngologists [^113cTCr3]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Children are not the exact miniatures of adults. The dosages of most medicines prescribed to children should be adjusted according to their ages and weights because children are not completely mature in development and the pharmacokinetics of a drug in them is hardly calculable. For example, the half-life of acetaminophen, one of the most common antipyretics, is much slower in neonates than in adults. Therefore, children are more vulnerable to dosing errors. It has been also reported that not all physicians prescribed for children according to package inserts or guidelines. Furthermore, the degree of prescribing discordance differed among specialties. Most studies of cross-specialty prescription comparisons measured merely the appropriateness of indications, the choice of drugs, and the number of distinct drug items. In some studies dealing with dosing problems, questionnaires, quizzes or chart reviews were usually adopted in research methods. To establish an indicator of prescribing quality in dosing within large-scale prescription databases, a more efficient approach is thus necessary.

In this study, we proposed a new method to estimate the extents of dosing variability in prescriptions to children among different specialties. Although prescription data were from a large nationwide health insurance claims database in Taiwan, the concept and procedures of our study could apply to studies of pediatric drug utilization in other countries.

### ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified in children aged 4–18 years [^115tZ9DH]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN pediatric AP-DGBIs — over-the-counter analgesics — The GDG recognizes that over-the-counter analgesics are commonly used and whereas they may have a role in intermittent or periodic symptom control, the GDG raises caution beyond local OTC dosing and duration guidance. The use of OTC analgesics in the management of pediatric AP-DGBIs warrants careful consideration, as NSAIDs and acetaminophen have risks of adverse events, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatotoxicity, renal impairment, and medication overuse headaches when consumed beyond the limits outlined in pediatric dosing guidelines. Evidence-based dosing parameters should be followed to reduce the potential for harm while acknowledging the intermittent role OTC analgesics may play in a multimodal approach to AP-DGBI management.

### Acetaminophen toxicity in children [^117261DA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen is widely used in children, because its safety and efficacy are well established. Although the risk of developing toxic reactions to acetaminophen appears to be lower in children than in adults, such reactions occur in pediatric patients from intentional overdoses. Less frequently, acetaminophen toxicity is attributable to unintended inappropriate dosing or the failure to recognize children at increased risk in whom standard acetaminophen doses have been administered. Because the symptoms of acetaminophen intoxication are nonspecific, the diagnosis and treatment of acetaminophen intoxication are more likely to be delayed in unintentional cases of toxicity. This statement describes situations and conditions that may contribute to acetaminophen toxicity not associated with suicidal intentions.

### Addressing pain in people living with cystic fibrosis: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation evidence-informed guidelines [^115s7iRt]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2025). High credibility.

Table 5 — pharmacologic management of pain (acetaminophen/paracetamol) details first-line use, dosing, and hepatotoxicity cautions: Adults and adolescents oral dosing is 325 to 650 mg every 4 to 6 h as needed or 1000 mg every 6 h as needed; maximum dose 4000 mg/day. Intravenous (IV) dosing for ≥ 50 kg is 650 mg every 4 h or 1000 mg every 6 h; maximum single dose 1000 mg/dose; maximum daily dose 4000 mg/day, and for < 50 kg is 12.5 mg/kg every 4 h or 15 mg/kg every 6 h; maximum single dose 15 mg/kg/dose (≤ 750 mg/dose); maximum daily dose 75 mg/kg/day (≤ 3750 mg/day). Children oral dosing is 10 to 15 mg/kg/dose every 4 to 6 h as needed; do not exceed 5 doses in 24 h; maximum daily dose 75 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 4000 mg/day); IV for < 50 kg follows 12.5 mg/kg every 4 h or 15 mg/kg every 6 h as needed; maximum single dose 15 mg/kg/dose (≤ 750 mg/dose); maximum daily dose 75 mg/kg/day (≤ 3750 mg/day). Infants/children < 2 years old have a maximum daily dose 60 mg/kg/day. The table lists acetaminophen/paracetamol as first-line pharmacologic therapy, included in many over-the-counter combination products, without anti-inflammatory activity, and notes that due to risk for hepatotoxicity some experts recommend a lower maximum dose of 3000 mg/day in adults with normal liver function when used for longer durations (> 3 days), with an even lower total daily dose (e.g., 2000 mg/day) or avoidance preferred for specified risk factors.

### Dosing variability in prescriptions of acetaminophen to children: comparisons between pediatricians, family physicians and otolaryngologists [^113LEZva]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our results revealed that the relative ratios of median doses of acetaminophen among all age groups were quite similar to those of median body weights in CDC Growth Charts and to those of recommended doses in pharmacopeia. It implied that most physicians paid attention to the child's body weight or age in prescribing. Thus, even though the information of body weight was not available in the claims datasets, we might infer from the dosing variability among specialty groups that the prescribing quality of physicians with narrower variability needed to be further scrutinized.

On the other hand, we could neither directly prove that the CV of dosages was suitable to serve as a measurement of prescribing quality. According to the Child Growth Standards published by the World Health Organization, the variation of body weight in infants is most marked and the extent of variation declines with age. In our study, the CV in each specialty also decreased with children's age. Besides, children aged 12 years and older can have the same dosage (500 mg) of acetaminophen as adults, without regard to body weight. In our study, the CV in each specialty was also negligibly small in adolescents (Table 3). The pattern of CVs reflected their usefulness in cross-specialty comparisons.

In our study, otolaryngologists had the narrowest dosing variability in children younger than 12 years. It was understandable that otolaryngologists with the background of surgically-oriented training might not be familiar with pediatric prescription or accustomed to dosing practice. The discrepancy of practice patterns between otolaryngologists and pediatricians had been reported, especially in treatment of acute otitis media and tonsillitis. A survey of otolaryngologists and pediatricians about deficiency of cross-training in Canada had also revealed that otolaryngologists felt a need of medication and dosage knowledge to be taught by pediatricians during otolaryngology residency. Modification of training programs or continuing education might be considered to resolve the cross-specialty discrepancy.

### Evaluation of age-banded dosing of oral paracetamol in hospitalised children: a retrospective analysis using clinical data in a tertiary paediatric hospital [^1122gBNv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate age-banded dosing in paediatric inpatients by determining the proportion of patients whose dose would fall outside the therapeutic range (by weight).

Design

A retrospective observational study. Weight and height measurements and details of hospital admissions were matched from the electronic patient record of a single, tertiary paediatric hospital. Dosage which would be given according to age-banded dosing was then compared with their weight.

Participants

All children admitted to a single tertiary children's hospital aged 3 months to 16 years over a 5-year period. Data were cleaned to remove values likely to be erroneous and filtered to reduce bias due to patients who were admitted on multiple occasions.

Outcomes

The main outcome was the proportion of patients who would receive a subtherapeutic or supratherapeutic paracetamol dose if given a dose based on their age. Secondary outcomes were to examine this in children of different ages and to examine the impact of alternative size-based dosing strategies.

Results

100047 admissions (in 68310 patients) had a weight documented. If age-banded dosing had been used, a subtherapeutic dose (less than 10mg/kg) would be given during 19829 (20%) of the admissions and a supratherapeutic dose (over 18.75mg/kg, 75mg/kg/day in four doses) in 4289 (4.3%). The highest risk of a subtherapeutic dose occurred in infants just prior to reaching 6 months of age (83%) and in children just prior to reaching 8 years (66%). The highest risk of a supratherapeutic dose was at 12 years of age (35%).

Conclusion

Age-banded dosing is not suitable for an inpatient paediatric population as approximately a quarter of patients receive a dose outside the recommended range of 10.0–18.75mg/kg.

### Antipyretic efficacy and safety of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in children [^116nN8GN]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the antipyretic effects and safety of ibuprofen compared with acetaminophen in febrile children.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE (1966-November 2003) and EMBASE (1988-November 2003) were conducted using the terms ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Bibliographies of selected articles were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Ibuprofen was significantly more effective than acetaminophen in reducing fever after a single dose. Ibuprofen was found to be more effective after 6 hours, but not after a longer period of time. Studies with multiple doses have also failed to show that one drug is better than the other.

Conclusions

The efficacy and effectiveness of acetaminophen and ibuprofen in their recommended dosages are similar, with slightly more beneficial effects shown with ibuprofen.

### As required versus fixed schedule analgesic administration for postoperative pain in children [^115wWAZv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute postoperative pain occurs as a result of tissue damage following surgery. Administering the appropriate analgesia to children is a complex process and it is unclear whether children's postoperative pain is more successfully treated by using 'as required' (when pain occurs) (termed 'pro re nata' or PRN) or (irrespective of pain at the time of administration).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of as required versus fixed schedule analgesic administration for the management of postoperative pain in children under the age of 16 years.

Search Methods

On 2 July 2014, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases. We reviewed the bibliographies of all included studies and of reviews, and searched two clinical trial databases, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PRN versus ATC analgesic administration for postoperative pain in children under the age of 16 years who had undergone any surgical procedure requiring postoperative pain relief, in any setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (AH, PW) independently extracted efficacy and adverse event data, examined issues of study quality, and assessed risk of bias as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Main Results

We included three RCTs (four reports) of 246 children aged under 16 years undergoing tonsillectomy. Children were given weight-appropriate doses of the study medication, either PRN or ATC, by a parent or carer at home for up to four days following surgery. We did not identify any studies assessing the management of postoperative pain in children in any other setting (i.e. as an inpatient). All studies included in this review were based on the use of paracetamol, and an opioid was added to paracetamol in two studies. Analgesics were administered either orally (tablet or elixir) or rectally (suppository). Reporting quality was poor and there were fewer than 50 children in each arm. Mean pain intensity scores decreased over time, as did medication use. However, children were still reporting pain at the final assessment, suggesting that no administration schedule provided adequate analgesia. There were no significant differences in pain intensity scores at any time point. The studies reported adverse events that may have been related to the study medication, such as nausea and vomiting, and constipation, but no statistically significant differences were noted between the groups. There were too few data from only three small studies and meta-analysis was not possible. One study reported that a higher amount of analgesics was consumed in the ATC group compared with the PRN group: it would have been helpful to show that the higher volume in the ATC group led to better analgesia but we were not able to demonstrate this.

Authors' Conclusions

There was limited evidence available to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of PRN versus ATC analgesic administration for the management of postoperative pain in children.

### A modified Delphi to define drug dosing errors in pediatric critical care [^116fiWKJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Dosing errors are the amongst the most common types of medication error in pediatric practice, along with incomplete and incorrect prescription preparation. Pediatric drug dosing is particularly challenging due to a child's growth, development and change in organ function over time. Dosing in children is therefore weight-based, involves the dilution of concentrated stock solutions, and the off-label use of medications approved for adults. Despite standard weight-based dosing in pediatrics, doses used in clinical practice can vary between practitioners, clinical settings, and healthcare centers. Dosing is often based on patient characteristics and clinician comfort, due to a lack of established evidence based guidelines for appropriate pediatric dosing of off-label drugs in children. Critically ill children present a further challenge for dosing due to the pharmacokinetic changes associated with concurrent organ dysfunction and acuity of illness, as well as the pharmacodynamic properties associated with the concomitant exposure of other potentially harmful medications.

There is no consensus definition for dosing error in adult or pediatric practice. Although a clinician-based definition for prescribing error has been proposed in pediatrics, no such definition exists specifically exists for dosing error. Heterogenous definitions of pediatric dosing error in the literature include an "error in drug dosing, ordering, transcribing, administering or monitoring"; a dosing error "higher than reference dosing"; "over 10% difference from reference dosing"; "over 20% dose deviation from recommended dose", +/− 25% of recommended dose (Ghaleb) or pharmacist consensus.

In clinical practice, critical care practitioners may prescribe acceptable doses outside a reference range, based on drug properties, organ dysfunction, and the patients' clinical status. Dosing references and a more concrete dosing error definition are still needed however, to guide standardized error reporting, quality improvement for optimal prescribing practices, error comparisons within research and clinical decision support tools. We sought to better understand what constitutes a dosing error in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The specific objectives of this study were 1) to develop a framework, informed by a set of principles, for a clinician-based definition of drug dosing errors in critically ill children, and 2) to identify the range, outside the standard reference range, that practitioners agree is a dosing error for different drug classes and clinical scenarios.

### ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified in children aged 4–18 years [^116KvqH4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale: The GDG recognizes that many probiotic and synbiotic preparations are readily available without prescription and are often used by members of the public for abdominal complaints. However, outside of two specific strains that had low and moderate certainty evidence for all of their core efficacy outcomes, evidence was not consistent, and this limited an overall class recommendation. While individual outcomes of individual strains did show effect, which may be the reason for interest in these agents, further research must address the pervasive issues with sample size, methods, and choice of outcome measures. It is suggested that if families and their professionals are motivated to consider the use of such agents that they should be monitored for efficacy and safety in line with other active therapies

Rationale: The use of OTC analgesics in the management of pediatric AP‐DGBIs warrants careful consideration. While readily accessible and frequently utilized for short‐term relief of episodic symptoms, NSAIDs and acetaminophen have risks of adverse events, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatotoxicity, renal impairment, and medication overuse headaches when consumed beyond the limits outlined in pediatric dosing guidelines. Evidence‐based dosing parameters should be followed to reduce the potential for harm while acknowledging the intermittent role OTC analgesics may play in a multimodal approach to AP‐DGBI management.

### Antipyretic efficacy of an initial 30-mg / kg loading dose of acetaminophen versus a 15-mg / kg maintenance dose [^117KQKEc]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the antipyretic efficacy of an initial 30-mg/kg acetaminophen loading dose versus a 15-mg/kg maintenance dose.

Methods

A double-blind, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial was conducted. A total of 121 febrile (rectal temperature between 39 degrees C and 40 degrees C) but otherwise healthy outpatients who were 4 months to 9 years of age and weighed 4 to 26 kg were assigned randomly to 1 of the dose groups: 15 mg/kg (n = 62) and 30 mg/kg (n = 59).

Results

In an "intention to treat" analysis, the time to obtain a temperature lower than 38.5 degrees C was significantly shorter in the 30-mg/kg than in the 15-mg/kg group (110 ± 94 minutes vs 139 ± 113 minutes). The maximum temperature decrease was significantly higher in the 30-mg/kg than in the 15-mg/kg group (2.3 ± 0.7 degrees C vs 1.7 ± 0.6 degrees C). Duration of rectal temperature below 38.5 degrees C was significantly longer in the 30-mg/kg than in the 15-mg/kg group (250 ± 92 minutes vs 185 ± 121 minutes, respectively). Adverse events were reported in 6 children in the 30-mg/kg group compared with 5 in the 15-mg/kg group (hyperthermia, hypothermia, vomiting). The difference was not statistically significant.

Conclusion

An initial 30-mg/kg acetaminophen loading dose seemed to be more effective in reducing fever than a 15-mg/kg maintenance dose. No difference was observed regarding clinical tolerance. These data suggest that acetaminophen treatment of fever may be more efficient in an initial loading dose.

### Use of analgesics / antipyretics in the management of symptoms associated with COVID-19 vaccination [^111tgNMg]. NPJ Vaccines (2022). Medium credibility.

Effect of analgesic and antipyretic medicines on immune responses to vaccination

Although analgesics and antipyretics are not indicated for prophylactic use, they can be administered at the time of vaccination to prevent side effects or therapeutically following side-effect onset. A limited number of studies have evaluated the effect of analgesics/antipyretics on immunogenicity. However, these studies have been limited to either specific age groups of the population or specific vaccines. As COVID-19 vaccination is being applied universally and eventually to all age groups, we undertook a more expansive review of the literature on acetaminophen and NSAIDs and their effects on vaccination.

Acetaminophen (Paracetamol)

Despite its widespread use for many years, the mechanism(s) of action of acetaminophen remain(s) unclear. The drug may exert its therapeutic effects through inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-1 and −2 and the subsequent decrease of prostaglandin synthesis, although other mechanisms have been suggested. Both COX-2 activation and prostaglandin production are important in innate immune response signaling. Activated T and B cells express COX-2 and produce prostaglandins. A small number of randomized controlled trials with several different vaccines have investigated the effects of prophylactic or therapeutic acetaminophen on vaccine responses in pediatric – and adult populations, with conflicting results (Table 1).

Table 1

At booster vaccination, the same dose was given to infants weighing between 7 kg and less than 9 kg and those with bodyweight of 9 kg or greater received four administrations of 125 mg acetaminophen each within 24 h (≤ 55.6 mg/kg/24 h).

### Drug dosing in the critically ill obese patient-a focus on sedation, analgesia, and delirium [^112swpQL]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-opioid analgesics

Non-opioid analgesics commonly administered to critically ill patients typically use non-weight-based dosing regimens based on information in product literature given the lack of prospective studies evaluating weight-based regimens. The few pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies evaluating the disposition of non-opioid agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen, suggest variable pharmacokinetic parameters with little benefit for dose individualization based on weight. Furthermore, there are adverse effect concerns when increasing doses beyond those needed to reach the analgesic ceiling effect. Some adverse effects (e.g. acetaminophen-induced liver injury) may be more frequent in patients with obesity. Therefore, no size descriptor recommendation is needed for analgesic agents administered by non-weight-based dosing regimens.

ACOG Practice Advisory — acetaminophen use in pregnancy: ACOG reaffirms that acetaminophen remains the analgesic and antipyretic of choice during pregnancy, and judicious use at the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration, in consultation with an obstetrician–gynecologist or other obstetric care professional, remains consistent with best practice. The current weight of evidence does not support a causal link between prenatal acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, and at this time, no change in clinical practice is warranted; ACOG's recommendations for the use of acetaminophen for specific indications remain current.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^115FE9uj]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) for pain management — APAP, also known as paracetamol, is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic agent whose analgesic and antipyretic actions appear limited to the central nervous system and, for this reason, APAP is ineffective as an anti-inflammatory; research suggests that APAP may also act as a cannabinoid system modulator. The most commonly reported side effect is GI discomfort, and the most common severe effects are hepatotoxicity from significant overdose with hepatocellular damage and death; toxicity from a single administration < 150 mg/kg for adults or 200 mg/kg for children is rare, and care should be taken in chronic alcoholics and other patients with hepatic dysfunction where the maximum safe daily dose may not be known. APAP has the advantage of being lightweight and low bulk, is available in PO, PR, and IV formulations, and multiple studies comparing IV against PO and PR administrations have found clinical equipoise.

### Comparison of acetaminophen (paracetamol) with ibuprofen for treatment of fever or pain in children younger than 2 years: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113cjFX2]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) and ibuprofen are the most widely prescribed and available over-the-counter medications for management of fever and pain in children. Data from a prospective cohort of 6476 children followed from birthsuggest that as many as 95% of children are exposed to acetaminophen by age 9 months. Despite the common use of these medications, treatment recommendations for young children remain divergent, especially among those younger than 6 months. While acetaminophen is uniformly recommended across countries for use from the neonatal period, the maximum daily dose beyond the neonatal period varies from 60 mg/kg/d in New Zealandand the United Kingdomto 90 mg/kg/d in the United States. Recommendations for ibuprofen use for the treatment of fever and pain in young children are considerably more variable. The New Zealand Formulary for Children, based on the British National Formulary for Children, recommends ibuprofen use from age 1 month at 5 mg/kg/dose, 3 to 4 times daily, to a maximum dose of 30 mg/kg/d. In contrast, in the United States, ibuprofen use is only recommended for children aged at least 6 months, with a higher maximum daily dose of 40 mg/kg/d.

Several authors caution against the use of ibuprofen in younger infants, citing a higher risk of acute kidney injury, particularly in the context of dehydration. Epidemiological studies conducted in North America, the United Kingdom, and Europe suggest that ibuprofen may play a role in the development of serious bacterial infection. Case-control and prospective cohort studies have shown a 2-fold to 5-fold increase in the odds of developing soft tissue infection with ibuprofen use in the context of primary varicella infection, and a similar increase in the odds of developing empyema with ibuprofen use during treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Although acetaminophen is often considered first-line in the treatment of fever and pain in children because its safety is perceived to be more assured, there is growing evidence suggesting acetaminophen use in children is associated with an increased risk of developing asthma and related atopic disease. Data regarding the risks of acetaminophen or ibuprofen in young children are often incorporated in studies across the pediatric age spectrum, but specific literature concerning the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) and systematic reviews of efficacy and safety in children younger than 2 years, particularly in infants younger than 6 months, are lacking.

### Determinants of antipyretic misuse in children up to 5 years of age: a cross-sectional study [^111YDUGM]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Fever in children is a common and usually benign symptom. It is known that antipyretic treatment is ineffective in the prevention of simple febrile seizures. Caregivers' administration of antipyretic medications to children has been reported, but data concerning the formulations used, actual doses administered, and effects of ethnicity and socioeconomic status on administration practices are incomplete.

Objective

The aim of this study was to identify the factors affecting antipyretic administration (higher-than-recommended doses in particular) by caregivers to their febrile children in 2 differing cultural-ethnic backgrounds.

Methods

This cross-sectional survey study, conducted from January to March 2002, was part of a larger, ongoing survey study of the differences in care givers' knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes concerning children's fever in the 2 major cultural-ethnic groups in the Negev District in Israel: Jews and Bedouin Moslems. It was conducted at the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED), Soroka Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel. A structured questionnaire was administered to Jewish and Bedouin Moslem parents or usual caregivers of young (age, 0–60 months) children attending the PED due to fever. Each child's weight was obtained from the PED medical record. After completion of the interview, the reported antipyretic dose per kilogram of body weight was calculated. Less-than-recommended dose was defined as < 9 mg/kg for acetaminophen and < 4.5 mg/kg for ibuprofen. Higher-than-recommended dose was defined as > 16.5 mg/kg for acetaminophen and > 11 mg/kg for ibuprofen.

Results

The caregivers of a total of 201 children (mean [SD] age, 20 [17] months; mean [SD] weight, 10.4 [4.0] kg) were included in the study. The study included 101 Jewish and 100 Bedouin Moslem caregivers. The proportion of people surveyed who were parents was 98%; grandmothers, 2%. Differences existed between the 2 cultural-ethnic groups in the source of knowledge regarding antipyretic use in children (a significantly larger proportion of Jewish caregivers received their knowledge concerning antipyretic use from package inserts compared with Bedouin caregivers [25.7% vs 6.0%; P < 0.001], and a significantly lower proportion of Jewish caregivers used "other" sources [15.8% vs 39.0%; P < 0.001]). Most (65.2%) caregivers indicated that they administered antipyretics for no or minimal elevations in body temperature (< -38 degrees C); 52.7% administered individual acetaminophen doses within 10% of the recommended dose, 34.8% administered a higher-than-recommended dose, and 21.4% repeated the dose at intervals of ≤ 3 hours. More Bedouin than Jewish caregivers exposed their children to higher-than-recommended antipyretic doses (48.0% vs 21.8%; P < 0.001). After adjusting for maternal education and work-for-income status, child's age, child's order in the family, and number of children in the family, a significant and independent inverse relationship was found between child's weight and higher-than-recommended acetaminophen doses, in which for each additional kilogram of body weight, a 30% decrease in the proportion of children administered higher-than-recommended doses was found (odds ratio [OR], 0.7 for each additional kg; 95% CI, 0.59–0.89; P = 0.002). In addition, a significant and independent relationship was found between the formulation of acetaminophen and the administration of higher-than-recommended doses (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.32–10.23; P < 0.001), with rectal suppositories related to the administration of higher-than-recommended dose by 4.9-fold.

Conclusions

The results of this survey concerning antipyretic treatment of children by their Jewish and Bedouin Moslem caregivers suggest that lighter body weight and the use of acetaminophen rectal suppositories were associated with the administration of higher-than-recommended doses of acetaminophen. Recommended doses of acetaminophen must be based not on the age but on the weight of the child.

### Management of fever in children: summary of the Italian pediatric society guidelines [^1162H9Ki]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

This article summarizes the Italian Pediatric Society guideline on the management of the signs and symptoms of fever in children, prepared as part of the National Guideline Program (NGLP).

Methods

Relevant publications in English and Italian were identified through searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from their inception through December 31, 2007. Based on the consensus of a multidisciplinary expert panel, the strength of the recommendations was categorized into 5 grades (A-E) according to NGLP methodology.

Summary

In the health care setting, axillary measurement of body temperature using a digital thermometer is recommended in children aged < 4 weeks; for children aged ≥ 4 weeks, axillary measurement using a digital thermometer or tympanic measurement using an infrared thermometer is recommended. When body temperature is measured at home by parents or care-givers, axillary measurement using a digital thermometer is recommended for all children. Children who are afebrile when seen by the clinician but are reported to have had fever by their caregivers should be considered febrile. In special circumstances, high fever may be a predictive factor for severe bacterial infection. Use of physical methods of reducing fever is discouraged, except in the case of hyperthermia. Use of antipyretics-paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen-is recommended only when fever is associated with discomfort. Combined or alternating use of antipyretics is discouraged. The dose of antipyretic should be based on the child's weight rather than age. Whenever possible, oral administration of paracetamol is preferable to rectal administration. Use of ibuprofen is not recommended in febrile children with chickenpox or dehydration. Use of ibuprofen or paracetamol is not contraindicated in febrile children with asthma. There is insufficient evidence to form any recommendations concerning fever in children with other chronic conditions, but caution is advised in cases of severe hepatic/renal failure or severe malnutrition. Newborns with fever should always be hospitalized because of the elevated risk of severe disease; paracetamol may be used, with the dose adjusted to gestational age. Use of paracetamol or ibuprofen is not effective in preventing febrile convulsion or the adverse effects of vaccines.

### Adolescent dosing and labeling since the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 [^113JJe4L]. JAMA Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

During pediatric drug development, dedicated pharmacokinetic studies are generally performed in all relevant age groups to support dose selection for subsequent efficacy trials. To our knowledge, no previous assessments regarding the need for an intensive pharmacokinetic study in adolescents have been performed.

Objectives

To compare U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved adult and adolescent drug dosing and to assess the utility of allometric scaling for the prediction of drug clearance in the adolescent population.

Design

Adult and adolescent dosing and drug clearance data were obtained from FDA-approved drug labels and publicly available databases containing reviews of pediatric trials submitted to the FDA. Dosing information was compared for products with concordant indications for adolescent and adult patients. Adolescent drug clearance was predicted from adult pharmacokinetic data by using allometric scaling and compared with observed values.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Adolescent and adult dosing information and drug clearance.

Results

There were 126 unique products with pediatric studies submitted to the FDA since the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, of which 92 had at least 1 adolescent indication concordant with an adult indication. Of these 92 products, 87 (94.5%) have equivalent dosing for adults and adolescent patients. For 18 of these 92 products, a minimum weight or body surface area threshold is recommended for adolescents to receive adult dosing. Allometric scaling predicted adolescent drug clearance with an overall mean absolute percentage error of 17.0%.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approved adult and adolescent drug dosing is equivalent for 94.5% of products with an adolescent indication studied since the FDA Amendments Act of 2007. Allometric scaling may be a useful tool to avoid unnecessary dedicated pharmacokinetic studies in the adolescent population during pediatric drug development, although each development program in adolescents requires a full discussion of drug dosing with the FDA.

### Therapeutic acetaminophen is not associated with liver injury in children: a systematic review [^112jU3fp]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Concern exists about the potential for liver injury with therapeutic dosing of acetaminophen in children.

Objective

We systematically reviewed the medical literature to determine the rate at which liver injury has been reported for children prescribed therapeutic doses of acetaminophen (≤ 75 mg/kg per day orally or intravenously or ≤ 100 mg/kg per day rectally).

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to locate all studies in which acetaminophen was administered to a defined pediatric population for ≥ 24 hours and for all case reports of liver injury after therapeutic acetaminophen dosing. Trained reviewers extracted data from each report. Major and minor hepatic adverse events (AEs) were defined prospectively. Causality was assessed by using the Naranjo algorithm.

Results

A total of 62 studies that enrolled 32,414 children were included. No child (0% [95% confidence interval: 0.000–0.009]) was reported to have exhibited signs or symptoms of liver disease, to have received an antidote or transplantation, or to have died. Major or minor hepatic AEs were reported for 10 children (0.031% [95% confidence interval: 0.015–0.057]). The highest transaminase value reported was 600 IU/L. Naranjo scores (2–3) suggested "possible" causation. Twenty-two case reports were identified. In 9 cases, the Naranjo score suggested "probable" causation (5–6).

Conclusions

Hepatoxicity after therapeutic dosing of acetaminophen in children is rarely reported in defined-population studies. Case reports suggest that this phenomenon may occur, but few reports contain sufficient data to support a probable causal relationship.

### Dosing variability in prescriptions of acetaminophen to children: comparisons between pediatricians, family physicians and otolaryngologists [^1133CVYG]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

To make a cross-specialty comparison of dosing variability, we chose only three major specialties: pediatrics, family medicine and otolaryngology. A recent study about child care within the NHI in Taiwan revealed that these three specialties covered 93.3% of ambulatory visits by children younger than 7 years. Because people in Taiwan could freely choose physicians and healthcare settings without referral and the copayment was relatively low within the NHI, otolaryngologists became the second largest specialty in providing ambulatory health care, especially in treating diseases of the respiratory system that accounted for one third of ambulatory visits. In Taiwan, the share of otolaryngology in ambulatory care could reach 9.5% in general population and as high as 20.7% in children.

Although the NHI claims were lacking in the data of body weight, we supposed that the patients in each of three specialties have similar distributions of body weights. On this assumption, we would compare the distributions of acetaminophen dosages prescribed by physicians in three specialties. Our hypothesis was that pediatricians should be more likely to prescribe on the basis of a patient's body weight. The dosing variability by pediatricians should be more marked than that by family physicians or otolaryngologists. The extent of difference in dosing variability between family physicians/otolaryngologists and pediatricians might serve as a quality indicator of prescribing.

### A retrospective description of anesthetic medication dosing in overweight and obese children [^116Xa53i]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric obesity is a major health concern in the United States and as many as 34% of those who require general anesthesia are overweight or obese (OW). The lack of data and recommendations for dosing medications in obese children leaves significant gaps in the understanding of correct dosing in the clinical setting.

Objective

To determine whether OW children were more likely to receive doses of medications outside the recommended range.

Methods

Following IRB approval, patient medical records were queried to identify children 2 through 17 years who underwent noncardiac surgeries and received at least one medication of interest. Children with hepatic disease, renal disease, neurological impairment, sleep-disordered breathing, or missing height or weight measurements were excluded. Children were stratified into weight categories based on age and gender percentiles as per CDC guidelines. Those ≥ 85th percentile were classified as overweight/obese. Ideal and lean weight (for age, gender) were calculated. Drug doses were stratified as under-dosed (> 10% below minimum recommended dose), overdosed (> 10% above maximum recommended dose), or within recommended dose (dose ± 10%). Actual doses were compared to recommended doses as per actual, ideal, or lean weight (as recommended for specific drugs) in the overweight/obese groups vs the control weight (CW) group.

Results

Ten thousand five hundred and nine doses were reviewed. Overweight/obese children were more likely to receive doses outside the recommended dose range than the CW group.

Conclusions

Overweight/obese children were more likely to receive doses of common anesthetic medications outside the recommended doses potentially adding risk of adverse outcomes in these children.

### Pediatric weight errors and resultant medication dosing errors in the emergency department [^113jD2mt]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

An accurate weight is critical for dosing medications in children. Weight errors can lead to medication-dosing errors.

Objectives

This study examined the frequency and consequences of weight errors occurring at 1 children's hospital and 2 general hospitals.

Methods

Using an electronic medical record database, 79,000 emergency department encounters of children younger than 5 years were analyzed. Extreme weights were first identified using weight percentiles. Encounters with potential weight errors were further evaluated using a retrospective chart review to determine whether a weight error and medication-dosing error occurred.

Results

The percentage of weight errors of total encounters at all 3 institutions was low (0.63% on average), but a large proportion of weight errors led to subsequent medication-dosing errors (34% on average). The children's hospital did not have clinically significantly lower occurrences of weight errors or weight-based medication errors. Common weight errors included the weight in pounds being substituted for the weight in kilograms and decimal placement errors.

Conclusions

Weight errors were uncommon at the 3 emergency departments that we studied, but they led to weight-based medication-dosing errors that had the potential to cause harm.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate, acetaminophen (hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen) [^111VQhqw]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population below the age of two years have not been established. Use of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen oral solution in the pediatric population is supported by the evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of hydrocodone and acetaminophen combination products in adults with additional data which support the development of metabolic pathways in children two years of age and over (see for pediatric dosage information). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Geriatric Use

Clinical Studies of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen oral solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Hydrocodone and the major metabolites of acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. Thus the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function due to the accumulation of the parent compound and/or metabolites in the plasma. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

Hydrocodone may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen oral solution and observed closely.

### The Society for Pediatric Anesthesia recommendations for the use of opioids in children during the perioperative period [^112YhH2N]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

9.3 Dosing strategies

There are only two randomized prospective studies evaluating the appropriate dosing of opioids in postoperative pediatric patients. In one study, Sutters et al compared "around the clock" (ATC) dosing to an "as needed" administration (PRN) strategy. In this case, children who received ATC acetaminophen with hydrocodone were compared to those who received the same medications "as needed" for complaints of pain. 107 There was improved pain control in the ATC cohort, but a slightly higher incidence of complications including a higher rate of daytime sedation in this group. A Cochrane review of ATC vs "as needed" dosing, 108 including three RCTs with a total of 246 children aged under 16 years of age found more medication is administered in the ATC group, but were unclear as to whether or not pain management was improved.

Recommendation: There is insufficient evidence to recommend PRN vs scheduled dosing strategies for opioids after surgery in children. Expert consensus is to use a PRN strategy until further evidence is available.

Strength of evidence: C.

9.4 Combinations of opioids and benzodiazepines

A recent FDA review determined that the use of opioid medications in combination with benzodiazepines in adults has increased, and that this practice has resulted in serious side effects. 109 Two studies are highlighted in this statement. The first found that the number of opioid analgesic prescriptions increased 8% and the annual number of benzodiazepine prescriptions increased by 31% over the last 5 years. 110 The number of patients receiving overlapping prescriptions for these two medications has increased by 41%. The second study found that between 2004 and 2011 the rate of opioid overdose deaths, in which benzodiazepines were also implicated, increased from 18% to 31%. 111 However, no similar pediatric data have been reported.

Recommendation: Opioid pain medications should not be prescribed with benzodiazepines except in children for whom there is a specific indication and alternative treatment options are inadequate. Doses should be limited to the lowest effective level and parents should be warned about the potential for excessive sedation and respiratory depression.

Strength of evidence: C.

### Comparing oral paracetamol doses in paediatrics with the new bnf-C dosing [^113W9R75]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The BNF-C 2014–20151 highlighted some key changes to the dosing of paracetamol in paediatrics, including a change in maximum daily dosage of oral paracetamol from 90mg/kg/day to 75mg/kg/day for post-operative pain, and inclusion of age-banded dosing for pain and pyrexia. The local Trust Paediatric Acute Pain Management Manual2 has acknowledged this change, but advised a maximum daily dose of 80mg/kg/day. This audit was undertaken to determine whether national proposed changes were implemented in practice, in comparison with local guidelines.

Aims

The aims and objectives of the audit were to compare oral paracetamol dosing in both medical and surgical settings with the new BNF-C dosing.

Method

Data were collected over a two week period in September 2014, from two medical and two surgical paediatric wards. The criteria for data collection included paediatric patients above the age of one month and up to 18 years, prescribed oral paracetamol for pain or pyrexia. The following data were collected:▸Initials of patients and age (for identification purposes and to prevent duplications)▸Weight (to assess appropriate and safe prescribing)▸Reason for admission (to distinguish between medical and surgical settings).

Results

Data were collected from 24 medical and 48 surgical patients (age range 1 month-16 years). The key findings were:19/24 medical patients were dosed according to the BNF-C age banded guidelines; 5/24 were dosed according to weight: 3 followed the Trust Manual; 1/24 followed the BNF-C, and 1 miscellaneous. No patients had a dose exceeding 80mg/kg/day.87% of surgical patients were dosed according to the weight based calculation, 69% of whom were within the maximum daily dose of 75mg/kg. Of the 31% whose daily dose exceeded 75mg/kg, all were less than 80mg/kg/day. The Trust Pain Manual does not include the dose banding as per the BNF-C but recommends 20mg/kg 6 hourly (max 80mg/kg/day) for acute pain in this age group.

Conclusion

Children on the medical wards were prescribed paracetamol following age banded dosing as per BNF-C, whereas surgical wards were more likely to dose by weight following the Trust Pain Manual. The Trust Pain Manual differs from the BNF-C and recommends a maximum daily dose of 80mg/kg/day for acute severe pain, to ensure adequate pain control and minimise calculation errors. Despite the new guidance in the BNF-C, it was found that many patients were prescribed a maximal daily dose greater than 75mg/kg/day; however no patient's daily dose exceeded 80mg/kg/day as indicated in the Manual. The main finding from the audit was that prescribers were not aware of the change in maximal daily dose of oral paracetamol. To highlight this important point, a poster was designed and distributed amongst the medical and surgical staff on the wards, highlighting that the dose should not exceed 75mg/kg in a 24 hour period.

### Ibuprofen efficacy, tolerability and safety in obese children: a systematic review [^112Lnz9B]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Childhood obesity can affect drug disposition and efficacy of ibuprofen. The primary objective was to assess efficacy of ibuprofen in obese children.

Design

A systematic review was undertaken following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology. Studies were identified from 12 databases. Two independent reviewers evaluated studies against the inclusion criteria and assessed for methodological quality.

Setting

Any clinical setting.

Patients

Patients under 18 years who were overweight/obese.

Interventions

Patients taking ibuprofen for any indication, dose or regimen.

Main Outcome Measures

The efficacy and tolerability of ibuprofen treatment in obese children and presence of any adverse drug reactions.

Results

Searches identified 1305 studies. Four studies met inclusion criteria: three retrospective cohort studies (n = 583, median age: 6 years, range: 1–18 years; n = 200, median age: 11 years, range: 3–18 years; n = 358 median age: 3.1 years, range: 1.2–8.5 years, respectively) and one case study. Each study differed in their method of dosing ibuprofen (weight-based, age-based and adjusted body weight dosing). Various doses were used: 5mg/kg every 6hours, 400mg three times a day, 120mg/dose and a dose calculated using adjusted body weight. One study reported efficacy (obese n = 189, non-obese, n = 394), where adequate pain control was achieved using 5mg/kg. The other three studies did not determine if efficacy differed between obese and non-obese children. One study described adverse effects. An increased risk of bleeding with ibuprofen was noted but did not differentiate between obese and non-obese children.

Conclusion

There are little published data to guide clinicians prescribing ibuprofen in obese children.

### Intravenous acetaminophen use in pediatrics [^113jSVxg]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen is a commonly used pediatric medication that has recently been approved for intravenous use in the United States. The purpose of this article was to review the pharmacodynamics, indications, contraindications, and precautions for the use of intravenous acetaminophen in pediatrics.
