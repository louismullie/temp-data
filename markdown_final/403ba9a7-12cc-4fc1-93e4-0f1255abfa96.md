## Question

what beta blockers improve heart function in chf?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which beta-blockers improve heart function in congestive heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the heart failure phenotype, because benefits differ in HFrEF versus HFpEF. Then, I should verify which specific beta-blockers have randomized trial evidence of improving outcomes. Next, I will review the magnitude and nature of benefit, including mortality, hospitalizations, and reverse remodeling. After that, I need to check whether benefits are a class effect or agent-specific. Finally, I will consider dosing strategy, special populations, and guideline alignment to synthesize a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions, because I need to ensure we are talking about the right patients. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is typically defined as LVEF 40% or less, whereas heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is generally defined as LVEF 50% or greater, with HFmrEF as the intermediate 41–49% range; benefits of beta-blockers are robust and guideline-endorsed in HFrEF, but remain uncertain or mixed in HFpEF, so I should be careful not to overgeneralize [^113roJAv] [^115Emj6D] [^1113JZUw].

> Next, I should review which beta-blockers have definitive outcome data in HFrEF. Wait, let me verify the agents and formulations: the three with replicated, mortality-reducing evidence are bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained-release metoprolol succinate; nebivolol has supportive but less definitive data and is not universally included in core recommendations, so I should prioritize the first three when the goal is to improve heart function and survival [^113roJAv] [^112mBNXd] [^114p8N7W] [^116MbCbb].

> I will now examine the strength of evidence for each agent. MERIT-HF showed that metoprolol CR/XL reduced all-cause mortality by about 34% and sudden cardiac death by about 41% in NYHA II–IV HFrEF, with early divergence of survival curves after roughly 60–90 days, which reassures me about both magnitude and time course of benefit [^112d2ovU] [^1143iKBD]. CIBIS-II demonstrated a significant mortality reduction with bisoprolol in similar populations, reinforcing the class benefit in HFrEF [^116tHBU9]. Carvedilol showed consistent benefits across multiple trials and was associated with improved survival in COPERNICUS in advanced HFrEF, extending applicability to sicker patients when carefully titrated [^1118P7Zm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without checking the functional impact. Beyond mortality, beta-blockers improve heart function via reverse remodeling with increases in LVEF, reductions in ventricular volumes, and improved symptoms and functional class; in MERIT-HF, for example, LVEF improved and NYHA class moved favorably, and pooled analyses estimate roughly a 30% mortality reduction and 40% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations, which aligns with my clinical observations of improved exercise tolerance after up-titration [^112d2ovU] [^1118P7Zm] [^1161D2Bs].

> I should confirm whether this is a class effect or if one beta-blocker is superior. Network meta-analyses indicate broadly similar mortality benefits across bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol succinate, suggesting a class effect in HFrEF rather than clear superiority of a single agent; however, the COMET head-to-head trial suggested carvedilol may have a survival edge over immediate-release metoprolol tartrate, but critics note underdosing and formulation issues, so I need to be cautious in interpreting that as carvedilol superiority over metoprolol succinate [^115WnJKk] [^113f76QV] [^115Mi4fb] [^1155oLjF]. Observational comparative effectiveness studies have shown conflicting signals, so I should avoid over-asserting agent-specific differences outside trials and stick to the three proven agents in practice [^1111X1vJ] [^114ptZpj].

> Let me think about dosing and titration, because heart function gains are dose-related but must be balanced with tolerability. Guidelines recommend starting very low and doubling about every 2 weeks toward target doses used in trials: carvedilol 25 mg twice daily, bisoprolol 10 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily; importantly, MERIT-HF subgroup analyses suggest that even patients who cannot reach full target may still derive substantial benefit if heart rate falls adequately, so I should individualize to heart rate, blood pressure, and symptoms rather than abandoning therapy at subtarget doses [^113roJAv] [^114p8N7W] [^116za918]. I should double-check that patients are euvolemic before initiation and monitor for congestion during up-titration to mitigate early decompensation risk [^113roJAv].

> But wait, what if the patient is in acute decompensation or has very low blood pressure. I need to ensure beta-blockers are not started in decompensated heart failure or when inotropes are required; however, if a patient with chronic HFrEF is admitted with ADHF, continuation of the beta-blocker is generally preferred over withdrawal when hemodynamics allow, as abrupt cessation can worsen outcomes, and initiation can proceed once the patient is stabilized and euvolemic [^113roJAv] [^116TmR4n] [^1127K96k].

> Next, I should review special populations, because the magnitude of benefit can vary. In patients with atrial fibrillation, individual patient data meta-analyses suggest no clear mortality benefit from beta-blockers in HFrEF, though rate control remains important; thus, I should not expect the same prognostic impact in AF and may prioritize rhythm strategy or alternative rate-control options when appropriate [^113z7DGQ] [^116etAoD]. In older adults, beta-blockers remain beneficial and generally well tolerated when titrated carefully, with age alone not a major predictor of intolerance, which supports offering therapy even in the elderly [^116TgMg2] [^111RmijA].

> I should confirm the stance in HFpEF, because this is where confusion often arises. High-quality randomized data for beta-blockers in HFpEF are limited; meta-analyses and observational studies show mixed signals, with some suggesting possible reductions in cardiovascular mortality but others showing neutral or even higher heart failure hospitalization risk in higher EF strata, so routine use for HFpEF is not guideline-endorsed and decisions should be individualized to comorbidities like ischemia, hypertension, or atrial fibrillation rather than for HFpEF per se [^111aBDwR] [^114q1j4h] [^112nuzcm] [^113roJAv]. Let me reconsider: if the patient has HFpEF with compelling indications like CAD or AF, a beta-blocker may still be reasonable for those reasons, but I should avoid implying disease-modifying benefit in HFpEF [^113roJAv].

> Finally, I need to ensure my recommendation aligns with contemporary guidelines and regulatory labeling. Current ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines give a Class I recommendation to one of the three mortality-proven beta-blockers in symptomatic HFrEF, emphasizing initiation after stabilization, gradual titration to target or maximally tolerated dose, and long-term continuation even if symptoms improve; performance measures similarly track use of bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol succinate as quality indicators in HFrEF care [^113roJAv] [^112mBNXd] [^116LtvZ9]. The FDA label for metoprolol succinate reflects the MERIT-HF outcomes, reinforcing the evidence base for that specific formulation in HFrEF [^114akmi6].

> Bottom line, after verifying the phenotype and evidence base, I should recommend one of the three proven beta-blockers — bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained-release metoprolol succinate — for patients with HFrEF who are hemodynamically stable, start low, titrate every 2 weeks toward target doses as tolerated, monitor for congestion and bradycardia, and continue long term to improve heart function, reduce hospitalizations, and prolong survival; in HFpEF, evidence is insufficient to recommend routine beta-blocker therapy for the syndrome itself, though comorbidity-driven indications may still apply [^113roJAv] [^112mBNXd] [^112d2ovU] [^1118P7Zm] [^111aBDwR].

Beta-blockers improve heart function in chronic heart failure by **reversing sympathetic overactivity** [^1161D2Bs] and promoting beneficial remodeling, with the most robust evidence for **bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol succinate** [^113roJAv] [^112d2ovU]. These agents reduce mortality, hospitalizations, and improve symptoms and ejection fraction in HFrEF [^112wwr6C] [^1118P7Zm], with benefits across ischemic and non-ischemic etiologies [^115Mi4fb]. They should be initiated at low doses and titrated to target or maximally tolerated doses [^114p8N7W] [^116UWrdx]; **avoid in acute decompensation** or severe bradycardia [^113roJAv]. Evidence in HFpEF is limited and mixed [^111aBDwR], so beta-blockers are not routinely recommended unless indicated for comorbidities [^111aBDwR].

---

## Mechanisms of benefit

Beta-blockers improve heart function in CHF through several mechanisms:

- **Reverse sympathetic overactivity**: Chronic sympathetic activation in CHF causes adverse remodeling, arrhythmias, and progression of heart failure. Beta-blockers counteract this by reducing heart rate, myocardial oxygen demand, and arrhythmias [^1161D2Bs].

- **Reverse remodeling**: Beta-blockers reduce myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and chamber dilation, improving ventricular function and ejection fraction [^1161D2Bs].

- **Reduction of arrhythmias**: By decreasing sympathetic tone and heart rate, beta-blockers reduce the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death [^116XfFTc].

---

## Beta-blockers with proven benefit

Three beta-blockers have **consistent evidence** of improving heart function and outcomes in CHF:

| **Beta-blocker** | **Clinical trial evidence** | **Key outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| Bisoprolol | CIBIS-II | - Reduced mortality <br/> - Hospitalizations <br/> - Improved ejection fraction [^116tHBU9] |
| Carvedilol | - COPERNICUS <br/> - COMET | - Reduced mortality <br/> - Hospitalizations <br/> - Improved ejection fraction [^1118P7Zm] |
| Metoprolol succinate | MERIT-HF | - Reduced mortality <br/> - Hospitalizations <br/> - Improved ejection fraction [^112d2ovU] |

---

These agents are **recommended by current guidelines** for all patients with HFrEF unless contraindicated [^113roJAv] [^116LtvZ9].

---

## Clinical outcomes

Beta-blockers consistently improve **clinical outcomes** in CHF:

- **Mortality reduction**: Approximately 30–35% reduction in all-cause mortality [^1118P7Zm] [^112d2ovU].

- **Reduction in hospitalizations**: Significant reduction in heart failure hospitalizations and progression of heart failure [^112d2ovU] [^1118P7Zm].

- **Improvement in ejection fraction**: Average increase of 5–10% in left ventricular ejection fraction, indicating improved cardiac function [^111MRmry].

- **Symptom improvement**: Better exercise tolerance, reduced dyspnea, and improved quality of life [^112wwr6C].

---

## Patient selection and dosing

Beta-blockers should be **initiated in stable patients** with HFrEF [^113roJAv]. Start at low doses and titrate every 2 weeks to target or maximally tolerated doses [^114p8N7W] [^116UWrdx]. Avoid initiation in acute decompensation or severe bradycardia [^1127K96k].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

Beta-blockers are generally well tolerated, but **contraindications** include severe bradycardia, second- or third-degree AV block, and severe asthma. Common adverse effects include hypotension, bradycardia, dizziness, and fatigue. In HFpEF, evidence is limited and mixed; beta-blockers are not routinely recommended unless indicated for comorbidities [^111aBDwR] [^114q1j4h].

---

Beta-blockers are a cornerstone of CHF management, **improving heart function and outcomes** in HFrEF. Bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol succinate are the preferred agents, with benefits across ischemic and non-ischemic etiologies.

### Clinical trials of β-blockers in heart failure: a class review [^112CTqZL]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Heart failure remains a clinically challenging illness, with increasing incidence and prevalence and a high risk of mortality. The introduction of agents that interfere with the neurohormonal response to chronic left-ventricular dysfunction has resulted in improved patient outcomes. Owing to slowed disease progression and reduced mortality, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are indicated in all patients with heart failure. New data indicate that in appropriate patients, beta-blocker therapy relieves the symptoms associated with heart failure, reduces hospitalizations, and improves survival when added to standard therapy. Questions still remain regarding the ideal use of beta blockers in heart failure, and ongoing trials will attempt to clarify those points.

Objective

To briefly discuss the pathophysiology of heart failure and the rationale for the use of beta-blockers in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Key morbidity reduction trials are briefly mentioned, and recent mortality reduction trials are reviewed. General recommendations regarding the use of beta-blockers in heart failure are also included to guide clinical practice.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and meta-analyses evaluating mortality reduction with beta-blockers in the treatment of heart failure were identified using a MEDLINE search from January 1993 to March 2000. Abstracts and presented results from recent scientific meetings were also considered.

Data Synthesis

Beta-blockers have been shown to decrease hospitalization for worsening heart failure, decrease the need for heart transplant, improve New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and increase left-ventricular ejection fraction. A mortality benefit has recently been demonstrated for patients with chronic heart failure. Carvedilol, bisoprolol, and controlled-release/extended-release metoprolol decreased the risk of dying by 65%, 34%, and 34%, respectively, in patients with primarily NYHA functional class II or III and systolic dysfunction. The benefit of these agents in patients with class IV heart failure or determining whether one agent has an advantage over another is being investigated in ongoing clinical trials.

Conclusions

Several beta-blockers have demonstrated mortality reduction in the treatment of patients with NYHA functional class II or III heart failure and systolic dysfunction. Beta-blockers should be considered in these patients when they are clinically stable and taking the current standard therapy of a diuretic plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or other vasodilator agent.

Context

Care of patients with heart failure has been revolutionized throughout the past decade. A paradigm shift in the strategy for treating heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction is in progress. Despite the initial perception about beta-blockers' safety, they are now the most extensively studied class of agents in the treatment of heart failure and have emerged as an important intervention to improve the clinical outcomes of heart failure patients.

Objective

To provide scientific rationale for the use of beta-blockers for patients with heart failure.

Data Sources

All English-language articles of large, randomized controlled clinical trials assessing the mortality benefits of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure were identified to provide the scientific rationale for the use of beta-blockers in heart failure. Basic science studies were reviewed to provide an overview of the potential physiologic role of beta-blockers in heart failure. Finally, clinical guidelines for the treatment of patients with heart failure were assessed to determine current recommendations for the use of these agents.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized controlled clinical trials of beta-blockers that included more than 300 subjects and assessed mortality as a primary end point.

Data Synthesis

Of the 4 beta-blockers tested in large randomized controlled clinical trials of patients with heart failure, 3 are available in the United States, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol; 2 of these, carvedilol and metoprolol, have Food and Drug Administration indications for the treatment of heart failure. Compared with placebo treatment, beta-blocker use is associated with a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations in patients with class II and III heart failure.

Conclusions

Tested in more than 10,000 patients, beta-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in class II through IV heart failure. Along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics, beta-blockers have strengthened the armamentarium to improve clinical outcomes of heart failure patients. The science supporting beta-blockers must be translated into practice safely and rationally if the agents are to achieve their full potential.

### Drug treatment effects on outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ToofK]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In trials enrolling patients with HFpEF, defined using an LV ejection fraction ≥ 40%, beta-blockers reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality by 22% and 25%, respectively. There was no significant effect of ACE inhibitors, ARB or MRA on the same outcomes. The effect of treatments on functional and quality of life outcomes was limited. Further adequately powered RCTs in beta-blocker therapy in this patient group is warranted to confirm this finding.

Key messages

What is already known on this subject?

There have been no individual large randomised controlled trials which demonstrate improvements in clinical outcomes for patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. This is represented in the latest European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure guidelines, which advocate treatment of comorbidities and symptoms.

What might this study add?

This meta-analysis shows that pooled analysis of beta-blocker trials demonstrates reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality by 22% and 25%, respectively, with no pooled effect seen in ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker and mineralocorticoid antagonist trials. There may also be a small benefit in terms of quality of life with several of the drug classes tested, although no difference in functional outcomes.

How might this impact on clinical practice?

Clinicians should consider using beta-blockers when there is an existing indication for them. There may be benefit in repeating a randomised controlled trial of beta-blockers in heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction with contemporary patient cohorts.

### Benefits of β blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: network meta-analysis [^115Mi4fb]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

β blockers, as a class, provided credible mortality benefits in comparison with placebo or standard treatment in patients with heart failure, and the beneficial effects on mortality persisted irrespective of the duration of treatment. However, we found no obvious differences when comparing the different β blockers head to head for the risk of death, sudden cardiac death, death due to pump failure, or drug discontinuation by way of a network meta-analysis or mixed treatment comparison. Accordingly, improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction were also similar irrespective of the individual study drug.

β blockers have long been shown to have unequivocal mortality benefits in chronic heart failure, especially with long term follow-up, although this is slightly controversial as most of the landmark randomized controlled trials of β blockers have been stopped prematurely. Several large trials and meta-analyses have assessed the mortality benefit of β blockers in chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and have shown a mortality benefit of β blocker use in chronic heart failure as well as in ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Various studies have looked at important reduction in clinically relevant endpoints such as sudden death, pump failure, and hospital readmission rates with β blockers in heart failure. Retrospective analyses have compared different β blockers and their effect on clinical endpoints in chronic heart failure, and no superiority was found for one individual class over another in reducing mortality or readmissions. When the surrogate endpoint of improvement in ejection fraction has been investigated, superiority of any one class of β blockers could not be definitely established. With this robust evidence in favor of β blockers in chronic heart failure, we decided to assess the efficacy of one β blocker over another by comparing them using a Bayesian network meta-analysis, in view of paucity of head to head trial data, except for the COMET study.

Rationale and recommendations for dosing of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction emphasize outcome benefits and titration to target or maximally tolerated doses. The rationale states that use of guideline-recommended beta blockers "has been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF, and studies have supported a dose-response relationship of beta blockers with improved outcomes", and that "treating at less than the target dose may result in worse clinical outcomes" with "the percentage of patients achieving these doses is low and remains low over time". It adds, "Treatment with a beta blocker should be initiated at very low doses, followed by gradual incremental increases in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated. Clinicians should make every effort to achieve the target doses of the beta blockers shown to be effective in major clinical trials". The 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline specifies, "Use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (eg, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality" with "(Class I, Level of Evidence: A)". The 2017 ACC decision pathway adds, "After a diagnosis of heart failure is made, GDMT should be initiated and therapies should be adjusted no more frequently than every 2 weeks to target doses (or maximally tolerated doses)" and "To achieve the maximal benefits of GDMT in patients with chronic HFrEF, therapies must be initiated and titrated to maximally tolerated doses".

### Benefits of β blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: network meta-analysis [^115WnJKk]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To clarify whether any particular β blocker is superior in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction or whether the benefits of these agents are mainly due to a class effect.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis of efficacy of different β blockers in heart failure.

Data Sources

CINAHL(1982–2011), Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Trials (-2011), Embase (1980–2011), Medline/PubMed (1966–2011), and Web of Science (1965–2011).

Study Selection

Randomized trials comparing β blockers with other β blockers or other treatments.

Data Extraction

The primary endpoint was all cause death at the longest available follow-up, assessed with odds ratios and Bayesian random effect 95% credible intervals, with independent extraction by observers.

Results

21 trials were included, focusing on atenolol, bisoprolol, bucindolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and nebivolol. As expected, in the overall analysis, β blockers provided credible mortality benefits in comparison with placebo or standard treatment after a median of 12 months (odds ratio 0.69, 0.56 to 0.80). However, no obvious differences were found when comparing the different β blockers head to head for the risk of death, sudden cardiac death, death due to pump failure, or drug discontinuation. Accordingly, improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction were also similar irrespective of the individual study drug.

Conclusion

The benefits of β blockers in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction seem to be mainly due to a class effect, as no statistical evidence from current trials supports the superiority of any single agent over the others.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^114NJtrR]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — selection of patients and initiation: Beta-blockers should be prescribed to all patients with stable HF due to reduced LVEF unless they have a contraindication or are unable to tolerate them, and treatment with a beta-blocker should be initiated as soon as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is diagnosed. Therapy should not be delayed until symptoms return or disease progression is documented, and even patients with little disability should receive treatment with a beta-blocker to reduce the risk of disease progression, future clinical deterioration, and sudden death. Patients need not be taking high doses of ACEIs prior to starting a beta-blocker, and in those taking a low dose of an ACEI, adding a beta-blocker produces a greater improvement in symptoms and reduction in risk of death than increasing the ACEI dose to trial targets. In patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention, beta-blockers should not be prescribed without diuretics.

### Beta-blockers for heart failure with reduced, mid-range, and preserved ejection fraction: an individual patient-level analysis of double-blind randomized trials [^113z7DGQ]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Recent guidelines recommend that patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40–49% should be managed similar to LVEF ≥ 50%. We investigated the effect of beta-blockers according to LVEF in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.

Methods and Results

Individual patient data meta-analysis of 11 trials, stratified by baseline LVEF and heart rhythm (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT0083244; PROSPERO: CRD42014010012). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death over 1.3years median follow-up, with an intention-to-treat analysis. For 14262 patients in sinus rhythm, median LVEF was 27% (interquartile range 21–33%), including 575 patients with LVEF 40–49% and 244 ≥ 50%. Beta-blockers reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared to placebo in sinus rhythm, an effect that was consistent across LVEF strata, except for those in the small subgroup with LVEF ≥ 50%. For LVEF 40–49%, death occurred in 21/292 [7.2%] randomized to beta-blockers compared to 35/283 [12.4%] with placebo; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.59 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34–1.03]. Cardiovascular death occurred in 13/292 [4.5%] with beta-blockers and 26/283 [9.2%] with placebo; adjusted HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.24–0.97). Over a median of 1.0years following randomization (n = 4601), LVEF increased with beta-blockers in all groups in sinus rhythm except LVEF ≥ 50%. For patients in atrial fibrillation at baseline (n = 3050), beta-blockers increased LVEF when < 50% at baseline, but did not improve prognosis.

Conclusion

Beta-blockers improve LVEF and prognosis for patients with heart failure in sinus rhythm with a reduced LVEF. The data are most robust for LVEF < 40%, but similar benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with LVEF 40–49%.

### Heart failure drug treatment [^1113JZUw]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure is the most common cardiovascular reason for hospital admission for people older than 60 years of age. Few areas in medicine have progressed as remarkably as heart failure treatment over the past three decades. However, progress has been consistent only for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In acutely decompensated heart failure and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, none of the treatments tested to date have been definitively proven to improve survival. Delaying or preventing heart failure has become increasingly important in patients who are prone to heart failure. The prevention of worsening chronic heart failure and hospitalisations for acute decompensation is also of great importance. The objective of this Series paper is to provide a concise and practical summary of the available drug treatments for heart failure. We support the implementation of the international guidelines. We offer views on the basis of our personal experience in research areas that have insufficient evidence. The best possible evidence-based drug treatment (including inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and β blockers) is useful only when optimally implemented. However, implementation might be challenging. We believe that disease management programmes can be helpful in providing a multidisciplinary, holistic approach to the delivery of optimal medical care.

### Association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^114iyZgS]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of hospitalizations and is associated with increased health care costs. More than half of the patients with HF have a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), defined as an ejection fraction (EF) of 50% or greater. Heart failure with a preserved EF continues to increase in prevalence and is associated with a high rate of hospitalization, yet, to our knowledge, evidenced-based therapies are lacking.,

β-Adrenergic receptor blockers (β-blockers) provide an unequivocal benefit in the treatment of chronic HF with a reduced EF (HFrEF), with a strong foundation of evidence to support their use. Most patients with HFpEF enrolled in contemporary clinical trials or in published cohorts also receive β-blockers, despite an uncertain benefit. A recent patient-based meta-analysis of 11 randomized β-blocker HF trials that enrolled patients with HFrEF also included a small number of patients with HFpEF. This analysis reinforced the benefit of β-blockers for patients with a reduced EF but did not demonstrate any benefit for patients with an EF greater than 50%.

To extend our understanding of the role β-blockers play in HFpEF, we performed an analysis of data from participants randomized in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) clinical trial. The primary focus of this analysis was to investigate the association of β-blocker use with HF hospitalizations among patients at different EF thresholds.

### Misconceptions and facts about beta-blockers [^113tw7oQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers are commonly used medications, and they have been traditionally considered "cardioprotective". Their clinical use appears to be more widespread than the available evidence base supporting their role in cardioprotection. Beta-blockers counteract neurohumoral activation in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and offer both symptomatic improvement and reduction in adverse events. On the other hand, the use of beta-blockers in uncomplicated hypertension results in suboptimal outcomes compared to the established first-line antihypertensive agents. Providers at all levels should be familiar with common misconceptions regarding beta-blocker use in routine clinical practice.

Several life-prolonging therapies are available for the treatment of heart failure, yet they are underutilized in many patients. A treatment gap exists between patients who are eligible for a therapy and the number of patients who actually receive them. Suboptimal prescribing rates for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have been reported. Strategies are needed to increase the proportion of patients who are receiving evidence-based therapies. Predischarge initiation of evidence-based therapies has effectively increased utilization in the acute coronary syndrome population. Predischarge initiation of beta-blockade in patients hospitalized for heart failure has also been shown to be safe and effective for improving beta-blocker use at 60 days. Larger registry initiatives have demonstrated improved use of evidence-based therapies associated with implementation of a performance improvement process system. The mortality and morbidity associated with heart failure is strikingly high, and it is critical that proven therapies are prescribed to all eligible patients so that clinical outcomes can be improved. Systematic processes are effective approaches to ensuring appropriate evidence-based therapies are prescribed in most patients.

### Drug treatment effects on outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1179Hftw]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical drug trials in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction have failed to demonstrate improvements in mortality.

Methods

We systematically searched Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials (RCT) assessing pharmacological treatments in patients with heart failure with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction ≥ 40% from January 1996 to May 2016. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, exercise capacity (6-min walk distance, exercise duration, VO 2 max), quality of life and biomarkers (B-type natriuretic peptide, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide). Random-effects models were used to estimate pooled relative risks (RR) for the binary outcomes, and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes, with 95% CI.

Results

We included data from 25 RCTs comprising data for 18101 patients. All-cause mortality was reduced with beta-blocker therapy compared with placebo (RR: 0.78, 95%CI 0.65 to 0.94, p = 0.008). There was no effect seen with ACE inhibitors, aldosterone receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and other drug classes, compared with placebo. Similar results were observed for cardiovascular mortality. No single drug class reduced heart failure hospitalisation compared with placebo.

Conclusion

The efficacy of treatments in patients with heart failure and an LV ejection fraction ≥ 40% differ depending on the type of therapy, with beta-blockers demonstrating reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Further trials are warranted to confirm treatment effects of beta-blockers in this patient group.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113roJAv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Beta blockers for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF, with current or previous symptoms, use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, and beta-blocker therapy provides high economic value. Treatment with beta blockers reduces the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization in patients with HFrEF. Beta blockers should be initiated at low doses with efforts to achieve target doses as tolerated, and they can be safely started before hospital discharge when patients are clinically stabilized and do not require intravenous inotropic therapy for HF. Even if symptoms or LVEF improve, long-term treatment with target doses should be maintained to reduce risk of progression, and abrupt withdrawal should be avoided unless indicated.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit and agent selection is summarized as follows: Three beta-blockers have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of death in patients with chronic heart failure (HF): bisoprolol, sustained-release metoprolol (succinate), and carvedilol; positive findings with these 3 agents should not be considered a class effect, and patients who have Stage C HF should be treated with 1 of these 3 beta-blockers. In one head-to-head trial, carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) versus immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose 50 mg twice daily) was associated with a significantly reduced mortality, and there have been no trials to explore whether the survival benefits of carvedilol are greater than those of sustained-release metoprolol when both are used at the target doses.

### Drug treatment effects on outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116kXWkB]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this meta-analysis show significant reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in RCTs using beta-blockers, while RAAS blockade (using ACE inhibitor, ARB and MRA individually) demonstrated no effect on mortality. Improvements in functional outcomes and quality of life were not significantly or consistently demonstrated using pooled results. Heterogeneity within trials that reported biomarker outcomes was too high to allow comparison.

The effect of beta-blockade on mortality suggests favourable outcomes in patients with LV ejection fraction > 40%. Similar benefits have been demonstrated in pooled analysis of observational studies and previous meta-analyses. Of the three beta-blocker trials, only one trial individually showed a significant reduction in mortality, and contributed the greatest weight to overall effects due to the high event rate. The two larger RCTs showed neutral results, although were both underpowered to detect effects on mortality. Notably, all three beta-blocker trials used an LV ejection fraction threshold of 40%, whereas trials using ACE inhibitor, ARB and MRA tended to use higher ejection fraction thresholds. The demonstrated reduction in mortality with beta-blockers may have been augmented by their effects on the HFmrEF population within these trials; a group that an emerging body of evidence suggests is more closely aligned with HFrEF. The beneficial effect of beta-blockers on mortality appears to be through preventing cardiovascular death, supported by a 25% reduction in cardiovascular mortality. We did not further investigate causes of cardiovascular death, although the pleiotropic effects of beta-blocker (such as its anti-arrhythmic properties) are likely to be important. Future sufficiently powered clinical trials and observational or registry data will be important in discerning if there is a true effect in patients with heart failure with an LV ejection fraction of 40% or more, and whether this benefit extends to those with LV ejection fraction > 50%. While we did not demonstrate a benefit for beta-blockers in hospitalisation for heart failure, 'hospitalisation' should not be interpreted in isolation since mortality events will impact future hospitalisation events.

### Benefits of β blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: network meta-analysis [^116MbCbb]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Results

After screening 720 citations (fig 1), we included 21 studies, with a total of 23 122 patients, treated with atenolol, bisoprolol, bucindolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, nebivolol, or placebo/standard treatment. Patients had a median age of 61 years, 77% were male, ischemic heart failure was present in 57%, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction was 25%, and patients were followed for a median of 12 months. In addition to standard anti-heart failure treatment except β blockers, the control group received placebo in all but two trials (in which the control group received an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor but no β blocker) (fig 2). One study compared carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate directly, although that has been criticized for under-dosing of metoprolol and for the use of a short acting formulation instead of an extended release form. Characteristics of studies are summarized in table 1and appendix table A. All trials had a low risk of bias according to Cochrane metrics (appendix table B).

Overall pair-wise meta-analysis confirmed a significant reduction in mortality with use of β blockers versus all comparators (both active and placebo) — odds ratio 0.71, 95% credible interval 0.64 to 0.80; P < 0.001 (fig 3). Separate meta-analyses incorporating odds ratios from individual trials with shorter duration of follow-up (< 12 months) (odds ratio 0.57, 0.46 to 0.70) and hazard ratios from trials with longer duration of follow-up (> 12 months) (hazard ratio 0.70, 0.60 to 0.81) to account for the differential follow-up periods showed effect sizes consistent with the results of the overall primary pair-wise meta-analysis (appendix figures A and B). We further corroborated this with another separate network meta-analysis of hazard ratios using a random effects Poisson regression model (appendix table C).

### Systematic review of the impact of beta blockers on mortality and hospital admissions in heart failure [^1168VPy5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a common condition that carries a high burden of mortality and morbidity. Several randomised trials have evaluated the effects of beta blockers in heart failure. This paper gives a systematic overview of published randomised trials of beta blockers in heart failure using standard methods. In all, 22 randomised controlled trials were identified with a total of 10480 patients, and an average of 11 months of treatment. The average age was 61 years and 4% were female. Most studies excluded patients with severe heart failure. Death rates in patients randomised to receive beta blockers compared to controls were 458/5657 (8.0%) and 635/4951 (12.8%) respectively, odds ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.55–0.72, P < 0.00001. Similar reductions were observed for hospital admissions for worsening heart failure (11.3 vs. 17.1%, respectively, odds ratio 0.63) and for the composite outcome of death or heart-failure hospital admission (19.4 vs. 26.9%, respectively, odds ratio 0.66). These results show that beta blockers reduce the risk of mortality or the need for heart-failure hospital admission by approximately one third. Absolute reductions of 5–6% in event rates were observed over approximately 1 year of treatment period. These important benefits should be implemented as a priority, since treatment with beta blockers is inexpensive and heart failure carries a high risk of death and disability. Further information on the effect of beta blockers in elderly patients and women would be helpful.

### Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system for chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111aBDwR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system improve survival and reduce morbidity in people with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); a review of the evidence is required to determine whether these treatments are beneficial for people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Objectives

To assess the effects of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in people with HFpEF.

Search Methods

We updated searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and one clinical trial register on 14 May 2020 to identify eligible studies, with no language or date restrictions. We checked references from trial reports and review articles for additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials with a parallel group design, enrolling adults with HFpEF, defined by LVEF greater than 40%.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 41 randomised controlled trials (231 reports), totalling 23,492 participants across all comparisons. The risk of bias was frequently unclear and only five studies had a low risk of bias in all domains. Beta-blockers (BBs) We included 10 studies (3087 participants) investigating BBs. Five studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 30 years to 81 years. A possible reduction in cardiovascular mortality was observed (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional benefit (NNTB) 25; 1046 participants; three studies), however, the certainty of evidence was low. There may be little to no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.00; 1105 participants; four studies; low-certainty evidence). The effects on heart failure hospitalisation, hyperkalaemia, and quality of life remain uncertain. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) We included 13 studies (4459 participants) investigating MRA. Eight studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 54.5 to 80 years. Pooled analysis indicated that MRA treatment probably reduces heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; NNTB = 41; 3714 participants; three studies; moderate-certainty evidence). However, MRA treatment probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; 4207 participants; five studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.11; 4070 participants; three studies; moderate-certainty evidence). MRA treatment may have little or no effect on quality of life measures (mean difference (MD) 0.84, 95% CI -2.30 to 3.98; 511 participants; three studies; low-certainty evidence). MRA treatment was associated with a higher risk of hyperkalaemia (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.77 to 2.51; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 11; 4291 participants; six studies; high-certainty evidence). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) We included eight studies (2061 participants) investigating ACEIs. Three studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 70 to 82 years. Pooled analyses with moderate-certainty evidence suggest that ACEI treatment likely has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.42; 945 participants; two studies), all-cause mortality (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.45; 1187 participants; five studies) and heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.15; 1019 participants; three studies), and may result in little or no effect on the quality of life (MD -0.09, 95% CI -3.66 to 3.48; 154 participants; two studies; low-certainty evidence). The effects on hyperkalaemia remain uncertain. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) Eight studies (8755 participants) investigating ARBs were included. Five studies used a placebo comparator and in three the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 61 to 75 years. Pooled analyses with high certainty of evidence suggest that ARB treatment has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.02, 95% 0.90 to 1.14; 7254 participants; three studies), all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11; 7964 participants; four studies), heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.02; 7254 participants; three studies), and quality of life (MD 0.41, 95% CI -0.86 to 1.67; 3117 participants; three studies). ARB was associated with a higher risk of hyperkalaemia (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.33; 7148 participants; two studies; high-certainty evidence). Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) Three studies (7702 participants) investigating ARNIs were included. Two studies used ARBs as the comparator and one used standardised medical therapy, based on participants' established treatments at enrolment. The mean age of participants ranged from 71 to 73 years. Results suggest that ARNIs may have little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.15; 4796 participants; one study; moderate-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11; 7663 participants; three studies; high-certainty evidence), or quality of life (high-certainty evidence). However, ARNI treatment may result in a slight reduction in heart failure hospitalisation, compared to usual care (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7362 participants; two studies; moderate-certainty evidence). ARNI treatment was associated with a reduced risk of hyperkalaemia compared with valsartan (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.01; 5054 participants; two studies; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that MRA and ARNI treatment in HFpEF probably reduces heart failure hospitalisation but probably has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality and quality of life. BB treatment may reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality, however, further trials are needed. The current evidence for BBs, ACEIs, and ARBs is limited and does not support their use in HFpEF in the absence of an alternative indication. Although MRAs and ARNIs are probably effective at reducing the risk of heart failure hospitalisation, the treatment effect sizes are modest. There is a need for improved approaches to patient stratification to identify the subgroup of patients who are most likely to benefit from MRAs and ARNIs, as well as for an improved understanding of disease biology, and for new therapeutic approaches.

### Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system for chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1156h8GZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system improve survival and reduce morbidity in people with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. There is uncertainty whether these treatments are beneficial for people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and a comprehensive review of the evidence is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects of beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two clinical trial registries on 25 July 2017 to identify eligible studies. Reference lists from primary studies and review articles were checked for additional studies. There were no language or date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with a parallel group design enrolling adult participants with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, defined by a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 40 percent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. The outcomes assessed included cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, hyperkalaemia, all-cause mortality and quality of life. Risk ratios (RR) and, where possible, hazard ratios (HR) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous data, mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) were calculated. We contacted trialists where neccessary to obtain missing data.

Main Results

37 randomised controlled trials (207 reports) were included across all comparisons with a total of 18,311 participants. Ten studies (3087 participants) investigating beta-blockers (BB) were included. A pooled analysis indicated a reduction in cardiovascular mortality (15% of participants in the intervention arm versus 19% in the control arm; RR 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.99; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25; 1046 participants; 3 studies). However, the quality of evidence was low and no effect on cardiovascular mortality was observed when the analysis was limited to studies with a low risk of bias (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.29; 643 participants; 1 study). There was no effect on all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation or quality of life measures, however there is uncertainty about these effects given the limited evidence available.12 studies (4408 participants) investigating mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) were included with the quality of evidence assessed as moderate. MRA treatment reduced heart failure hospitalisation (11% of participants in the intervention arm versus 14% in the control arm; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; NNTB 41; 3714 participants; 3 studies; moderate-quality evidence) however, little or no effect on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and quality of life measures was observed. MRA treatment was associated with a greater risk of hyperkalaemia (16% of participants in the intervention group versus 8% in the control group; RR 2.11; 95% CI 1.77 to 2.51; 4291 participants; 6 studies; high-quality evidence). Eight studies (2061 participants) investigating angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were included with the overall quality of evidence assessed as moderate. The evidence suggested that ACEI treatment likely has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, or quality of life. Data for the effect of ACEI on hyperkalaemia were only available from one of the included studies. Eight studies (8755 participants) investigating angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) were included with the overall quality of evidence assessed as high. The evidence suggested that treatment with ARB has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, or quality of life. ARB was associated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia (0.9% of participants in the intervention group versus 0.5% in the control group; RR 1.88; 95% CI 1.07 to 3.33; 7148 participants; 2 studies; high-quality evidence). We identified a single ongoing placebo-controlled study investigating the effect of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that MRA treatment reduces heart failure hospitalisation in heart failure with preserverd ejection fraction, however the effects on mortality related outcomes and quality of life remain unclear. The available evidence for beta-blockers, ACEI, ARB and ARNI is limited and it remains uncertain whether these treatments have a role in the treatment of HFpEF in the absence of an alternative indication for their use. This comprehensive review highlights a persistent gap in the evidence that is currently being addressed through several large ongoing clinical trials.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: an umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^116VLu4B]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Heart failure

Beta-blockers have a class I, level of evidence A recommendation in chronic HFrEF, and yet uptake in clinical practice remains suboptimal in certain groups. Subgroup analyses have demonstrated that reduction of mortality and hospitalisation with beta-blockers is consistent in sinus rhythm, regardless of age or gender, baseline heart rate or the degree of reduction in ejection fraction. However, IPD meta-analysis revealed no signal for benefit in the subgroup of patients with atrial fibrillation at baseline. The reasons for this distinction remain unclear, but may relate to differences in the association of heart rate and prognosis compared with sinus rhythm, or consequences such as myocardial fibrosis that may influence therapeutic efficacy. Heart failure with intermediate and preserved LVEF accounts for over half of patients, and yet available data is extremely limited. Further RCTs are clearly warranted to address this evidence gap, as well as the interaction with renal dysfunction which is common in patients with HF.

Perioperative risk reduction

Beta-blockers are commonly considered to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients undergoing surgery, but the controversy over integrity of data in the DECREASE studies has led to questions about their true value. In meta-analyses with low risk of bias, we saw an increase in mortality following non-cardiac surgery compared with control and consistent increases in stroke risk. These adverse events offset any benefit from the reduced risk of MI and were consistent with the largest and highest quality individual RCT, the PeriOperative ISchemic Evaluation (POISE) trial. However, the frequency of mortality and incident stroke (absolute event rates ~ 0.3% and ~ 0.6%, respectively) were rarer than myocardial infarction (~ 4%). Indeed, the NNT to prevent an MI was 72 compared with a NNH of 214 to cause a death and 352 to cause a stroke. In cardiac surgery, where one might anticipate a prognostic benefit from beta-blockers, we found no appreciable reduction in events, including for incident MI.

### Beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction [^112Vp7kt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.4 million people died from ischaemic heart disease in 2012, constituting 15% of all deaths. Beta-blockers are recommended and are often used in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is currently unclear whether beta-blockers should be used in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. Previous meta-analyses on the topic have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methods has assessed the effects of beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of beta-blockers compared with placebo or no treatment in patients without heart failure and with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 40% in the non-acute phase after myocardial infarction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index - Expanded, BIOSIS Citation Index, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, European Medicines Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Turning Research Into Practice, Google Scholar, and SciSearch from their inception to February 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials assessing effects of beta-blockers versus control (placebo or no treatment) in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction, irrespective of publication type and status, date, and language. We excluded trials randomising participants with diagnosed heart failure at the time of randomisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed our published protocol, with a few changes made, and methodological recommendations provided by Cochrane and Jakobsen and colleagues. Two review authors independently extracted data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and major cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial reinfarction). Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, angina, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction during follow-up. We assessed all outcomes at maximum follow-up. We systematically assessed risks of bias using seven bias domains and we assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 25 trials randomising a total of 22,423 participants (mean age 56.9 years). All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias. In all, 24 of 25 trials included a mixed group of participants with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST myocardial infarction, and no trials provided separate results for each type of infarction. One trial included participants with only ST-elevation myocardial infarction. All trials except one included participants younger than 75 years of age. Methods used to exclude heart failure were various and were likely insufficient. A total of 21 trials used placebo, and four trials used no intervention, as the comparator. All patients received usual care; 24 of 25 trials were from the pre-reperfusion era (published from 1974 to 1999), and only one trial was from the reperfusion era (published in 2018). The certainty of evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes. Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 97.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.90; I² = 15%; 22,085 participants, 21 trials; moderate-certainty evidence) and myocardial reinfarction (RR 0.76, 98% CI 0.69 to 0.88; I² = 0%; 19,606 participants, 19 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events (RR 0.72, 97.5% CI 0.69 to 0.84; 14,994 participants, 15 trials; low-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.73, 98% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I² = 47%; 21,763 participants, 19 trials; low-certainty evidence). Hence, evidence seems to suggest that beta-blockers versus placebo or no treatment may result in a minimum reduction of 10% in RR for risks of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction. However, beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may not affect the risk of angina (RR 1.04, 98% CI 0.93 to 1.13; I² = 0%; 7115 participants, 5 trials; low-certainty evidence). No trials provided data on serious adverse events according to good clinical practice from the International Committee for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH-GCP), nor on quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Beta-blockers probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality and myocardial reinfarction in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers may further reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo or no intervention in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. These effects could, however, be driven by patients with unrecognised heart failure. The effects of beta-blockers on serious adverse events, angina, and quality of life are unclear due to sparse data or no data at all. All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias, and incomplete outcome data bias alone could account for the effect seen when major cardiovascular events, angina, and myocardial infarction are assessed. The evidence in this review is of moderate to low certainty, and the true result may depart substantially from the results presented here. Future trials should particularly focus on patients 75 years of age and older, and on assessment of serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP and quality of life. Newer randomised clinical trials at low risk of bias and at low risk of random errors are needed if the benefits and harms of beta-blockers in contemporary patients without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction are to be assessed properly. Such trials ought to be designed according to the SPIRIT statement and reported according to the CONSORT statement.

### Beta-blocker benefit according to severity of heart failure [^116tHBU9]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Beta-blockers are an established treatment for chronic heart failure. However, the relationship between their benefit and the severity of the disease remains to be determined.

Methods and Results

We studied the relationship between amplitude of benefit of beta-blockers and severity of chronic heart failure, based on data for mortality and hospitalizations for worsening heart failure, using a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, complementary subgroup analyses and analysis of individual data from the CIBIS II trial. In the meta-analysis, mortality was reduced by 22% (95%CI: 16 to 28) and hospitalizations for worsening heart failure by 24% (95%CI: 20 to 29). Benefit was similar with metoprolol, bisoprolol and carvedilol. After exclusion of bucindolol trials, due to the heterogeneity of results for mortality, the reduction in mortality was similar according to the severity of heart failure, assessed either by left ventricular ejection fraction or by New York Heart Association classification. In CIBIS II, beta-blockers induced a significant reduction in mortality of 45% (95%CI: 9 to 66), 41% (95%CI: 17 to 59) and 23% (95%CI: 1 to 40) in the low, intermediate and high risk groups, respectively. Hospitalizations were reduced by 35% (95%CI: 2 to 57), 41% (95%CI: 18 to 58) and 23% (95%CI: 0 to 41), there was no significant difference between the three score groups.

Conclusion

We conclude that the amplitude of benefit of the beta-blockers carvedilol, metoprolol and bisoprolol on mortality and morbidity is similar, regardless of the severity of chronic heart failure.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to beta-blockers, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate one of the three β-blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) to reduce mortality and hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF with current or previous symptoms.

### Population-based analysis of class effect of β blockers in heart failure [^1111X1vJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The long-term use of β blockers has been shown to improve the outcomes of patients with heart failure (HF). However, it is still disputed whether this is a class effect, and, specifically, whether carvedilol or bisoprolol are superior to metoprolol. The present study was a comparative effectiveness study of β blockers for patients with HF in a population-based setting. We conducted an observational cohort study using the Quebec administrative databases to identify patients with HF who were prescribed a β blocker after the diagnosis of HF. We used descriptive statistics to characterize the patients by the type of β blocker prescribed at discharge. The unadjusted mortality for users of each β blocker was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using the log-rank test. To account for differences in follow-up and to control for differences among patient characteristics, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the mortality. Of the 26,787 patients with HF, with a median follow-up of 1.8 years per patient, the crude incidence of death was 47% with metoprolol, 40% with atenolol, 41% with carvedilol, 36% with bisoprolol, and 43% with acebutolol. After controlling for several different covariates, we found that carvedilol (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97 to 1.12, p = 0.22) and bisoprolol (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.01, p = 0.16) were not superior to metoprolol in improving survival. Atenolol (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.87, p < 0.0001) and acebutolol (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95, p = 0.004) were superior to metoprolol. In conclusion, we did not find evidence of a class effect for β blockers in patients with HF.

### A trial of the β-blocker bucindolol in patients with advanced chronic heart failure [^112aVLdh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Although beta-adrenergic-receptor antagonists reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with mild-to-moderate chronic heart failure, their effect on survival in patients with more advanced heart failure is unknown.

Methods

A total of 2708 patients with heart failure designated as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III (in 92 percent of the patients) or IV (in 8 percent) and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 percent or lower were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with either bucindolol (1354 patients) or placebo (1354 patients) and followed for the primary end point of death from any cause.

Results

The data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial after the seventh interim analysis. At that time, there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (unadjusted P = 0.16). The results presented here are based on complete follow-up at the time of study termination (average, 2.0 years). There were a total of 449 deaths in the placebo group (33 percent) and 411 deaths in the bucindolol group (30 percent; adjusted P = 0.13). The risk of the secondary end point of death from cardiovascular causes was lower in the bucindolol group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.99), as was the risk of heart transplantation or death (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.99).

Conclusions

In a demographically diverse group of patients with NYHA class III and IV heart failure, bucindolol resulted in no significant overall survival benefit.

### Age is not a significant risk factor for failed trial of β-blocker therapy in older patients with chronic heart failure [^116TgMg2]. Age and Ageing (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate how well older heart failure patients tolerate beta-blockers in everyday clinical practice.

Design

Retrospective casenote analysis.

Setting

Specialist heart failure clinic in a large teaching hospital.

Participants

226 patients with a clinical diagnosis of heart failure and evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Measurements

Data on age, sex, comorbid illness, other medications, duration of beta-blocker therapy, side-effects and reasons for discontinuation.

Results

Patients aged 75 years and over had a higher level of comorbid disease and worse New York Heart Association status. Despite this, 60.4% of those aged 75 or over had been tried on a beta-blocker (versus 69% of those aged < 75), and of those tried, 80% of those aged 75 or over were still taking a beta-blocker at the time of survey (versus 86% of those aged < 75). Forty-seven percent of those aged 75 or over had at least one side-effect recorded (versus 48% of those aged < 75). Significant risk factors for failing a trial of beta-blocker therapy were worse New York Heart Association status and worse left ventricular function, but importantly not age.

Conclusions

A high proportion of older heart failure patients tolerate beta-blockers. Side-effects and failure rates are comparable to younger patients. Left ventricular function and worse New York Heart Association class, rather than age, predict low tolerability of therapy. Further studies are warranted to evaluate whether frail patients with heart failure can improve their quality of life by taking beta-blockers.

### Effect of metoprolol CR / XL in chronic heart failure: metoprolol CR / XL randomised intervention trial in congestive heart failure (MERIT-HF) [^112d2ovU]. Lancet (1999). Excellent credibility.

The study MERIT-HF was published by MERIT-HF Study Group. and colleagues in 1999 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the MERIT-HF study, the trial question was: is conventional therapy plus metoprolol CR/XR once daily superior to conventional therapy alone in patients with HF, a LVEF ≤ 40%, and NYHA class II-IV symptoms? In the MERIT-HF study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MERIT-HF study, the population was: 3991 patients (898 female, 3093 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HF, an LVEF ≤ 40%, and NYHA class II-IV symptoms. The key exclusion criteria were acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 28 days before randomization; indication or contraindication for treatment with beta blockers, HF secondary to systemic disease or alcohol abuse; or AV block of the second and third degree. In the MERIT-HF study, the interventions were: n = 1990 conventional therapy plus metoprolol CR/XR once daily (12.5 mg for NYHA III-IV or 25.0 mg once daily for NYHA II, target dose 200 mg once daily plus optimum standard therapy) n = 2001 placebo (conventional therapy alone). In the MERIT-HF study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in all-cause death (7.2% vs. 11%; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.81). In the MERIT-HF study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in SCD (0.19% vs. 0.132%; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.9) Significant decrease in worsening HF (0.3% vs. 0.58%; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.79). In the MERIT-HF study, the conclusion was: in patients with HF, an LVEF ≤ 40%, and NYHA class II-IV symptoms, conventional therapy plus metoprolol CR/XR once daily was superior to placebo with respect to a all-cause death.

### Association is not causation: treatment effects cannot be estimated from observational data in heart failure [^1114nH5Y]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

Several landmark RCTs demonstrated significant mortality benefit with the use of beta-blockers in HFrEF. Seventeen non-randomized studies reported 18 estimates of beta-blocker 'treatment-effect'. Sixteen of these suggested beta-blocker use was associated with a lower mortality, and two did not, (Table 3).

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction

The effect of beta-blockers on mortality was examined in one small randomized trialand a pre-specified subgroup analysis of a randomized trial which included patients with both HFrEF and HFpEF. Overall, we identified 13 non-randomized studies of beta-blockers in HFpEF, of which nine reported an association between beta-blocker use and better survival, whereas four did not, (Table 3).

Mixed/unspecified heart failure phenotype

One moderately large RCT evaluated the effects of nebivolol in patients with both HFrEF and HFpEF, demonstrating a neutral effect on mortality. We identified 17 observational studies reporting 19 estimates of the 'effect' of treatment, with 17 suggesting benefit, and two reporting no difference in outcome between those treated with and not treated with a beta-blocker(Table 3).

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

Two pivotal RCTs in HFrEF demonstrated the mortality and hospitalization benefits of MRAs. In contrast, of 12 non-randomized studies only one concluded MRAs were of benefit, with 10 finding a neutral effect, and one suggesting a harmful effect(Table 4).

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction

One large RCT showed no effect of spironolactone on mortality in patients with HFpEF. Two observational studies also found a neutral effect, but a further non-randomized study reported an association between MRA use and lower mortality(Table 4).

Mixed/unspecified heart failure phenotype

Of five studies of patients with a mixed HF phenotype, two suggested benefit, and three reported a neutral effect, (Table 4).

### Opportunities for improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure [^114myAtg]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Improved treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF) can slow disease progression, promote clinical stability, and prolong survival.

Hypothesis

Patterns in diagnostic test utilization and pharmacotherapy among patients with newly diagnosed heart failure may affect outcomes.

Methods

Claims data were analyzed from all diagnostic procedures and prescriptions from 1995 to 1998 in 3,353 patients with heart failure diagnosed within 1 year. Rates of diagnostic testing and categories of drugs prescribed were the main outcome measures. Demographic variables and type of provider were analyzed within a setting whose access to care was controlled.

Results

Rates of diagnostic testing with respect to basic, metabolic/endocrine, alternative diagnoses, underlying ischemia, and left ventricular function varied as a function of gender, age, race, and primary versus specialty care provider. Only 4.7% of patients underwent all diagnostics and treatments recommended in current guidelines. However, those patients (27.5%) who underwent an evaluation for ischemic heart disease and were prescribed vasodilators or beta blockers enjoyed the lowest crude mortality.

Conclusions

There are multiple opportunities apparent to improve the initial diagnostic and therapeutic care of patients with heart failure. There appears to be an early survival benefit with respect to use of vasodilators and beta blockers within the first year of treatment.

### Patterns of β-blocker utilization in patients with chronic heart failure: experience from a specialized outpatient heart failure clinic [^116tfJ2D]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers have been shown incontrovertibly to improve morbidity and survival in patients with heart failure. However, there is limited information regarding their use in clinical practice settings, and reasonable utilization targets for quality improvement initiatives have not been established.

Method

We identified 500 consecutive patients with chronic heart failure seen at a specialized outpatient heart failure clinic from March 2001 to May 2001, and retrospectively extracted clinical and drug information from an electronic medical record.

Results

In this cross-sectional analysis, the rate of beta-blocker utilization was 69%. Seventy-five percent of patients had at least tried a beta-blocker. Among those with beta-blockers initiated, 16% experienced side effects that led to drug discontinuation (9.1%) or down-titration (6.9%) that was similar across all NYHA classes. A lower utilization rate of beta-blockers was observed in patients of advanced age and those with diabetes mellitus, concomitant antiarrhythmic therapy, and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (P < .05). Respiratory disease remained the most common reason for withholding beta-blocker therapy, especially with severe obstructive (rather than restrictive) physiology.

Conclusion

It appears that about 70% of patients with chronic heart failure can be successfully treated with a beta-blocker in a specialized heart failure outpatient setting where physicians are committed to beta-blocker use in heart failure. It is possible that subgroups with lower utilization rates can be targeted for quality improvement initiatives.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115smLpc]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to beta-blockers, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that β-blocker therapy provides high economic value in patients with HFrEF with current or previous symptoms.

### Β blockers for heart failure [^111RmijA]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

In their linked article, Kotecha and colleagues (doi:) present a meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) and conclude that β blockers reduce all cause mortality and admission to hospital related to heart failure in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and in sinus rhythm, irrespective of age and sex. These findings reinforce the recommendations of current clinical guidelines. In daily clinical practice, however, prescription rates of β blockers and the doses taken are lower than might be expected based on the available evidence. β blockers seem to be underused, especially in women and older adults of both sexes. Studies from secondary care clearly show suboptimal prescribing, although reported prescription rates vary considerably. In primary care, uptake of β blockers is even lower.

Kotecha and colleagues included nearly all the available evidence from trials comparing β blockers with placebo, with individual data from 13 833 patients including 3283 women and more than 4000 adults aged 70–80. Use of β blockers significantly reduced mortality hazard ratios ranged from 0.65 in the third quarter of the age distribution (median age 68) to 0.77 for the highest quarter (median age 75). Sex did not modify these effect estimates. Similarly, β blockers reduced the number of admissions related to heart failure in all age and sex subgroups.

### Comparison of the beneficial effect of β-blockers on mortality in patients with ischaemic or non-ischaemic systolic heart failure: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114Bskx1]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Mechanisms by which beta-blockers bring benefit may differ according to the aetiology of heart failure (HF). It is uncertain whether the magnitude of the benefit of beta-blockers is the same in ischaemic or non-ischaemic HF.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of all randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-design trials of beta-blockers in HF that collected data on mortality during follow-up.

Results

Among 26 randomised trials comparing beta-blockers with placebo in HF, 4 studies with 7250 patients provided information on the number of patients who died during follow-up in subgroups of ischaemic and non-ischaemic aetiology of HF. Two studies were performed with bisoprolol, one with carvedilol and one with metoprolol. HF was associated with ischaemic aetiology in 4746/7250 patients (65%) and non-ischaemic aetiology in 2504/7250 patients (35%). Mortality occurred in 301 patients. The risk ratio (RR) for beta-blockers versus placebo was 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.75, p < 0.00001) in ischaemic HF, compared with a RR of 0.62 (95% CI 0.45–0.84, p = 0.002) in the presence of non-ischaemic HF.

Conclusion

The magnitude of the prognostic benefit conferred by beta-blockers for overall mortality in non-ischaemic HF appears to be very similar to that in ischaemic HF.

### Tolerability of β-blocker initiation and titration in the metoprolol CR / XL randomized intervention trial in congestive heart failure (MERIT-HF) [^1143iKBD]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

beta-Blockade improves survival when administered over a long period of time to patients with heart failure. However, the time course of any possible deterioration during the titration phase has not been reported.

Methods and Results

We looked at evidence of clinical deterioration in the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) by analyzing events and symptoms during the first 90 days. During titration, the Kaplan-Meier curves for the combined end point of all-cause mortality/all-cause hospitalization were similar in all patients randomized, with no significant difference in favor of placebo at any visit or in any of the analyzed subgroups (New York Heart Association class II, III/IV, or III/IV with ejection fraction < 0.25, heart rate less-than-or-equal 76 bpm, and systolic blood pressure less-than-or-equal 120 mm Hg). The curves started to diverge in favor of beta-blockade after 60 days. Low heart rate was the main factor that limited titration. In New York Heart Association class III/IV, 5.9% of the patients receiving placebo discontinued study medicine during the first 90 days compared with 8.1% of those receiving metoprolol CR/XL (P = 0.037 unadjusted, P = NS adjusted); corresponding figures in those with New York Heart Association class III/IV and ejection fraction < 0.25 were 7.1% and 8.0% (P = NS). From day 90 until the end of the study, more patients in the placebo group discontinued study medicine in all subgroups. There was no change in diuretic or ACE inhibitor dosing with beta-blocker titration. Most patients reported no change in symptoms of breathlessness or fatigue during the titration phase.

Conclusions

When carefully titrated, metoprolol CR/XL can be given safely to the overwhelming majority of patients with stable mild to moderate heart failure, with minimal side effects or deterioration.

### Benefits of β blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: network meta-analysis [^112yyVJ6]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

We report categorical outcomes as numbers and continuous outcomes as median (interquartile range). We derived the raw event rates from individual studies and constructed 2×2 tables with raw number of events and total population of the trial. In trials that did not report raw event rates, investigators reported the percentage or proportion of patients having the event under consideration, which we rounded off to whole numbers by using the sample size of the population; we then calculated the risk difference by using the formula 1/(1+%OR), where OR = odds ratio. We calculated number needed to treat and corresponding absolute risk reduction from the 2×2 tables. We abstracted data in duplicate, and the inter-rater agreement was good (κ statistic = 0.88). Considering different lengths of follow-up for individual trials, and to account for censored data, we obtained the rates of outcomes for all trials with follow-up longer than 12 months and calculated the log hazard ratios (assuming a constant rate of hazards for individual trials) from the event rates reported and mean duration of follow-up. We did standard pair-wise meta-analysis comparing β blockers with comparators, with 95% confidence intervals. We also used a random effect model (DerSimonian and Laird) to calculate prediction intervals for all cause mortality, using RevMan v5.1 and Stata version 11. We assessed and quantified heterogeneity with the help of the I 2 statistic computed with the Cochran Q test.

### What is the current best drug treatment for hypertensive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction? Review of the totality of evidence [^113m4cx4]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence in favor of beta-blocker treatment in HFpEF

Most patients (55%–87%) enrolled in HFpEF RCTs used open-label beta-blocker therapy despite sparse trial evidenceand mostly as background therapy for concomitant cardiovascular conditions with high heart rate, such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or atrial fibrillation. Therefore, designing prospective RCTs in HFpEF with no beta-blocker use in the placebo arm is virtually impossible.

The SENIORS trial with nebivololincluded HF patients not based on LVEF and demonstrated a beneficial beta-blocker effect independent of LVEF in a prespecified subgroup analysis. The effect on the composite primary outcome of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospital admission showed an overall HR of 0.86, and in the subgroup possessing LVEF ≥ 35%, HR was 0.82. Apart from this single RCT, the published literature in HFmrEF or HFpEF patients is based on observational cohorts, on which meta-analyses have also been made. An example is a meta-analysis on beta-blockers in HFmrEF and HFpEF (LVEF > 40%), which revealed that beta-blocker use was associated with reduced risk of mortality. Beta-blockers also have beneficial effects in HFpEF patients who are in sinus rhythm. A specific reason for the beneficial role of beta-blockers in HFpEF beyond their beneficial effects in patients with the concomitant diseases mentioned above is the increased sympathetic activity in this form of HF, whether patients have obesity or not. Another interesting aspect of assessing beta-blockers in HF is their effect on increasing natriuretic peptide (NP) concentrations, likely because of their heart rate-reducing properties. Thus, although beta-blockers continue to be a major therapy in patients with HFrEF, documented for bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and nebivolol, it is unclear how the increase in NPs contributes to their benefits and whether NPs can be used for monitoring HF progression during beta-blocker treatment.

### Association between the β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, all-cause mortality and length of hospitalization in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115DvYHg]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFpEF) is defined as the presence of heart failure in the absence of any evidence of reduced LV ejection fraction. This type of heart failure is also known as heart failure with intact left ventricular (LV) function. The incidence of HFpEF is on the rise, and research has linked it to an increase in the number of patients who require hospitalization. Numerous studies on patients with chronic heart failure have shown that this syndrome has a high mortality and morbidity rate. However, evidence from clinical studies revealing improvements in mortality has been variable and essentially unbiased; a few investigations suggest that pharmacological therapy may improve the tolerance for exercise and quality of life of these people. Given that patients with heart failure with intact left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are more likely to be older and have a greater number of comorbidities than their counterparts, the efficacy of pharmacological treatment may be best assessed by its impact on hospitalization and associated symptoms. This condition can be treated with neprilysin inhibitors, sacubitril, valsaltran, an interleukin‐1 blocker, Spironolactone, a RAAS blocker, a beta‐blocker (BB), Sildenafil, an aldosterone antagonist, empagliflozin, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Even though there is a paucity of evidence supporting their advantages, BBs are often recommended for HFpEF. BBs, or beta‐adrenergic blocking medications, works by inhibiting the release of stress chemicals adrenaline and noradrenaline in specific regions, which decreases the heart rate and the force with which blood is pushed throughout the body. In their research articles, Yum et al.and Xu et al.found that over 80% of patients with HFpEF received BBs. However, current research suggests a link between the use of CCBs and better outcomes in individuals with HFpEF. CCBs improve HFPEF by reducing peripheral vasoconstriction and, thus, lowering left ventricular afterload. For instance, Vider et al.reported in their study article that the use of CCBs was related to reduced risks of death in patients with HFpEF, whereas Borlaug et al.observed that CCBs were the third‐ or fourth‐line therapy for hypertension in patients with HFpEF. Due to conflicting or insufficient information concerning the effects of medications in patients with HFpEF, it is essential to examine the efficacy of both current treatment choices to avert unembellished outcomes in patients with HFpEF. There is an immediate need for treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet there are currently no medications that have been shown to be successful. Patients with HFpEF routinely get BBs despite a lack of clinical evidence supporting their use. Recent clinical trials have shown that more than 75% of patients with HFpEF are being treated with BBs. Similarly, recent studies suggested that HFpEF patients who used CCBs had better results. In this meta‐analysis, we sought to examine the impact of BBs and CCBs on all‐cause mortality and hospitalization due to cardiovascular causes among patients with heart failure and preserved LVEF.

### Heart rate and rhythm and the benefit of Beta-blockers in patients With Heart failure [^116etAoD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between mortality and heart rate remains unclear for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in either sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objectives

This analysis explored the prognostic importance of heart rate in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in randomized controlled trials comparing beta-blockers and placebo.

Methods

The Beta-Blockers in Heart Failure Collaborative Group performed a meta-analysis of harmonized individual patient data from 11 double-blind randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, analyzed with Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) modeling heart rate measured at baseline and approximately 6 months post-randomization.

Results

A higher heart rate at baseline was associated with greater all-cause mortality for patients in sinus rhythm (n = 14,166; adjusted HR: 1.11 per 10 beats/min; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 to 1.15; p < 0.0001) but not in AF (n = 3,034; HR: 1.03 per 10 beats/min; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.08; p = 0.38). Beta-blockers reduced ventricular rate by 12 beats/min in both sinus rhythm and AF. Mortality was lower for patients in sinus rhythm randomized to beta-blockers (HR: 0.73 vs. placebo; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.79; p < 0.001), regardless of baseline heart rate (interaction p = 0.35). Beta-blockers had no effect on mortality in patients with AF (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.12; p = 0.58) at any heart rate (interaction p = 0.48). A lower achieved resting heart rate, irrespective of treatment, was associated with better prognosis only for patients in sinus rhythm (HR: 1.16 per 10 beats/min increase, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.22; p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Regardless of pre-treatment heart rate, beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in sinus rhythm. Achieving a lower heart rate is associated with better prognosis, but only for those in sinus rhythm.

### Pharmacologic therapy for patients with chronic heart failure and reduced systolic function: review of trials and practical considerations [^113rB1TU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome resulting from any structural or functional cardiac disorder impairing the ability of the ventricles to fill with or eject blood. The approach to pharmacologic treatment has become a combined preventive and symptomatic management strategy. Ideally, treatment should be initiated in patients at risk, preventing disease progression. In patients who have progressed to symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, certain therapies have been demonstrated to improve survival, decrease hospitalizations, and reduce symptoms. The mainstay therapies are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers (bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol XL/CR), with diuretics to control fluid balance. In patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors because of angioedema or severe cough, valsartan can be substituted. Valsartan should not be added in patients already taking an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker. Spironolactone is recommended in patients who have New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III to IV symptoms despite maximal therapies with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics, and digoxin. Low-dose digoxin, yielding a serum concentration < 1 ng/mL can be added to improve symptoms and, possibly, mortality. The combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate might be useful in patients (especially in African Americans) who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors or valsartan because of hypotension or renal dysfunction. Calcium antagonists, with the exception of amlodipine, oral or intravenous inotropes, and vasodilators, should be avoided in HF with reduced systolic function. Amiodarone should be used only if patients have a history of sudden death, or a history of ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia, and should be used in conjunction with an implantable defibrillator. Finally, anticoagulation is recommended only in patients who have concomitant atrial fibrillation or a previous history of cerebral or systemic emboli.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^114hmNpo]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

What drug treatments should be considered essential to the management of patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction?

Accordingly, for purposes of the present review, the treatments that are considered to be essential and broadly applicable to patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction are (i) inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system; (ii) neprilysin inhibitors (i.e. sacubitril/valsartan); (iii) beta‐adrenergic blockers that have been shown to prolong life (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, and bisoprolol); and (iv) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. 1, 2, 11 The evidence base for each of these drug classes is clinically persuasive and statistically robust. The magnitude of the incremental benefit of each drug class is meaningful (at least 20% reduction in the risk of death) for neprilysin inhibitors, beta‐blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. 11 Furthermore, these three classes of drugs have each been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death 18; consequently, the utilization of these drugs cannot be reasonably delayed even if patients are clinically stable. 10, 11 In contrast, angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have only a modest benefit on the risk of death (5–16% risk reduction) 19; the survival benefit cannot be enhanced by intensification of treatment 20, 21; and they do not reduce the risk of sudden death. 22

Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate can prolong survival, but the combination may be inferior to ACE inhibitors with respect to mortality. 23 Use of this drug combination in the modern era is based on an analysis of a relatively small number of events in a select population. 11 Furthermore, sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors are not considered in the current framework, since the evidence base supporting their ability to reduce mortality in patients with established heart failure is still evolving. 24 If the survival benefits are confirmed by additional trials, these drugs can be included in our proposed system.

### Prescription of β-blockers in patients with advanced heart failure and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. clinical implications and survival [^114PEHUG]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The effects of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure (HF) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are not well established.

Aims

To assess the association between beta-blocker prescription at discharge and mortality in a cohort of patients with advanced HF and preserved LVEF.

Methods and Results

We prospectively studied a cohort of 443 patients with advanced HF and preserved LVEF (LVEF ≥ 40%). Mean age was 78 years, 56% female, 33% NYHA class IV. Overall, 227 patients (51%) had a beta-blocker prescribed at discharge. Mean duration of follow-up was 25 (± 18) months. Death (all cause) occurred in 40 patients (17.6%) who were receiving a beta-blocker at discharge and 73 patients (33.8%) who were not on a beta-blocker. In multivariate Cox analysis, including adjustment for propensity score, prescription of a beta-blocker remained associated with a 43% relative mortality risk reduction (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.88, p = 0.01).

Conclusions

In this cohort of patients with advanced HF and preserved LVEF, prescription of a beta-blocker was associated with a significant mortality reduction. This beneficial effect of beta-blocker use needs to be further confirmed in prospective, randomised clinical trials.

### Lower in-hospital mortality with beta-blocker use at admission in patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^116TmR4n]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Beta‐blockers are guideline‐directed medical therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Previous large clinical trials have consistently shown that beta‐blockers reduce mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalization in patients with chronic HFrEF. One of the beneficial effects of beta‐blockers is reverse remodeling and subsequent improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Beta‐blockers also reduce sudden cardiac death (SCD). The discontinuation of beta‐blockers in patients admitted with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) has been reported to be associated with significantly increased in‐hospital and short‐term mortality, possibly due to activation of the sympathetic nervous system by abrupt discontinuation of beta‐blockers.

However, there is a scarcity of data on the effects of beta‐blocker use at admission for ADHF on in‐hospital outcomes. In ADHF settings, there is a concern about using beta‐blockers at hospitalization for their negative inotropic effect to disrupt the compensation of the heart. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of beta‐blocker use at admission for ADHF on in‐hospital outcomes in patients with ADHF.

Heart failure

Four IPD studies and 31 other meta-analyses met inclusion criteria, comprising 66 individual RCTs, 35,383 participants, mean follow-up of 12.3 months (range 3 to 32 months) and a total of 534,461 patient-years of follow-up. The RCTs were predominantly in patients with HFrEF; only 3 trials were designed to include patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 40%. A summary of the highest quality data is presented in Fig. 2 and detailed analysis in Supplemental Figure 4.

All-cause mortality

IPD meta-analysis of 11 double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs demonstrated that beta-blockers significantly reduced mortality in patients with sinus rhythm (13,833 patients; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.70–0.82), regardless of age, gender or achieved heart rate. However, there was no reduction in mortality in the subgroups with atrial fibrillation (3064 patients; RR 0.95, 0.83–1.10; p interaction 0.002 for rhythm on baseline electrocardiogram), or the small subgroup with LVEF ≥ 50%. In non-IPD meta-analyses, beta-blockers were associated with reduced mortality compared to control, but findings were non-significant in subgroups with atrial fibrillation, LVEF > 40% and black patients, and inconsistent in patients with diabetes.

Cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation and stroke

In both IPD and other meta-analyses, patients in (or predominantly in) HFrEF and sinus rhythm had substantial reduction in cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalisation with beta-blockers compared to control. Beta-blockers had no effect on non-fatal stroke compared with placebo (16,644 patients) in patients in HFrEF, irrespective of if they were in sinus rhythm (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.78–1.32) or atrial fibrillation (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.66–1.63).

### 2020 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^116LtvZ9]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). High credibility.

PM-4: Beta-blocker therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — The performance measure defines the percentage of patients age ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12-mo period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge. The numerator is patients who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12-mo period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge, where outpatient includes a prescription at ≥ 1 visits in the 12-mo measurement period or documentation that the patient is already taking a beta blocker, and inpatient includes a prescription at discharge or documentation to continue therapy after discharge; beta-blocker therapy should include bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained-release metoprolol succinate. The denominator is all patients age ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior LVEF ≤ 40%, with denominator exclusions of heart transplant and LVAD and denominator exceptions for documentation of medical reason(s) (e.g., intolerance) or patient reason(s) (e.g., patient refusal) for not prescribing beta-blocker therapy. Rationale states that beta blockers improve survival and reduce hospitalization for patients with stable heart failure and reduced LVEF, and treatment should be initiated as soon as a patient is diagnosed with reduced LVEF and does not have prohibitively low systemic blood pressure, fluid overload, or recent treatment with an intravenous positive inotropic agent. Clinical recommendations cited are that use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality (Class I, Level of Evidence: A), and that initiation of beta-blocker therapy is recommended after optimization of volume status and successful discontinuation of intravenous diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents; therapy should be initiated at a low dose and only in stable patients, with caution when patients have required inotropes during their hospital course (Class I, Level of Evidence: B).

### The evolution of β-blockers in coronary Artery Disease and heart Failure (part 1 / 5) [^1132LJ5V]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

As new treatments continue to improve clinical outcomes in coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure, it is necessary to characterize the appropriate use of β-adrenergic receptor blockers (β-blockers) in the contemporary management of these conditions. This review examines the current evidence supporting β-blocker use in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), heart failure with midrange ejection fraction (HFmEF), and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), following acute coronary syndrome and in stable CAD. β-Blockers remain essential in the treatment of HFrEF, but limited evidence supports their use in HFmEF or HFpEF. They should still be considered routinely following acute coronary syndrome, but there is a need for contemporary trials that re-examine this in patients without left ventricular dysfunction, as well as in patients with stable CAD. From a global perspective, more studies are needed to characterize the extent of β-blocker use in CAD and heart failure, and how evidence-based use can be improved in these conditions.

Meta‐analysis

Search strategy

We carried out a meta‐analysis of the three major drug classes used in chronic systolic heart failure. We identified the most recent meta‐analysis for each drug class 6, 7, 8 that calculated effects on all‐cause mortality in eligible RCTs. We repeated the search from each meta‐analysis in the MEDLINE, Cochrane and EMBASE databases for the 6 months preceding the publication date of the previous meta‐analysis to ensure that no new RCTs had been published. The search strings were: (i) ACE inhibitors: PubMed search: (Heart failure [Title/abstract] OR congestive [Title/Abstract]) AND angiotensin‐converting enzyme (inhibitor OR inhibition OR blocker OR blockade) OR ACE (inhibitor OR inhibition OR blocker OR blockade) OR captopril OR enalapril OR lisinopril OR ramipril OR quinapril; filters: randomized controlled trial; publication date from 1 January 1994 to 1 January 2016; humans; (ii) beta‐blockers: PubMed search: (Heart failure [Title/abstract] OR congestive [Title/Abstract]) AND (adrenergic beta‐antagonist OR beta‐adrenergic OR beta‐blocker OR beta‐blockade OR carvedilol OR metoprolol OR bisoprolol OR bucindolol OR nebivolol); filters: randomized controlled trial; publication date from 1 April 2012 to 1 January 2016; humans; (iii) aldosterone antagonists: PubMed search: (Heart failure [Title/abstract] OR congestive [Title/abstract]) AND aldosterone receptor (antagonist OR blocker OR blockade OR blocking agent) OR canrenoate OR canrenone OR canrenoic acid OR spironolactone OR eplerenone OR RN 52‐01‐ OR RN 107724‐20‐9 OR Aldactone OR Inspra; filters: randomized controlled trial; publication date from 1 January 2008 to 1 January 2016; humans.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Randomized controlled trials studying chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction were included, as long as they utilized a placebo‐controlled arm rather than non‐placebo 'usual care'. Any RCTs specifically investigating heart failure with preserved ejection fraction or acute heart failure in specific scenarios were excluded from our analyses.

Data abstraction

Manuscripts of included RCTs were independently reviewed by two authors to confirm sample size, numbers of deaths in the control and treatment arms, and follow‐up period. If manuscripts were unavailable for an RCT, we included data for that RCT quoted in previous meta‐analyses.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: an umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^114oQhYM]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Beta-blockers are an established part of the routine management for many cardiovascular conditions and are widely used by physicians across the spectrum of healthcare. They act via multiple pathways, limiting the effects of catecholamine excess, affecting inotropy and chronotropy, providing anti-arrhythmic and anti-ischaemic effects and inhibiting renin release. However, this diversity of action carries the possibility of varying net effects on individual outcomes, depending on patient characteristics and disease substrate. Beta-blockers are well tolerated even in patients with advanced conditions such as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), as confirmed in double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Although side effects such as dizziness, lethargy and cold extremities are commonly reported in clinical practice, similar rates are seen with placebo. Beta-blockers can cause bradycardia, atrioventricular block and symptomatic hypotension, especially in patients with sinus and/or atrioventricular node dysfunction, and are contraindicated in severe asthma because of the risk of life-threatening bronchospasm.

The balance of risk versus benefit remains unclear in many cardiovascular conditions. For example, in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), many RCTs predate reperfusion strategies and contemporary medical treatment. There have also been questions about the efficacy of beta-blockers in HFrEF patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation and safety concerns for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery and in hypertension. These uncertainties have contributed to suboptimal uptake in patient groups where beta-blockers are known to reduce mortality and morbidity. Indeed, patients at greatest risk of death seem least likely to receive evidence-based therapy. The aim of our study was to review all available evidence for beta-blocker therapy across these different cardiovascular indications, providing clear assistance for clinicians and to inform future guidelines. For each condition, we used an evidence-based hierarchy that first identified the availability of individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses, and if not, whether there were aggregate data meta-analyses with unbiased data to better understand the balance of efficacy and safety of beta-blockers.

### Prognostic benefit of β-blockers in patients not receiving ACE-inhibitors [^117E4Awi]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Beta-blockers (BBs) confer significant prognostic benefit in patients (pts) with systolic chronic heart failure (CHF). However, major trials have thus far studied BBs mainly in addition to ACE-Inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as background therapy. The magnitude of the prognostic benefit of BBs in the absence of ACE-I or ARB has not as yet been determined.

Methods and Results

We performed a meta-analysis of all placebo-controlled BB studies in patients with CHF (n > 200). Trials were identified via Medline literature searches, meeting abstracts, and contact with study organizations. Results for all-cause mortality and death or heart failure hospitalization were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel (fixed effects) method. The impact of BB therapy on all-cause mortality in CHF, in the absence (4.8%) and presence (95.2%) of ACE-I (or ARB), was determined from six trials of 13 370 patients. The risk ratio (RR) for BBs vs. placebo was 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53–1.02] in the absence of ACE-I or ARB at baseline, compared with a RR of 0.76 (95% CI 0.71–0.83) in the presence of these agents. When ACE-Inhibitors were analysed in the same way (pre-BB), a RR of 0.89 (0.80–0.99) vs. placebo was observed in studies of > 90 days. The impact of BB therapy on death or HF hospitalization in systolic CHF, in the absence and presence of ACE-I, was determined from three trials of 8988 patients. The RR for BBs vs. placebo was 0.81 (95% CI 0.61–1.08) in the absence of ACE-I or ARB at baseline, compared with a RR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.74–0.83) in the presence of these agents. When ACE-Is were analysed in the same way (pre-BB), a RR of 0.85 (95% CI 0.78–0.93) vs. placebo was observed in studies of > 90 days.

Conclusion

The magnitude of the prognostic benefit conferred by BBs in the absence of ACE-I appears to be similar to those of ACE-Is in systolic CHF. These data therefore suggest that either ACE-Is or BBs could be used as first-line neurohormonal therapy in patients with systolic CHF. Prospective studies directly comparing these agents are required to definitively address this issue.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^117XB13Z]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Step 1. Simultaneous initiation of a beta‐blocker and an SGLT2 inhibitor

Based on the evidence from randomized controlled trials, which of the foundational agents should be initiated as the first step? In our view, the most serious and unexpected complication of heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction is sudden cardiac death, and the most effective and rapidly‐acting means of preventing such death is beta‐adrenergic blockade, presumably because beta‐blockers interfere with catecholamine‐related ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Additionally, among the four foundational drug classes, beta‐blockers are most likely to exert favourable effects on left ventricular remodelling during long‐term treatment, yielding important recovery of a depressed ejection fraction. However, for beta‐blockers to be initiated safely (regardless of their position in the sequence), physicians should ensure that patients are clinically euvolaemic before the start of treatment and that concurrently administered diuretics are promptly intensified if fluid retention (as evidenced by weight gain) occurs. Failure to do so may explain why initiation of beta‐blockade can result in early worsening of heart failure, which can be avoided (even in patients with severe symptoms) if clinical euvolaemia is achieved and maintained.

Because of the predilection of beta‐blockers to cause fluid retention, we favour a strategy where beta‐blockers are combined with an SGLT2 inhibitor as the first step in drug sequencing. As a result of their actions on sodium and glucose transport in the proximal renal tubule, SGLT2 inhibitors promote a short‐term osmotic diuresis, which may contribute to the established ability of this drug class to reduce worsening heart failure events, a benefit that is seen rapidly following initiation of treatment. This early effect may help to minimize the risks of fluid retention that can be seen following initiation of treatment with a beta‐blocker. SGLT2 inhibitors also exert a striking nephroprotective effect, as evidenced by a slowing of the decline in glomerular filtration rate during long‐term therapy. This favourable effect on kidney function is especially important since several other foundational drugs (e.g. angiotensin receptor blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) often act to worsen renal function in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. Importantly, treatment with a beta‐blocker and an SGLT2 inhibitor does not require specialized safety monitoring or laboratory testing. As a result, the ability of patients to tolerate a combination of a beta‐blocker and an SGLT2 inhibitor can generally be fully established within 2 weeks of starting outpatient treatment with both classes of drugs.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) patients without angina — In patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) but without HF or angina, 4 types of interventions have been used to reduce the risk of reinfarction and death, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta-blockers, drugs to address dyslipidemia such as statins, antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel, and coronary revascularization. In patients who have had an MI and who have HF but not angina, the use of ACEIs and beta-blockers can also decrease the risk of reinfarction and death, but it is less clear whether such patients benefit from the use of aspirin or revascularization. Aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of major ischemic events in patients without HF; however, the role of aspirin in patients with HF has not been established and may attenuate the hemodynamic and survival benefits of ACEIs, making the role of aspirin in preventing ischemic events in patients with chronic HF controversial. Alternative antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel) may not interact adversely with ACEIs and may have superior effects in preventing clinical events, but their ability to favorably affect outcomes in HF has not been demonstrated. Despite these theoretical possibilities, coronary revascularization has not been shown to improve cardiac function or symptoms of HF or to prevent reinfarction or death in patients with HF and no angina.

### The effects of β-blockers in patients with stable chronic heart failure. predictors of left ventricular ejection fraction improvement and impact on prognosis [^111MRmry]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies, with limited number of patients, have tried to determine the predictors of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improvement after beta-blockade. No study has demonstrated that LVEF improvement was an independent predictor of cardiac survival.

Methods

The aims of the study were to determine in a large group of patients with stable chronic heart failure associated with reduced LVEF the predictors of LVEF improvement (difference in LVEF [deltaLVEF], ie, the value after beta-blockade minus the value before beta-blockade) after beta-blockade and to analyze prognostic impact of deltaLVEF. Three hundred fourteen consecutive patients underwent an echocardiogram, a radionuclide angiogram, and a maximum cardiopulmonary exercise test before and 3 months after maximal tolerated doses of beta-blockers have been reached.

Results

After beta-blockade, LVEF improved from 30% ± 11% to 40% ± 13%. In the whole population, independent predictors of deltaLVEF were nonischemic etiology, baseline LVEF (negative correlation), and baseline heart rate (positive correlation). In ischemic patients, independent predictors of deltaLVEF were absence of history of myocardial infarction, baseline heart rate, and baseline LVEF; whereas in nonischemic patients, independent predictors were baseline LVEF and baseline QRS width (negative correlation). After 1082 days of follow-up, there were 53 cardiovascular deaths and 2 urgent transplantations. Left ventricular ejection fraction improvement (defined as an absolute increase in LVEF > 5%) was an independent predictor of cardiac survival. Patients who had an LVEF ≤ 45% after beta-blockade with a deltaLVEF ≤ 5% represented a high-risk subgroup.

Conclusions

In patients with chronic heart failure, predictors of LVEF improvement after beta-blockade were different according to etiology. Left ventricular ejection fraction improvement was an independent predictor of cardiac survival.

### Β-blocker withdrawal and functional capacity improvement in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^113EjGW6]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Increasing the patient's heart rate (HR) has emerged as a therapeutic option in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the evidence is conflicting, and the profile of patients who benefit most from this strategy remains unclear.

Objective

To assess the association of β-blocker treatment withdrawal with changes in the percentage of predicted peak oxygen consumption (VO2) across indexed left ventricular diastolic (iLVEDV) and indexed left ventricular systolic volumes (iLVESV), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with HFpEF and chronotropic incompetence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This post hoc analysis was conducted using data from the investigator-blinded multicenter, randomized, and crossover clinical trial, PRESERVE-HR, that took place from October 1, 2018, through December 31, 2020, to investigate the short-term effects (2 weeks) of β-blocker withdrawal on peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2). Patients with stable HFpEF (New York Heart Association functional class II to III) receiving treatment with β-blocker and chronotropic incompetence were included.

Intervention

Participants in the PRESERVE-HR trial were randomized to withdraw vs continue with β-blocker treatment. After 2 weeks, they were crossed over to receive the opposite intervention. This crossover randomized clinical trial examined the short-term effect of β-blocker withdrawal on peak VO2.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was to evaluate the association between β-blocker withdrawal and short-term changes in percentage of peak VO2 across iLVEDV, iLVESV, and LVEF in patients with HFpEF and chronotropic incompetence treated with β-blocker.

Results

A total of 52 patients (mean age, 73 [SD, 13] years; 60% female) were randomized. The mean resting HR, peak HR, peak VO2, and percentage of peak VO2 were 65 (SD, 9) beats per minute (bpm), 97 (SD, 15) bpm, 12.4 (SD, 2.9) mL/kg per minute, and 72.4% (SD, 17.7%), respectively. The medians (minimum-maximum) of iLVEDV, iLVESV, and LVEF were 44 mL/m2 (IQR, 19–82), 15 mL/m2 (IQR, 7–32), and 64% (IQR, 52%-78%), respectively. After stopping β-blocker treatment, the median increase in peak HR was plus 30 bpm (95% CI, 25–35; P < .001). β-Blocker cessation was differentially associated with change of percentage of peak VO2 across the continuum of iLVESV (P for interaction = .02), indicating a greater benefit in those with lower iLVESV.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, results showed that in patients with HFpEF and chronotropic incompetence receiving treatment with β-blocker, lower iLVESV may identify those with a greater short-term improvement in maximal functional capacity after stopping β-blocker treatment. Further studies are warranted for further investigation.

### Cardiac adrenergic activation in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a role for β-blockade? [^114J5H57]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

The recent clinical success with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) in treating heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]: ≤ 40%) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (LVEF: ≥ 50%) has given rise to the proposition that LVEF cutoffs should no longer be used as the basis for subclassifying heart failure patients into different pathophysiologic phenotypes and that, going forward, for classification systems to have clinical importance, they should be "more representative of the state of our knowledge about heart failure, and should reflect contemporary approaches to how patients with heart failure are evaluated and treated". With this brief context as background, the results by Kaye et al, in this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science raise provocative questions about the state of our knowledge about heart failure, as well as where and how the field should advance.

### Heart failure due to reduced ejection fraction: medical management [^111idw9G]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure is an increasingly common condition resulting in high rates of morbidity and mortality. For patients who have heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, randomized clinical trials demonstrate consistent mortality benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, direct-acting vasodilators, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists. Additionally, some data show benefits from two new classes of drugs: angiotensin receptor blocker/neprilysin inhibitor and sinus node modulator. Diuretics and digoxin can be used as needed for symptom control. Statins are not recommended solely for treatment of heart failure. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and biventricular pacemakers improve mortality and function in selected patients. For patients who have been hospitalized for heart failure, disease management programs and telemonitoring can reduce hospitalizations and mortality.

### Contemporary use and implications of Beta-blockers in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF: the DELIVER trial [^111qtQG1]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although beta-blockers are not recommended for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) according to the latest European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America guidelines, these therapies remain commonly used for comorbidity management. There has been concern that beta-blockers may adversely influence clinical outcomes by limiting chronotropic response in HFpEF.

Objectives

This study sought to examine the contemporary use and implications of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or HFpEF.

Methods

In the DELIVER (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure) trial, a total of 6,263 patients with symptomatic heart failure (HF) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 40% were randomized to dapagliflozin or placebo across 20 countries. In this prespecified analysis, efficacy and safety outcomes were examined according to beta-blocker use at randomization. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death or worsening HF.

Results

Overall, beta-blockers were used in 5,177 patients (83%), with wide variation by geographic region. Beta-blocker use was associated with a lower risk of the primary outcome in covariate-adjusted models (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.60–0.83). Dapagliflozin consistently reduced the risk of the primary outcome in patients taking beta-blockers (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.72–0.94) and in patients not taking beta-blockers (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.61–1.03; P interaction = 0.85), with similar findings for key secondary endpoints. Adverse events were balanced between patients randomized to dapagliflozin and placebo, regardless of background beta-blocker use.

Conclusions

In patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF who were enrolled in DELIVER, 4 out of 5 participants were treated with a beta-blocker. Beta-blocker use was not associated with a higher risk of worsening HF or cardiovascular death. Dapagliflozin consistently and safely reduced clinical events, irrespective of background beta-blocker use.

### Cardiovascular drug class specificity: β-blockers [^113hwLdW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic blockers are one of the most frequently prescribed cardiovascular drugs. Numerous beta-blockers are available for clinical use. Although these agents differ substantially, it is not clear whether (and which) differences are clinically relevant. Most of the important differences among agents reflect the relative specificity for beta1-, beta2-, and alpha-adrenergic receptors. Selection of a particular agent and target dose is probably best guided by available trial data, even though data are limited. Nonselective agents (with or without alpha-blocking properties) devoid of intrinsic sympathetic activity (ISA) are most appropriate postinfarction. Evidence exists demonstrating a mortality benefit postinfarction for propranolol, timolol, metoprolol, and, in the presence of left ventricular dysfunction, carvedilol. In the setting of heart failure, the selective agents metoprolol and bisoprolol as well as the nonselective agent carvedilol (which possesses alpha-blocking properties) have a demonstrated mortality benefit. Not all tolerated beta-blockers are associated with a survival benefit and it is probably not advisable to extrapolate benefits to all drugs with similar (although probably not identical) properties. Carvedilol may possess advantages over other beta-blockers and a possible survival advantage, suggested by the recent Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET), although these findings are not universally accepted. Ultimately, selection of a specific agent avoids obvious contraindications and uses trial data to guide selection and dose as long as side effects are absent or tolerable.

### Β-blocker use and health status among patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^113dEPJS]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

β-Blockers are a key pillar of guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but their role in HFpEF remains controversial, given a lack of randomized clinical trial data and inconsistent observational data. In this secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial, more than 75% of patients were receiving β-blockers at randomization. β-Blocker use was not significantly associated with health status at baseline or 4 months, nor was it associated with modification of the health status benefits of spironolactone. In addition, the association between β-blocker use and baseline health status did not differ significantly across subgroups defined by baseline heart rate, atrial fibrillation, prior myocardial infarction, or history of stroke. However, there were a few nonsignificant findings that may warrant further investigation. First, patients with higher LVEF (≥ 65%) receiving β-blockers had worse health status than patients with LVEF of 55% to 64% or those with LVEF of 45% to 54%. This finding is consistent with a prior study that showed an increased risk of heart failure hospitalization with β-blockers among patients with higher LVEFbut differed from a second study that showed potential benefit of β-blockers across the range of LVEF. Second, the association of spironolactone with health status was seen predominantly among patients receiving β-blockers, which may indicate that spironolactone can counter some of the negative associations of β-blockers. However, given the sample size of the current study, particularly among patients not receiving β-blockers, these hypothesis-generating findings need to be explored in larger datasets or, ideally, in prospective trials.

Limitations

There are several limitations to our study, most notably the nonrandomized use of β-blockers. Although we adjusted for a broad set of covariates, residual confounding from unmeasured or unknown factors remains possible. The association of β-blockers with health status among patients with HFpEF is likely complicated and related to many factors, such as the presence of persistent arrhythmias, baseline heart rate, and chronotropic response to exercise, which we could not account for in this study. Second, health status can be affected by a number of clinical and sociodemographic factors that were not captured in this study, which could introduce type II error. Third, we could not account for the duration of, intensity of, or adherence to β-blocker use.

### New medications for heart failure [^114hCeMn]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Heart failure is common and results in substantial morbidity and mortality. Current guideline-based therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, including beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists aim to interrupt deleterious neurohormonal pathways and have shown significant success in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure. Continued efforts to further improve outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction have led to the first new-in-class medications approved for heart failure since 2005, ivabradine and sacubitril/valsartan. Ivabradine targets the If channels in the sinoatrial node of the heart, decreasing heart rate. Sacubitril/valsartan combines a neprilysin inhibitor that increases levels of beneficial vasodilatory peptides with an angiotensin receptor antagonist. On a background of previously approved, guideline-directed medical therapies for heart failure, these medications have shown improved clinical outcomes ranging from decreased hospitalizations in a select group of patients to a reduction in all-cause mortality across all pre-specified subgroups. In this review, we will discuss the previously established guideline-directed medical therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, the translational research that led to the development of these new therapies, and the results from the major clinical trials of ivabradine and sacubitril/valsartan.

### Why do patients fail to receive β-blockers for chronic heart failure over time? A "real-world" single-center, 2-year follow-up experience of β-blocker therapy in patients with chronic heart failure [^113x1YBd]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The longitudinal pattern of beta-blocker use in a heart-failure practice setting has not been explored. Previous studies have not specifically addressed the use of beta-blockers over time to determine the rate of use and reasons for discontinuation. The long-term compliance rate for beta-blocker drugs outside the context of a clinical trial has not been established.

Methods

We prospectively followed a cohort of 500 consecutive patients between March and May 2001, with a clinical diagnosis of chronic heart failure seen in a specialized heart failure clinic and determined the longitudinal pattern of beta-blocker use and clinical outcomes over a 2-year period.

Results

The final cohort consists of 340 patients with a complete 2-year follow-up data (mean age 61 ± 14 years, 69% men, 53% with ischemic etiology, mean ejection fraction 27.6 ± 15%). At 6, 12, and 24 months, beta-blocker utilization rates were maintained in 69%, 70%, and 74% of patients, respectively. Of the 120 confirmed initial non-beta-blocker users, 28 (23%) were subsequently started on beta-blocker, despite suspected relative contraindications in 53% of patients. Over a period of 2 years, the discontinuation rate was 10%, with failure to restart a beta-blocker after hospitalization as the most common reason for beta-blocker discontinuation.

Conclusion

Utilization rates of beta-blockers in our heart failure clinic have remained constant at approximately 70% throughout a 2-year follow-up. Of those who discontinued beta-blockers (10%), the most common documented cause was failure to restart beta-blockers after hospitalization.

### Race and beta-blocker survival benefit in patients with heart failure: an investigation of self-reported race and proportion of African genetic ancestry [^1116p4JV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The landmark clinical trials that established the efficacy of beta‐blockers in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) predominately consisted of white patients (80–99%), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 despite evidence that black patients have higher risk for developing and dying from HF. 7 Subgroup analyses of these pivotal trials show effect estimates that are consistent with treatment benefit across races (though very limited in terms of power), 8, 9 and consensus guidelines reasonably recommend beta‐blocker use in all patients with HFrEF unless contraindicated. 10 The extrapolation of clinical trial data from 1 patient race to another is an important issue because at least 29 medications (including beta‐blockers) are reported to have racial disparities in safety or efficacy, 11 and this is clearly salient in the setting of HF. 12 BEST (Beta Blocker Evaluation of Survival trial), which tested bucindolol in chronic HFrEF patients, showed differing effects depending on race with a trend toward harm among black patients. 13, 14 Moreover, some observational data sets have suggested reduced efficacy of approved beta‐blockers in black HFrEF patients. 15, 16

### Role of high-dose beta-blockers in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and elevated heart rate [^115TTY93]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers in high target doses are recommended for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) but not for preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Treatment benefits are often more pronounced in high-risk subgroups, and patients with HFpEF with heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute have emerged as such a high-risk subgroup. We examined the associations of high-dose beta-blocker use with outcomes in these patients.

Methods

Of the 8462 hospitalized patients with heart failure with ejection fraction ≥ 50% in the Medicare-linked Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) registry, 5422 had a discharge heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute. Of these, 4537 had no contraindications to beta-blocker use, of which 2797 (2592 with dose data) received prescriptions for beta-blockers. Of the 2592, 730 received high-dose beta-blockers, defined as atenolol ≥ 100 mg/day, carvedilol ≥ 50 mg/day, metoprolol tartrate or succinate ≥ 200 mg/day, or bisoprolol ≥ 10 mg/day, and 1740 received no beta-blockers. Using propensity scores for the receipt of high-dose beta-blockers, we assembled a matched cohort of 1280 patients, balanced on 58 characteristics.

Results

All-cause mortality occurred in 63% and 68% of matched patients receiving high-dose beta-blocker vs no beta-blocker, respectively, during 6 years (median, 2.8) of follow-up (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–0.98; p = 0.027). The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for all-cause readmission and the combined endpoint of all-cause readmission or all-cause mortality associated with high-dose beta-blocker use were 0.90 (0.81–1.02) and 0.89 (0.80–1.00), respectively.

Conclusions

In patients with HFpEF and heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute, high-dose beta-blocker use was associated with a significantly lower risk of death. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to examine this association.

### Association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^114q1j4h]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

β-Blockers are prescribed to most patients with heart failure (HF) with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), but their effect on HFpEF remains unclear.

Objective

To determine the association of β-blocker use with HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, overall and in strata of patients with an ejection fraction (EF) of 50% or greater or less than 50%.

Design, Setting, and Participants

For 1761 participants from North and South America enrolled in the multicenter, double-blinded Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist randomized clinical trial of spironolactone for patients with HFpEF between August 10, 2006, and January 31, 2012, the association of baseline β-blocker use with HF hospitalization and CVD mortality was analyzed using unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models, overall and in strata of patients with an EF of 50% or greater or less than 50%. Participants had symptomatic HF with a left ventricular EF of 45% or greater, with enrollment based on either hospitalization attributed to decompensated HF in the prior year or elevated natriuretic peptide levels. Statistical analysis was performed from January 31 to May 2, 2019.

Exposure

Use of β-blockers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident HF hospitalization and CVD mortality.

Results

Among 1761 participants included in the analysis (879 women and 882 men; mean [SD] age, 71.5 [9.6] years), 1394 (79.2%) reported β-blocker use and 1567 (89.0%) had an EF of 50% or greater. Hospitalizations for HF occurred for 399 participants (22.7%), and CVD mortality occurred for 229 participants (13.0%). Use of β-blockers was associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization among patients with HFpEF with an EF of 50% or greater (hazard ratio, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.28–2.37]; P < .001) but not among patients with an EF between 45% and 49% (hazard ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.28–1.63]; p = 0.39). There was a significant interaction between β-blocker use and EF threshold for incident HF hospitalizations (P = 0.03). Use of β-blockers was not associated with a change in CVD mortality.

Conclusions and Relevance

For patients with an EF of 50% or greater, β-blocker use was associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalizations but not CVD mortality. For patients with an EF between 45% and 49%, there was no such association.

### Association between the β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, all-cause mortality and length of hospitalization in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114rZn3s]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The present meta‐analysis was undertaken following the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

2.1 Data sources and searches

An inclusive literature search was conducted without any limitations on the year and language of publication utilizing the electronic databases Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed up to September 30, 2022 using the following search criteria: (I) "heart failure with preserved ejection fraction " OR "HFpEF"; (II) "beta‐blockers" OR BB; (III) "calcium channel blockers" OR "CCB"; (IV) "all‐cause mortality"; (V) Length of hospitalization; (VI) and "cardiovascular outcomes". Within the context of the search strategy, the Boolean operator "AND" was used to combine the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) with the text keywords. First, duplicate articles were deleted from the search results, followed by a title and abstract screening of the remaining articles. Finally, the full texts of all the qualified studies were retrieved and reviewed for inclusion and exclusion based on the inclusion–exclusion criteria.

2.2 Study selection

The literature search was conducted separately by two authors. Through discussion, a consensus was obtained in the event of dispute. The following conditions must be met for a study to qualify: (a) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy of BBs and CCBs; (b) studies that evaluate at least one of the following two outcomes: all‐cause mortality, or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes. Exclusion criteria included clinical trials with a follow‐up time of smaller than one month. Studies that were led on healthy volunteers or on those who suffered from disorders other than HFpEF were also not considered. In the end, studies that compared medications other than BBs and CCBs were not included in this meta‐analysis.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^113hK6bi]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Current challenges in describing the adequacy of treatment regimens

Authors often claim that patients enrolled in clinical studies were receiving optimal medical therapy as background treatment. In clinical practice, practitioners commonly state that their treatment plan is 'guideline‐directed medical therapy'. What do these statements mean? Actually, there exists no standardized framework to describe the degree to which a patient's medical regimen adheres to, or deviates from, the strategies that were used in clinical trials to demonstrate the benefits of specific drugs and devices.

There should be no doubt that most patients are not receiving target (or the highest tolerated) doses of all essential drugs, even when patients are treated by clinical investigators with considerable expertise in heart failure. Critical (class I) elements are often missing, and most eligible patients are never prescribed target doses of essential drugs at any point in time during follow‐up. 3, 4, 5 In one prospective study, only 23% of patients were receiving ≥ 50% of target doses of beta‐blockers, renin–angiotensin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. 4 In a second survey, target doses of angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, beta‐blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were prescribed in < 1%. 5

Even if an expert panel were formed to critically examine the treatment of individual patients, such oversight does not necessarily improve physician adherence to crucial recommendations. For example, the COAPT trial established a compulsory review of drug treatments for patients with heart failure prior to enrolment. Yet, only 60% to 70% of patients were receiving a conventional inhibitor of the renin–angiotensin system; < 5% were receiving a neprilysin inhibitor; and it is not known if patients were treated with the target doses of class I agents that have been shown to reduce mortality. 6 Furthermore, the medical review process in COAPT was applied only at the start of the trial; following randomization, uptitration of medications was discouraged, an approach that is inconsistent with best clinical practice. Interestingly, in the MITRA‐FR trial (which studied the same intervention as in COAPT), patients received more intensive medical therapy for heart failure than in the COAPT trial, even though there was no external oversight process. 7

### Association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^112nuzcm]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

These results demonstrate that β-blocker use in the TOPCAT trial cohort was associated with a higher risk for incident HF hospitalization among patients with an EF of 50% or greater, without an associated change in CVD mortality. Future studies are needed to prospectively assess the effects of β-blockers in HF populations with a normal EF.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^114XDPEm]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Do the benefits of foundational drugs depend on background therapy?

Assuming that there are four foundational pharmacological treatments for patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, it is important to ask if the efficacy of each treatment is influenced (favourably or unfavourably) by co‐administration of the other therapies. Are angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors effective only in patients receiving beta‐blockers? Are the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors evident only if patients are receiving mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists? It is understood that each drug class was tested in patients already receiving certain background therapy; however, the fact that background therapy was present does not imply that the background therapy was needed for the study medication to have demonstrated efficacy in a large‐scale trial.

It is therefore noteworthy that the totality of evidence from randomized controlled trials strongly indicates that background therapy does not influence the response to each of the foundational drug classes (Table 1). In general, for patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, beta‐blockers were tested in patients already receiving conventional inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system. However, in the post‐infarction setting, the converse was true, i.e. angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors were typically tested in patients already receiving beta‐blockers. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure following a myocardial infarction, beta‐blockers were shown to reduce mortality in trials with and without background therapy with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor. Furthermore, the first trial with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (RALES) tested spironolactone in patients who were largely not receiving a beta‐blocker, but the second trial of the drug class (EMPHASIS‐HF) tested eplerenone in a setting where most patients were receiving a beta‐blocker as background therapy; the benefits reported in the two trials were similar. Enalapril was effective in reducing mortality in a trial in which > 50% of the patients received spironolactone and in a trial where potassium‐sparing diuretics were prescribed to < 10%. In the large‐scale trials with sacubitril/valsartan and with SGLT2 inhibitors, the favourable effects of both drug treatments were similar whether patients were or were not receiving a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitors were effective in reducing hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes (with a magnitude similar to that seen in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction), but most of the patients in these trials were not receiving spironolactone or eplerenone. Finally, in the two trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, background therapy with a neprilysin inhibitor did not minimize the benefits of treatment with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. Background therapy has influenced the effects of the study medication only when the treatments unequivocally interfered with the same pathophysiological pathway (i.e. angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and renin inhibitors).

### Β-blockers and 1-year postdischarge mortality for heart failure and reduced ejection fraction and slow discharge heart rate [^1169EDmL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study we examined the effect of β‐blockers according to the discharge heart rate in a large cohort of patients with HFrEF. We demonstrated that patients with slow heart rate had favorable outcomes regardless of β‐blocker use and that the use of β‐blocker at discharge was associated with improved 1‐year mortality only among patients with high heart rate.

Β‐Blockers, Heart Rate, and Outcomes

Overall, more patients with slow heart rate received β‐blockers, which reflects the negative chronotropic effect of β‐blockers. Nevertheless, among patients without a β‐blocker prescription at discharge, 25% had slow heart rate; these patients may have low intrinsic heart rate, relatively low sympathetic tone, or increased sympathetic tone with sinoatrial node dysfunction. 10 It is reported that heart failure patients typically have vagal attenuation and elevated sympathetic tone, 11 as well as significantly impaired sinus node function with structural alterations. 12

By blocking the adrenergic receptors in cardiomyocytes, β‐blockers exert negative chrono‐ and inotropic, antiarrhythmic, and antiproliferative effects, among others. Clinical trials of β‐blockers in patients with HFrEF showed a correlation between heart rate reduction and improved outcomes. 5, 13, 14 Nonetheless, those studies could not separate the negative chronotropic effect from the other potentially beneficial effects of the β‐blockers. Notably, ivabradine, which blocks the I f channel in the sinus node and reduces heart rate without the properties of a β‐blocker, has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, indicating that heart rate reduction per se improves outcomes. 8 Heart rate reduction lowers energy expenditure, 15 increases coronary perfusion, 16 and unloads ventricular loading via alteration of vascular elastance. 17 Thus, heart rate is not only a marker but also a mediator in patients with heart failure.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure — practical use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) emphasizes that treatment with an ACEI should be initiated at low doses, and renal function and serum potassium should be assessed within 1 to 2 weeks of initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter; because fluid retention can blunt benefits and fluid depletion can potentiate adverse effects, healthcare providers should ensure that patients are being given appropriate doses of diuretics before and during treatment. Clinicians should attempt to use doses that have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials; if these target doses of an ACEI cannot be used or are poorly tolerated, intermediate doses should be used, and clinicians should not delay the institution of beta-blockers in patients because of a failure to reach target ACEI doses. Once titrated, patients can generally be maintained on long-term therapy with an ACEI with little difficulty; although symptoms may improve within the first 48 hours, the clinical responses are generally delayed and may require several weeks, months, or more to become apparent, and even if symptoms do not improve, long-term treatment with an ACEI should be maintained to reduce the risk of death or hospitalization. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment with an ACEI should be avoided in the absence of life-threatening complications; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided; the use of an ACEI can also minimize or eliminate the need for long-term potassium supplementation; and in hemodynamically or clinically unstable patients it may be prudent to interrupt treatment with the ACEI temporarily until the clinical status of the patient stabilizes.

14.3 Heart Failure

MERIT-HF was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of TOPROL-XL in which 3991 patients with ejection fraction ≤ 0.40 and NYHA Class II-IV heart failure attributable to ischemia, hypertension, or cardiomyopathy were randomized 1:1 to TOPROL-XL or placebo. The protocol excluded patients with contraindications to beta-blocker use, those expected to undergo heart surgery, and those within 28 days of myocardial infarction or unstable angina. The primary endpoints of the trial were (1) all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization (time to first event) and (2) all-cause mortality. Patients were stabilized on optimal concomitant therapy for heart failure, including diuretics, ACE inhibitors, cardiac glycosides, and nitrates. At randomization, 41% of patients were NYHA Class II; 55% NYHA Class III; 65% of patients had heart failure attributed to ischemic heart disease; 44% had a history of hypertension; 25% had diabetes mellitus; 48% had a history of myocardial infarction. Among patients in the trial, 90% were on diuretics, 89% were on ACE inhibitors, 64% were on digitalis, 27% were on a lipid-lowering agent, 37% were on an oral anticoagulant, and the mean ejection fraction was 0.28. The mean duration of follow-up was one year. At the end of the study, the mean daily dose of TOPROL-XL was 159 mg.

The trial was terminated early for a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (34%, nominal p = 0.00009). The risk of all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization was reduced by 19% (p = 0.00012). The trial also showed improvements in heart failure-related mortality and heart failure-related hospitalizations, and NYHA functional class.

The table below shows the principal results for the overall study population. The figure below illustrates principal results for a wide variety of subgroup comparisons, including US vs. non-US populations (the latter of which was not pre-specified). The combined endpoints of all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization and of mortality plus heart failure hospitalization showed consistent effects in the overall study population and the subgroups. Nonetheless, subgroup analyses can be difficult to interpret and it is not known whether these represent true differences or chance effects.

### American college of cardiology / American Heart Association chronic heart failure evaluation and management guidelines: relevance to the geriatric practice [^115yovp1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is the only cardiovascular disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines.

Purpose

The purpose of revising the 1995 ACC/AHA guidelines was to incorporate recent advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to HF treatment and to assist physicians in clinical decision-making in the management of HF.

Methods

The ACC/AHA invited representatives from the American College of Chest Physicians, the Heart Failure Society of America, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine to participate in the preparation of the guidelines. The writing committee searched pertinent medical literature in English using computerized databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and manually searching the bibliographies of the selected articles. The writing committee classified HF into four stages, including patients who are at high risk for developing HF. According to this new classification, Stage A and B represent asymptomatic patients, the former at high risk for developing HF but no structural disorder, the latter with structural disorders of the heart. Stage C encompasses patients with underlying structural heart disorders who are symptomatic, either currently or in the past. Stage D includes end-stage HF patients. This new classification is intended to complement the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of HF into Class I (asymptomatic), Class II (symptomatic on less than ordinary exertion), Class III (symptomatic on ordinary exertion), and Class IV (symptomatic at rest).

Results

The recommendations are categorized into those for evaluation and management.

### What is the current best drug treatment for hypertensive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction? Review of the totality of evidence [^113hBT7D]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT DRUG TREATMENT OF HF IN PATIENTS WITH A PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION

The objectives of HF treatment are to increase survival, reduce hospitalizations for worsening HF, and improve quality of life. To achieve these objectives, current Americanand EuropeanHF guidelines have developed specific treatment recommendations for patients with HFrEF. In contrast, most patients with a mildly reduced and a midrange LVEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF, respectively, have been left with symptomatic supportive care due to an alleged lack of evidence. Due to data that have emerged from recent RCTs, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved new HF drugs, and American guidelines have been revised accordingly. Also, the European Medical Agency (EMA) and European HF Guidelines may follow, at least partly with the SGLT2Is but not with the traditional drug classes mentioned above.

The treatment recommendations for HFrEF include renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (ACEI or ARB, alternatively ARNI), selected beta-blockers, MRAs, and SGLT2Is. The results of major outcome trials and the scientific basis for using these drug classes, "cornerstones", in HFpEF, are summarized in Figure 3 and are further discussed based on information included in Tables 2 and 5.

Figure 3.
The cornerstones of drug treatment of heart failure. Abbreviations are defined in the footnotes in Table 1 and Figure 1.

Bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and nebivolol are included because these beta-blockers have been proven to reduce mortality in HFrEF. Hypertensive patients with severe HF may have low blood pressure because of very high total peripheral resistance and may need careful in-hospital up-titration of medications from all 4 corners, as indicated in the lower part of Figure 3.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114o8xWv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Pre–heart failure (stage B) management to prevent clinical heart failure focuses on disease-modifying therapies and device prevention at specific left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events. In patients with a recent myocardial infarction and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality. In patients who are at least 40 days post–myocardial infarction with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving GDMT and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death to reduce total mortality. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF. In patients with LVEF < 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations. In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful.

### Carvedilol or sustained-release metoprolol for congestive heart failure: a comparative effectiveness analysis [^114ptZpj]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Relative effectiveness of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate has never been compared in patients with heart failure (HF).

Methods and Results

From January 1998 to December 2008, 3,716 consecutive patients with ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 40%, initiated and maintained on carvedilol or metoprolol succinate, were enrolled and followed until June 2010. The primary end point was all-cause mortality, and the secondary end points were readmissions from HF and follow up EFs at 1, 3, and 5 years. HF etiology (ischemic or nonischemic) was a significant effect modifier, and separate analysis was performed for these subcohorts. Compared with those on carvedilol, patients on metoprolol succinate were less likely to experience mortality in the ischemic HF cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43–0.66) but were more likely to die in the nonischemic HF cohort (aHR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10–1.28). Follow-up EF was similar by type of beta-blocker used in both ischemic and nonischemic HF cohorts. Furthermore, no significant difference was noted in the incidence of HF hospitalizations by beta-blocker type used in both ischemic and nonischemic HF cohorts.

Conclusions

Metoprolol succinate was associated with an improved survival in patients with ischemic HF, and carvedilol was associated with an improved survival in patients with nonischemic HF.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular events — acute MI and history of MI with normal LVEF: In patients with an acute MI, the infusion of a fibrinolytic agent or the use of percutaneous coronary intervention can decrease the risk of developing HF, and patients also benefit from both a beta-blocker and either an ACEI or ARB, which can decrease the risk of reinfarction or death when initiated within days after the ischemic event; combined neurohormonal blockade produces additive benefits. In patients with a history of MI but normal LVEF, both hypertension and hyperlipidemia should be treated vigorously, patients with a recent MI should also receive ACEIs and beta-blockers to reduce death risk, and evidence from 2 large-scale studies indicates that prolonged ACEI therapy can reduce major cardiovascular events even when started months or years after MI.

Treatment of stage A heart failure should focus on reducing modifiable risk factors, including management of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. To prevent symptomatic heart failure, ACE inhibitors and beta blockers should be used in all patients with stage B or C heart failure who have a reduced ejection fraction. Patients with stage C heart failure and fluid retention should be treated with diuretics in addition to ACE inhibitors and beta blockers.

### Update on ivabradine for heart failure [^114pgpjH]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite dramatic advances in therapy for heart failure (HF) during the past 3 decades, hospitalization and mortality rates remain relatively high. In recent decades, it has become apparent that HF is divisible into two equally lethal but pathophysiologically different sub-classes, the first comprising patients with LV systolic dysfunction [heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)] and the other, approximately equal in size, involving patients with "preserved" systolic function [heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)]. Evidence-based event reducing therapy currently is available only for HFrEF. With the completion of seminal trials of beta blockers, now part of standard therapy for HFrEF, it was apparent that heart rate slowing is an underlying basis of clinical effectiveness of HFrEF therapy. With the discovery of the "f current" that modulates the slope of spontaneous diastolic depolarization of the sino-atrial node, a non-beta blockade approach to heart rate slowing became available. Ivabradine, the first FDA-approved f-current blocker for HFrEF, markedly reduces hospitalizations for worsening heart failure, while also progressively reducing mortality as pre-therapy heart rate increases, and also promotes beneficial left ventricular remodeling, improves health-related quality of life and is effective despite a wide range of comorbidities. The drug is well tolerated and adverse effects are relatively few. Ivabradine represents an important addition to the armamentarium for mitigation of HFrEF.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — key medication recommendations: In patients with HFrEF with current or previous symptoms, use of one of the three mortality-proven beta blockers (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations; in patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV symptoms, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if estimated glomerular filtration rate is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and thereafter; and in patients with symptomatic chronic HFrEF, SGLT2i are recommended to reduce hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular mortality irrespective of the presence of type 2 diabetes.

A further underappreciated consideration is the influence of concomitant therapy on the dosing of an added treatment. This can be best seen in two trials (CIBIS III and CARMEN) comparing initiation of treatment with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril) or a beta‐blocker (bisoprolol or carvedilol) first and adding the alternative second. When enalapril was used first, the dose achieved was larger than when it was used second, i.e. added to a beta‐blocker rather than used before a beta‐blocker (Table 1). Of course, in the trial on which our target dose of enalapril is based on (the treatment arm of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction, SOLVD‐T) the use of a beta‐blocker was minimal.

This 'target dose' approach used in the original placebo‐controlled landmark trials using renin–angiotensin system blockers also influenced the design of subsequent trials comparing and adding alternative agents such as the neprilysin inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination sacubitril/valsartan and the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren. In these trials, all participants were required to demonstrate toleration of the target dose of enalapril (control therapy) before randomization to either the experimental therapy or control therapy. This was because the achievement of at least the mean dose of enalapril shown to be effective in SOLVD‐T was considered a prerequisite for demonstration of non‐inferiority or superiority of the experimental therapy over the established control treatment (enalapril). This design requirement renders understanding the dosing of sacubitril/valsartan particularly difficult as all patients were taking the target dose at the time of randomization (to either continue sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg twice daily or to enalapril 10 mg twice daily) – see below.

Introduction

Worldwide, an estimated 37 million people have a diagnosis of heart failure. The lifetime risk for developing heart failure is approximately 20%. The prevalence of heart failure is increasing, presumably caused by an increase in both life expectancy and risk factors leading to heart failure as well as improved treatment of acute cardiovascular events.

Guidelines recommend treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with a beta-blocker and an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)). It is recommended to add a mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist in patients who remain symptomatic after this initial treatment.

New drugs for heart failure have been developed and approved that combine inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system pathway (with an ARB) with inhibition of the neprilysin enzyme. These new types of drugs are classified as angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs).

The European Society of Cardiology recommends ARNIs as a replacement for ACE-I in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (EF < 35%) who remain symptomatic (New York Heart Association (NYHA) II to IV) despite optimal medical therapy with an ACE-I, a beta-blocker and a mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist (unless there are contraindications). The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Heart Failure Society of America, make similar recommendations.

To our knowledge, the effects of ARNIs have not been assessed previously in a systematic review.

All-cause mortality is an objective end point and is usually reported as a primary or secondary outcome, although the NMA also included 28 trials that reported mortality as an adverse event or a reason for study withdrawal (Figure 4 A). Because the quality of these 28 studies did not differ greatly from that of the other included trials, the broadest evidence base was included.

3.1 Literature search results

Figure S1 depicts the PRISMA chart for the selection of research. Through a comprehensive search of online databases, 567 studies were identified in total. After eliminating duplicates, the abstracts and titles of 376 studies were screened. Only 48 studies qualified for full‐text evaluation. Ten publications were finally included in the present meta‐analysis based on the PICOS criteria shown in Table S1.

The main characteristics of all included trials, including 12 940 patients with HFpEF are displayed in Table 1. Five publications evaluated the effectiveness of BBs, while five articles evaluated the effectiveness of CCBs. In all included investigations, the median follow‐up time ranged from 1 month to 42 months.

Discussion

HFpEF and HFrEF have a significant impact on the physical functioning and well‐being of patients 6, 7, 24 in addition to a substantial risk of mortality and hospitalisation. 25, 26 Exercise capacity appears to correlate with quality of life outcomes in patients with HF, but to a greater extent in patients with HFpEF; in patients with HFrEF, raised left atrial pressure may play a greater role in determining exercise capacity. Recommendations for the treatment of HFrEF include use of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor, beta‐blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, all of which have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with HFrEF. 5 However, HFrEF remains associated with symptom burden, reduced exercise capacity and impaired physical functioning. 6, 24 Patients with HFpEF tend to be older, more often female, and more likely to have a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation than patients with HFrEF. 5 According to the current guidelines, no treatment has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with HFpEF. 5 A recent meta‐analysis by Zheng et al. 2 reported that beta‐blockers may reduce cardiovascular mortality, though meta‐analyses of drug interventions have shown no improvement in exercise capacity or functional outcomes in these patients, with only limited improvement in patient quality of life. 2, 27 The management of HFpEF involves control of congestive symptoms, usually with diuretics, and the treatment of co‐morbidities. 5 In the absence of effective treatments to reduce mortality, alleviating symptoms and improving patient well‐being may be important goals in the management of patients with HFpEF, 5 and there is an unmet medical need for treatments that can improve quality of life in these patients.

A total of 1394 participants (79.2%) were receiving β-blockers at baseline and 1567 (89.0%) had an EF of 50% or greater (Table 1). Irrespective of β-blocker use, most patients had preexisting hypertension. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation was 42.6% (594 of 1393) among those receiving a β-blocker and 40.7% (149 of 366) among those not receiving a β-blocker, and the prevalence of prior myocardial infarction was 22.1% (308 of 1395) among those receiving a β-blocker and 13.7% (46 of 336) among those not receiving a β-blocker. The proportion of patients with an advanced functional impairment (New York Heart Association class ≥ 3) was almost identical between groups.

### Dose of metoprolol CR / XL and clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure: analysis of the experience in metoprolol CR / XL randomized intervention trial in chronic heart failure (MERIT-HF) [^116za918]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

We performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis in the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Chronic Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) with the aim of reporting on the heart rate (HR) response during the titration phase and clinical outcomes from the three-month follow-up visit to end of study in two dosage subgroups: one that had reached more than 100 mg of metoprolol CR/XL once daily (high-dose group; n = 1,202; mean 192 mg) and one that had reached 100 mg or less (low-dose group; n = 412; mean 76 mg).

Background

Clinicians have questioned whether patients need to reach the target beta-blocker dose to receive benefit. METHODS; Outcome (Cox-adjusted) was compared with all placebo patients with dose available at the three-month visit (n = 1,845).

Results

Data indicated somewhat higher risk in the low-dose group compared with the high-dose group. Heart rate was reduced to a similar degree in the two dose groups, indicating higher sensitivity for beta-blockade in the low-dose group. The reduction in total mortality with metoprolol CR/XL compared with placebo was similar: 38% (95% confidence interval, 16 to 55) in high-dose group (p = 0.0022) and also 38% (95% CI, 11 to 57) in the low-dose group (p = 0.010).

Conclusions

Risk reduction was similar in the high- and low-dose subgroups, which, at least partly, may be the result of similar beta-blockade as judged from the HR response. The results support the idea of an individualized dose-titration regimen, which is guided by patient tolerability and the HR response. Further research is needed to shed light on why some patients respond with a marked HR reduction and reduced mortality risk on a relatively small dose of a beta-blocker.

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) initiation strategy and phenotype considerations indicate that a combination of 4 classes can be started at the same time at low doses with more than one titration at a time, while sequencing may be necessary in other cases; the Writing Committee affirms directly initiating ARNI whenever possible to avoid delays; initiation and titration may require considering patient phenotype, with ARNI often better tolerated when the patient is still congested ("wet") and beta-blockers better tolerated when the patient is less congested ("dry") with an adequate resting heart rate; beta-blockers should not be newly initiated in decompensated signs or symptoms but can be continued in decompensated HF, and only evidence-based beta-blockers should be used in HFrEF.

### Association is not causation: treatment effects cannot be estimated from observational data in heart failure [^113QiHE4]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

There is a particularly strong evidence base for the treatment of HF, making it an appropriate condition in which to compare treatment effects established in RCTs with those estimated in non-randomized and observational studies.

Looking first at patients with HFrEF, six observational studies (reporting seven 'effect' estimates) fulfilled our inclusion criteria, and examined the association between treatment with an ACEI/ARB and mortality. Of these, five showed a lower mortality in patients receiving treatment of this type, whereas two did not, i.e. there was relatively good concordance between these non-randomized studies and the pivotal RCTs. However, the same concordance was not found in studies in HFpEF (see below).

The non-randomized analyses of beta-blockers in HFrEF also showed good agreement with the RCTs, with 16 of 18 analyses concordant. However, this was not the case in observational studies of patients with a mixed HF phenotype, where the Study of the Effects of Nebivolol Intervention on Outcomes and Rehospitalisation in Seniors with Heart Failure (SENIORS) trial had shown a neutral effect on mortality. Of the 19 non-randomized analyses, 17 showed a lower mortality among patients of this type treated with a beta-blocker.

benefit to patients with heart failure, administered practolol to a 59-year-old woman with heart failure, with dramatic improvement in the patient's clinical status. 22 In another study, 23 Waagstein and colleagues demonstrated that β-blockers were well tolerated by patients with heart failure. Subsequent studies from his group demonstrated. drops in cardiac output lead to decreased organ perfusion, a compensatory increase in adrenergic drive, and the subsequent release of neurohormones such as norepinephrine. 35, 42 In turn, norepinephrine stimulates ventricular contraction and increases vascular resistance, thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. This increase. As the neurohormonal hypothesis emerged, so too did a new understanding of the potential role of β-blockers in heart failure. Although acute treatment with β-blockers decreases blood pressure and cardiac index, long-term administration of β-blockers is associated with significant increases in ejection fraction64–77.

and cardiac index and a decrease in left ventricular end diastolic pressure. 61, 77–87 β-Blockers reverse the deleterious changes associated with LV remodeling and decrease myocardial mass and LV volume, leading to improved hemodynamics. Finally, β-blockers may also mediate benefit via regulating heart rate and decreasing cardiac. arrhythmias. 67 These direct cardiac effects led to the hypothesis that β-blockers would provide substantial clinical benefits in patients with heart failure. β-Blockers have been evaluated in more than 10 000 patients with mild, moderate, or severe heart failure and ejection fractions less than 40% in randomized clinical trials. Five meta-analyses88–92. have arrived at the same conclusions: the use of β-blockers was associated with a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations in patients with heart failure. In the most recent of these meta-analyses, 92 it was estimated that 26 patients would need to be.

In practical terms, however, the observed 23% reduction in mortality represents a clinically important outcome. With the emergence of strong new evidence demonstrating that β-blockers decrease morbidity and mortality in a broad range of patients with heart failure, guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, 12 the European Society of Cardiology, 11 and the Heart Failure Society of America10 all strongly support the use of β-blockers in.

### Β-blockers in heart failure… [^113AvaYc]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

β-Blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and stable fluid status. The successful adoption of β-blocker guidelines for these patients requires an understanding of the value of this therapy and effective systems to maintain safety and ensure high quality of care. This article distills scientific evidence and. consensus guidelines into a series of cases and practical answers about patient selection, discussions with patients, management and monitoring, and systems improvements to optimize quality of care, safety, and benefit for all patients with heart failure. Once thought harmful for patients with heart failure, 1, 2 β-blockers have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients.

Previous guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association 14 and current guidelines from the Heart Failure Society of America11 have recommended β-blockers for certain patients with mild to moderate heart failure according to New York Heart Association functional classification. 4, 6, 7 Prompted by new evidence, 5, 10 the most recent ACC–AHA guidelines13 have introduced a broader disease-progression staging. Guidelines also recommend β-blockers for certain patients at risk for developing heart failure caused by hypertension or coronary artery disease. Patients with severe symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations should be evaluated by a physician experienced in treating heart failure. and recent guidelines11, 13 suggest that β-blockers should be initiated because they reduce progression to heart failure, as in trials of coronary artery disease or hypertension.

17, 19 The 2 previous patients are prototypical "ideal" examples of heart failure patients for whom β-blockers are recommended. Clinicians, however, must. but patients with nonreversible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have been included in several studies4, 7 and can be expected to do well if observed for worsening respiratory status. Additionally, heart failure patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease20, 23 and diabetes21, 22 may have a greater absolute benefit from β-blockers than those without. high doses of an ACE inhibitor. In addition, there is some evidence for benefit with low doses of ACE inhibitors either by themselves or in combination with β-blockers43 as well as for very low doses of β-blockers. 13, 44 Finally, an early benefit for both agents together is plausible based on their separate mechanisms of action.

### Metoprolol is a safe treatment in patients with severe CHF… [^117Rh6oJ]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Beta-blocker therapy has been shown to reduce the symptoms of heart failure and appears to be well tolerated by these patients. Despite this proven benefit, there is still some concern about use of beta blockers in patients with more severe CHF. The concern is that these agents may actually worsen symptoms and increase mortality. Goldstein and colleagues studied the effect of a beta. 1-selective beta blocker — metoprolol controlled release/extended release — in the treatment of patients with severe CHF. The study was a subgroup analysis of the larger MERIT-HF study with 795 enrolled participants. The study group consisted of patients with New York Heart Association Functional class III or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of less than 25 percent.

Those who qualified for the study were randomly assigned to receive placebo or metoprolol, with starting dosages of 12. 5 or 25 mg once daily. The dosage was doubled every two weeks up to a target of 200 mg per day or the highest tolerated dosage. The study looked at cardiac morbidity and mortality, hospitalizations, and tolerability of treatment. The yearly mortality rate in the metoprolol group was reduced by 39 percent compared with the placebo group. In addition, sudden deaths were reduced by 45 percent, and the number of deaths secondary to worsening of heart failure was reduced by 55 percent. The metoprolol group also had fewer hospitalizations and showed improvement in NYHA functional classification. Metoprolol was well tolerated, and fewer persons withdrew from the trial group than from the placebo group. The authors conclude that metoprolol controlled release/extended release can be used in the treatment of severe CHF.

This treatment was well tolerated, reduced mortality rates, and improved heart failure symptoms.

### Effect of beta blockers in chronic heart failure… [^112wwr6C]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

It has been shown that the use of beta-adrenergic blockers prevents the adverse effects of sympathetic stimulation on the failing heart. Beta blockade has produced favorable results in a large number of randomized, controlled trials. Although two meta-analyses of the effect of beta blockers in heart failure have been published, the emphasis was on rates of mortality, and data from some nonrandomized or uncontrolled trials were included. Lechat and associates combined the results of 18 published double-blind, placebo-controlled and parallel-group trials to include measures not reported in the original publications. The 18 trials enrolled a total of 3, 023 patients with heart failure that was caused by idiopathic dilated cardiopathy and ischemic heart disease. For all end points, there was a significant effect in favor of treatment with beta blockers.

Patients taking beta blockers experienced a 32 percent reduction in the risk of death and a 41 percent reduction in hospitalizations compared with the placebo-treated patients. Patients receiving beta blockers also showed a 32 percent improvement in NYHA classification and were 30 percent less likely to have worsening symptoms. The ejection fraction increased by 29 percent in patients treated with beta blockers compared with placebo-treated patients. Assuming a treatment period identical to the mean duration of follow-up, the authors determined that physicians would need to treat 38 patients to avoid one death, 24 patients to avoid one hospitalization and 15 patients to avoid one combined end point. The meta-analysis indicates that the use of beta blockers is associated with a reduction in mortality of about 30 percent in patients with heart failure.

Any uncertainty about the effect of beta blockers on rates of survival is heightened by the finding that the magnitude of the mortality reduction depends on the pharmacologic properties of the drug used. While selective and nonselective beta blockers increased ejection fractions and decreased hospitalizations in a similar way, nonselective beta blockers were associated with a larger survival benefit than beta. The authors conclude that unlike other meta-analyses, this analysis did not confine itself to mortality but rather analyzed nonfatal measures of outcome such as hospitalizations. For these variables, the number of events was large and the treatment effects were robust. This meta-analysis demonstrates that the addition of a beta blocker to conventional therapy is associated with hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement as well as favorable effects on morbidity and mortality. Physicians have sufficient evidence to support the use of beta blockers in heart failure.
