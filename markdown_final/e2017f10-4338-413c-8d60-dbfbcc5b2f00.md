## Question

What causes mucous retention cyst sinus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes mucous retention cysts in the maxillary sinus and how to understand the pathophysiology and contributing factors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition and histology of a mucous retention cyst versus look-alike lesions. Then, I should verify the primary pathogenic mechanism at the glandular level. Next, I will examine upstream triggers that lead to ductal obstruction, including inflammatory, allergic, anatomic, and iatrogenic factors. After that, I should review epidemiology and natural history to gauge how often these cysts progress or remain stable. Finally, I will synthesize a causal model and highlight key distinctions from pseudocysts and mucoceles to avoid misclassification and guide management implications.

> Let me first confirm the definition and histology so I don't conflate entities. A maxillary sinus mucous retention cyst is a true cyst lined by epithelium that arises from blockage and dilatation of a seromucinous gland duct within the sinus lining, which distinguishes it from an antral pseudocyst that lacks an epithelial lining and from a mucocele that represents expansion of an entire sinus cavity rather than a focal glandular cyst, so I need to keep those categories straight in my mind [^114zF7hN] [^112PDKDJ] [^113DtCmW].

> Now, I should verify the primary pathogenic mechanism. The initiating event is obstruction of a minor salivary-type gland duct in the maxillary sinus mucosa, leading to retained secretions, ductal distension, and cyst formation. This is consistently described as the core cause across contemporary surgical and pathologic series, and it aligns with classic otolaryngology frameworks that classify these as secreting cysts arising from glandular obstruction [^114zF7hN] [^112PDKDJ] [^113DtCmW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about triggers. I need to check what upstream factors commonly precipitate that ductal blockage. Chronic rhinosinusitis with mucosal edema and inflammation, allergic rhinitis, and superimposed infections can compress or inflame ducts and impair mucociliary clearance, thereby promoting retention cyst formation; this inflammatory-allergic milieu is repeatedly cited as a plausible background in case series and reviews, and it dovetails with the broader pathophysiology of CRS where mucosal inflammation and drainage impairment are central [^114vBB6T] [^115LWh1c] [^114xDzAh].

> Next, I should review anatomic contributors because outflow compromise can be structural. Let me consider the osteomeatal complex: a smaller maxillary ostium diameter, accessory ostia, concha bullosa, and septal deviation have all been associated with higher odds of mucous retention cysts, supporting the concept that impaired ventilation and drainage predispose to glandular obstruction and cystogenesis. I should double-check that these associations are statistically significant, and yes, the CT-based study reports inverse correlation with ostium size and significant links to septal deviation and concha bullosa, which strengthens causality inference even though the design is observational [^1176aBpX].

> But wait, what if the ostium itself is not the only bottleneck? I need to ensure I account for local mucosal dynamics. Mucosal thickening and generalized inflammatory changes within the maxillary sinus can kink or compress minor ducts, and accessory ostia may alter pressure and flow patterns in ways that favor cyst formation; these mucosal and variant outflow features are described in the same anatomic-variation cohort and fit with the broader CRS literature on mucosal disease and drainage [^1176aBpX] [^114xDzAh].

> I will now examine iatrogenic and traumatic factors because they can directly injure ducts. Prior sinus surgery, including Caldwell-Luc procedures, and midface trauma can disrupt mucosa and entrap glandular elements, creating focal obstruction and cyst formation; case-based literature documents mucoceles and retention-type phenomena after such interventions, and although those reports span multiple sinuses, the mechanistic principle of ductal disruption leading to retention is directly applicable to maxillary mucous retention cysts as well [^117KYJD6] [^1113M3Ts].

> Let me think about prevalence and natural history so I don't overstate progression risk. Incidental mucous retention cysts are common, with pooled estimates around 13% in asymptomatic populations on imaging, and long-term follow-up shows that many remain stable, some regress, and a minority enlarge; importantly, larger cysts, particularly over 20 mm, are more likely to increase in size over time, which is why size-based management algorithms in implant literature distinguish ≤ 20 mm from > 20 mm lesions when planning sinus augmentation [^113zeDTr] [^111yYToE] [^111jCph9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought osteomeatal complex obstruction might be a universal prerequisite, but I should correct that assumption. While OMC blockage is a key driver in CRS and can theoretically contribute to cyst formation, retention cysts can also arise without persistent OMC obstruction, and some even occur in sinuses with accessory or surgically created ostia. This means OMC obstruction may initiate some cysts, but it is not mandatory for all, so I need to be cautious not to overgeneralize that mechanism [^114vBB6T] [^1176aBpX].

> Let me synthesize a causal model to ensure coherence. The most parsimonious pathway is that chronic mucosal inflammation from infection or allergy, structural outflow compromise at the OMC or locally, or direct mucosal injury from surgery or trauma lead to obstruction of a minor salivary duct in the maxillary sinus lining. Retained secretions then cause ductal dilatation and epithelial cyst formation, with size and behavior modulated by ongoing inflammation, pressure dynamics, and ostial patency over time [^114zF7hN] [^1176aBpX] [^112PDKDJ].

> I should confirm key distinctions so management implications are clear. Unlike pseudocysts, which are non-epithelial fluid collections that can drain spontaneously, mucous retention cysts are true epithelial-lined cysts that typically require aspiration or excision if intervention is needed. Unlike mucoceles, which represent expansion of an entire sinus and can erode bone, retention cysts are focal glandular cysts that usually do not cause bony destruction unless very large and chronically inflamed, which helps explain why small lesions are often observed while larger or symptomatic ones are addressed [^114zF7hN] [^112PDKDJ] [^115ZuvMA].

> In summary, I need to ensure the final message is precise: mucous retention cysts of the maxillary sinus result from obstruction of a seromucinous gland duct, most often in the setting of chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic inflammation, anatomic outflow compromise, or prior sinus surgery or trauma. They are true epithelial-lined cysts that are frequently incidental and stable but can enlarge when > 20 mm, and their pathogenesis is multifactorial rather than tied to a single universal cause [^114zF7hN] [^1176aBpX] [^113zeDTr] [^111jCph9].

Mucous retention cysts of the paranasal sinuses arise from **obstruction of seromucinous gland ducts** [^114zF7hN] within the sinus mucosa, leading to mucus accumulation and cyst formation [^112PDKDJ]. Key triggers include **chronic sinus inflammation** (allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis) [^115LWh1c], **anatomic variants** (septal deviation, concha bullosa, narrow ostia) [^1176aBpX], and **prior sinus surgery or trauma** that disrupts normal drainage [^notfound]. They are typically asymptomatic and found incidentally [^115LWh1c]; symptoms may occur if the cyst enlarges or obstructs sinus drainage [^115LWh1c]. Management is usually observation, with intervention only if symptomatic or complicated [^111yYToE].

---

## Pathophysiology

Mucous retention cysts result from **obstruction of seromucinous gland ducts** [^114zF7hN] within the sinus mucosa, causing mucus retention, ductal dilation, and cyst formation [^112PDKDJ]. The cyst wall is lined by epithelium, distinguishing it from pseudocysts, which lack an epithelial lining [^115LWh1c].

---

## Etiological factors

Several factors contribute to the development of mucous retention cysts:

---

### Chronic sinus inflammation

- **Allergic rhinitis**: Persistent mucosal edema and inflammation can obstruct gland ducts [^115LWh1c].

- **Chronic rhinosinusitis**: Ongoing inflammation leads to mucosal thickening and ductal obstruction [^115ZuvMA].

- **Infections**: Recurrent or chronic sinus infections can cause mucosal inflammation and ductal blockage [^1113M3Ts].

---

### Anatomical variations

- **Septal deviation**: Alters airflow and drainage, promoting mucosal edema and ductal obstruction [^115vDL5a].

- **Concha bullosa**: Enlarged middle turbinate can obstruct sinus drainage [^notfound].

- **Narrow sinus ostia**: Congenital or acquired narrowing impedes normal drainage, increasing cyst risk [^1176aBpX].

---

### Trauma or surgical interventions

Trauma or surgical interventions can cause **iatrogenic injury** — prior sinus surgery or facial trauma may disrupt normal mucosal drainage, leading to ductal obstruction and cyst formation [^1113M3Ts].

---

## Clinical presentation

Mucous retention cysts are typically **asymptomatic** and discovered incidentally on imaging [^115LWh1c]. When symptomatic, symptoms result from obstruction of sinus drainage or mass effect and include:

- **Nasal congestion**: Due to impaired sinus drainage [^115LWh1c].

- **Facial pressure or pain**: From sinus obstruction or infection [^115BQ2ZX].

- **Headache**: Associated with sinus pressure [^115LWh1c].

- **Nasal discharge**: From chronic sinus inflammation or infection [^115LWh1c].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Imaging is the primary diagnostic tool for mucous retention cysts:

| **Imaging modality** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Computed tomography (CT) | - Dome-shaped, well-circumscribed, homogenous lesion <br/> - Typically located at the sinus floor <br/> - No bony erosion or tooth root communication [^112PDKDJ] [^111yYToE] |
| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | - T2 hyperintense <br/> - T1 hypointense <br/> - No enhancement on contrast <br/> - Useful for differentiating from other lesions [^114CiA9s] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on symptoms, cyst size, and complications:

- **Observation**: Asymptomatic cysts are managed conservatively with regular follow-up [^111yYToE].

- **Medical therapy**: Nasal corticosteroids and saline irrigations may reduce inflammation and symptoms [^113K3r3m].

- **Surgical intervention**: Indicated for symptomatic cysts, large cysts causing obstruction, or complications such as infection. Endoscopic sinus surgery is the preferred approach [^1171Ju4M].

---

## Potential complications

Although generally benign, mucous retention cysts can lead to **complications** if untreated:

- **Sinus infection**: Chronic or recurrent infections due to impaired drainage [^113ZGkW6].

- **Expansion**: Large cysts may cause bony expansion or erosion [^notfound].

- **Obstruction**: Cysts can obstruct sinus drainage, leading to chronic rhinosinusitis [^notfound].

---

Mucous retention cysts of the paranasal sinuses result from **obstruction of seromucinous gland ducts**, often due to chronic inflammation, anatomical variations, or trauma. They are usually asymptomatic and managed conservatively, but surgical intervention is indicated for symptomatic or complicated cases.

RESULTS

The 3 patients were in their 50s or 60s and presented to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery between 2014 and 2020. Their demographic, clinical, and radiographic information, along with surgical outcome and status at the last visit, are discussed below. Their classification and corresponding treatments are presented in Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table 1.

Case 1 (Type 1: PsC Type)

A 53-year-old male presented to a local dental clinic with a history of cyst formation in the left sinus without any clinical symptoms. The treatment was planned for implant installation on the ipsilateral side of the cyst. However, because of the existence of a cyst at the site necessitating sinus augmentation, his private practice dentist referred him to our hospital for a comprehensive assessment and appropriate management.

At the first consultation, he was not experiencing pain but had a medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. He underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan for further evaluation, and a maxillary CT scan demonstrated a 1.9 × 1.3 × 1.4 cm PsC in the left maxillary sinus (Fig. 1 A, B). The PsC was located on the floor of the sinus, lifting the sinus mucous membrane. The treatment plan was a drainage of mucous fluid together with sinus lifting and bone augmentation on teeth #26 and #27. A lateral approach was conducted with the creation of a bony window, through which spontaneous drainage of the PsC occurred. Without puncturing the sinus membrane, successful bone augmentation was performed with a particulate xenogenic bone graft. An absorbable xenogenic collagen membrane was placed over the bony window to secure the grafted material.

FIGURE 1
The preoperative panoramic radiograph (A) and maxillary CT scan (B) revealed a distinct radiopaque lesion with a "dome-shaped" appearance, located in the left maxillary sinus. The lesion was believed to be a pseudocyst (PsC). The postoperative panoramic radiograph (C) depicts the successful removal of the PsC and the favorable outcome of the sinus augmentation procedure.

On regular follow-up, no evidence of maxillary sinus infection or any other complications arising from the sinus surgery were observed (Fig. 1 C).

The oral cavity and its bony components (maxilla and mandible), along with the nose and its related sinuses, constitute most of the face. Because of their proximity, disease in one may affect the other, whereas trauma of the midface will involve bones common to the oral cavity, nose, and paranasal sinuses. The two serve important life-supporting functions, being the portals for nutrition and respiration. The paranasal sinuses are pneumatic cavities lined by mucous membrane and communicate directly with the nasal cavity. This article presents a brief but relevant view of the surgical anatomy of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.

### Severe facial pain and removal of maxillary sinus mucous retention cyst [^115BQ2ZX]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Maxillary sinus retention cysts (MRCs) are typically asymptomatic and require no treatment. An early 30s man presented with a decade-long history of severe left-sided chronic facial pain (CFP). Multiple prior treatments resulted in an edentulous patient with persistent pain. Imaging revealed a dome-shaped radiopaque change in the left maxillary sinus. History and clinical examination suggested persistent idiopathic facial pain, and doubts about the outcome of a surgical intervention were explained to the patient. Surgical removal of the MRC via lateral antrotomy led to complete symptom resolution of CFP. This case substantiates the importance of considering MRCs as a possible cause of CFP. It also emphasises the need for a systematic multidisciplinary approach in cases of unexplained CFP.

Case presentation

Case 1

A 41-year-old East Asian female patient with a one-year history of gradual painless proptosis in the left eye was admitted. There was no significant personal or familial medical and trauma history. Blood and urine tests were normal. She had no any disturbance in the lipid profile. The best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 in the right eye and 20/33 in the left eye. The patient presented with painless proptosis, inwards and downward eyeball displacement, and upward restricted extraocular muscle movements. Hertel exophthalmometry readings were 16 mm in the right eye and 13 mm in the left. An irregularly shaped, well-defined soft mass was palpable in the superior aspect of left orbit. The rest of ocular examination was normal. CT scan displayed a 2.8 × 3.2 × 1.5 cm soft tissue mass in the left frontal sinus, eroding the floor of sinus, orbital roof, and extending into the superior orbital space (Fig. 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exhibited an irregular mass, the lesions were hyperintense signals on T1 weighted images (T1WI) (Fig. 2). The lesions were isointense and hyperintense mixed signals on T2 weighted images (T2WI). Contrast-enhanced imaging demonstrated that most tumor parts reveal a non-significant enhancement. Resection was performed via an anterior orbitotomy. After incising the superolateral orbital periosteum, a cavity containing dark red liquid was accessed just inside the orbital rim. During the operation, the cystic fluid was aspirated, the cystic wall was removed (Fig. 3), and the abnormal bone was thoroughly curetted. The histopathological examination of cyst contents and wall revealed inflammatory granulation tissues, fibrous capsule wall, cholesterol clefts with altered blood pigments, and calcifications, consistent with the diagnosis of cholesterol granuloma (Fig. 4). There was no recurrence upon follow-up.

### Maxillary sinus augmentation following removal of a maxillary sinus pseudocyst after a shortened healing period [^112pAdQQ]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Dome-shaped radiopacities on the floor of the maxillary sinus are commonly interpreted as a sinus cyst on radiographs during dental implant planning. They might present an obstacle in sinus grafting, leading to bone graft failure or implant loss later. The therapeutic approaches to the removal of such cystic lesions and the following sinus augmentation are still controversial. The purpose of this article is to present a modified technique that can be used for predictable removal of a maxillary sinus cyst and sinus augmentation after a shortened healing period in patients with maxillary sinus pseudocysts.

Materials and Methods

A total of 11 patients with a mean age of 43.7 years with a radiographic dome-shaped opacity in the posterior maxilla sinus were included in this study. A lateral sinus window (with a diameter of about 5 mm) was prepared, and removal of the cyst was performed with grasping forceps. Three months after removal of the cyst, a conventional sinus augmentation with xenogeneic material was undertaken. Dental implants were placed 6 months later. Panoramic radiography and coronal/axial computed tomography were performed to diagnose the sinus lesion preoperatively and for follow-up.

Results

A total of 11 pseudocysts were removed from the sinuses of 11 patients under local anesthesia. Histologic evaluation showed antral pseudocysts in all specimens. A soft tissue scar was evident after 3 months of healing at the time of sinus augmentation. No sinus membrane perforation was seen or occurred during the sinus augmentation. A total of 17 implants were placed and restored prosthetically. No clinical complications were observed. The patients were followed up for a mean of 29.2 months (range, 17–43 months) after prosthetic loading, during which no implants were lost and no recurrence of the antral pseudocyst was observed.

Conclusion

The described modified surgical technique allows the minimally invasive removal of the antral pseudocyst and histologic verification of the diagnosis without compromising the nasoantral entrance as well as the anatomy of the sinus for future sinus augmentations. It can be performed under local anesthesia without endoscopic equipment while shortening the treatment period.

### Maxillary sinus augmentation and implant installation in patients with pseudocysts and mucous retention cysts [^116eVu1t]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Case 2 (Type 2: MRC Type With Size ≤ 20 mm)

A 63-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of maxillary dental rehabilitation. Based on a maxillary CT scan, the patient was diagnosed with MRC (1.5 × 1.9 × 1.2 cm) in the left sinus, but he had no clinical symptoms about that. Installing the implant and lifting the sinus required the removal of the MRC. The treatment plan was aspiration of the cyst followed by #24–26 implant installation with sinus lifting (Fig. 2 A, B).

FIGURE 2
Preoperative panoramic radiograph (A) and CBCT (B) revealed the dimensions of the cysts in the left maxillary sinus and the extent of atrophy of the alveolar ridge in the same region. The lesion was identified as a mucous retention cyst (MRC). Subsequently, the figure illustrates the procedure of cystic content aspiration using a 10 mL syringe, followed by simultaneous implant installation (C). Finally, the postoperative panoramic radiograph (D) at the 1-year follow-up highlights the successful outcome of the procedure.

Mid-crestal and vertical incisions were made in the area of #24–26. The lateral sinus wall was punctured using a low-speed round bur, and the location of the MRC was confirmed. A 23-gauge needle was utilized to perform aspiration, resulting in the collection of 1.2 mL of exudate. Subsequently, sinus elevation was performed using hand instruments, followed by the placement of a xenograft and xenogenic membrane to complete the sinus augmentation procedure. A prefabricated surgical guide for dental implants was placed and secured onto the remaining maxillary teeth, and the implants were positioned precisely at their intended locations (Fig. 2 C).

Sixteen months after the operation, the patient showed no postprocedural complications or implant failure (Fig. 2 D).

### Rare mandibular surgical ciliated cysts: report of two new cases [^112X5FP8]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The surgical ciliated cyst, also known as the "postoperative maxillary cyst" or "implantation cyst", occurs as a result of iatrogenic implantation of respiratory epithelium into a noncontiguous surgical site after sinus surgery. It typically presents as a well-defined radiolucency in the maxilla in young adults. Histopathologically, the cyst is lined by ciliated columnar, cuboidal, or pseudostratified squamous epithelium with mucous cells. We report two rare cases of a surgical ciliated cyst located in the mandible.

### An atypical presentation of sinus mucopyocele in a pediatric cystic fibrosis patient [^112hes6L]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Allergic conjunctivitis is the most common type I IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to environmental allergens involving the ocular surface, affecting approximately 25% of the general population and 30% of allergy-predisposed children. Symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis include ocular pruritus, tearing, conjunctival edema, hyperemia, watery discharge, burning, and photophobia. Treatment of allergic conjunctivitis involves topical and sometimes oral therapy as well as allergen avoidance. The current literature is limited in terms of the association between sinus disease and chronic allergic conjunctivitis. While in other ophthalmic symptomatology (proptosis, epiphora, deep orbital pain, double vision),–physicians often look to the adjacent sinus for the etiology, such an analysis is often overlooked in the patient with severe, unremitting allergic conjunctivitis refractory to traditional medical management. In particular, paranasal sinus mucocele has not been well documented as a possible cause of conjunctivitis, particularly in children. To our knowledge, there is only one case reported of a mucocele leading to chronic blepharoconjunctivitis and this was in an adult patient (the adult population is more likely to have mucoceles than the pediatric population). More common ophthalmic symptoms of these benign, epithelial-lined, mucus filled sacs include proptosis, visual disturbances, motility defects, and pain due to mass effect.–Mucoceles have been documented in association with systemic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), with a prevalence of 16% in cases of CF with symptoms of chronic upper airway disease. In addition, patients with CF generally have a large number of bacteria in their sputum and nasal secretionsand therefore have a higher risk of infection (mucopyocele). In cases of infection, drainage of the mucopyocele is indicated to ensure eradication of the organism that can have significant pulmonary consequences. Identification and diagnosis of the mucocele is critical in helping maintain the pulmonary health of such patients, which can be difficult in atypical cases without symptoms of nasal obstruction. We present herein a case of a 3-year-old CF patient misdiagnosed for 2 years with chronic allergic conjunctivitis whose symptoms were caused by an ethmoidal mucopyocele infected with Escherichia coli.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^1123TerT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) disease states that warrant consideration for expedited sinus surgery include nasal polyps, bone erosion, osteitis, allergic mucin, and fungal ball. In chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), polyps shrink in response to oral or topical steroids but frequently regrow once the steroid is stopped, and sinus surgery for CRSwNP involves the immediate removal of polyps and removes the physical obstruction of the sinuses. For bone erosion, bone erosion does not change in response to oral or topical steroids or antibiotics, and sinus surgery immediately removes the source of the pressure atrophy and prevents progression of bone erosion. For osteitis, no medical treatment exists for paranasal sinus osteitis at this time, and surgery can remove the osteitic bone that contributes to sinonasal obstruction and can also immediately decrease the progression of disease to help facilitate topical medical treatments. In allergic mucin, medical therapy carries significant risks and is insufficient at enabling effective mucociliary clearance of the thick sticky mucin, whereas surgical intervention is considered first-line treatment and is recommended in multiple consensus statements. For a fungal ball, no medical therapy to completely eradicate fungal ball and bacterial superinfection currently exists, and surgical intervention is gold-standard treatment to remove the fungal debris and reestablish sinus drainage pathway.

The olfactory pathway is composed of peripheral sinonasal and central sensorineural components. The wide variety of different pathologies that can affect the olfactory pathway reflect this complex anatomical relationship. Localising olfactory pathology can present a challenge to the reporting radiologist. This imaging review will illustrate the normal anatomy of the olfactory system and describe a systematic approach to considering olfactory dysfunction. Key concepts in image interpretation will be demonstrated using examples of olfactory pathway pathologies.

### Pharyngeal retention cysts: radiographic findings in seven patients [^113JRXYU]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to better characterize the radiographic features of pharyngeal retention cysts on double-contrast pharyngograms.

Conclusion

Pharyngeal retention cysts typically involve the valleculae, appearing on double-contrast pharyngograms as small, round or ovoid, well-circumscribed, smooth-surfaced submucosal masses that are best visualized on frontal views of the pharynx. Such features should be highly suggestive of benign retention cysts, obviating further diagnostic workup in asymptomatic patients. When the cysts are lobulated or completely obliterate the valleculae, however, further evaluation by otolaryngologic examination may be required to rule out malignant tumor in the pharynx.

Axial bone window CT b shows a permeative process within the frontal sinus causing cortical destruction (arrowed). T1WI demonstrates recurrent SCC involving the frontal sinus (c), expanding the sinus and infiltrating the bone (long arrow) with loss of the normal fatty marrow signal (arrowhead for comparison). There is clear evidence of inner and outer table cortical breach on T1WI with loss of the normal hypointense cortical rim (short arrow) placing the patient at risk of intracranial disease. The lesion demonstrates mild enhancement (d), with associated dural thickening and enhancement (arrow) indicating transpatial spread

Benign inflammatory diseases

Sinonasal polyposis is a benign inflammatory mucosal condition that most commonly affects the maxillary sinuses and often extends into the middle meatus of the nasal cavity (Fig. 7). It is characterised by its rounded contours. The presence of more extensive sinonasal polyposis, particularly in the upper meatus and the posterior portion of the middle meatus, can significantly impede olfactory function.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^1141ihqm]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative debridement after ESS — Based on the type of surgery performed and the postoperative endoscopic exam, postoperative debridement may be performed, and removal of retained blood and dense crusting from the nasal cavity and sinuses is important to the healing process. This in-office procedure, typically done with topical anesthesia only, can be uncomfortable, and the importance and frequency of these visits should be discussed with patients in advance when needed to optimize outcomes.

### Maxillary sinus augmentation and implant installation in patients with pseudocysts and mucous retention cysts [^1129dWyD]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

All 3 cases exhibited favorable outcomes without any complications. Based on these cases, spontaneous drainage of PsC before sinus augmentation is recommended. Regarding MRC, if the size is smaller than 20 mm, aspiration should be considered as a viable option. However, for MRCs larger than 20 mm, complete removal is advised. In addition, simple aspiration of MRC does not significantly damage the mucosal lining, and sinus augmentation may be performed simultaneously. However, with cyst enucleation, sinus augmentation should be delayed until complete mucosal healing.

This study has certain limitations, including the presentation of only one case for each classification and no control group. However, despite these limitations, the categorization of patients into PsC, MRC (≤ 20 mm), and MRC (> 20 mm) based on existing literature and the utilization of distinct surgical approaches for each category can provide valuable guidance to surgeons involved in oral rehabilitation procedures.

A thorough assessment of maxillary sinus cysts is crucial during sinus grafting procedures to minimize the risk of disrupting normal sinus function. The management of these cysts, whether through spontaneous drainage, aspiration, or enucleation, should be carefully determined based on the anticipated pathologic diagnosis and the size of the cyst. Considering these factors, clinicians can make informed decisions for the best possible outcomes.

### Natural course of the maxillary sinus fungus ball: results from seoul national university hospital healthcare center [^116TKKqu]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

We retrospectively analyzed data from the Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center. The data of 41,497 patients who underwent structured brain MRI between 2004 and 2023 were included in the health checkup program. Our objective was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and progression of maxillary sinus fungus balls. During screening, we first reviewed the data of patients who underwent brain MRI at least three times with readings that included "sinus" or "fung". Predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for the screening and selection of patients with fungus ball. Primary screening was performed as described previously. Patients with typical T2‐weighted MRI findings (central T2 hypointensity with surrounding T2 hyperintense mucosal thickening) were screened and selected. However, patients who demonstrated lesions with smooth homogeneous signal intensity on T1‐weighted MR (homogeneous hypointense or hyperintense lesions indicative of retention cysts or mucoceles) were excluded.

Additionally, we reviewed the records of patients who underwent brain MRI once or twice with the presence of a fungus ball confirmed by ESS (the surgery was performed after referral to the surgeon from the Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center owing to a suspicion of fungus ball based on the brain MRI). Patients with fungus balls in sinuses other than the maxillary sinuses were excluded. Also, patients with an insufficient interval (< 1 year) between imaging examinations were excluded.

To identify the related factors, we reviewed sex, age at first imaging completion, interval between the last and first imaging, and history of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and nasal septal deviation (DSN). Furthermore, we reviewed the images of maxillary dental implants and endodontic materials that had been inserted into the root canals. We reviewed the medical history and CT scans to check for endodontic material and dental implant status. On the CT scans, endodontic materials were identified as white hyperdense spots evident in the tooth canals whereas the dental implants were easily identified.

- **Definition**: CRS is defined as the evidence of inflammation in the sinonasal mucosa for > 12 weeks characterized by sinus pressure, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and decreased sense of smell.
- **Pathophysiology**: A complex interplay of host factors (defects in mechanical, innate, and adaptive components of immune system) and environmental factors (allergens, toxins, microbial agents) have been implicated in the development of CRS.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of persistent sinus pressure, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and a decreased sense of smell.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: CRS is not associated with increased mortality.

### Maxillary sinus augmentation and implant installation in patients with pseudocysts and mucous retention cysts [^1173ApBx]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

This case study systematically assessed diverse approaches to sinus augmentation in the presence of sinus pathology. Three patients were carefully selected and categorized as pseudocyst (PsC) (type 1), mucous retention cyst (MRC) smaller than 20 mm (type 2), and MRC larger than 20 mm in size (type 3). All patients underwent sinus augmentation procedures, with each case utilizing a unique surgical approach. Spontaneous drainage was performed for the patient with PsC (type 1), followed by uncomplicated sinus augmentation. For the patient with an MRC smaller than 20 mm (type 2), aspiration of the cyst contents preceded sinus augmentation. Conversely, the patient with a larger MRC (type 3) underwent cyst enucleation followed by sinus augmentation after complete recovery of the sinus membrane. No complications were noted in any of the cases, and follow-up revealed stable implant installation at the site of sinus augmentation. Within the constraints of this study, the choice of surgical procedure, whether involving spontaneous drainage, aspiration, or enucleation, should be guided by an anticipated pathologic diagnosis and the size of the sinus cyst. This informed approach empowers clinicians to make well-informed decisions for the best possible outcomes and sustained results. Overall, this study offers valuable insights for clinicians seeking to optimize sinus augmentation procedures in the presence of sinus pathology.

### Natural course of retention cysts of the maxillary sinus: long-term follow-up results [^111yYToE]. The Laryngoscope (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Retention cysts of the maxillary sinus are an incidental finding on radiographs. These cysts usually appear as rounded, dome-shaped, soft tissue masses, most often on the floor of the maxillary sinus. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term natural course of retention cysts of the maxillary sinus.

Methods

Between November 1997 and October 2002, 40 patients were incidentally found to have retention cysts of the maxillary sinus on Waters view films. Seventeen of these patients were followed for 38 to 102 (mean, 60) months. Medical records, endoscopic nasal examinations, and Waters view of all 40 patients were reviewed. The size of each retention cyst and the ratio of cyst size to antral size were measured.

Results

Of the 40 patients, 21 (52.5%) had cysts in the left maxillary sinus, 17 (42.5%) had cysts in the right maxillary sinus, and 2 (5%) had cysts in both sinuses. Thirty of the 43 (69.7%) cysts appeared to arise from the floor of the sinus. Cyst size ranged from 108 mm to 1,001 mm, and the ratio of cyst size to antral size ranged from 12.8% to 96.9%, as measured on Waters view. Follow-up Waters view films in 17 patients showed that seven cysts disappeared completely, two decreased in size, four showed no significant change in size, and five increased in size.

Conclusions

Most retention cysts of the maxillary sinus spontaneously regressed or showed no significant change in size over the long term. These findings suggest that, in the absence of associated complications, "wait and see" may be the appropriate management strategy for these retention cysts.

### Flexible endoscopy in the visualization of 3D-printed maxillary sinus and clinical application [^112Dpd2x]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Case1

In a patient with inverted papilloma of the MS, a bone septum arising from the floor of the MS can be bypassed using flexible endoscope, revealing the anterior compartment of alveolar recess.

The preoperative CT image showed lesions in the left MS, which has a bone septum on the inferior wall (Fig. 2 a, b). The lesions with secretion retention could be enhanced on MRI scans (Fig. 2 c–f). The inverted papilloma, confirmed by postoperative pathology, arises from the junction of the medial and inferior wall. The tumor was resected completely along with edema polyp in the alveolar crypt through prelacrimal recess approach. After the suspicious bones were removed, the mucosa at the anterior of inferior turbinate was sewed up. In postoperative follow-up, the ostium, posterolateral wall and part of the superior wall of the MS could be observed with 0° rigid endoscope, but the inferior wall couldn't be seen (Fig. 2 g). The visual range under 70° endoscope could include the posterior compartment of alveolar recess, and just reach the bone septum in the floor of the MS (Fig. 2 h, i). In contrast, the bone septum could be bypassed by applying flexible endoscope, visualizing the anterior compartment of alveolar recess, where a small cyst-like lesion exists (Fig. 2 j–o).

This article is only available in the PDF format. Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables. Benign Cysts of the Paranasal Sinuses. Presented by Dr. Harold F. Schuknecht. Benign cysts of the paranasal sinuses are of two general types, those which take origin from the sinus mucosa and those which invade the maxillary sinuses from the teeth. From the mucosa arise three types: The nonsecreting cysts, the mucous gland cysts and the mucoceles. Nonsecreting cysts are found in the maxillary sinuses and occur in about 5 per cent, as shown by routine roentgenograms. On roentgenograms they produce a characteristic dome-shaped shadow, but may also fill the sinus and produce complete homogeneous clouding. The cyst forms as a collection of straw-colored fluid in the loose subepithelial connective tissue of the mucosa. This fluid is usually sterile and coagulates on standing.

Small nonsecreting cysts usually produce no symptoms and need not be removed. When the cyst occupies one half or more of the sinus, there may result. Lindsay JR, Lawson LJ. CHICAGO LARYNGOLOGICAL AND OTOLOGICAL SOCIETY. Arch Otolaryngol. 1948; 47: 693–702. doi:

### Clinicopathologic features of dentigerous cysts in the maxillary sinus [^117UCiaY]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Dentigerous cyst (DC) in the maxillary sinus is extremely rare. This study evaluated the clinical features, etiologic factors, imaging, treatment, and signs and symptoms of this type of DC. Clinical symptoms, radiographic findings, surgical methods, and histopathologic findings of 4 patients with DCs in the maxillary sinus were evaluated. In addition, we reviewed the literature reports of DCs in the maxillary sinus over the past 40 years. Our 4 patients with DC in the maxillary sinus showed the following results: (1) all the patients were males at first 3 decades of age, (2) swelling and/or yellow-green pus discharges from pharyngeal cavity were common symptoms, (3) the involved teeth in the DC were the maxillary third molar teeth and supernumerary teeth, and (4) Caldwell-Luc approach was performed in these 4 patients. The patients with DC in the maxillary sinus should be evaluated thoroughly by extraoral and intraoral examinations, proper diagnostic imaging procedures, and pathologic examination to avoid misdiagnosis of maxillary sinusitis. The standard treatment for DC in the maxillary sinus is often removed by Caldwell-Luc approach. Furthermore, marsupialization or functional endoscopic sinus surgery may be performed because of the size, location of the cysts, or the age of the patients.

### Asymptomatic giant epiglottic cyst causing an unexpectedly difficult airway: a case report [^1148h3Wq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Epiglottic cysts are benign lesions resulting from the obstruction and retention of glandular secretions, and they can be observed in individuals across all age groups. The historical occurrence of epiglottic cysts during laryngoscopy is 4 in 5000 cases (0.08%), with larger cysts being even rarer at 0.02%. For adults, these cysts can be symptomless or cause minor symptoms such as feeling discomfort in the throat, a sensation of foreign body or obstruction. With the growth of the cyst, these symptoms may worsen, possibly causing breathing difficulties. Although small, incidental cysts might not need treatment, larger cysts with symptoms usually require surgical intervention. It is essential to carefully manage large epiglottic cysts during tracheal intubation to prevent puncture, which might result in aspiration or hemorrhage. In extreme situations, a tracheostomy might be required.

### Endoscopic sinus surgery for inflammatory maxillary sinus disease [^115efG3u]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Objective/Hypothesis

The role of endoscopic sinus surgery for treating chronic maxillary sinusitis is well established. The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of endoscopic sinus surgery in the treatment of maxillary sinus inflammatory disease that includes mucoceles, retention cysts, and antrochoanal polyps.

Study Design

This is a retrospective review of 32 consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery for mucoceles (n = 21), retention cysts (n = 5), or antrochoanal polyps (n = 6).

Methods

The medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, presenting symptoms, and type of operation. Surgical outcome was determined by resolution of symptoms, recurrence of disease, and need for revision or additional surgery.

Results

Ethmoidectomy with middle meatal antrostomy was performed in all patients; 28 patients had additional middle turbinectomy. Postoperative follow-up ranged from 6 months to 4 years. The operation resulted in resolution of symptoms and a patent antrostomy on long-term follow-up in all cases of mucoceles. No case required revision surgery. On the other hand, the disease recurred in three patients (60%) with retention cysts and three patients (50%) with antrochoanal polyps despite patent antrostomies. The recurrences occurred 3 to 6 months after the surgery. The recurrent cases of antrochoanal polyps required Caldwell Luc procedures. The three failures in cases of retention cysts were successfully managed with repeated office endoscopic marsupialization through a patent antrostomy.

Conclusions

Endoscopic sinus surgery is an effective treatment for mucoceles, with favorable long-term outcome. Maxillary retention cysts commonly recur after endoscopic sinus surgery. However, the recurrence can be managed in the office through a patent antrostomy. Endoscopic sinus surgery may be offered as initial surgical treatment for antrochoanal polyps, but a Caldwell Luc operation may be needed for recurrent disease.

### Giant epidermoid cyst of the maxillary sinus: a postoperative complication? [^115bqC6w]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Epidermoid cysts are benign lesions, which are usually detected on the floor of the mouth in the head and neck region. They can develop from abnormal epithelial components of an ectoderm tissue during the embryological life or alternatively they can arise from the implanted epithelium after trauma or surgery. The diagnosis of an epidermoid cyst in the maxillary sinus can be challenging and it could be easily mistaken for any benign or malign lesion of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. In this case, we present a 44-year-old man with a giant epidermoid cyst in the right maxillary sinus with a previous history of paranasal sinus surgery. We present a very rare case of epidermoid cyst and also discuss the importance of radiological imaging modalities in differential diagnosis of a unilateral expansile mass in the maxillary sinus.

### Maxillary sinus augmentation and implant installation in patients with pseudocysts and mucous retention cysts [^111TvvU8]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Complete removal of all true sinus cysts is generally recommended. However, a study by Han et alfound that, in the case of MRC, aspiration alone did not lead to any postoperative complications and resulted in the successful stabilization of dental implants. Although the author presented only one case of aspiration and another case of cyst enucleation, the study conclusion was that simple aspiration may be a less invasive approach and could be used in cases of MRC. Hence, the decision to perform cyst aspiration or removal should not solely depend on its classification as a true cyst but also on its size and potential to obstruct the ostium function.

In the present cases, distinct treatment approaches were employed for PsC and MRC based on their respective sizes (≤ 20 mm and > 20 mm). Previous studies influenced the rationale for adopting different treatment methods for MRC measuring 20 mm or larger and tending to exhibit progressive enlargement over time. Consequently, a complete removal of moderate to large MRCs was deemed advantageous for achieving favorable long-term outcomes.

The PsC observed in "case 1" did not occupy a significant portion of the sinus lumen and was not expected to interfere with ostium function after sinus augmentation. Therefore, during the surgical procedure, a lateral bony window of the sinus was created, and the sinus mucosa was elevated to allow spontaneous drainage of the inflammatory exudate. In "case 2", MRC was found in the left sinus and did not involve a sizable portion of the sinus lumen. As MRC is a true cyst, spontaneous drainage was not a suitable treatment. Therefore, a needle aspiration was performed to alleviate pressure and decrease its size before sinus augmentation. Finally, a large MRC was identified in the right sinus of "case 3" and had the potential to interfere with ostium function. Thus, complete removal of the MRC was performed, and sinus augmentation was not conducted to avoid dissemination of the bone grafting material into the sinus. The timing of dental implant placement for all 3 cases was determined by expected initial stability. If the height of the remaining alveolar ridge was insufficient, the implant was delayed until the grafted bone material in the sinus had stabilized.

Table 7 — evaluation criteria for ESS without radiologic evidence of disease in a sinus — outlines selected scenarios in patients with guideline-established CRS undergoing ESS. In such patients, there may be very carefully selected patient-specific scenarios when ESS could include a sinus that does not have any radiologic evidence of mucosal thickening. Reasons include when the sinus is interposed between radiologically diseased sinuses and not addressing it could compromise ESS, when the patient's CRS puts them at high risk for recurrence and revision ESS due to postoperative osteitic changes, when the radiologically diffuse nature suggests a sinus without radiologic evidence is likely to have active CRS, and when ESS on adjacent sinuses may risk postoperative function of the nondiseased sinus. The table additionally states that these concepts and this key action statement do not condone surgery on patients with normal sinus computed tomography scans.

FIGURE 2
Apical periodontitis.

Inflammation near the root may stimulate proliferation of the periapical epithelial cells, resulting in formation of a periapical cyst (Fig. 3). These cysts are lined with stratified squamous epithelium and filled with protein-rich fluid and cellular debris. They slowly enlarge and are often asymptomatic, although symptoms may arise if inflammation increases or if the cyst grows significantly. Treatment of periapical cysts is the same as that for periapical granulomas. Residual periapical cysts (which persist after removal of the affected tooth) should be excised. Periapical abscesses may develop de novo or from chronic periapical granuloma transformation, and are characterized by collection of inflammatory cells and infected tissue at the apex of a non-vital tooth. If the abscess extends into the alveolus, the patient may experience progressive pain, tenderness, sensitivity to percussion, swelling of adjacent tissue, extrusion of the affected tooth, and systemic signs of infection. Radiographs often demonstrate apical periodontal ligament broadening and an ill-defined radiolucency, but no significant bony defects. Sequelae of an inappropriately treated or untreated abscess include intraoral sinus tract formation, head and neck fascial space abscesses or cellulitis, and osteomyelitis. Management of periapical abscess focuses on drainage, possible tooth extraction with curettage of the cavity, or endodontic therapy if the tooth is thought to be salvageable. Antibiotics are usually unnecessary for treatment of localized abscesses unless there are systemic symptoms, involvement of fascial spaces or osteomyelitis. Intraoral sinus tracts often resolve spontaneously after appropriate treatment of the offending tooth, and require no further intervention.

FIGURE 3
Periapical cyst.

Complications of Pulpal and Periapical Disease

If a periapical abscess is not drained (either surgically or spontaneously), it can perforate through the cortical bone of the maxilla or mandible and extend along soft tissue fascial planes. The head and neck have multiple fascial spaces delineated by different anatomic structures, including muscles, bone, tendons, ligaments, and so on. Odontogenic infections have the potential to spread into these spaces and result in superficial or deep space infection. Depending on their anatomic location and surrounding structures, these infections have varying degrees of severity and propensity to cause systemic harm. The most common complication and most frequent cause of death from odontogenic infections is airway compromise. Additional complications may also include, but are not limited to, visual disturbances/blindness, sinusitis, mediastinitis, septic thrombus formation, and systemic sepsis.

Case 3 (Type 3: MRC Type With Size > 20 mm)

A 69-year-old male presented to the department with a previously treated maxillary sinus. The patient presented with symptoms of nasal obstruction and discharge, leading to the decision to undergo a Caldwell-Luc osteotomy procedure (CLOP) at another hospital; however, MRC was not fully eliminated in the right sinus. In addition to the pathologic status of the maxillary sinus, the loss of #16 tooth was not yet treated. The patient was informed about the remaining MRC and the need for dental rehabilitation with an implant (Fig. 3 A, B).

FIGURE 3
Preoperative panoramic radiograph (A) and CBCT (B) reveal a large sinus cyst in the right sinus; no signs of any other sinus infection were found upon clinical examination. (C) and (D) depict the intraoperative procedure of cyst enucleation, wherein a plate was utilized to secure the bony window after the removal of the mucous retention cyst (MRC). (E) and (F) show histopathologic examination of mucous retention cyst with an epithelial-lined cystic structure (H&E, ×10 and ×40). The postoperative panoramic radiograph (G) and CT (H) illustrate follow-up status at 3 years and 1 year, respectively. The MRC was successfully enucleated, and the implant was installed without any complications in the sinus.

The treatment plan was to enucleate the MRC and then lift the sinus to install the implant sequentially. Bone graft after sinus lifting was not planned for this surgery. A small bony window was created on the lateral side of the right maxillary sinus, and the retrieved bone fragment was retained for use as a cover after the procedure. The MRC was clearly visible through the bony window and was removed. Following the removal of the MRC, sinus elevation via osteotome was conducted, and no bone augmentation was performed. The dental implant was then successfully placed in the desired location. Finally, the removed bone window was repositioned and fixed using miniplate and screws (Fig. 3 C, D). Postoperative histopathologic examination showed MRC with an epithelial-lined cystic structure (Fig. 3 E, F).

During the 39-month follow-up, unfavorable outcomes were not detected, and the patient was satisfied with the results (Fig. 3 G, H).

### Maxillary sinus augmentation and implant installation in patients with pseudocysts and mucous retention cysts [^115LWh1c]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

PsC and MRC are cysts that can develop in the maxillary sinus. The conditions are difficult to differentiate on imaging, particularly when they are small in size. Under microscopic examination, PsCs do not exhibit glandular or ductal structures. They are believed to arise from periapical or other infections that results in the accumulation of inflammatory exudates beneath the periosteum. Mucous retention cysts, on the other hand, are inflammatory cysts that form as a result of a blocked gland or duct within the sinus lining. Another notable distinction between PsC and MRC is that the former lacks epithelial lining, whereas the latter possesses a genuine epithelial lining.

PsCs and MRCs are usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on radiography, with a reported prevalence of about 10% in the general population. Patients with sinusitis symptoms may have previously experienced sinusitis or allergic symptoms, which are assumed to be potential factors in the development of PsCs and MRCs. Therefore, in cases with large-sized PsC or MRC, symptoms may occur and treatment may be required. Cases 1 and 2 showed PsC type and MRC type with size ≤ 20 mm, respectively. Both cases showed representative anatomic findings of PsC and MRC and had no special clinical symptoms. On the other hand, for case 3, classified as MRC type with size > 20 mm, the patient presented symptoms of nasal obstruction and discharge, resembling sinusitis. CLOP was first performed at another hospital, and the remaining MRC was additionally removed at the time of implant surgery in our hospital. In the histopathologic examination of the removed MRC, a cystic structure lined with epithelium was observed. Furthermore, studies suggest that symptoms such as migraines, nasal congestion, postnasal drip, and tenderness upon palpation of the anterior maxillary sinus wall are often attributed to the presence of large MRCs obstructing the natural ostium drainage pathway.

### Sinus radiological findings in general asymptomatic populations: a systematic review of incidental mucosal changes [^113zeDTr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the range of incidental mucosal changes in a general sinonasally asymptomatic population on radiology.

Data Sources

Medline (1996-present) and Embase (1974-present) were searched on March 14, 2020, to identify articles that reported radiological sinus mucosal findings in asymptomatic population groups. Bibliographic search of included studies was conducted to identify additional articles.

Review Methods

The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. A comprehensive search strategy was formulated and articles screened to extract data reporting Lund-Mackay (LM) score, presence of mucous retention cysts, and maxillary mucosal thickening. A random-effects model was used in meta-analysis.

Results

A total of 950 articles were identified, of which 33 manuscripts met the inclusion criteria. The included studies involved 16,966 sinonasally asymptomatic subjects. The mean LM score was 2.24 (95% CI, 1.61–2.87), and an LM score of ≥ 4 in 14.71% (95% CI, 6.86–24.82%) was present across all general asymptomatic population groups. Mucous retention cysts were noted in 13% (95% CI, 8.33–18.55%) and maxillary mucosal thickening of ≥ 2 mm in 17.73% (95% CI, 8.67–29.08%).

Conclusion

The prevalence of incidental mucosal changes in a general asymptomatic population on radiology needs to be considered when making a diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis.

### Unusual cause of hypopituitarism: sphenoid mucocele [^116KfFNz]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Paranasal sinus mucocele is cystic, expansile, benign masses that contain mucus surrounded by epithelium. It causes significant locally destruction of the sinus wall and present with various symptoms depending on the pressure on neighboring structures. Sphenoid sinus mucocele constitutes 1% to 2% of all paranasal sinus mucoceles. Headache is the most common symptom that leads to correct diagnosis. In addition, the close proximity of the sphenoid sinus to important structures such as the optic nerve, cavernous sinus and the pituitary gland causes various symptoms. Treatment is surgical drainage of mucocele to reduce pressure.

### Isolated unilateral upper alveolar numbness in silent sinus syndrome [^115o6Hak]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

The patient was last reviewed 4 months after surgery and noted some improvement in his upper alveolar numbness. No significant improvement was seen in his facial asymmetry. Endoscopic examination demonstrated a widely patent middle maxillary antrostomy and a small mucus retention cyst within the left maxillary sinus.

Discussion

SSS is a rare and underdiagnosed entity typically characterised by unilateral painless enophthalmos, hypoglobus and facial deformity with the peak incidence in the fourth decade. It was first described by Montgomery in 1964 and subsequently termed as SSS by Soparkar et al in 1994. Besides hypoglobus and enophthalmos, the spectrum of ophthalmic presentation of SSS also includes transient vertical diplopia, upper lid retraction, lagophthalmos and blurred vision. Confusion of the description of SSS and CMA as independent and isolated entities exists.

CMA, like SSS, is an uncommon acquired condition with progressive inflexion of the maxillary antral walls resulting in volume loss and resultant clinical signs/symptoms. CMA is also accompanied by sinonasal symptoms such as nasal congestion, facial pain, discomfort or pressure, headaches and rhinorrhoea. Patients with CMA present in their late 30s to early 40s with no gender predilection or laterality bias. Clinical presentation of CMA is a range based on the evolution and severity of disease. Kass et al proposed that CMA may be divided into three stages representing the spectrum of the disease: stage 1, membranous deformity with lateralised maxillary fontanelle; stage 2, bony deformity with inward bowing of one or more osseous wall; stage 3, clinical deformity with enophthalmos, hypoglobus and/or midfacial deformity.SSS has been proposed to be a subtype of stage 3 CMA, whereby there is absence of sinonasal symptoms.

### Closure of the frontal sinus ostium by a block of bone: unexpected cause of frontal mucocele [^1148oYWP]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Mucoceles are benign, slow-growing lesions. Frontal sinus mucoceles are caused by the obstruction of the sinus ostium and seromucous secretions fill the inside of the cyst. The size of the cyst and the destroyed sinus walls gradually expands. Cystic mass can lead to orbital or intracranial complications when it overflows beyond the boundaries of the sinus. In this manuscript, we presented an unexpected cause of frontal mucocele in which the closure of the frontal sinus ostium is caused by a block of bone. A case of orbital complications is presented.

### Functional surgery for the treatment of dentigerous cyst in the maxillary sinus [^113UCKnU]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Dentigerous cyst (DC) in the maxillary sinus is rarely seen. Several complications are observed after the Caldwell-Luc operation, which is combined with endoscopy. Still, a more perfect treatment method is yet to be discovered.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to explore and assess a new functional surgical treatment with fewer complications, which not only insured normal maxillary sinus cilia restoration and bony integrity but also did little damage to maxillary sinus natural ostium.

Methods

Dentigerous cyst in the maxillary sinuses of 20 patients had conditions diagnosed through radiographic imaging and the locating of bone windows' positions according to preoperative 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) (3D CT). All the patients underwent a functional surgery in which a bony lid was created anteriolaterally of maxillary sinus with piezosurgery and reimplanted by titanium plates after enucleating the cyst, leaving the maxillary sinus mucosa in place with or without endoscope's assistance. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by clinical examination and radiographic imaging at regular intervals; the longest follow-up was 24 months.

Results

All the patients recovered except for one, who underwent plate removal and radical maxillary sinusotomy owing to infection. Patients were asymptomatic, and CT images showed integrated maxillary bone. Extrusion deformation of the sinus was improved to different extents after 6 to 24 months of follow-up.

Conclusions

Functional surgery for the treatment of DC in the maxillary sinus is a new approach and has the advantages of less surgical trauma, restoration of mucosa and bony wall, and more satisfactory results.

Pansinusitis with complete opacification of the paranasal sinuses (a). The bilateral nature of the disease is a sign of benignity whilst the rarefaction and thinning of the bony architecture (arrowed) suggests a more chronic process. Conversely unilateral opacification as demonstrated in (b) and (c) is suspicious for a malignant process. Notice the bony destruction of the inferior turbinate in both cases (arrowed in b and c), which can be difficult to discern from rarefaction (arrowed, a); however, this must be assessed in the context of unilateral disease. The imaging appearances in (b) and (c) are strikingly similar on both CT and MRI (not shown) and were only distinguishable on histology, which confirmed sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (b) and malignant melanoma (c). Incidental note is made of bilateral maxillary sinus mucus retention cysts (b), identifiable by their rounded, convex contour, and fluid density (arrowhead, b), in contrast to the concave maxillary mucosal thickening (arrowhead, c)

### Anterior clinoidal mucocele causing the orbital apex syndrome [^111CDjh9]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

The patient's visual acuity recovered remarkably at 1 month postoperation.

The rate of ACP pneumatisation is around 9.5%. Pneumatised patterns are classified according to the route of pneumatisation, that is via the optic strut, the anterior root, or both. Awareness of these variations in pneumatisation can prevent the destruction of the mucous membrane and the occurrence of surgical complications, such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage, following an anterior clinoidectomy.

Blockage of the drainage of the paranasal sinus for any reason can result in the accumulation of trapped secretions and mucocele. Owing to the proximity of the ACP to the optic nerve, patients with mucocele in this location often present with ocular symptoms.

Prompt surgical treatment is usually advocated to achieve best recovery. Surgical options include open surgical resection or transnasal endoscopic approach. The latter may be preferable to the cases where sinus cysts expand to the ACP. Nonetheless, if the mucocele is localised in the ACP, cystic resection by craniotomy may be safer, because the cystic area is over the optic nerve by transnasal endoscopic surgery. However, a history of sinusitis can aid in the diagnosis of a reversible form of optic neuritis, for which proper medical treatment with steroids and antibiotics may be preferable to surgical intervention.

Learning points

Awareness of anterior clinoid process (ACP) pneumatisation can prevent the occurrence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage as a result of an anterior clinoidectomy.
Patients with anterior clinoid mucocele presenting with visual loss who have a history of sinusitis receive only medical treatment with antibiotics and can thus avoid surgery.
An endoscopic approach may be preferable to cases where the sinus cysts expand to the ACP. However, if the mucocele localized in the ACP, the cystic resection by craniotomy or endoscopic trans-orbital approach may be safer, because the cystic area is over the optic nerve by transnasal endoscopic surgery.

### An atypical presentation of sinus mucopyocele in a pediatric cystic fibrosis patient [^113GagZY]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

It is always important to consider the adjacent sinuses when managing a patient with chronic periocular symptomatology, particularly allergic disease, even in pediatric cases. Of further important note is that in the specific condition of CF, mucoceles are more common and are more likely to be infected (ie, mucopyoceles), while in otherwise normal patients they are almost uniformly sterile. This is an important distinction for the patient with CF, since a chronic source of bacterial infection in the upper airway can become the source of infection spread to the lower airway, the latter infections being the major determinant of long-term outcome in such patients. Our case report highlights that chronic conjunctivitis in CF patients that is refractory to standard management should lead to a thorough evaluation including bacterial cultures and in some cases neuroimaging to determine and properly treat a putative underlying cause.

Mucocele

Mucocele presents as a complete opacification of one or more paranasal sinuses: most frequently, the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are filled with mucus and their walls are lined by normal-appearing respiratory epithelium (Fig. 7). It is often associated with bony wall expansion and focal osseous resorption. The pathogenesis of mucocele remains unclear, but an altered mucociliary clearance, cystic dilatation of the mucosal glands, and cystic development from embryonic remnants are all contributing factors, often in the context of chronic rhinosinusitis. Radiation therapy can also lead to an isolated sphenoid mucocele as a consequence of fibrous tissue formation obstructing the natural ostium. Mucocele appears as a completely mucous-filled and expanded sinus with a typical rim enhancement — sign of encapsulation — and lack of intralesional CE. CT density and MRI SI are variable, depending on the amount of water, mucus, and proteins. Most frequently, this lesion exhibits high water content with low density on CT, low SI on T1W, and high on T2W images; the high protein content results in high CT density, high SI on T1W, and low SI on T2W images. DWI and ADC are highly variable. When viscous protein-rich secretions are present, it may have very low ADC values (< 0.5 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s).

MRI shows a large mass (white arrows) displacing the ipsilateral internal carotid artery posteriorly (white dotted arrow) on T2W axial image (a) and the pituitary gland superiorly (white dotted arrow) on T2W sagittal image (b). Sphenoid sinus is markedly enlarged with mucous content and peripheral rim enhancement on axial (c) and sagittal (d) T1W fat-saturated CE images. No sign of superimposed infection or invasion of the adjacent structures is observed

Differential diagnoses: fungus ball, which shows very low or "dark" SI on T2W; sphenoid mucus retention cyst, a more common condition that shows similar SI and density but without completely filling the sinus, it does not determine bony changes nor it shows recognisable walls; sphenoid sinus inverted papilloma, a rare entity that shows — contrary to the mucocele — homogeneous CE, also of the internal component.

### Radiology quiz case: diagnosis… [^114CqfEW]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Diagnosis: Concha bullosa mucopyocele. Comment. A mucocele of the paranasal sinuses differs from typical mucoceles in that it is a true mucus retention cyst with an epithelial lining most often caused by obstruction. 1 This obstruction of normal mucociliary flow may be primary, or secondary to nasal polyps, facial trauma, sinus surgery, or tumors, and leads to an accumulation of mucoid fluid and the development of a slowly expanding mass. 1 These become symptomatic owing to impingement of surrounding structures and can cause local bony destruction and remodeling. Mucoceles that become secondarily infected are called mucopyoceles. Mucoceles and mucopyoceles most commonly occur in the frontal and ethmoid sinuses but rarely can develop in a concha bullosa.

### Benign cysts of the paranasal sinuses… [^113DtCmW]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

BENIGN cysts which are common in and peculiar to the paranasal sinuses are of two general types, those which take origin from the sinus mucosa and those which invade the maxillary sinuses from the teeth. Dermoids and cysts of the facial cleft, which frequently involve the nasal structures, rarely involve the paranasal sinuses proper. While the pathogenesis of some types of cysts found in the sinuses is fairly well understood, the development of others is not adequately explained, nor is the etiology of certain types established. A simple classification of these cysts is as follows: Cysts arising from the sinus mucosa Nonsecreting cysts Secreting cysts Retention cyst Mucocele Odontogenic cysts Follicular cysts Radicular cyst. This classification does not include cystic neoplasms; therefore adamantinomas, which may become cystic, are not included.

We report an unusual case of a displaced maxillary molar and associated dentigerous cyst within the maxillary sinus in an adolescent presenting as recurrent sinusitis. Although a rare cause of sinusitis in children, dentigerous cysts should be included in the differential diagnosis for causes of persistent or recurrent sinusitis in this age group. This report provides further evidence for obtaining imaging studies when managing pediatric sinusitis that does not respond to standard antibiotic therapy. We discuss management options for these lesions including the differential diagnoses and need for follow-up.

A 59-year-old man presented with unilateral nasal congestion and discharge. Clinical examination revealed a mass in the floor of the nasal cavity. Sinus CT indicated a retained tooth or a dermoid cyst. It was removed by endoscopic surgery. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of a retained tooth. At follow-up, the patient reported no nasal symptoms. A retained nasal tooth is rare, and the symptoms are variable. It can resemble other diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis. Surgical removal is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and eliminate symptoms.

Purpose-Objective. Vallecular cyst (VC) is a rare but potentially dangerous cause of stridor in neonates and infants. When seen in older children, VC is usually asymptomatic or there are only subtle symptoms. Here we describe the imaging findings of a rare and interesting case of VC in a 14-year-old boy and present relevant literature review.

Material and methods. A 14-year-old boy presented with dyspnea, progressive difficulty in swallowing of 4 days duration and coughing. There was no history of change in voice, earache or neck swelling. His vital signs and general condition were stable. Indirect laryngoscopy revealed a smooth non pulsatile mass occupying the base of the tongue. The vallecula, larynx and hypopharynx were not visible.

Results. Lateral neck X-ray revealed a smooth, soft-tissue lesion in the epiglottic area. Computed Tomography (CT) demonstrated a 3 cm × 2.9 cm midline, unilocular cystic mass extending from the tongue base to the level of the pyriform sinuses. The cyst arised from the right vallecula deforming the epiglottis. CT findings were indicative of an infected VC. Surgical treatment included aspiration and excision of the VC. Histologically, the cyst contained respiratory epithelium with mucous glands, with an external lining of squamous epithelium, and contained inflammatory fluid.

Discussion and conclusions. In our case, the infected VC caused severe airway obstruction, which is rare in older children and may require emergent tracheostomy.

### Orbitofrontal cholesterol granuloma masquerading as frontal sinus mucoceles: report of two cases [^115vDL5a]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Orbitofrontal cholesterol granuloma is rare, has a prediliction to the frontal sinuses. The location of disease is similar to the frontal sinus mucoceles. Therefore, the two patients were misdiagnosed before surgery and should be differentiated from them. Mucoceles are expansive cysts of mucus secreted by goblet cells interspersed in the ciliated mucosa. Although all paranasal sinuses are susceptible, the frontal and ethmoidal sinuses have the highest incidence. They can occur at any age, but most patients with mucoceles are between 40–60. Compromised sinus ventilation is the basic etiology of mucocele formation. The reasons may include (1) lesions of the nasal cavity and sinuses (or abnormal development), such as nasal polyps, sinus osteoma, and nasal septum deviation, and (2) inflammation or trauma leading to nasal adhesion and sinus obstruction. Mucoceles can compress and erode the surrounding bone wall, leading to absorption of the orbital wall as they grow gradually. Frontal sinus mucoceles frequently lead to the absorption of superior orbital wall, extending into the orbit, resulting in ocular symptoms and signs. The ocular manifestations are similar to orbital cholesterol granuloma. CT scan shows expansive growth of the mucoceles in the sinuses with absorption and destruction of adjacent bone and intrusion into surrounding structures. The clear boundary; the internal density is more uniform, mostly low density; a few can be equal or even high density. The density is dependent on the protein concentration of sac fluid. When protein concentration is high, density is high, whereas when protein concentration is low, density is low. Mucocele MRI signal intensity is quite distinct, and signal level may correlate with disease duration. Subsequently, patients with a short disease course have more moisture and hypointense presentation on T1WI. Patient with a long period of the disease has more protein, presenting hyperintense on T1WI.

### Maxillary sinus augmentation and implant installation in patients with pseudocysts and mucous retention cysts [^113ZGkW6]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Sinus augmentation at the site of PsC or MRC remains controversial because related studies mostly contain short follow-ups and are frequently deemed to be at high risk of bias. However, according to several studies, the removal of sinus cysts for successful sinus augmentation depends on the size of the antral cysts. In cases where PsCs or MRCs are small and asymptomatic and unlikely to cause obstruction of the sinus ostium after sinus augmentation, there may be no need to remove them before bone grafting and implant placement. However, if the cysts are large enough to occupy a sizable portion of the sinus space, then it may be necessary to address them before sinus augmentation to avoid potential complications of membrane perforations, sinus infection, acute maxillary sinusitis, orbital cellulitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. Thus, it is advisable to perform sinus augmentation only after excising the sinus cyst to eliminate the risk of potential adverse events in all cases.

Traditionally, a 2-stage protocol has been recommended in which sinus augmentation is performed after sinus cyst removal. Lin and colleagueselaborated on this approach by performing sinus grafting approximately three months after removing the PsC. Dental implant installation was conducted 6 months after sinus augmentation. While the study reported no complications, the need for 2 separate surgical procedures and the risks associated with sinus elevation due to scarring from the first surgery have led clinicians to consider a 1-stage protocol.

The 1-stage protocol involves performing both sinus cyst removal and augmentation in a single surgical procedure, followed by immediate or delayed installation of a dental implant. According to several studies, sinus cyst removal was accomplished by spontaneous drainage, aspiration, or enucleation. In a case report by Kara et al, a sinus augmentation procedure was performed without removing a PsC. The authors reported spontaneous drainage through the incision line 2 weeks after the surgery. In another case presented by the same authors, PsC was aspirated before sinus augmentation. No complications were observed and the results were satisfactory for both surgical approaches. In the same manner, Liu et alsuggested that, as PsC is not a true cyst and has a high likelihood of remaining unchanged over time, aspiration of the cyst fluid may be sufficient preparation for sinus augmentation. This method may also reduce the risk of damage to the sinus membrane, which is essential for normal maxillary sinus function.

### Maxillary mucosal cyst is not a manifestation of rhinosinusitis: results of a prospective three-dimensional CT study of ophthalmic patients [^111nN4VN]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Mucosal cysts in the maxillary antrum (MMC) are a common finding in imaging of the paranasal sinuses. Their significance remains in doubt and their prevalence in the general nonrhinitic population is unknown.

Objectives

To establish the prevalence of MMCs in patients without nasal complaints and identify any association with putative causative factors. To identify any correlation between objective radiologic evidence of chronic rhinosinusitis or dental disease and the presence of cysts.

Study Design

Prospective case series.

Methods

Computed tomography (CT) images from 257 patients undergoing scans of the orbits for ophthalmic reasons were entered into this study. Patients responded to a questionnaire prior to scanning inquiring about nasal complaints, treatment for nasal disorders, previous nasal injury, allergy, asthma, recent upper respiratory tract infection, and dental root disease of the upper jaw.

Results

Overall 35.6% of patients studied had radiologic evidence of at least one maxillary mucosal cyst. There was no association between the presence of cysts and subjective or objective evidence of sinus or dental disease. Specifically, there was no correlation between the presence of cysts and the total and ostiomeatal complex Lund-Mackay radiologic scores.

Conclusions

Maxillary mucosal cysts are prevalent in nonrhinitic patients and do not reflect sinus or dental disease. Their presence should not be an indication for sinus surgery.

### Paranasal sinus disease could be a reason for unsuccessful immunotherapy of inhalant allergy in children [^1164AGss]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of paranasal sinuses condition assessed in computed tomography on inhalant allergen desensitization effects.

Materials & Methods

Retrospective analysis of medical records of children undergoing allergen immunotherapy in outpatient otolaryngology clinic of University Children Hospital in Lublin was performed. Control group consisted of children who underwent allergen immunotherapy and obtained satisfying effects; study group consisted of children who did not experience significant improvement after desensitization therapy.

Results

Computed tomography of nose cavity and paranasal sinuses exposed numerous pathologic changes affecting both, control and study group. Blockage of ostiomeatal complex was twice more common in children who did not respond adequately to desensitization therapy. In our study group, radiological findings suggesting rhinosinusitis were found in 73% of patients, while retention cysts in maxillary sinuses were discovered in 27% of patients.

Conclusions

Pathological findings in paranasal sinuses in computed tomography may arise from uncontrolled allergic rhinitis. If chirurgical management is indicated, allergen immunotherapy should be postponed until total recovery from operational procedure and repeated.

### Thornwaldt cysts [^116DcEkC]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Thornwaldt cysts are rare and benign congenital cysts in the region of the pharyngeal bursa, formed by a communication between the notochord and the nasopharyngeal endoderm. They result from a mechanical obstruction, inflammation, or abscess of the pharyngeal bursa. They are superficial to the superior constrictor muscle and covered by the nasopharyngeal mucous membrane. Most cases are asymptomatic, and patients may rarely present symptoms such as nasal obstruction, foreign body sensation, hearing loss, and periodic halitosis. Therefore, they are often accidentally diagnosed on MRI. Asymptomatic cysts do not require treatment, whereas symptomatic cases require surgical intervention by endonasal or transoral approach. Marsupialization is the procedure of choice to avoid recurrences. The aim of this article is to present and discuss 2 cases of Thornwaldt cysts.

### Surgical management of paranasal sinus mucoceles: a long-term study of 60 cases [^1171Ju4M]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Paranasal sinus mucocele is a benign pseudocystic lesion, which may originate from any of the sinus cavities. Although the diagnosis may be suggested by the clinical presentation, CT is necessary to accurately analyze the regional anatomy and extent of the lesion. MRI is helpful in defining the limited unusual lesions occurring in critical areas. Standard treatment is surgical marsupialization, through endonasal sinus surgery, which offers a conservative, minimally invasive approach, and respects the sinus architecture and natural drainage. Our long-term experience with the endonasal endoscopic approach for the treatment of mucoceles led us to subsequently expand our indications to include most mucoceles, either as the sole approach or associated with an external approach. Comprising the surgical experience of two collaborating universities, this paper describes the indications for the endonasal surgical approach and the long-term postoperative followup.

### Imaging of the sublingual and submandibular spaces [^114h7Bh6]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Infectious/inflammatory

There are many causes, as well sequelae of inflammation and infection within the sublingual and submandibular spaces. Proper localisation of the abnormality is useful in determining aetiology.

Ranula

Among the differential diagnosis of cystic lesions in the sublingual space, a ranula is a commonly acquired lesion (Table 2). Traditionally considered as a post-inflammatory or post-traumatic sequela of glandular obstruction, a ranula is a mucous retention cyst arising from the sublingual or minor salivary glands.

Table 2
Distinguishing imaging features among cystic lesions in the sublingual and submandibular spaces

On imaging, ranulas have the typical appearance of cystic lesions with fluid attenuation on CT, hyperintensity on T2-weighted MR sequences, and are anechoic on ultrasound (Fig. 5). MRI in particular can serve to assess the size, content, location and extent of the lesion, especially in preoperative planning. Additionally, a ranula can be indistinguishable from an epidermoid cyst based on CT and sonography, but the absence of restricted diffusion on MRI establishes the diagnosis (Fig. 6).

Fig. 5
Simple ranula. a Axial and b coronal contrast-enhanced CT images demonstrate a well-circumscribed fluid attenuation lesion within the left sublingual space (*)

Fig. 6
Sublingual space ranula. a Axial T2-weighted MR image shows a high-signal lesion within the left sublingual space. b Axial diffusion-weighted image and c ADC map demonstrates lack of restricted diffusion, confirming the diagnosis (as opposed to an epidermoid, which would have restricted diffusion)

As the cystic lesion enlarges, it can "rupture" through its sublingual space boundaries and extend into the submandibular space through the posterior free edge of the mylohyoid muscle or mylohyoid boutonniere. Referred to as a plunging ranula, the herniated portion leaves behind a band-like portion of the cyst within the sublingual space, forming the "tail sign" (Fig. 7). On rare occasions, it can also extend into the parapharyngeal space or upper cervical soft tissues.

Axial contrast-enhanced CT images of the floor of the mouth illustrates a well-circumscribed cystic lesion predominantly occupying the left submandibular space causing a mass effect on the left submandibular gland (a, arrow).

### Maxillary sinus augmentation and implant installation in patients with pseudocysts and mucous retention cysts [^112PDKDJ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Three patients were included in the case reports. All patients enrolled in this study underwent either aspiration or cyst removal with or without sinus augmentation before implant installation at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Seoul National University Dental Hospital, Seoul, Korea. Particulate xenogenic bone graft (bovine bone mineral, Bio-Oss; Geistlich Pharma AG) and a resorbable xenogenic collagen membrane (Bio-Gide; Geistlich Pharma AG) were used for sinus augmentation.

Classifications of Maxillary Sinus Cysts

Cystic lesions in the maxillary sinus are generally classified into 3 types: PsC, MRC, and true sinus mucocele. Of these, patients with PsC and MRC that were not true cysts were included in this study and classified into one of 3 types.

The first type is a nonsecreting cyst, the PsC type that is a focal accumulation of inflammatory exudate and has no epithelial lining. In this case, most of the antral mucosa is lifted from the bone, allowing the spontaneous release of exudate during sinus augmentation (type 1: PsC type). Radiologically, it initially presents as mucosal thickening with a uniform radiodensity and clear demarcations. Normally, there are no symptoms and no specific treatment is required.

The second and third types are MRC, secreting cysts caused by blockage and dilatation of ducts of the seromucinous glands. Radiologically, MRC appears as a well-defined dome-shaped and homogenous mass within the maxillary sinus. Moreover, MRC does not exhibit signs of bony erosion or communication with a tooth root. These distinguishing features allow for differentiation between true mucoceles and MRC within the sinus. These cases are classified based on size as type 2 with size ≤ 20 mm and type 3 with size > 20 mm. This size cutoff was chosen because of its tendency to increase in the size of the cystic lesion. Because the cysts are lined with epithelium, they do not disappear or shrink naturally during surgery and must be aspirated or completely removed before sinus augmentation.

Imaging and complications awareness — Be aware that a tumor or an infection of the sphenoid sinus may involve adjacent structures such as the optic nerve, cavernous sinus, and carotid artery (Rec, C). Perform a CT scan when imaging of the sinuses is indicated; it is required before surgical intervention or when complications of rhinosinusitis are suspected (StrRec, A). Radiographic imaging is recommended in a patient with unilateral CRS to exclude a tumor or anatomic defect or foreign body (Rec, C). Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if soft tissue resolution is required, such as with a suspected tumor or in patients with complications; if a CT scan visualizes a soft tissue mass, then the patient should be referred to an ear, nose, and throat physician (Rec, B).

### Maxillary sinus augmentation and implant installation in patients with pseudocysts and mucous retention cysts [^111jCph9]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

MRC and PsC may be untreated because of their tendency to be stationary. However, according to a study conducted by Wang et al, almost 30% of MRC grew after a follow-up period ranging from 38 to 102 months. Thus, it may be advisable to remove MRC before or during a sinus grafting procedure, or it is likely that the ostium will become blocked by the growing cyst. In the same manner, the presence of a small PsC is rarely a contraindication for sinus grafting, but a large PsC that occupies one-third of the sinus volume may impede normal sinus function after sinus surgery. Therefore, debates remain on sinus augmentation near an MRC or PsC.

There is a difference between PsC and MRC regarding a cystic epithelium lining. Due to this difference, during sinus augmentation, these 2 conditions require different treatments. With MRC, it has been reported that 42% remained unchanged, 15% increased in size, and 43% decreased in size or disappeared. An initial size > 20 mm and bilateral location were significant predictors for increasing the size of the cystic lesion. Therefore, treatment should be based on the categorization of maxillary cystic lesions into PsC, MRC smaller than 20 mm, and MRC larger than 20 mm in size.

In this study, we report cases of treatment for PsC and MRC before sinus augmentation and implant installation, along with an analysis of outcomes.

### What's that smell? A pictorial review of the olfactory pathways and imaging assessment of the myriad pathologies that can affect them [^114CiA9s]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

MRI assists in differentiation between solid soft tissue elements of a tumour and the fluid characteristics of secretions. Secretions are T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense, whereas primary sinonasal neoplasms are usually T2 intermediate- or less commonly T2 hyperintense- and T1 hypointense (Fig. 5). Post-contrast MR imaging aids in delineation of sinonasal soft tissue masses. Solid components of sinonasal tumours enhance, whilst the haemorrhagic, necrotic, or cystic components do not. Sinonasal tumours can be differentiated from thickened mucosa (peripheral enhancement) and secretions (which do not enhance) based on their enhancement patterns (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Axial MRI images of a 66-year-old female patient with right maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). She presented with symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis for which a CT sinuses was performed (not shown) demonstrating unilateral maxillary sinus disease, suspicious for malignancy. Axial T2 weighted image (a) exhibits an isointense soft tissue lesion (white arrowhead) permeating and extending through the right maxillary sinus, which can be differentiated from the high T2 signal normal mucosa (arrow). Both the SCC (white arrowhead) and normal mucosa (arrow) are hypointense on T1W imaging (b). On T1W post-contrast imaging (c), the lesion demonstrates less enhancement (white arrowhead) compared to the adjacent hyperenhancing sinonasal mucosa (arrow) (c). Transpatial spread into the right pterygopalatine fossa is also identifiable on all sequences (black arrowheads with white outline)

MRI is best suited for demonstrating any transpatial spread of sinonasal disease, including intracranial spread. This includes perineural spread of disease, seen particularly in adenoid cystic carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. This is demonstrated on MRI as nerve thickening and/or enhancement, and loss of perineural fat. Widening of the neural foramina may also be seen, especially foramina relating to branches of the trigeminal nerve. Orbital and anterior skull base invasion in both malignant and infective conditions are also best seen on MRI. On coronal imaging, loss of the normal low signal anterior skull base cortical margin, loss of the normal T1 hyperintense marrow signal, and frank breach of the anterior cranial fossa on post-contrast T1WI (Fig. 6) are sensitive indicators of bone infiltration and transcalvarial spread of disease.

### Destructive cysts of the maxillary sinus affecting the orbit… [^117KYJD6]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Symptomatic maxillary sinus cysts are diagnosed less frequently than similar cysts of the frontal and ethmoidal sinuses and are rarely reported in the ophthalmic literature. Patients with cysts of the maxillary sinus may present to the ophthalmologist with proptosis, enophthalmos, diplopia, ptosis, epiphora, and, rarely, decreased visual acuity. Four patients with maxillary sinus mucoceles are presented; one of these patients had a concurrent retention cyst in the orbit. Clinical history, radiologic findings, and histopathologic mechanisms are discussed. Mucocele is a recognized complication of the Caldwell-Luc procedure and midface trauma. Blockage of the sinus ostia was the cause previously proposed to explain antral mucocele development. Clinical and histopathologic features may support more than one single mechanism for the pathogenesis of maxillary sinus cysts.

Maxillary sinus mucocele or retention cysts should be considered in the differential diagnosis of exophthalmos or enophthalmos following blowout fracture of the orbital floor.

### Postoperative maxillary cyst after maxillary sinus augmentation [^116TmPSL]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The posterior edentulous maxilla is a critical anatomic region for dental implant therapy. Because of severe alveolar bone resorption and maxillary sinus pneumatization, low bone volume is often presented clinically. Although maxillary sinus augmentation has been developed to promote bone reconstruction and oral rehabilitation, complications have been reported. Possible complications include paranasal sinusitis, loss of the graft, and displacement of an implant into the antrum. In this study, we present an observed rare complication of maxillary sinus augmentation, a postoperative maxillary cyst that occurred 10 years after treatment.

### Giant mucocele of the frontal sinus [^116cttCx]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Giant mucocele of the frontal sinus is a rare pathology of benign entity caused by retention of mucous secretions in the sinus. It may expand and erode the surrounding structures such as bones and cerebral parenchyma. The authors describe a patient with frontal giant mucocele involving the orbit, the ethmoid, and intracranial portion of the dura. The main presenting symptoms were diplopia and proptosis. A computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging were performed to permit differential diagnosis from other pathologies such as ossifying fibroma, fibrous dysplasia, and other neoplasms. A single stage maxillofacial and neurosurgical approach to treatment was taken consisting in the removal of the mucocele and reconstruction of the eroded bones with cranial bone grafts. The dura was repaired with temporalis muscle fascia sealed with fibrin glue. Two years after surgery, the patient shows no recurrence and satisfactory morphologic and functional results.

### Maxillary sinus augmentation and implant installation in patients with pseudocysts and mucous retention cysts [^114zF7hN]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

With the advent of implant procedures, bone augmentation has been studied to establish the base for endosseous implant placement in cases of severe atrophic alveolar processes. The height of both maxillary alveolar processes is affected by a prolonged edentulous state involving atrophic changes of the alveolar process over time. Together with atrophic bone, pneumatization of the maxillary sinus is also of great concern when planning to install implants in the posterior area of the maxilla. To overcome such difficulty, sinus augmentation is routinely conducted with satisfactory results. Unfortunately, another challenge for sinus augmentation before implant installation involving pathologic changes in the sinus is maxillary sinus cysts.

Although the nomenclature and pathogenesis of maxillary sinus cysts have largely been disputed, many researchers support classification into 3 groups: antral pseudocyst (PsC), mucous retention cyst (MRC), and true sinus mucocele. A PsC is not lined with epithelium but is composed of inflammatory exudate accumulation between the antral mucosa and the underlying bone. Unlike PsC, MRC, and mucoceles of the maxillary sinus are lined with epithelium. Retention cysts of the maxillary sinus are caused by blockage and dilatation of ducts of the seromucinous gland and are also lined with epithelium. The mucous retention cyst can be further classified into extravasation, luminal, and mixed type. Mucoceles of the maxillary sinus are expanding, destructive lesions that can perforate the walls of the sinus if not treated. The pathogenesis is impaired drainage through the ostium due to inflammation, allergies, malignant disease, or sinus surgery.

### Do maxillary sinus retention cysts reflect obstructive sinus phenomena? [^114vBB6T]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Nine cases demonstrated bilateral cysts, allowing 42 unilateral cases to be analyzed, with the nondiseased side as a control. Cases with bilateral RCs were eliminated from the remaining analysis. The mean cyst size was 1. 56 cm, and cysts were most commonly located inferiorly within the sinus. The specific location of the maxillary sinus RCs was as follows: Maxillary sinus RCs are classically described as dome-shaped lesions originating from the mucosa within the maxillary sinus. These cysts make up one of the most common incidental findings within the paranasal sinuses. Several studies3–5 have documented incidences ranging from 4. 3% to
8. 7% by plain radiography in the general patient population. It would appear that maxillary sinus RCs occur somewhat more frequently in patients with symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis than in asymptomatic patients.

Obstruction of the OMC is believed to be a critical step in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis. 8 Much of the endoscopic treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis is mainly directed at addressing disease involving the OMC. Obstruction of the OMC may result in mucosal thickening, air fluid levels, complete opacification, or other pathological findings within the maxillary sinus. Similarly, obstruction may also promote the formation of mucosal RCs, although such a relation has been difficult to demonstrate.
9. The pathogenesis of maxillary sinus RCs remains unclear. Some studies9 propose a postobstructive or allergic cause for these cysts. There is some evidence that these cysts may progressively enlarge and culminate in the form of an antrochoanal polyp. 10 Other reports11 have implicated barotrauma in the genesis of these cysts. It is possible that the initial event leading to the formation of a maxillary sinus RC is OMC obstruction.

After the initial formation of the cyst, the OMC may subsequently become patent, while the cyst may persist. Therefore, it is possible that OMC obstruction may yet be implicated in the formation of RC. Only a longitudinal study on the evolution of these cysts would be able to completely exclude this possibility. Interestingly, this study did find cases in which RCs arose in sinuses with accessory or surgically augmented maxillary sinus ostia, further suggesting that OMC obstruction is not linked to cyst formation.

### Correlation between presumed sinusitis-induced pain and paranasal sinus computed tomographic findings [^113zCFCb]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The correlation between facial and/or head pain in patients clinically suspected of having sinusitis and actual localized findings on sinus computed tomographic (CT) imaging are poorly understood.

Objective

To prospectively evaluate the relationship of paranasal sinus pain symptoms with CT imaging.

Methods

Two hundred consecutive patients referred by otolaryngologists and internists for CT of the paranasal sinuses participated by completing a questionnaire immediately before undergoing CT. Three radiologists blinded to the patients' responses scored the degree of air/fluid level, mucosal thickening, bony reaction, and mucus retention cysts using a graded scale of severity (0 to 3 points). The osteomeatal complexes and nasolacrimal ducts were also evaluated for patency. Bivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between patients' localized symptoms and CT findings in the respective sinus.

Results

One hundred sixty-three patients (82%) reported having some form of facial pain or headache. The right temple/forehead was the most frequently reported region of maximal pain. On CT imaging the maxillary sinus was the most frequently involved sinus. Bivariate analysis failed to show any relationship between patient symptoms and findings on CT. Patients with a normal CT reported a mean 5.88 sites of facial or head pain versus 5.45 sites for patients with an abnormal CT.

Conclusions

Patient-based responses of sinonasal pain symptoms fail to correlate with findings in the respective sinuses. CT should therefore be reserved for delineating the anatomy and degree of sinus disease before surgical intervention.

### Sinonasal outcome scores and imaging: a concurrent assessment of factors influencing their association [^112YHj6B]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The overall discriminatory ability of validated instrument scores for computed tomography (CT) findings of chronic rhinosinusitis has limitations and may be modified by multiple factors. To support optimal methods for assessment, we studied which factors could influence this relationship, including the concurrent impact of multiple discrete CT scoring mechanisms, colocalized imaging findings, and nasal comorbid conditions.

Study Design

Observational outcomes study.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Methods

Patients with sinonasal complaints who completed the 22-item Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) and underwent CT were included. Multivariate ordinal regression was utilized to assess associations. CT data were quantified with the Lund-Mackay system, Zinreich system, and a direct measure of maximal mucosal thickness. The impact of incidental findings (mucous retention cysts, periapical dental disease) and nasal comorbid conditions was also assessed.

Results

A total of 233 patients were included. SNOT-22 nasal scores were significantly associated with CT results when those with incidental findings were excluded, regardless of the radiologic scoring mechanism utilized: Lund-Mackay regression coefficient, 0.321 (P = 0.046); Zinreich, 0.340 (P = 0.033); and maximum mucosal thickness, 0.316 (P = 0.040). This relationship subsided when incidental findings were present. SNOT-22 overall scores, sleep scores, and psychological domain scores had no significant association with imaging results, regardless of radiologic scoring system utilized. Nasal comorbid conditions had inconsistent associations.

Conclusions

SNOT-22 nasal domain scores were associated with all 3 radiologic scoring systems when incidental findings were absent but not when they were present. Delineating the presence or absence of these colocalized findings affected the relationship between SNOT-22 scores and radiological results, beyond other concurrent factors.

### Paranasal sinus opacification in headache sufferers: a population-based imaging study (the HUNT study-MRI) [^116Wun6h]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Background The association between headache and paranasal sinus disease is still unclear. Because of symptom overlap, the two conditions are not easily studied on the basis of symptoms alone. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether paranasal sinus opacification on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was associated with migraine, tension-type headache (TTH) or unclassified headache. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of 844 randomly selected participants (442 women, age range 50–65 years, mean age 57.7 years). Based on 14 headache questions, participants were allocated to four mutually exclusive groups: migraine, TTH, unclassified headache or headache free. On MRI, opacifications as mucosal thickening, polyps/retention cysts and fluid in the five paired sinuses were measured and recorded if ≥ 1mm. For each participant, opacification thickness was summed for each sinus and, in addition, a total sum of all sinuses was calculated. Opacification in each sinus was compared between headache-free participants and the headache groups using non-parametric tests, and the total sum was compared by logistical regression. Results No significant association was found between paranasal sinus opacification and headache in general, nor when headache was differentiated into migraine, TTH and unclassified headache. This was also true in separate analyses of mucosal thickening and fluid and of opacification from each paranasal sinus. Conclusion Migraine, TTH and unclassified headache were found not to be associated with an increased degree of paranasal sinus opacification at MRI.

### A case of cutaneous bronchogenic cyst over the left scapula [^115L1A6v]. The Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Bronchogenic cyst is noted shortly after birth or in early childhood and usually presents as a swelling or draining sinus in the presternal area. Its origin and pathogenesis can be explained as a developmental anomaly of the tracheobronchial buds from the primitive foregut. The patient was a 4-year-old boy with a child-fist-sized soft mass over his left scapula, which had been detected at birth and had been gradually growing. Grossly, it appeared to be a simple cyst with clear mucoid fluid. Histopathological study demonstrated a unilocular cyst composed of ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelia, interspersed goblet cells, smooth muscles, and mucous glands on the cyst wall, which are features compatible with cutaneous bronchogenic cyst.

### Symptomatic maxillary sinus retention cysts: should they be removed? [^115cKi6h]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Recently, endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) okay? has become the surgical procedure of choice for removing retention cysts from the maxillary sinus. The aim of our study was to determine the relationship between symptomatic relief and ESS with or without endoscopic excision of maxillary cysts.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized study.

Methods

Inclusion criteria were symptomatic maxillary cysts filling at least 50% of the sinus space. We conducted a prospective, randomized study comprising 80 patients. Of the patients, 41 underwent endoscopic ethmoidectomy, middle meatus antrostomy, and excision of the cysts (group A); and 39 underwent ethmoidectomy and antrostomy without cyst detachment (group B). During follow-up an attempt was made to correlate symptomatic failure with type of surgery, computed tomography (CT) score, cyst size, and ratio of cyst size/antral size.

Results

Symptomatic failure occurred in nine cases: four in the group A and five in group B. There was no relationship between success rates and type of surgery, CT score, cyst size, and ratio of cyst size/antral size.

Conclusions

Endoscopic ethmoidectomy and middle meatus antrostomy without cyst detachment yielded similar outcomes with cyst extirpation through the antrostomy. Our treatment should be aimed in restoring ventilation and drainage of the dependent maxillary sinus.

### Characterization of sinonasal lesions on CT, MRI, and PET / CT [^1176WWRU]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis of sinonasal lesions includes benign and malignant disease. Current radiologic diagnosis depends on the complementary roles of CT and MRI. PET/CT has been widely utilized for diagnosis and staging of various types of tumors as well as assessing treatment response. This article summarizes distinguishing radiologic characteristics of sinonasal disease, including lesions that are FDG avid (squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, inverted papilloma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and sinusitis), lesions that express somatostatin receptors (meningioma, esthesioneuroblastoma, and juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma), and lesions that are not FDG avid (mucocele, mucus retention cyst, and sinus meningoencephalocele). Furthermore, PET/MRI may better facilitate the diagnosis of sinonasal disease.

### Evaluation of anatomical variations of the maxillary sinus in patients with and without mucous retention cyst [^1176aBpX]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives: Mucous retention cyst (MRC) is a benign and self-limited lesion that can be caused by many risk factors, including anatomical variations of the sinonasal region. This study aims to investigate the relationship between anatomical variations and the presence of MRC. Materials and Methods: In total, 2109 sinonasal cone beam computed tomography images were evaluated for the presence of MRC, and the sinonasal anatomical regions such as the osteomeatal complex (OMC), infundibulum length, ostium height, the diameter of the ostium, the presence of accessory ostium, concha bullosa, and mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses. Shapiro-Wilk normality test, independent sample t-test, and chi-square test were used for statistical analysis, and P < .05 was considered significant. Results: The prevalence of MRC was 119 (5.6%) cases. The average diameter of the ostium in cases with and without MRC was 0.49 ± 0.41 mm and 0.99 ± 0.76 mm, respectively, which showed a significant inverse relationship(P < .001). A significant relationship was found between the septum deviation, the ostium height, the concha bullosa, and the accessory ostium with the presence of MRC (P < .001). Conclusions: Sinonasal anatomical variations such as ostium diameter, ostium height, septal deviation, the presence of accessory ostium, and concha bullosa can cause MRC development, and considering that surgery may be necessary in some cases; this could be of great importance to clinicians and surgeons for treatment and prevention of development or recurrence of these pseudocysts in patients.

### Unilateral sinonasal symptoms [^115JEMRT]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to describe the pathology in patients with unilateral sinonasal symptoms and to identify variables that may predict neoplastic pathology.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was completed on 207 consecutive patients with sinonasal symptoms, most of whom underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery from 2005 to 2008. Of the charts reviewed, 63 patients had unilateral sinonasal symptoms with unilateral opacification of paranasal sinus computed tomography scans. Presenting symptoms and radiographic, surgical, and pathologic findings were analyzed.

Results

All 63 patients underwent surgical management for their symptoms, and specimens were sent for pathologic evaluation. There were 12 cases of antrochoanal polyp, 14 of nasal polyposis, 8 of chronic rhinosinusitis, 7 of concha bullosa, 4 of retention cyst in maxillary sinus, 2 of mucocele, 3 of oroantral originated cyst, and 13 cases of benign or malign neoplastic diseases, some of which were extremely rare cases such as pleomorphic adenoma, ameloblastoma, schwannoma, myxoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Nasal discharge was more common in inflammatory than neoplastic disease. However, epistaxis was more common in neoplastic disease.

Conclusions

A wide variety of pathologic findings present with unilateral sinonasal symptoms. A careful history, examination, and radiographic studies can often determine the responsible disease process. Histologic confirmation remains obligatory for diagnosis. There are also some rare cases, which should be considered in differential diagnosis of unilateral polyp or mass lesion on nasoendoscopy.

### Maxillary sinus angiomyolipoma: a case report and overview [^112AExWP]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Otolaryngologists are called upon to evaluate and treat sinonasal masses discovered incidentally on imaging studies. Although common conditions such as sinonasal polyps and mucus retention cysts predominate, it is prudent practice to formulate a differential diagnosis to identify unusual conditions. We present a case of a maxillary sinus mass in a 78-year-old man that was discovered incidentally on brain imaging and subsequently identified on biopsy as an angiomyolipoma (AML). AMLs are benign hamartomatous tumors that rarely occur in extrarenal locations. Only a few cases have been reported in the nasal cavity. We believe our case represents the first reported instance of AML arising within a maxillary sinus. Identification of intratumoral fat within the mass on imaging studies may suggest the diagnosis of AML preoperatively. Close interdisciplinary collaboration among the otorhinolaryngology, radiology, and pathology services is beneficial for patient management. We report this case to raise awareness that AML can arise in this previously unreported location. Moreover, we wish to emphasize that AML should be considered in the differential diagnosis when imaging studies demonstrate a well-defined, heterogeneous, fat-containing solitary mass in the nasal cavity or maxillary sinus.

### Nasopharyngeal cyst in an adolescent boy: differential diagnosis-embryological and anatomical considerations [^115ZSsCC]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

In the current article, we present a case of an adolescent boy with a nasopharyngeal cyst that induced nasal and Eustachian tube obstruction. Nasopharyngeal cysts can be found incidentally during imaging examinations such as MRI; however, a symptomatic nasopharyngeal cyst is a rare finding in the paediatric population. The cyst was treated successfully by marsupialisation, and the histological diagnosis revealed an adenoidal retention cyst. The differential diagnosis of a nasopharyngeal cyst is always challenging since developmental cysts such as Rathke's pouch cysts, Torwaldt's and branchial cleft cysts may be encountered at the nasopharynx. The current article also intends to present the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to a nasopharyngeal cyst, emphasising anatomical and embryological considerations that address its differential diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^115AK4tY]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging for rhinosinusitis — indications and limitations are summarized as follows: The major indication of sinus MRI is to evaluate the complications related to sinus disease or to determine the presence and map the location of a sinus tumor, and MRI provides superior imaging of the adjacent soft tissues compared with CT owing to improved soft tissue resolution. Magnetic resonance imaging should not be performed to evaluate for uncomplicated sinus inflammatory disease; the role is reserved for CT. Although MRI may display even the most subtle sinus mucosal thickening, the trace sinus mucosal thickening that can be observed with MRI is often not clinically relevant, and more serious rhinosinusitis, including excessively inspissated sinus disease and even extensive fungal disease, may not be seen at MRI. For differentiating a mucocele from a tumor, an MRI can easily differentiate between a mucocele and a tumor; although a mucocele may enhance along its periphery at MRI, it does not enhance within its center, and MRI is preferred for this purpose.

### Spontaneous transethmoidal meningoencephalocele presenting in the form of recurrent unilateral nasal discharge: discussion of the diagnosis and endoscopic surgical management [^114s5Rv4]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 56-year-old Caucasian woman presented with an intermittent unilateral rhinorrhea on the right side for several months associated with chronic ipsilateral fronto-temporal headaches. She was in good health and had no significant medical background or history of head trauma or any nasal or para-nasal sinuses surgery. She underwent a neurological evaluation and the diagnosis of chronic tension headaches with migraines component was made. A medical treatment was tried without any symptom improvement.

Due to the unfavourable evolution, she underwent a head CT scan (figure 1A, B) and MRI (figure 1C, D). These radiological examinations showed a cystic mass located in the anterior ethmoidal cells on the right side with an adjacent skull base bony defect. There were no other intracranial mass or other lesions. The rest of the nasal cavity and sinuses showed no other anomalies.

Figure 1
(A) Coronal CT scan view shows the lesion with a bony defect at the level of the skull base on the right side. (B) Sagittal CT scan view shows the lesion on the anterior ethmoid cells in the right side with a skull base defect at this level. (C) MRI imaging on T2 sequence fat sat, axial view shows the cystic lesion on the anterior right ethmoid. (D) MRI imaging on T2 sequence Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), coronal view shows the cystic lesion on the anterior right ethmoid. (E) Intraoperative three-dimensional imaging guided navigation system view shows the accurate localisation of the lesion. (F) Intraoperative endoscopic view shows the herniated sac of brain parenchyma at the level of the anterior ethmoid in the right side.

The patient was referred to the ear, nose and throat department for evaluation. Her initial complaint was an intermittent right-sided rhinorrhea without nasal obstruction or any other symptoms. The fiberoptic endoscopic examination of the nose showed a normal appearance of the nasal mucosa, mild and non-obstructive septal deviation, no evidence of intranasal mass or polyps. There was no spontaneous right-sided rhinorrhea but the Dandy manoeuvre (head bent forward and downwards for a few minutes) triggered a right-sided clear rhinorrhea and the analysis of this nasal liquid was positive for beta-2 transferrin protein.

According to these clinical and radiological findings, the diagnosis of a transethmoidal meningoencephalocele was retained. After discussion with the patient, the decision of a combined otorhinolaryngology and neurosurgery management was made.

### A rare cause of wheezing in infancy [^111eBRgU]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

We describe an infant with recurrent wheezing and cough caused by an oropharyngeal cyst. Mucosal oropharyngeal cysts arise from obstruction or traumatic severance of a duct in a minor salivary gland, which leads to retention of mucous secretion. The mucosal cyst of the oropharynx is a rare cause of respiratory distress in the infants. The clinical symptoms depend on the size, shape, and location of the cyst.

### Mucous retention cyst of temporal bone: a mimic of cholesteatoma on DW-MRI [^115SoyYC]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

Non-EPI DW imaging is increasingly being used as a sensitive sequence in detecting cholesteatomas especially if CT findings are not confirmatory. Cholesteatoma appears as a hyperintense focus on DWI. We present two cases of mucous retention cysts in the mastoid temporal bone/middle ear cavity, which present as hyperintense on non-EPI DWI and potentially may mimic cholesteatomas. Differentiating between the two conditions is important, as surgery can be avoided in mucous retention cysts. We have also discussed ways to differentiate between these two conditions on MRI. To our knowledge, this entity is not reported previously.
