## Question

How do a manage an outpatient copd exacerbation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage an outpatient COPD exacerbation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should assess severity and decide on outpatient versus inpatient care. Next, I will initiate core pharmacologic therapy, including bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids. After that, I need to decide whether antibiotics are indicated and, if so, which agent and duration. I will then implement non-pharmacologic measures, arrange follow-up and monitoring, and finally update maintenance therapy and prevention strategies, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics, because not every worsening of dyspnea in a patient with COPD is an exacerbation. I need to check for pneumonia, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, and upper airway dysfunction, and I should verify that symptoms are beyond day-to-day variation and acute in onset, typically within 14 days, with increased dyspnea and/or cough and sputum changes, while remembering that exacerbations are heterogeneous and often inflammatory in nature [^111HmkaQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about outpatient management until I assess severity. I should confirm that there is no respiratory failure, altered mental status, hemodynamic instability, inability to eat or sleep due to dyspnea, or inability to care for self, and I should check for high-risk comorbidities or uncertain diagnosis, because any of these would push me toward ED evaluation or hospitalization rather than outpatient care [^113faPdU] [^117UWvwx].

> Next, I should review the core pharmacologic foundation: short-acting inhaled bronchodilators are first-line for acute relief, and I need to ensure technique with MDI plus spacer or use a nebulizer if needed. I should also initiate or optimize long-acting bronchodilators as soon as feasible during or immediately after the acute episode to restore baseline control and reduce relapse risk, aligning with GOLD's emphasis on prompt bronchodilation and early maintenance therapy [^116SWGkW] [^117UWvwx].

> I will now examine the role of systemic corticosteroids. A short course of oral prednisone or prednisolone, typically 40 mg daily for 5 days without taper, improves lung function, oxygenation, and short-term outcomes and shortens recovery, and I should remember that longer courses do not add benefit and increase adverse effects, so I need to keep it short and avoid unnecessary repeats [^116SWGkW] [^117HDGBN].

> Wait, let me verify the antibiotic decision, because this is where nuance matters. Antibiotics are not routinely indicated for mild outpatient exacerbations, but I should consider them when there are cardinal bacterial features such as increased sputum purulence with increased dyspnea and sputum volume, or when there is fever, leukocytosis, or radiographic pneumonia, and I should also weigh patient-specific risks like older age, frequent exacerbations, or severe airflow limitation, recognizing that sputum purulence has reasonable sensitivity for high bacterial load and that CRP-guided strategies can safely reduce unnecessary prescribing in primary care [^115KNG56] [^117KVkjS] [^111FLWvf].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought antibiotics clearly reduce treatment failure across all outpatient settings, but I should double-check the magnitude and consistency. Cochrane analyses suggest a modest reduction in treatment failure in outpatients, yet heterogeneity is high and some contemporary outpatient trials, including the doxycycline RCT, show no meaningful benefit on time to next exacerbation when added to steroids, so I need to individualize decisions and avoid reflexive prescribing, especially in mild cases [^112f7miJ] [^1171opD5] [^111FLWvf].

> If antibiotics are indicated, I should confirm the shortest effective course. A 5-day regimen is sufficient for most outpatients, with amoxicillin-clavulanate, doxycycline, or a macrolide as reasonable first-line choices depending on local resistance and comorbidities, and I should avoid fluoroquinolones unless there are specific risk factors or intolerance, keeping the regimen narrow and time-limited to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^115KNG56] [^114ARoyi].

> Let me consider non-pharmacologic measures that meaningfully affect outcomes. I need to ensure smoking cessation support, vaccination updates including influenza and pneumococcal, and structured follow-up within about a week to reassess symptoms, inhaler technique, and adherence, and I should provide or update a written action plan with clear red flags and medication instructions, because action plans with support reduce ED visits and hospitalizations even though they may increase short-term use of steroids and antibiotics, which is acceptable if it prevents deterioration [^116ukGMT] [^1159gnB3] [^113SnvuS].

> I should confirm oxygen needs pragmatically. Routine oxygen is not indicated for stable outpatients without hypoxemia, but if SpO2 is below about 90% on room air or the patient is in respiratory distress, I should arrange supplemental oxygen and escalate care as needed, and I need to remember that new or worsening hypoxia is a red flag for hospitalization rather than continued outpatient management [^113SnvuS] [^117WbJ1E].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring. Within 48 hours to 1 week, I will reassess dyspnea, cough, sputum, activity tolerance, and vitals, and I should double-check inhaler technique and adherence, because poor technique is a common cause of treatment failure. If there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen, I should reconsider the diagnosis, look for complications like pneumonia or thromboembolism, and reassess the need for antibiotics or hospitalization, documenting the exacerbation in the problem list for future risk stratification [^117UWvwx].

> Hold on, I should verify how this exacerbation affects long-term therapy. One moderate exacerbation treated with steroids is enough to shift risk and often warrants escalation of maintenance therapy, so I should reassess symptoms and exacerbation history and consider stepping up to LAMA+LABA, and if exacerbations continue or eosinophils are elevated, add ICS to the regimen, while also planning pulmonary rehabilitation and ensuring vaccinations are current to reduce future risk [^114Bb3oo] [^116bpGsh] [^113e3PwG].

> Finally, I need to ensure prevention strategies are embedded. I should reinforce smoking cessation, vaccination, exercise, and nutrition, arrange pulmonary rehabilitation when feasible, and consider self-management education with case management for high-risk patients, because these interventions reduce hospitalizations and improve quality of life, and I should document the exacerbation frequency to guide ongoing risk categorization and therapy adjustments [^1139h3fi] [^113e3PwG] [^115JsdFV].

Outpatient COPD exacerbations are best managed with a **short-acting bronchodilator** (SABA ± SAMA) for rapid relief [^116SWGkW], plus a **short course of oral corticosteroids** (prednisone 40 mg daily for 5 days) to improve lung function and reduce relapse risk [^116SWGkW]. Antibiotics are reserved for patients with increased sputum purulence, volume, or dyspnea, or with a history of frequent exacerbations; if used, a 5-day course is sufficient [^115KNG56] [^114ARoyi]. Monitor for clinical deterioration, ensure inhaler technique is correct, and arrange follow-up within 2–7 days; **escalate care** for hypoxemia (SpO₂ < 90%), respiratory failure, or failure to improve.

---

## Initial assessment and severity classification

During initial assessment, **confirm the diagnosis** by identifying increased dyspnea, cough, and/or sputum beyond normal variation, and consider pneumonia, heart failure, and pulmonary embolism in the differential [^111HmkaQ]. Classify severity as **mild** (increased symptoms without severe distress), **moderate** (requiring antibiotics and/or systemic corticosteroids), or **severe** (requiring hospitalization or emergency care) [^115mEftW] [^111xYCbJ].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Bronchodilators

Use **short-acting bronchodilators** — SABA (e.g. albuterol) ± SAMA (e.g. ipratropium) — as first-line therapy for rapid symptom relief [^116SWGkW]. Initiate or optimize **long-acting bronchodilators** (LABA and/or LAMA) once the acute episode stabilizes to reduce future exacerbation risk [^116SWGkW].

---

### Systemic corticosteroids

- **Indication**: Moderate-to-severe exacerbations to improve lung function, oxygenation, and shorten recovery [^116SWGkW].
- **Regimen**: Prednisone 40 mg orally once daily for 5 days; no taper needed for short courses [^113rXDqd].
- **Benefits**: Reduced treatment failure, relapse, and hospitalization risk [^117HDGBN].

---

### Antibiotics

- **Indication**: Increased sputum purulence, volume, or dyspnea, or history of frequent exacerbations [^115KNG56].
- **Regimen**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate, doxycycline, or macrolide (azithromycin) for 5 days [^115KNG56] [^114ARoyi].
- **Rationale**: Reduces treatment failure and relapse in bacterial exacerbations [^117KVkjS].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

Provide **patient education** on inhaler technique, symptom recognition, and when to seek care, and ensure **follow-up** within 2–7 days to assess response and adjust therapy [^115PLUcA].

---

## Indications for escalation of care

Escalate care for **hypoxemia** (SpO₂ < 90% on room air), **respiratory failure** (hypercapnia, altered mental status), or **failure to improve** after 48–72 hours of outpatient therapy [^113faPdU].

---

## Prevention of future exacerbations

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended [^113SnvuS].
- **Vaccinations**: Influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccines [^notfound].
- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Improves symptoms and reduces exacerbations [^113SnvuS].
- **Maintenance therapy**: LABA, LAMA, or ICS-LABA based on symptoms and exacerbation history [^116bpGsh].

## Outpatient COPD exacerbation management

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Regimen** |
|-|-|-|
| SABA ± SAMA | All exacerbations | 2–4 puffs every 4–6 hours |
| Systemic corticosteroids | Moderate-to-severe | Prednisone 40 mg daily × 5 days |
| Antibiotics | - Increased sputum purulence <br/> - Volume <br/> - Or dyspnea | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate <br/> - Doxycycline <br/> - Or macrolide × 5 days |
| Follow-up | All patients | Within 2–7 days |

---

Outpatient COPD exacerbations require **prompt bronchodilation**, short-course corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe events, and antibiotics only when bacterial features are present, with close follow-up and prevention strategies to reduce recurrence [^116SWGkW].

## References

### Outpatient treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: comparisons with asthma [^111Zxxy8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive syndrome of expiratory airflow limitation caused by chronic inflammation of the airways and lung parenchyma. The airway inflammatory response in COPD is initiated by smoking in the overwhelming majority of cases, and chronic exposure to cigarette smoke initiates a series of events that cause damage to central airways, peripheral airways, and terminal airspaces, leading to physiologic and clinical abnormalities. The contrasting inflammatory phenotypes of asthma and COPD have important implications for clinical and physiologic manifestations of disease, as well as for therapy. The outpatient treatment of COPD differs from the approach used in asthma and can be divided into 3 subgroups: health care maintenance, drug therapy, and nondrug therapy. Smoking cessation, regular spirometry, and immunization are important components of health care maintenance. Drug therapy consists of optimal bronchodilator therapy supplemented, when necessary, with either inhaled corticosteroids or theophylline. Nondrug therapies include pulmonary rehabilitation, supplemental oxygen, and surgery.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — antibiotic indications and duration: Antibiotics should be given to patients with exacerbations of COPD who meet cardinal symptom criteria or require mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive). A metanalysis demonstrated that ≤ 5 days of antibiotic treatment had the same clinical and bacteriological efficacy as longer conventional treatment in outpatients, and We recommend a duration of ≤ 5 days of antibiotic treatment for outpatient treatment of COPD exacerbations. Based on conflicting data, we cannot recommend at this time the use of procalcitonin-based protocols to decide on antibiotic use in COPD exacerbations.

### An update on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2017 guidelines with a focus on classification and management of stable COPD [^113ec6q6]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines offer important changes to the assessment and management of stable COPD of importance to practitioners, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, and nurses who care for patients with COPD. Therapies are now chosen based on the burden of symptoms and the history of COPD exacerbations, and inhaler regimens are modifiable based on continual clinical reassessment. Although identifying the degree of airway obstruction remains important for informing the clinical status of the patient with COPD, FEV 1 is no longer used to direct the therapeutic approach. Therapies and modes of inhaled medication delivery for each GOLD grouping have been modified and reflect the need for reevaluation of patient symptoms and COPD exacerbation history as an indicator to add or withdraw therapies. As the knowledge of this important disease continues to expand, exacerbation and symptom prevention in patients with stable COPD will remain as an important target of COPD therapies and research. Novel drug combinations and delivery devices are sure to positively affect the practitioner's approach to patients with stable COPD. The new 2017 GOLD guidelines represent a step toward personalized care of the patient with COPD.

### Real-world effectiveness study of guideline-directed COPD STANDARDized management in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a cluster randomised trial design [^1128xESt]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects the ageing population worldwide. Exacerbations worsen health status and increase health resource use. Existing guidelines recommend disease management, but they are not fully implemented in a clinical setting. Evidence regarding best practice and real-world effectiveness is limited.

Methods and Analysis

A nationwide multicentre clinical effectiveness trial is being performed between 2023 and 2027, involving 99 secondary hospitals in urban and rural areas in China. It is an open-label, adjudicator and assessor-blinded, parallel group, cluster randomised pragmatic trial. Hospitals are randomly allocated to standardised management (SM) or usual care. A total number of 3456 stable patients with COPD who are symptomatic (individuals in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Group B) or have exacerbation risk (individuals with one moderate exacerbation history in Group A and individuals in Group E) using GOLD 2023 ABE classification will be enrolled. In the SM group, an integrated intervention comprising five components will be delivered using a physician and nurse model. These are: (1) long-term inhaled maintenance therapy, (2) periodic inhaler technique assessment and symptom monitoring, (3) annual pulmonary function testing, (4) COPD education session and (5) health behaviour adoption (smoking cessation, vaccination, pulmonary rehabilitation). In the control group, patients will receive routine care. The primary goal is to assess the real-world effectiveness of guideline-directed disease management on exacerbation prevention, with moderate-to-severe exacerbation as the primary outcome and hospital admission, mortality, health status and COPD self-management as secondary outcomes. It is the first pragmatic trial undertaken of this form in a developing country. It is anticipated that it will provide a feasible and effective COPD management model that can inform guidelines and be rolled out into secondary and primary care, with modification, to ensure standardised COPD care nationwide.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^111w5GcJ]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

For decades, there is an unresolved debate about adequate prescription of antibiotics for patients suffering from exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of this systematic review was to analyse randomised controlled trials investigating the clinical benefit of antibiotics for COPD exacerbations.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of randomised, placebo-controlled trials assessing the effects of antibiotics on clinically relevant outcomes in patients with an exacerbation. We searched bibliographic databases, scrutinized reference lists and conference proceedings and asked the pharmaceutical industry for unpublished data. We used fixed-effects models to pool results. The primary outcome was treatment failure of COPD exacerbation treatment.

Results

We included 13 trials (1557 patients) of moderate to good quality. For the effects of antibiotics on treatment failure there was much heterogeneity across all trials (I² = 82%). Meta-regression revealed severity of exacerbation as significant explanation for this heterogeneity (p = 0.016): Antibiotics did not reduce treatment failures in outpatients with mild to moderate exacerbations (pooled odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.75–1.59, I² = 18%). Inpatients with severe exacerbations had a substantial benefit on treatment failure rates (pooled odds ratio of 0.25, 95% CI 0.16–0.39, I² = 0%; number-needed to treat of 4, 95% CI 3–5) and on mortality (pooled odds ratio of 0.20, 95% CI 0.06–0.62, I² = 0%; number-needed to treat of 14, 95% CI 12–30).

Conclusion

Antibiotics effectively reduce treatment failure and mortality rates in COPD patients with severe exacerbations. For patients with mild to moderate exacerbations, antibiotics may not be generally indicated and further research is needed to guide antibiotic prescription in these patients.

### Antibiotics for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112f7miJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated with antibiotics. However, the value of antibiotics remains uncertain, as systematic reviews and clinical trials have shown conflicting results.

Objectives

To assess effects of antibiotics on treatment failure as observed between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (primary outcome) for management of acute COPD exacerbations, as well as their effects on other patient-important outcomes (mortality, adverse events, length of hospital stay, time to next exacerbation).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and other electronically available databases up to 26 September 2018.

Selection Criteria

We sought to find randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with acute COPD exacerbations comparing antibiotic therapy and placebo and providing follow-up of at least seven days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened references and extracted data from trial reports. We kept the three groups of outpatients, inpatients, and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) separate for benefit outcomes and mortality because we considered them to be clinically too different to be summarised as a single group. We considered outpatients to have a mild to moderate exacerbation, inpatients to have a severe exacerbation, and ICU patients to have a very severe exacerbation. When authors of primary studies did not report outcomes or study details, we contacted them to request missing data. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) for treatment failure, Peto odds ratios (ORs) for rare events (mortality and adverse events), and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes using random-effects models. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. The primary outcome was treatment failure as observed between seven days and one month after treatment initiation.

Main Results

We included 19 trials with 2663 participants (11 with outpatients, seven with inpatients, and one with ICU patients). For outpatients (with mild to moderate exacerbations), evidence of low quality suggests that currently available antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk for treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (RR 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.94; I² = 31%; in absolute terms, reduction in treatment failures from 295 to 212 per 1000 treated participants, 95% CI 165 to 277). Studies providing older antibiotics not in use anymore yielded an RR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; I² = 31%). Evidence of low quality from one trial in outpatients suggested no effects of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.30). One trial reported no effects of antibiotics on re-exacerbations between two and six weeks after treatment initiation. Only one trial (N = 35) reported health-related quality of life but did not show a statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups. Evidence of moderate quality does not show that currently used antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure among inpatients with severe exacerbations (i.e. for inpatients excluding ICU patients) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.12; I² = 50%), but trial results remain uncertain. In turn, the effect was statistically significant when trials included older antibiotics no longer in clinical use (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.00; I² = 39%). Evidence of moderate quality from two trials including inpatients shows no beneficial effects of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 2.48, 95% CI 0.94 to 6.55). Length of hospital stay (in days) was similar in antibiotic and placebo groups. The only trial with 93 patients admitted to the ICU showed a large and statistically significant effect on treatment failure (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.45; moderate-quality evidence; in absolute terms, reduction in treatment failures from 565 to 107 per 1000 treated participants, 95% CI 45 to 254). Results of this trial show a statistically significant effect on mortality (Peto OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.72; moderate-quality evidence) and on length of hospital stay (MD -9.60 days, 95% CI -12.84 to -6.36; low-quality evidence). Evidence of moderate quality gathered from trials conducted in all settings shows no statistically significant effect on overall incidence of adverse events (Peto OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.63; moderate-quality evidence) nor on diarrhoea (Peto OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.07; moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Researchers have found that antibiotics have some effect on inpatients and outpatients, but these effects are small, and they are inconsistent for some outcomes (treatment failure) and absent for other outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay). Analyses show a strong beneficial effect of antibiotics among ICU patients. Few data are available on the effects of antibiotics on health-related quality of life or on other patient-reported symptoms, and data show no statistically significant increase in the risk of adverse events with antibiotics compared to placebo. These inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that can help identify patients who would benefit from antibiotics, while sparing antibiotics for patients who are unlikely to experience benefit and for whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs, and multi-resistance) should be avoided.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to general principles, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to individualize pharmacological treatment regimens guided by the severity of symptoms, risk of exacerbations, side effects, comorbidities, drug availability and cost, and the patient's response, preference, and ability to use various drug delivery devices. Assess inhaler technique needs regularly.

### COPD exacerbation: lost in translation [^116KWEhw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The introduction and acceptance of a standard definition for exacerbations of COPD can be helpful in prompt diagnosis and management of these events. The latest GOLD executive committee recognised this necessity and it has now included a definition of exacerbation in the guidelines for COPD which is an important step forward in the management of the disease. This definition is pragmatic and compromises the different approaches for exacerbation. However, the inclusion of the "healthcare utilisation" approach (". may warrant a change in regular medication") in the definition may introduce in the diagnosis of exacerbation factors related to the access to health care services which may not be related to the underlying pathophysiological process which characterizes exacerbations. It should be also noted that the aetiology of COPD exacerbations has not yet been included in the current definition. In this respect, the definition does not acknowledge the fact that many patients with COPD may suffer from additional conditions (i.e. congestive cardiac failure or pulmonary embolism) that can masquerade as exacerbations but they should not be considered as causes of them. The authors therefore suggest that an inclusion of the etiologic factors of COPD exacerbations in the definition. Moreover, COPD exacerbations are characterized by increased airway and systemic inflammation and significant deterioration in lung function. These fundamental aspects should be accounted in diagnosis/definition of exacerbations. This could be done by the introduction of a "laboratory" marker in the diagnosis of these acute events. The authors acknowledge that the use of a test or a biomarker in the diagnosis of exacerbations meets certain difficulties related to performing lung function tests or to sampling during exacerbations. However, the introduction of a test that reflects airway or systemic inflammation in the diagnosis of exacerbations might be another step forward in the management of COPD.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1156rEKg]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services and society that is likely to increase in the future. It is, therefore, important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible. In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed in an attempt to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, there are a number of barriers to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including the sheer weight of guidelines in all therapeutic areas, a focus on scientific knowledge rather than on clinical practice, lack of trust in the recommendations, practical considerations (e.g. time, resources, budget) and failure to include the perspective of patients. The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice and from a credible source. In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts. Local implementation plans have been developed to help ensure that GOLD recommendations are implemented in practice. In all COPD guidelines, however, lung function measures feature prominently with limited reference to outcome measures of interest to patients and healthcare payers (e.g. frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization). Low expectations among physicians and patients may also impair implementation. In conclusion, guidelines may improve the management of COPD, but the main challenge is to ensure implementation.

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^116GP5tm]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Exacerbations can be of bacterial, viral or mixed etiology, with bacteria involved in 50% of exacerbations. Consequently, current management of exacerbations frequently involves the use of antibiotics. The paper by Puhan et al published this month in BMC Medicine examines the benefit of antibiotics in placebo-controlled trials in mild to moderate outpatient exacerbations. The authors use a meta-analytic approach and rightly conclude that more trials are needed in this area. However, the heterogeneity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and exacerbations and the limited end-points in past trials do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn about antibiotic use in outpatient exacerbations based on this meta-analysis. Future trials need to take into account this heterogeneity as well as incorporate novel end-points to address this important issue.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^115wAR7r]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

COPD exacerbation prevention — education/case management with specialist access and action plans: In patients with COPD with a previous or recent history of exacerbations, we recommend education and case management that includes direct access to a health-care specialist at least monthly to prevent severe acute exacerbations of COPD, as assessed by decreases in hospitalizations (Grade 1C); related evidence on structured education and action plans included four studies, with two assessing changes in mean ED visits and mean hospitalizations and two assessing hospitalization rates, none using ED visits or hospitalizations as the primary outcome measure, and these studies demonstrated no effect on mean ED visits, mean hospitalizations, or hospitalization rates, with inclusion criteria varying (a previous history of an AECOPD within the past year in one trial; FEV1 between 40% and 80% predicted or FEV1 < 65% predicted or no FEV1 requirement in others) and sample sizes ranging from 52 to 154.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management — aims, assessment, and therapy review: The aim of COPD management is to reduce symptoms and future risk, COPD patients should have an assessment of the severity of their airflow obstruction, symptoms, history of exacerbations, exposure to risk factors and comorbidities to guide management, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy should be adjusted as necessary with further reviews undertaken.

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^111SBV4V]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

### COPD exacerbation: lost in translation [^113eT34Q]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The introduction and acceptance of a standard definition can be helpful in the clinical management of COPD patients. First, exacerbations could be detected and treated promptly. This is important since a delay in starting appropriate treatment is associated with a delay in the recovery from an exacerbation. Second, frequent exacerbators who require treatment that reduces exacerbation frequency could be identified in early stages of the disease and could be treated appropriately.

The latest GOLD executive committee recognised the necessity for a standard definition of exacerbations. Although GOLD executive summary in 2001 used a general description of exacerbations based on the worsening of the clinical condition of the patient, avoiding the use a standard definition, GOLD has now included a definition of exacerbation in the guidelines for COPD. This is an important step forward.

The current definition states that: "an exacerbation of COPD is defined as an event in the natural course of the disease characterized by a change in the patient's baseline dyspnea, cough, and/or sputum that is beyond normal day-to-day variations, is acute in onset, and may warrant a change in regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD". This definition is pragmatic and it is not in disagreement with previous definitions. Actually, the current definition compromises the different approaches for exacerbation. However, the inclusion of the "healthcare utilisation" approach (". may warrant a change in regular medication") in the current definition may introduce in the diagnosis of exacerbation factors related to the access to health care services which may not be related to the underlying pathophysiologal process which characterizes exacerbations.

In addition, it should be noted that the aetiology of COPD exacerbations has not yet been included in the current definition. In this respect, the definition does not acknowledge the fact that many patients with COPD may suffer from additional conditions, such as community acquired pneumonia, congestive cardiac failure or pulmonary embolism that can masquerade as exacerbations but they should not be considered as causes of COPD exacerbations. In these cases the management may be challenging for physicians and mandatory for the patients. For example, patients presenting with symptoms of exacerbation may have pulmonary embolism which requires anticoagulation. However, warfarin (a common oral anticoagulative therapeutic agent) interacts with steroids or with antibiotics which are required for exacerbations treatment and thus, more intensive monitoring of the anticoagulative effect is required. Therefore, inclusion of the etiologic factors of COPD exacerbations in the definition might improve further the management of these cases.

### Impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations on patients and payers [^115LQ9cp]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not only an established major cause of mortality and morbidity but is increasing in worldwide prevalence despite current medical interventions. The natural history of COPD is punctuated by periods of acute symptomatic, physiologic, and functional deterioration or exacerbations. These events are responsible for considerable additional morbidity and mortality and impact on patients' long-term health status. Despite advances in understanding disease mechanisms and in treatment, exacerbations continue to be the major cause of COPD-associated hospitalization, and provision for their management incurs considerable health care costs. Although pharmacologic therapies may improve clinical outcomes, these benefits must be optimized by prompt diagnosis and delivery. This will require improved understanding of this complex disease by physicians and patients alike.

### Real-world effectiveness study of guideline-directed COPD STANDARDized management in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a cluster randomised trial design [^115CSJZr]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects the ageing population worldwide. Exacerbations worsen health status and increase health resource use. Existing guidelines recommend disease management, but they are not fully implemented in a clinical setting. Evidence regarding best practice and real-world effectiveness is limited.

Methods and analysis

A nationwide multicentre clinical effectiveness trial is being performed between 2023 and 2027, involving 99 secondary hospitals in urban and rural areas in China. It is an open-label, adjudicator and assessor-blinded, parallel group, cluster randomised pragmatic trial. Hospitals are randomly allocated to standardised management (SM) or usual care. A total number of 3456 stable patients with COPD who are symptomatic (individuals in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Group B) or have exacerbation risk (individuals with one moderate exacerbation history in Group A and individuals in Group E) using GOLD 2023 ABE classification will be enrolled. In the SM group, an integrated intervention comprising five components will be delivered using a physician and nurse model. These are: (1) long-term inhaled maintenance therapy, (2) periodic inhaler technique assessment and symptom monitoring, (3) annual pulmonary function testing, (4) COPD education session and (5) health behaviour adoption (smoking cessation, vaccination, pulmonary rehabilitation). In the control group, patients will receive routine care. The primary goal is to assess the real-world effectiveness of guideline-directed disease management on exacerbation prevention, with moderate-to-severe exacerbation as the primary outcome and hospital admission, mortality, health status and COPD self-management as secondary outcomes. It is the first pragmatic trial undertaken of this form in a developing country. It is anticipated that it will provide a feasible and effective COPD management model that can inform guidelines and be rolled out into secondary and primary care, with modification, to ensure standardised COPD care nationwide.

### Action plans with brief patient education for exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1159gnB3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major driver of decline in health status and impose high costs on healthcare systems. Action plans offer a form of self-management that can be delivered in the outpatient setting to help individuals recognise and initiate early treatment for exacerbations, thereby reducing their impact.

Objectives

To compare effects of an action plan for COPD exacerbations provided with a single short patient education component and without a comprehensive self-management programme versus usual care. Primary outcomes were healthcare utilisation, mortality and medication use. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, psychological morbidity, lung function and cost-effectiveness.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register along with CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trials registers. Searches are current to November 2015. We handsearched bibliographic lists and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs comparing use of an action plan versus usual care for patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD. We permitted inclusion of a single short education component that would allow individualisation of action plans according to management needs and symptoms of people with COPD, as well as ongoing support directed at use of the action plan.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. For meta-analyses, we subgrouped studies via phone call follow-up directed at facilitating use of the action plan.

Main Results

This updated review includes two additional studies (and 976 additional participants), for a total of seven parallel-group RCTs and 1550 participants, 66% of whom were male. Participants' mean age was 68 years and was similar among studies. Airflow obstruction was moderately severe in three studies and severe in four studies; mean post bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) was 54% predicted, and 27% of participants were current smokers. Four studies prepared individualised action plans, one study an oral plan and two studies standard written action plans. All studies provided short educational input on COPD, and two studies supplied ongoing support for action plan use. Follow-up was 12 months in four studies and six months in three studies. When compared with usual care, an action plan with phone call follow-up significantly reduced the combined rate of hospitalisations and emergency department (ED) visits for COPD over 12 months in one study with 743 participants (rate ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.79; high-quality evidence), but the rate of hospitalisations alone in this study failed to achieve statistical significance (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.01; moderate-quality evidence). Over 12 months, action plans significantly decreased the likelihood of hospital admission (odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.97; n = 897; two RCTs; moderate-quality evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19 (11 to 201)) and the likelihood of an ED visit (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78; n = 897; two RCTs; moderate-quality evidence; NNTB over 12 months 12 (9 to 26)) compared with usual care. Results showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality during 12 months (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.31; n = 1134; four RCTs; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence interval). Over 12 months, use of oral corticosteroids was increased with action plans compared with usual care (mean difference (MD) 0.74 courses, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.35; n = 200; two RCTs; moderate-quality evidence), and the cumulative prednisolone dose was significantly higher (MD 779.0 mg, 95% CI 533.2 to 10248; n = 743; one RCT; high-quality evidence). Use of antibiotics was greater in the intervention group than in the usual care group (subgrouped by phone call follow-up) over 12 months (MD 2.3 courses, 95% CI 1.8 to 2.7; n = 943; three RCTs; moderate-quality evidence). Subgroup analysis by ongoing support for action plan use was limited; review authors noted no subgroup differences in the likelihood of hospital admission or ED visits or all-cause mortality over 12 months. Antibiotic use over 12 months showed a significant difference between subgroups in studies without and with ongoing support. Overall quality of life score on St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) showed a small improvement with action plans compared with usual care over 12 months (MD -2.8, 95% CI -0.8 to -4.8; n = 1009; three RCTs; moderate-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence showed no benefit for psychological morbidity as measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).

Authors' Conclusions

Use of COPD exacerbation action plans with a single short educational component along with ongoing support directed at use of the action plan, but without a comprehensive self-management programme, reduces in-hospital healthcare utilisation and increases treatment of COPD exacerbations with corticosteroids and antibiotics. Use of COPD action plans in this context is unlikely to increase or decrease mortality. Whether additional benefit is derived from periodic ongoing support directed at use of an action plan cannot be determined from the results of this review.

### COPD exacerbations: the impact of long versus short courses of oral corticosteroids on mortality and pneumonia: nationwide data on 67 000 patients with COPD followed for 12 months [^117HDGBN]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contribute to high morbidity and mortality. Patients with COPD are also at greater risk of developing pneumonia, mainly due to the impairment of lung defence mechanisms and use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). In addition, patients hospitalised for COPD and pneumonia exhibit substantially higher rates of intensive care admission, mortality and longer length of hospital stay compared with persons without COPD.

Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommendation for treatment duration of systemic corticosteroids (oral corticosteroids, OCS) for acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) has changed over the last decades, ranging from treatment durations of 10–14 days,7–10 daysand is currently 5–7 days. The last reduction was based on a robust randomised controlled trial.

OCS are recommended to patients with COPD during acute exacerbations, and most COPD exacerbations can safely be managed in the outpatient setting.OCS have been found to shorten the length of hospital stays, improve lung function, and reduce the risk of early relapse and treatment failure in patients with non-pneumonia exacerbation. No effect has been observed regarding longer-term lung function, length of stay at intensive care unit and 30-day mortality. Most clinical trials investigating OCS for exacerbations were performed on patients who require hospitalisation, and only a few have described the effect of OCS in the outpatient setting.

OCS use is associated with a number of adverse effects including hyperglycaemia, ﬂuid retention, weight gain, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, adrenal suppression, deep vein thrombosis, osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. Even short courses of OCS (median days = 6) have been associated with adverse effects, and they increase with increased number of OCS courses. In addition, OCS have been shown to cause severe infections due to their immunosuppressive activity, which impairs phagocyte function and suppresses cell-mediated immunity. This was confirmed in a meta-analysis of 71 pooled controlled trials that showed a relative risk of 1.6 for infectious events in the prednisolone group (n = 2111) compared with the controls (n = 2087). However, the risk of severe infections and death following the use of OCS is in general unknown and mainly short-term follow-up endpoints have been reported in patients with COPD. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide, observational cohort study to determine the association between duration of OCS treatment in outpatients with AECOPD and the risk of pneumonia hospitalisation and all-cause mortality during a 1-year study period and to explore how the timing of the exposure affects the risk estimates.

### Doxycycline for outpatient-treated acute exacerbations of COPD: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1171opD5]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics do not reduce mortality or short-term treatment non-response in patients receiving treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD in an outpatient setting. However, the long-term effects of antibiotics are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate if the antibiotic doxycycline added to the oral corticosteroid prednisolone prolongs time to next exacerbation in patients with COPD receiving treatment for an exacerbation in the outpatient setting.

Methods

In this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial, we recruited a cohort of patients with COPD from outpatient clinics of nine teaching hospitals and three primary care centres in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria were an age of at least 45 years, a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years, mild-to-severe COPD (Global Initiative of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stage 1–3), and at least one exacerbation during the past 3 years. Exclusion criteria were poor mastery of the Dutch language, poor cognitive functioning, known allergy to doxycycline, pregnancy, and a life expectancy of shorter than 1 month. If a participant had an exacerbation, we randomly assigned them (1:1; with permuted blocks of variable sizes [ranging from two to ten]; stratified by GOLD stage 1–2 vs 3) to a 7 day course of oral doxycycline 100 mg daily (200 mg on the first day) or placebo. Exclusion criteria for randomisation were fever, admission to hospital, and current use of antibiotics or use within the previous 3 weeks. Patients in both groups received a 10 day course of 30 mg oral prednisolone daily. Patients, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was time to next exacerbation in all randomly allocated patients except for those incorrectly randomly allocated who did not meet the inclusion criteria or met the exclusion criteria. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, number NTR2499.

Findings

Between Dec 22, 2010, and Aug 6, 2013, we randomly allocated 305 (34%) patients from the cohort of 887 patients to doxycycline (152 [50%]) or placebo (153 [50%]), excluding four (1%) patients (two [1%] from each group) who were incorrectly randomly allocated from the analysis. 257 (85%) of 301 patients had a next exacerbation (131 [87%] of 150 in the doxycycline group vs 126 [83%] of 151 in the placebo group). Median time to next exacerbation was 148 days (95% CI 95–200) in the doxycycline group compared with 161 days (118–211) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1.01 [95% CI 0.79–1.31]; p = 0.91). We did not note any significant differences between groups in the frequency of adverse events during the first 2 weeks after randomisation (47 [31%] of 150 in the doxycycline group vs 53 [35%] of 151 in the placebo group; p = 0.54) or in serious adverse events during the 2 years of follow-up (42 [28%] vs 43 [29%]; p = 1).

Interpretation

In patients with mild-to-severe COPD receiving treatment for an exacerbation in an outpatient setting, the antibiotic doxycycline added to the oral corticosteroid prednisolone did not prolong time to next exacerbation compared with prednisolone alone. These findings do not support prescription of antibiotics for COPD exacerbations in an outpatient setting.

### Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in United States emergency departments, 2010–2018 [^111qZTSP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this national sample representative of 7,508,000 AECOPD visits, the overall ED visit rate for AECOPD remained persistently high during the 9-year study period. Certain patient and ED factors were associated with higher ED visits for AECOPD. Hospitalizations through the ED decreased over time, and there was a near statistically significant increase in the use of systemic corticosteroids in the ED during the same time period.

Compared to studies using the NHAMCS data from earlier years, the previously identified upward trend in AECOPD ED visit rates seemed to plateau during this study period (2010–2018). A possible explanation for this trend is the combined effect of decreasing smoking rates over time in the U.S. a relatively stable population of COPD, and perhaps improved outpatient care for patients with stable COPD. Nonetheless, there is still room for improvement. For example, the higher ED visit rate for patients with public insurance, such as Medicare and Medicaid, may suggest limitations in the current system of outpatient COPD management for this patient population and the potential benefit of targeted interventions to prevent acute COPD exacerbations. Patients with Medicaid may be more likely to experience barriers to optimal outpatient care, such as difficulty obtaining a primary care provider who accepts public insurance, challenges maintaining prescriptions for inhalers and medications, and thus rely on the ED for both unmet chronic COPD needs and management of exacerbations which are likely more frequent due to undertreated disease. Of note, interventions are especially needed during the winter months (e.g. action plan), when AECOPD rates are highest, as shown in our study and others.

### Antibiotics for treatment and prevention of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114VuTEe]. The Journal of Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations (AE) can be recurrent problems for patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increasing morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests that ≥ 50% of acute exacerbations involve bacteria requiring treatment with an antibiotic which should have high activity against the causative pathogens. However, sputum analysis is not a pre-requisite for antibiotic prescription in outpatients as results are delayed and patients are likely to be colonised with bacteria in the stable state. Clinicians rely on the clinical symptoms, sputum appearance and the patient's medical history to decide if an AE-COPD should be treated with antibiotics. This article reviews the available data of antibiotic trials in AE-COPD. Management of frequent exacerbators is particularly challenging for physicians. This may include antibiotic prophylaxis, especially macrolides because of anti-inflammatory properties; though successful in reducing exacerbations, concerns about resistance development remain. Inhalation of antibiotics achieves high local concentrations and minimal systemic exposure; therefore, it may represent an attractive alternative for antibiotic prophylaxis in certain COPD patients. Inhaled antibiotic prophylaxis has been successfully used in other respiratory conditions such as non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis which itself might be present in COPD patients who have chronic bacterial infection, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) plus long-acting β-agonist (LABA) versus LABA plus inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111fUVUx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are inhaled medications used to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). When two classes of medications are required, a LAMA plus an ICS (LABA+ICS) were previously recommended within a single inhaler as the first-line treatment for managing stable COPD in people in high-risk categories. However, updated international guidance recommends a LAMA plus a LABA (LAMA+LABA). This systematic review is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2017.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of LAMA+LABA versus LABA+ICS for treatment of people with stable COPD.

Search Methods

We performed an electronic search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal, followed by handsearches. Two review authors screened the selected articles. The most recent search was run on 10 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel or cross-over randomised controlled trials of at least one month's duration, comparing LAMA+LABA and LABA+ICS for stable COPD. We included studies conducted in an outpatient setting and irrespective of blinding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and evaluated risk of bias. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs), and continuous data as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Review Manager 5. Primary outcomes were: participants with one or more exacerbations of COPD; serious adverse events; quality of life, as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score change from baseline; and trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). We used the GRADE framework to rate our certainty of the evidence in each meta-analysis as high, moderate, low or very low. MAIN RESULTS: This review updates the first version of the review, published in 2017, and increases the number of included studies from 11 to 19 (22,354 participants). The median number of participants per study was 700. In each study, between 54% and 91% (median 70%) of participants were males. Study participants had an average age of 64 years and percentage predicted FEV 1 of 51.5% (medians of study means). Included studies had a generally low risk of selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting biases. All but two studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, which had varying levels of involvement in study design, conduct, and data analysis. Primary outcomes The odds of having an exacerbation were similar for LAMA+LABA compared with LABA+ICS (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; I² = 61%; 13 studies, 20,960 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The odds of having a serious adverse event were also similar (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.15; I² = 20%; 18 studies, 23,183 participants; high-certainty evidence). Participants receiving LAMA+LABA had a similar improvement in quality of life, as measured by the SGRQ, to those receiving LABA+ICS (MD -0.57, 95% CI -1.36 to 0.21; I² = 78%; 9 studies, 14,437 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) but showed a greater improvement in trough FEV 1 (MD 0.07, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.08; I² = 73%; 12 studies, 14,681 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes LAMA+LABA decreased the odds of pneumonia compared with LABA+ICS from 5% to 3% (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.72; I² = 0%; 14 studies, 21,829 participants; high-certainty evidence) but increased the odds of all-cause death from 1% to 1.4% (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.75; I² = 0%; 15 studies, 21,510 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The odds of achieving a minimal clinically important difference of four or more points on the SGRQ were similar between LAMA+LABA and LABA+ICS (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.25; I² = 77%; 4 studies, 13,614 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Combination LAMA+LABA therapy probably holds similar benefits to LABA+ICS for exacerbations and quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, for people with moderate to severe COPD, but offers a larger improvement in FEV 1 and a slightly lower risk of pneumonia. There is little to no difference between LAMA+LABA and LAMA+ICS in the odds of having a serious adverse event. Whilst all-cause death may be lower with LABA+ICS, there was a very small number of events in the analysis, translating to a low absolute risk. Findings are based on moderate- to high-certainty evidence from heterogeneous trials with an observation period of less than one year. This review should be updated again in a few years.

### Acute exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: should we use antibiotics and if so, which ones? [^113QQbbj]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with evidence suggesting at least 50% of exacerbations involve bacteria that benefit from antibiotic treatment. Here, we review the most relevant data regarding the use of antibiotics in exacerbations of COPD and provide insights on the selection of initial antibiotic therapy for their treatment.

Recent Findings

Identification of bacterial exacerbations still relies on clinical assessment rather than laboratory biomarkers. Several recent studies, including a meta-analysis and placebo-controlled trials, demonstrate improved outcomes with antibiotics in all but mild exacerbations of COPD, including both inpatient and outpatient. A broader antibiotic regimen should be used for patients who have risk factors for poor outcomes. A risk-stratification approach can guide antibiotic choice, although the stratification algorithm still needs to be validated in a randomized controlled trial.

Summary

The use of antibiotics for the treatment of moderate-to-severe suspected bacterial exacerbations in COPD is supported by published trials and evidence-based systematic reviews. Recent trials also show differences in outcomes based on antibiotic choice. More research is necessary to evaluate risk stratification approaches when selecting initial antibiotic therapy.

Treatment setting for COPD exacerbations — the goals of treatment are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and prevent the development of subsequent events. Depending on the severity of an exacerbation and/or the severity of the underlying disease, an exacerbation can be managed in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. More than 80% of exacerbations are managed on an outpatient basis with pharmacological therapies including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics.

### Home-based pulmonary rehabilitation early after hospitalisation in COPD (early homeBase): protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^113e3PwG]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience a progressive decline in lung function, reduced exercise tolerance, marked breathlessness and multiple comorbidities. Recurrent bouts of acute deterioration in symptoms are common in COPD, and such exacerbationscommonly require hospital admission for treatment and management. Hospitalisation for an exacerbation of COPD is associated with increased morbidity, readmission, resource utilisation and mortality. Additionally, COPD exacerbations reduce both quality of life and physical function, which may not spontaneously recover. For people with COPD avoiding exacerbations, and resultant hospitalisations are outcomes of key importance.

Pulmonary rehabilitation, a comprehensive programme including exercise training and self-management education, is an established management strategy for people with COPD recommended in guidelines. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses and large cohort studies have both demonstrated that completion of pulmonary rehabilitation reduces future exacerbations, need for hospitalisation and hospital length of stay. The reduced likelihood of hospital admission is particularly evident when pulmonary rehabilitation is undertaken following an exacerbation (pooled OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.91). However, following hospitalisation for an exacerbation, fewer than 10% of people with COPD are referred to outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation on hospital dischargeand fewer than 3% attend outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation in the year following hospital discharge. Low rates of pulmonary rehabilitation referral are contributed to by limited knowledge and experience of pulmonary rehabilitation by healthcare professionals. Poor referral rates are further compounded by key patient-related barriers to attendance at outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programmes including limited understanding of programme requirements and benefits, and difficulties associated with travel and transport.

If no, obtain history, physical exam, and tests as clinically indicated to evaluate for alternate diagnoses, then initiate short-acting acute bronchodilator therapy (albuterol ± ipratropium MDI with spacer or via nebulizer) and administer oxygen if necessary. A subsequent decision asks "Are acute symptoms resolved?"; if yes, consider continuing short-acting bronchodilator therapy, initiating long-acting bronchodilator therapy, initiating steroid therapy, and initiating antibiotic therapy; if no, arrange transfer. After improvement, arrange follow-up, instruct the patient to contact the clinic if condition deteriorates, and return to the primary care pathway.

This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years. Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure proper evaluation of severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include assessment of (1) symptoms, (2) severity of airflow limitation, (3) history of exacerbations, and (4) comorbidities. The first three points can be used to evaluate level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations, and this is done in a way that splits patients with COPD into four categories-A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce risk of exacerbations. Identification and treatment of comorbidities must have high priority, and a separate section in the document addresses management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant shareholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines on the management of COPD.

### Diagnosis and outpatient management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review [^113SnvuS]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

There are 30 million adults (12%) in the United States who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease accounts for 3.2% of all physician office visits annually and is the fourth leading cause of death (126 000 deaths per year). Most patients are diagnosed by their primary care clinicians who must address the highly variable clinical features and responses to therapy. The diagnosis and treatment of COPD is rapidly changing, so understanding recent advances is important for the delivery of optimal patient care.

Observations

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by incompletely reversible expiratory airflow limitation. Spirometry is the reference standard for diagnosing and assessing the severity of COPD. All patients should be counseled about and receive preventive measures such as smoking cessation and vaccination. Treatment should be guided by the severity of lung impairment, symptoms such as dyspnea, the amount of cough and sputum production, and how often a patient experiences an exacerbation. When dyspnea limits activity or quality of life, COPD should be treated with once- or twice-daily maintenance long-acting anticholinergic and β-agonist bronchodilators. Patients with acute exacerbations may benefit from the addition of inhaled corticosteroids, particularly those with elevated peripheral eosinophil levels. Pulmonary rehabilitation, which includes strength and endurance training and educational, nutritional, and psychosocial support, improves symptoms and exercise tolerance but is underutilized. Supplemental oxygen for patients with resting hypoxemia (defined as SpO₂ < 89%) improves survival.

Conclusions and Relevance

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a complicated disease requiring intensive treatment. Appropriate use of long-acting maintenance bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and pulmonary rehabilitation decreases symptoms, optimizes functional performance, and reduces exacerbation frequency. Supplemental oxygen in patients with resting hypoxemia prolongs life, and other advanced treatments are available based on specific patient characteristics.

### Variability in adherence to clinical practice guidelines and recommendations in COPD outpatients: a multi-level, cross-sectional analysis of the EPOCONSUL study [^114VfpNx]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical audits have reported considerable variability in COPD medical care and frequent inconsistencies with recommendations. The objectives of this study were to identify factors associated with a better adherence to clinical practice guidelines and to explore determinants of this variability at the the hospital level.

Methods

EPOCONSUL is a Spanish nationwide clinical audit that evaluates the outpatient management of COPD. Multilevel logistic regression with two levels was performed to assess the relationships between individual and disease-related factors, as well as hospital characteristics.

Results

A total of 4508 clinical records of COPD patients from 59 Spanish hospitals were evaluated. High variability was observed among hospitals in terms of medical care. Some of the patient's characteristics (airflow obstruction, degree of dyspnea, exacerbation risk, presence of comorbidities), the hospital factors (size and respiratory nurses available) and treatment at a specialized COPD outpatient clinic were identified as factors associated with a better adherence to recommendations, although this only explains a small proportion of the total variance.

Conclusion

To be treated at a specialized COPD outpatient clinic and some intrinsic patient characteristics were factors associated with a better adherence to guideline recommendations, although these variables were only explaining part of the high variability observed among hospitals in terms of COPD medical care.

### Influence of age on real-life effects of doxycycline for acute exacerbations among COPD outpatients: a population-based cohort study [^114pTM3q]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Implications for future research and clinical practice

The tendency towards better effects of antibiotics in the elderly COPD patients may offer clues for clinicians and researchers for more targeted management of AECOPD. In particular, decision-making about empirical antibiotic therapy for AECOPD should take the age of patients into consideration. However, before that, more prospective, well-designed studies with more accurate diagnostic information are needed to further confirm the finding from this study.

Although related guideline and GOLD report about antibiotic use for AECOPD were basically based on secondary care RCT evidence, decision-making in daily practice is influenced by many factors making AECOPD treatment more challenging in outpatient settings. Therefore, identifying high risk populations for infection may improve management and clinical decisions about antibiotic use in COPD outpatients. The high risk of infection and beneficial effects from antibiotics for AECOPD in elderly outpatients should warrant a personalised approach towards antibiotic treatment.

### REALizing and improving management of stable COPD in China: a multi-center, prospective, observational study to realize the current situation of COPD patients in China (REAL)-rationale, study design, and protocol [^112JngaJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fifth leading cause of death in China with a reported prevalence of 8.2% people aged ≥ 40years. It is recommended that Chinese physicians follow Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and national guidelines, yet many patients with COPD in China remain undiagnosed. Furthermore, missed diagnoses and a lack of standardized diagnosis and treatment remain significant problems. The situation is further complicated by a lack of large-scale, long-term, prospective studies of real-world outcomes, including exacerbation rates, disease severity, efficacy of treatment, and compliance of COPD patients in China.

Methods/Design

The REALizing and improving management of stable COPD in China (REAL) study is a 52-week multi-center, prospective, observational trial. REAL aims to recruit approximately 5000 outpatients aged ≥ 40years with a clinical diagnosis of COPD per GOLD 2016. Outpatients will be consecutively recruited from approximately 50 tertiary and secondary hospitals randomly selected across six geographic regions to provide a representative population. Patients will receive conventional medical care as determined by their treating physicians. The primary objective is to evaluate COPD patient outcomes including lung function, health status, exacerbations, hospitalization rate, and dyspnea following 1 year of current clinical practice. Secondary objectives are to assess disease severity, treatment patterns, adherence to medication, and associated risk factors. Data will be collected at two study visits, at patients' usual care visits, and by telephone interview every 3months.

Discussion

Knowledge of COPD among physicians in China is poor. The REAL study will provide reliable information on COPD management, outcomes, and risk factors that may help improve the standard of care in China. Patient recruitment began on 30 June 2017 and the estimated primary completion date is 30 July 2019.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^111Koq5T]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our systematic review informs the debate about appropriate prescription of antibiotics for COPD exacerbations. As long as exacerbations remain an ill-defined event, the distinction between in- and outpatient treatment may serve as simple guidance to decide for or against antibiotics. Patients with severe exacerbations requiring hospital admission benefit substantially from antibiotics. In outpatients with mild to moderate exacerbations, antibiotics appear to offer no benefits in general. Further research will show how the subgroup of patients with mild to moderate exacerbations, who might benefit from antibiotics, can be identified.

### Antibiotics for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111ECBZt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated with antibiotics. However, the value of antibiotics remains uncertain as systematic reviews and clinical trials have shown conflicting results.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in the management of acute COPD exacerbations on treatment failure as observed between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (primary outcome) and on other patient-important outcomes (mortality, adverse events, length of hospital stay).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and other electronically available databases up to September 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with acute COPD exacerbations comparing antibiotic therapy and placebo with a follow-up of at least seven days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened references and extracted data from trial reports. We kept the three groups of outpatients, inpatients and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) separate for benefit outcomes and mortality because we considered them to be clinically too different to be summarised in one group. We considered outpatients to have a mild to moderate exacerbation, inpatients to have a severe exacerbation and ICU patients to have a very severe exacerbation. Where outcomes or study details were not reported we requested missing data from the authors of the primary studies. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RR) for treatment failure, Peto odds ratios (OR) for rare events (mortality and adverse events) and weighted mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes using fixed-effect models. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

Sixteen trials with 2068 participants were included. In outpatients (mild to moderate exacerbations), there was evidence of low quality that antibiotics did statistically significantly reduce the risk for treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.94; I² = 35%) but they did not significantly reduce the risk when the meta-analysis was restricted to currently available drugs (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.01; I² = 33%). Evidence of high quality showed that antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure in inpatients with severe exacerbations (ICU not included) (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91; I² = 47%) regardless of whether restricted to current drugs. The only trial with 93 patients admitted to the ICU showed a large and statistically significant effect on treatment failure (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.45; high-quality evidence). Evidence of low-quality from four trials in inpatients showed no effect of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.79). High-quality evidence from one trial showed a statistically significant effect on mortality in ICU patients (Peto OR 0.21; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.72). Length of hospital stay (in days) was similar in the antibiotics and placebo groups except for the ICU study where antibiotics statistically significantly reduced length of hospital stay (mean difference -9.60 days; 95% CI -12.84 to -6.36 days). One trial showed no effect of antibiotics on re-exacerbations between two and six weeks after treatment initiation. Only one trial (N = 35) reported health-related quality of life but did not show a statistically significant difference between the treatment and control group. Evidence of moderate quality showed that the overall incidence of adverse events was higher in the antibiotics groups (Peto OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.27). Patients treated with antibiotics experienced statistically significantly more diarrhoea based on three trials (Peto OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.11 to 6.17; high-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics for COPD exacerbations showed large and consistent beneficial effects across outcomes of patients admitted to an ICU. However, for outpatients and inpatients the results were inconsistent. The risk for treatment failure was significantly reduced in both inpatients and outpatients when all trials (1957 to 2012) were included but not when the analysis for outpatients was restricted to currently used antibiotics. Also, antibiotics had no statistically significant effect on mortality and length of hospital stay in inpatients and almost no data on patient-reported outcomes exist. These inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that help identify patients who benefit from antibiotics and patients who experience no effect, and in whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs and multi-resistance) could be avoided.

COPD exacerbations — antibiotics and decision aids: Although infectious causes can be viral or bacterial, the use of antibiotics in exacerbations remains controversial, yet there is evidence supporting the use of antibiotics when patients have clinical signs of a bacterial infection such as increased sputum purulence. Observed sputum color can safely modulate antibiotic therapy with no adverse effects if sputum is white or clear, and observed sputum purulence has 94.4% sensitivity and 52% specificity for high bacterial load. A systematic review of placebo-controlled studies showed that antibiotics reduce short-term mortality by 77%, treatment failure by 53% and sputum purulence by 44%, supporting treatment of moderately or severely ill patients with COPD exacerbations and increased cough and sputum purulence with antibiotics. In an outpatient RCT, adding doxycycline to oral corticosteroid did not prolong time to next exacerbation. Point-of-care C-reactive protein (CRP) strategies reduced antibiotic prescriptions without impaired outcomes in UK primary care outpatients, and another trial in hospitalized patients found similar results (reduced antibiotic use with no increase in treatment failure); data indicate antibiotic usage can be safely reduced from 77.4% to 47.7% when CRP is low. Procalcitonin has been studied to determine antibiotic use in COPD exacerbations, but the efficacy of this biomarker is controversial.

VA/DoD COPD guideline — antibiotics for outpatient exacerbations states: "There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of antibiotics for outpatient COPD exacerbations (C-reactive protein guided or not). (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-replaced)". An SR suggested decreased risk for treatment failures "up to one month following the initiation of treatment", but also "found no significant difference between antibiotic treatment and placebo in re-exacerbations in 2–6 weeks, median time to next exacerbation up to 12 months, and all-cause mortality up to two years after starting antibiotic treatment". Safety signals include that "one SR and two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggests an increase in diarrhea with antibiotic therapy compared with placebo from four weeks to two years post commencement of antibiotics", and "No significant difference was found in harms between shorter and longer durations of broad spectrum antibiotics". For biomarker-guided prescribing, "the use of C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing guided antibiotic prescription compared to usual care, had no clinically important difference in adverse effects… at six months", and "The Work Group did not review evidence on other specific biomarkers, such as procalcitonin". Clinically, "Based on clinical judgment, antibiotic therapy may be warranted and beneficial on a case-by-case basis", with examples including "a moderate exacerbation, increased dyspnea and increased sputum volume/purulence, fever/chills, and leukocytosis with radiographic evidence of pneumonia". The Work Group's confidence in the evidence was stated as low.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^111ashKS]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Meaning of the study

We quantified the influence of severity of exacerbations on the effects of antibiotics using the Operational Classification of Severity of the European Respiratory and American Thoracic Society. The major advantage of this classification over earlier ones is that it is simple to apply. But one needs to consider that severity of exacerbations is not the only determinant for hospital admission and that co-morbidity and social circumstances also play an important role. As long as the mechanisms of exacerbations are not fully understood and cannot be assessed in detail by pathophysiological variables, the Operational Classification of Severity may describe exacerbations most comprehensively. This simplification comes at the price of not discriminating between different forms of exacerbations that can be treated on an outpatient base. It is, however, unclear, whether this distinction is necessary in general. Even if there is an effect of antibiotics in more severe exacerbations of outpatients it is likely to be small. The four ongoing trials, that all include outpatients, may inform us in this regard.

The results of our systematic review may have important implications for clinical practice and help to inform discussions that are ongoing for decades. Most patients with COPD exacerbations who do not need hospital admission may not benefit from immediate antibiotic treatment. The most prudent choice for these patients might be to withhold antibiotics at first while first line management should include bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, patient instruction to use medications correctly as well as follow-up visits. If patients do not recover or show further worsening of health status, antibiotics might still be considered after 3 to 5 days of first line treatment. Thereby, a substantial amount of antibiotics could be spared with positive consequences for the patient and society (adverse effects, antibiotic resistance and costs.)

A remark clarifies this does not preclude the use of systemic corticosteroids for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, and the underlying text notes they have not been shown to reduce exacerbations beyond 30 days and that no evidence supports long-term corticosteroids, with risks that far outweigh any benefits.

VA/DoD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) guideline scope focuses on outpatient care in the primary care setting and does not address the specialty care of advanced COPD or the inpatient care of COPD exacerbations. It provides clinical practice recommendations for the care of patients with COPD, includes an Algorithm that incorporates clinical recommendations in the context of the flow of patient care, and adds Research Priorities that identify areas needing additional research. The methodology used in developing this CPG has been updated and reflects stricter standards than previous versions, with details in Appendix A. The document advocates increasing support to patients through self-management programs and telehealth, notes continued strengthening of evidence for the importance of smoking cessation, and highlights areas needing further research including the use of antibiotics during COPD exacerbations. Toolkit materials for providers and patients (provider summary, patient summary, and pocket card) are available online. The Work Group's tasks included determining the scope of the CPG, crafting clinically relevant key questions to guide the systematic evidence review, and developing evidence-based clinical practice recommendations, including determining the strength and category of each recommendation.

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^115PTo5q]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchitis is among the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription worldwide. This diagnosis includes two distinct entities, acute bronchitis in the absence of underlying lung disease and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute bronchitis is predominantly a viral disease with good evidence that antibiotics are not of benefit in its management. Exacerbations of COPD, on the other hand, can be of bacterial, viral or mixed etiology, with bacterial infection currently estimated to contribute up to 50% of exacerbations. Furthermore, in contrast to acute bronchitis, these exacerbation episodes are not benign events, as they have consequences ranging from days lost from work, deterioration of health status, progression of airflow obstruction and even death. Therefore, appropriate management of COPD exacerbations is crucial.

Antibiotics are often used in the management of COPD exacerbations. It is estimated that more than 80% of COPD exacerbations are treated on an outpatient basis, which can be regarded as mild to moderate exacerbations. The article published by Puhan et al this month in BMC Medicine makes the argument that there is a lack of evidence for antibiotic benefit in mild to moderate exacerbations of COPD and that additional placebo-controlled trials are required. Their argument is based on a meta-analytic approach where they identified five placebo-controlled randomized trials in the literature, which were confined to 'mild to moderate' exacerbations of COPD. With this approach, although all but one of the trials favor antibiotics, the combined odds ratio is not statistically significant.

Although their conclusions based on the analysis are not erroneous, their approach to this question highlights a number of issues that make it difficult to resolve this argument; these include the heterogeneity of exacerbations, patients and antibiotics in these trials. Another major issue is the acceptance of the results of these trials without critically examining the limitations of the end-points used in these studies. The 'devil is in the details' in these trials, and these details are often overlooked in a meta-analytic approach.

### Is one exacerbation enough to modify therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? [^114oCwQm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality globally. The current Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy for how COPD is diagnosed and managed emphasizes the importance of assessing both respiratory symptoms and exacerbations in the classification of COPD. The threshold for exacerbations to move from a less severe (Category A or B) to a more severe (Category E) group is one severe exacerbation or two or more moderate exacerbations. This threshold is the subject of the study by Vanfleteren and colleagues (pp.) that appears in this issue of the Journal.

Although acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs) are common and critically important events, several questions surround their definition. The standard definition for AECOPD is a post hoc definition that is based on utilization: Exacerbations that are treated in an outpatient setting with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics are classified as moderate, and those that result in hospitalization are classified as severe. This concept has been challenged, however, with the concept that physiologic measures should be used to classify exacerbations. Although this approach may work with hospitalized patients, for whom the physiologic data needed to classify exacerbations are available, it will not work with outpatients, for whom a range of exacerbation severity is also likely. Additional questions related to AECOPDs include when the exacerbations actually begin and end and optimal prevention strategies, as well as the question addressed in this paper: whether one moderate exacerbation is more similar to two moderate exacerbations or no moderate exacerbations.

### International differences in the frequency of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations reported in three clinical trials [^112gRi75]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are the cornerstone of evidence-based treatment. It is now customary to conduct large, complex studies to identify therapies that reduce the incidence of clinically important but infrequent events like death, hospitalization, or symptomatic deterioration. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exacerbations are important because they drive clinical and physiological deterioration as well as healthcare costs. However, the interpretation of exacerbation data in clinical trials has proven to be very complex. Exacerbations are not normally distributed over time, and their occurrence can lead to behavioral changes such as leaving the trial. Further, the operational identification of an exacerbation's presence and severity relies on the post hoc determination of a new therapeutic intervention. The determinants of this therapeutic decision have not been studied in detail, and physicians in different countries might choose to manage the same event differently. Moreover, exacerbations may be under or overreported when determined only by patient-reported symptom variability and the specific treatment initiated.

Although some studies have relied on complex statistical models that address the problem of the patient's individual propensity to exacerbate, other studies have focused on identifying differences in the time to first exacerbation. Even when using these approaches, large numbers of patients are needed to provide sufficient statistical power for a proper test of the null hypothesis when exacerbation is an outcome. Indeed, the numbers involved in exacerbation studies have risen substantially in the last two decades. In part, this reflects the falling exacerbation rates seen in the comparator arms of large RCTs, usually attributed to better background therapy. The strongest predictor of the likelihood of an exacerbation is previous exacerbation history, which is often used as a study enrichment entry criterion. However, the observed event rate is commonly lower than that anticipated from the patient's history before randomization. Moreover, patients in efficacy trials commonly have lower rates of exacerbation than seen in studies with less strict inclusion criteria.

### Influence of age on real-life effects of doxycycline for acute exacerbations among COPD outpatients: a population-based cohort study [^116gKGwn]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory disease and a leading cause of death worldwide. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) characterised by the sudden worsening of respiratory symptoms may accelerate the progress of COPD and contribute significantly to worsened patients' health status, mortality and medical costs. As about 50% of AECOPD are triggered by bacterial infections, the use of antibiotics has become a common component in the therapeutic management of AECOPD.

The evidence on the benefits of oral corticosteroids for AECOPD is of high quality. However, the effects of antibiotics in addition to corticosteroids are still uncertain, especially in an outpatient setting. A Cochrane review in 2012 did not show a significant reduced risk of treatment failure by antibiotics. Although treatment guidelines in 2017 conditionally recommended antibiotics for AECOPD among outpatients, this recommendation was based on synthesised evidence from only two earlier randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In the same year, a new large RCT concluded that antibiotics for AECOPD in an outpatient setting are not effective. Later in 2018, an updated Cochrane review included two more RCTs than in 2012and showed statistically significant beneficial effects of antibiotics. Of note, while most RCTs focused on the short-term effect of antibiotics, the long-term effect in outpatient settings also remains unclear due to conflicting results.

The majority of AECOPD is treated in primary care and establishing a bacterial infection diagnosis with sputum cultures is not always feasible in routine practice due to technical reasons. Therefore, accurate prescribing of antibiotics according to guidelines is still low. Notably, many studies indicate that the susceptibility to infections increases with age. According to a large population-based observational study, the protective effect of antibiotics against pneumonia is more pronounced in older patients. Thus, we hypothesised that older patients may benefit more from empirical antibiotic treatment for AECOPD than younger patients.

In addition to prednisone or prednisolone, doxycycline is one of the first-choice oral antibiotics for AECOPD if antibiotic treatment is indicated. Since only one RCT studied doxycycline, we conducted a cohort study to evaluate if doxycycline has meaningful value added to oral corticosteroids on AECOPD in both the short-term and longer-term for outpatients, and examined the potential effect modification across age groups.

### Is one exacerbation enough to modify therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? [^114Bb3oo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

To address the question posed in the title, on the basis of the data presented by Vanfleteren and colleagues, yes, it does appear that one steroid-treated AECOPD is enough to merit an escalation in the maintenance therapy of COPD. Some questions do remain. This analysis limited moderate exacerbations to those treated with a course of steroids, which is not always used in the treatment of AECOPD. Thus, one question to be addressed is whether these results would be similar in patients whose outpatient exacerbations were just treated with a course of antibiotics or other interventions. The second question relates to those patients in Category E, which can currently be attained by one hospitalized AECOPD or two outpatient AECOPDs. The presence of a COPD hospitalization may require a dramatically different approach compared with that taken for those patients with only outpatient exacerbations, such as extended use of nebulized therapies, mandatory use of inhaled steroids, and referral to pulmonary rehabilitation. Thus, the second question to be addressed concerns how outcomes vary between patients in Category E with and without a COPD hospitalization. This may ultimately require the development of a new "Category H" that focuses on hospitalized patients with COPD and the special interventions that these patients need. The final question that needs to be addressed is whether the new suggested criteria for the classification of severe AECOPD can be applied in a population such as this and result in differential outcomes.

To conclude, one moderate exacerbation, as defined in this study, was enough to increase substantially the risk of a future exacerbation and should lead to an escalation of therapy.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^117DMbKt]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Exacerbations are important events in COPD. Management of the acute event remains dependent on inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, oral corticosteroids and antibiotics, with or without oxygen and ventilatory support. Comorbidities should be addressed. Given the importance of these events, effective care should also include deployment of strategies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce future exacerbations. Although new approaches are in development, a major current challenge is to understand which strategies to use in which patients at which stage of their disease. COPD exacerbations are heterogeneous events occurring in a heterogeneous disease and there is no 'one size fits all' approach to COPD exacerbation management and prevention.

### Care-seeking and delay of care during COPD exacerbations [^115V2gxr]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients who receive earlier treatment for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a better prognosis, including earlier symptom resolution and reduced risk of future emergency-department visits (ED) or hospitalizations. However, many patients delay seeking care or do not report worsening symptoms to their healthcare provider. In this study, we aimed to understand how patients perceived their breathing symptoms and identify factors that led to seeking or delaying care for an acute exacerbation of COPD. We conducted semistructured interviews with 60 individuals following a recent COPD exacerbation. Participants were identified from a larger study of outpatients with COPD by purposive sampling by exacerbation type: 15 untreated, 15 treated with prednisone and/or antibiotics in the outpatient setting, 16 treated in an urgent care or ED setting, and 14 hospitalized. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Participants were primarily male (97%) with a mean age of 69.1 ± 6.9 years, mean FEV 1 1.42 (± 0.63), and mean mMRC dyspnea of 2.7 (± 1.1). We identified 4 primary themes: (i) access and attitudinal barriers contribute to reluctance to seek care, (ii) waiting is a typical response to new exacerbations, (iii) transitioning from waiting to care-seeking: the tipping point, and (iv) learning from and avoiding worse outcomes. Interventions to encourage earlier care-seeking for COPD exacerbations should consider individuals' existing self-management approaches, address attitudinal barriers to seeking care, and consider health-system changes to increase access to non-emergent outpatient treatment for exacerbations. Clinical Trial Registration NCT02725294.

### A retrospective analysis to identify predictors of COPD-related rehospitalization [^113faPdU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airflow limitation and is associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the lungs to noxious particles or gases. Although the primary effect of COPD is on the lungs, it is also associated with the development of adverse systemic effects and comorbidities, which contribute to its severity. COPD is a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality; worldwide in 2010, it affected more than 210 million individuals and was one of the top six leading causes of death. In 2015, the World Health Organization estimated that approximately 65 million individuals had moderate-to-severe COPD and projected it to become the third leading cause of death globally by 2030. In 2012, chronic lower respiratory diseases, including COPD, were the third leading cause of deaths in the United States and, in 2013, an estimated 15.7 million adults had physician-diagnosed COPD. In 2012, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) estimated that around 12 million individuals in the United States had undiagnosed COPD.

Patients with COPD often experience acute worsening of respiratory symptoms, known as exacerbations, which range in severity from mild events that patients manage themselves at home to severe episodes that require hospitalization. Recurrent COPD exacerbations, particularly those requiring hospitalization, have been shown to hasten lung function decline and increase patient mortality, as well as have a deleterious impact on health-related quality of life. According to the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society task force, indications for hospitalization of patients with an exacerbation include: occurrence of high-risk comorbidities (e.g. pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, renal or liver failure); inadequate response of symptoms to outpatient management; marked increase in dyspnea; inability to eat or sleep because of symptoms; worsening hypoxemia or hypercapnia; alterations in mental status; inability of patients to care for themselves (lack of home support); uncertain diagnosis; and inadequate home care.

### Development of a patient-centred, evidence-based and consensus-based discharge care bundle for patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111T4mwu]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, chronic lung disease characterised by progressive and not fully reversible airflow limitation. Acute exacerbations of COPD are defined by worsening in patients' baseline symptoms of dyspnoea, cough and sputum (quantity and purulence); exacerbations become more frequent and severe as the disease progresses. These events constitute the single most important determinant of health status in patients with COPDand account for increased morbidity, frequent emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalisations and death.

A cornerstone of COPD management is preventing acute exacerbations of COPD and breaking the cycle of recurrence. A large body of evidence supports both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to reduce the risk of acute exacerbations of COPD and improve overall health status. Despite this evidence, important care gaps remain as patients are often discharged from hospital or the ED following an acute exacerbation of COPD with no clear plan to prevent future episodes. Information exchange between hospital, ED and primary care physicians about the acute exacerbation of COPD is often incomplete or unavailable at the first postdischarge outpatient appointment. Often, patients and families assume care coordination responsibilities and personally convey follow-up instructions to primary care physicians. Information is sometimes provided verbally, and patients often struggle with health literacy issues. This creates a critical situation in which inaccurate information is translated from acute to community care settings. There is a need to improve transitions of care for patients with COPD across ED, hospital and community settings and ensure coordination and continuity of care.

### When should acute exacerbations of COPD be treated with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics in primary care: a systematic review of current COPD guidelines [^116rAGqK]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted in Web of Science, SCOPUS, SveMed+, PubMed, Embase, Cihnal (EBsco) and Ovid MD to identify COPD guidelines. Throughout the entire search, 'COPD' as Mesh-term was used whenever applicable. If a database did not support Mesh-terms, 'COPD' was searched in keywords, abstract and title. 'COPD' was combined with the search phrases 'guideline' and 'recommendation'. The search string used throughout the search was as follows:
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease AND (Guideline OR Recommendation).

Our initial search was performed with a time limit set for publications between 2003 and 2013. It was then extended to 8 May 2014 to ensure the inclusion of any new publications during our work on this project. Eligibility assessment was conducted by the first and the last author, and the approach from the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement was followed(Figure 1). To avoid overlooking documents that were published elsewhere than in the searched databases, a supplemental search was conducted in the guideline databases UpToDate, Best Practice, National Guideline Clearinghouse, Cochrane Library, Guidelines International Network and websites of the Canadian Medical Association, and American College of Physicians. Furthermore, websites of national health authorities (Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Switzerland, and Netherlands) were searched for eligible guidelines. This search was not repeated after 2013. Only guidelines and published documents with recommendations on adults with AECOPD and/or infectious diseases of the lungs when containing AECOPD were included in this study. They also had to be published in English, German, Dutch, or a Scandinavian language. The most recent guideline from each country was included. The included guidelines were analysed in terms of guideline development by applying criteria from the AGREE II tool (Appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation II). The criteria applied belonged to the domains 2 (stakeholder involvement), 3 (rigor of development), and 6 (editorial independence). We extracted recommendations about patient assessment for treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics. If recommendations were given separately for inpatients and outpatients, only those for outpatients were considered. Evidence explicitly linked to the recommendations, as described in domain 3 of the AGREE II tool, was obtained, and randomised controlled trials published in scientific medical journals were assessed in terms of study setting, study design, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Furthermore, we decided to add the trials included in the latest versions of the Cochrane reviews about treating AECOPD with systemic corticosteroidsand antibiotics, although not directly referred to in the guidelines.

### A 7-point evidence-based care discharge protocol for patients hospitalized for exacerbation of COPD: consensus strategy and expert recommendation [^116tZ8TX]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic, progressive lung disease, accounting for 3.2 million deaths every year. Acute exacerbation of COPD (ECOPD), defined as " an event characterized by dyspnea and/or cough and sputum that worsens over less than 14 days ", is an important event in the course of COPD because it causes significant deterioration of physical, mental and social health, hastens disease progression, increases the risk of dying and causes a substantial economic loss not only to the patient and his/her family, but also to the society.

In-hospital mortality for ECOPD ranges from 2.5 to 25%, and among those who survive, 25–55% get readmitted. The 2-year and 5-year mortality rates after hospitalization for ECOPD are 26% and 58%, respectively. Readmission rates for ECOPD are the highest among all chronic disease conditions. In a systematic review of 57 studies from 30 different countries, readmission rates for COPD were reported to be 2.6–82% at 30 days, 11.8–45% at 31–90 days, 18–63% at 180 days, and 25–87% at 365 days.

### Building toolkits for COPD exacerbations: lessons from the past and present [^113rXDqd]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

Exacerbation treatment

Despite a greater understanding of the biology and complexity of COPD exacerbations, this has not (yet) translated into novel therapies to treat exacerbations. There has been no new intervention to treat COPD exacerbations since the widespread adoption of non-invasive ventilation to treat exacerbations with hypercapnoeic respiratory failure in the early 1990s. From the first introduction of guidelines such as GOLD in 1997, the therapy for an exacerbation is unchanged. As described below, despite being commonly used, there remain significant research knowledge gaps in determining which exacerbations do and do not require treatments with antibiotics and corticosteroids.

Systemic corticosteroids were first used in rheumatological disease during the late 1940s. Despite evidence in the late 1980s that many hospitalised patients were being treated with systemic corticosteroids, it was only at the turn of the millennium that small randomised clinical trails (RCTs)first documented clinical efficacy, suggesting benefit on lung function and outcomes such as length of hospital stay. Around the same time, the first small outpatient trials of steroids at exacerbation reported, with modest benefits confirmed in a larger 2003 RCT. Later it was defined that short course (5 days) treatment was as effective as longer 14 day courses, and without the need to taper dose. With a greater emphasis on exacerbation phenotyping, more recent studies have documented the ability to safely withhold steroids in exacerbations without an eosinophil signal. However, the practicality of achieving this at point-of-care, and the optimal blood eosinophil cut-off to guide steroid therapy remain to be determined, and there are ongoing trials in the area. Given the toxicity associated with repeated courses of corticosteroids, the need for effective novel anti-inflammatory agents is also great. Disappointingly, there is no evidence of benefit with the anti-TNF agent entanerceptor roflumilast, for example.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a need for action [^115EH1uW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with exacerbations contributing strongly to the overall severity and burden of disease at the individual level. Many patients with COPD are managed predominantly in the primary care setting; therefore, primary care physicians (PCPs) must be aware of and understand the causes, effects, and management of COPD exacerbations. This review offers practical information about how exacerbations are defined in the treatment setting, pathogenic and environmental causes, options for exacerbation treatment and prevention, and suggestions for improving care in the clinic. Exacerbations have a strong negative effect on patients and are associated with an increased risk of further exacerbations and decreases in lung function. Thus, it is important that exacerbations not requiring hospitalization be identified and confidently managed in the clinical setting. Understanding treatment options for acute exacerbations and maintenance treatment to prevent future exacerbations may help PCPs better understand what they can do to support their patients. This review aims to provide useful guidance for PCPs to identify exacerbations and adjust their practice for optimal management of exacerbations in patients with COPD. It also aims to encourage PCPs that they have an important task in integrating effective COPD management into the primary care setting.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a Primer for emergency physicians [^115PLUcA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) impose a significant burden on patients and the emergency health care system. Patients with COPD who present to the emergency department (ED) often have comorbidities that can complicate their management.

Objective

To discuss strategies for the management of acute exacerbations in the ED, from initial assessment through disposition, to enable effective patient care and minimize the risk of treatment failure and prevent hospital readmissions.

Discussion

Establishing a correct diagnosis early on is critical; therefore, initial evaluations should be aimed at differentiating COPD exacerbations from other life-threatening conditions. Disposition decisions are based on the intensity of symptoms, presence of comorbidities, severity of the disease, and response to therapy. Patients who are appropriate for discharge from the ED should be prescribed evidence-based treatments and smoking cessation to prevent disease progression. A patient-centric discharge care plan should include medication reconciliation; bedside "teach-back", wherein patients demonstrate proper inhaler usage; and prompt follow-up.

Conclusions

An effective assessment, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate discharge plan for patients with AECOPD could improve treatment outcomes, reduce hospitalization, and decrease unplanned repeat visits to the ED.

### Disease management program for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized controlled trial [^112TewBs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

The effect of disease management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not well established.

Objectives

To determine whether a simplified disease management program reduces hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits due to COPD.

Methods

We performed a randomized, adjudicator-blinded, controlled, 1-year trial at five Veterans Affairs medical centers of 743 patients with severe COPD and one or more of the following during the previous year: hospital admission or ED visit for COPD, chronic home oxygen use, or course of systemic corticosteroids for COPD. Control group patients received usual care. Intervention group patients received a single 1- to 1.5-hour education session, an action plan for self-treatment of exacerbations, and monthly follow-up calls from a case manager.

Measurements and Main Results

We determined the combined number of COPD-related hospitalizations and ED visits per patient. Secondary outcomes included hospitalizations and ED visits for all causes, respiratory medication use, mortality, and change in Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire. After 1 year, the mean cumulative frequency of COPD-related hospitalizations and ED visits was 0.82 per patient in usual care and 0.48 per patient in disease management (difference, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.15–0.52; P < 0.001). Disease management reduced hospitalizations for cardiac or pulmonary conditions other than COPD by 49%, hospitalizations for all causes by 28%, and ED visits for all causes by 27% (P < 0.05 for all).

Conclusions

A relatively simple disease management program reduced hospitalizations and ED visits for COPD. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00126776).

### Medication regimens for managing COPD exacerbations [^114ziMd3]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Exacerbations are a hallmark feature of COPD and contribute to morbidity and mortality. There is general agreement that the pharmacotherapy of COPD exacerbations includes bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Strong evidence exists for the benefit of corticosteroids for exacerbations and of antibiotics in the acute hospital setting. There remains considerable uncertainty, however, in the best drug selection, dose, route, and duration of treatment. This article reviews the evidence base and expert recommendations for drug treatment of COPD exacerbations in the out-patient and in-patient settings.

### Severity distribution and treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in China: baseline results of an observational study [^115jYmvj]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receives low awareness and is undertreated in China. Understanding the burden and treatment of COPD across the nation is important for improving quality of care for this disease. This study aims to reveal the current situation of COPD severity distribution and management across China.

Methods

Baseline data from REALizing and Improving Management of Stable COPD in China, a multicentre, prospective, longitudinal, observational study, were analysed. Patients diagnosed with COPD as per Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2016 (GOLD 2016) criteria were enrolled from 50 randomly selected hospitals (tertiary, 25; secondary, 25) across six geographical regions. Data were collected in routine clinical settings.

Results

Between 15 December 2017 and 6 August 2020, 5013 patients were enrolled and 4978 included in the full analysis set. Of these, 2459 (49.4%) reported ≥ 1 exacerbation within 12 months prior to study enrolment, with a mean annual rate of 0.9/patient, including 0.2/patient and 0.5/patient leading to emergency room visits and hospitalisation, respectively. Spirometry graded 458 (10.1%), 1886 (41.7%), 1558 (34.5%), and 616 (13.6%) were GOLD stage I-IV, and 536 (11.4%), 1034 (22.0%), 563 (12.0%), and 2566 (54.6%) were classified as GOLD 2016 Group A-D, respectively, without evident regional variations. Inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta 2 -agonist (ICS/LABA, 1316 [26.4%]), ICS/LABA plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist (ICS/LABA+LAMA, 871 [17.5%]), and LAMA (754 [15.1%]) were prescribed at high rates across all groups and regions. Medications not recommended by GOLD were commonly prescribed (TCM, 578 [11.6%]; others, 951 [19.1%]), and 681 (13.7%) were not given ICS or long-acting bronchodilators.

Conclusions

Disease burden among Chinese COPD outpatients is high. Improved guideline adherence for COPD treatment is needed. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT03131362.

### Exacerbation-free COPD: a goal too far? [^113HEPP5]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

The seventh Lund COPD workshop focused on exacerbations. As chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) progresses, exacerbations, events characterized by acute worsening of symptoms, increase in frequency and severity. Patients fear their occurrence, as they compromise function and quality of life, may require admission to the hospital, and can be fatal. There are therapies that improve outcome of exacerbations, such as antibiotics and corticosteroids. More importantly, some treatments, such as regular inhaled bronchodilator therapy (particularly with long-acting agents), inhaled corticosteroids, and vaccination against influenza virus, can partially prevent attacks. However, exacerbations remain a challenge, as no therapy effectively banishes them. The current symposium, "Exacerbation-free COPD, a goal too far?", was designed to address this problem. The challenge addressed by the participants was whether more effective treatments could be developed that could further eliminate COPD exacerbations.

### The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease report and practice implications for the respiratory therapist [^114KADo3]. Respiratory Care (2017). Low credibility.

Since 1998, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has worked with health care professionals, medical researchers, and public health officials around the world to optimize the prevention, treatment, and management of COPD. GOLD has continually worked to ensure COPD management strategy recommendations are aligned with current published research. The 2017 GOLD report represents a major revision to GOLD strategy guidelines, the first such major revision in the last 5 years. As such, the 2017 report has significant implications for the diagnosis of COPD, the management of stable disease, and the treatment of exacerbations. As respiratory therapists (RTs) are front-line clinical professionals throughout the COPD continuum of care, a thorough understanding of the new GOLD recommendations for practice is critical. New recommendations regarding diagnosis, severity assessment, and both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of COPD are presented, and suggestions for how RTs can integrate these recommendations into COPD care practices are provided.

Managing the presenting problem. Is it a COPD exacerbation?

A COPD exacerbation is defined as 'an acute event characterised by a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variation and leads to change in medications'. The worsening symptoms are usually increased dyspnoea, increased sputum volume and increased sputum purulence. All these symptoms are present in our patient who experiences an exacerbation triggered by a viral upper respiratory tract infection — the most common cause of COPD exacerbations. Apart from the management of the acute exacerbation that could include antibiotics, oral steroids and increased use of short-acting bronchodilators, special attention should be given to his on-going treatment to prevent future exacerbations. Short-term use of systemic corticosteroids and a course of antibiotics can shorten recovery time, improve lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1)) and arterial hypoxaemia and reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure and length of hospital stay. Short-acting inhaled β 2 -agonists with or without short-acting anti-muscarinics are usually the preferred bronchodilators for the treatment of an acute exacerbation.

Reviewing his routine treatment

One of the concerns about this patient is that his COPD is inadequately treated. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) suggests that COPD management be based on a combined assessment of symptoms, GOLD classification of airflow limitation, and exacerbation rate. The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scoreor the COPD Assessment Tool (CAT)could be used to evaluate the symptoms/health status. History suggests that his breathlessness has begun to interfere with his lifestyle, but this has not been formally asssessed since the diagnosis 6 years ago. Therefore, one would like to be certain that these elements are taken into consideration in future management by involving other members of the health care team. The fact that he had two to three exacerbations per year puts the patient into GOLD category C–D (see Figure 1) despite the moderate airflow limitation. Our patient is only being treated with short-acting bronchodilators; however, this is only appropriate for patients who belong to category A. Treatment options for patients in category C or D should include long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) or long-acting β 2 -agonists (LABAs), which will not only improve his symptoms but also help prevent future exacerbations. Used in combination with LABA or LAMA, inhaled corticosteroids also contribute to preventing exacerbations.

### The impact of integrated disease management in high-risk COPD patients in primary care [^117Qunk6]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease characterized by increasing symptoms, decreasing (QoL), and increasing frequency of exacerbations. – These inter-related patient outcomes are the foundational elements of the current Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) severity classification (A–D).GOLD A and B patients are low and medium-risk patients who infrequently experience exacerbations. Collectively, GOLD C and D patients are high-risk patients defined by frequent exacerbations and/or a severe exacerbation requiring hospitalization. The high-risk "frequent-exacerbation" COPD phenotype persists over time, and accounts for one-third of the COPD patient population. Exacerbations exact a substantial personal toll on COPD patients, reducing their QoL significantly. – In addition, COPD-related hospitalization accounts for more than half the cost of managing COPD in our health systems. International practice guidelines recommend effective pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions to specifically address these patient and health system outcomes; however, the impact of these recommendations on high-risk COPD patients in our communities has been limited by a substantial knowledge-to-care implementation gap.

The majority of COPD patients are managed by primary care practitioners. Although evidence-based management of COPD is increasingly complex, primary care providers manage high-risk COPD patients with multiple comorbidities within health systems that have enduring challenges. There are diagnostic barriers related to spirometry access and utilization. – There is a low level of provider knowledge of COPD clinical practice guidelines. – Chronic management of severe COPD requires multiple medications provided in different inhalation devices. To achieve self-efficacy, patients require self-management education and ongoing support. In practical terms, these evidence-based objectives are difficult to achieve by individual practitioners within the context of a regular clinical encounter. Thus, in practice, a minority of patients have an objectively confirmed diagnosis, or action plan, receive smoking cessation counseling, and for many medications, are under-prescribed relative to disease severity. – Narrowing the knowledge-to-care implementation gap in primary care requires transformative innovation.

### Real-world effectiveness study of guideline-directed COPD STANDARDized management in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a cluster randomised trial design [^116W4UBD]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Objectives

It is hypothesised that guideline-directed COPD management can reduce moderate-to-severe exacerbations, comparing standardised management (SM) to usual care (UC) groups. The primary outcome is exacerbations measured as healthcare resource utilisation (HRU) events. Secondary objectives include exacerbation-related admissions, time to first moderate/severe exacerbation, changes in lung function, symptoms, exercise tolerance, mortality, self-management, adherence to interventions and direct healthcare costs.

### The DOSE index in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: evaluating healthcare costs [^1159wo4v]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study confirms that the DOSE index is strongly associated with various healthcare parameters, including the number of outpatient visits, outpatient medical expenses, hospitalization frequency, hospitalization days, hospitalization expenses, and total healthcare costs. The DOSE index emerges as a valuable tool for predicting healthcare costs in COPD patients and offers clinicians a comprehensive framework for effective disease management and resource allocation. By integrating both clinical severity and exacerbation frequency, the DOSE index provides actionable insights for optimizing the care of COPD patients.

### Long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) plus long-acting β-agonist (LABA) versus LABA plus inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^112p64Qh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Three classes of inhaler medications are used to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): long-acting beta-agonists (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). When two classes of medications are required, LAMA plus LABA (LAMA+LABA) and LABA plus ICS (LABA+ICS) are often selected because these combinations can be administered via a single medication device. The previous Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidance recommended LABA+ICS as the first-line treatment for managing stable COPD in high-risk people of categories C and D. However, the updated GOLD 2017 guidance recommends LAMA+LABA over LABA+ICS.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of LAMA+LABA versus LABA+ICS for treatment of people with stable COPD.

Search Methods

We performed an electronic search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (2 February 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (4 June 2016), and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal (4 June 2016), followed by a handsearch (5 June 2016). Two review authors screened and scrutinised the selected articles.

Selection Criteria

We included individual randomised controlled trials, parallel-group trials, and cross-over trials comparing LAMA+LABA and LABA+ICS for stable COPD. The minimum accepted trial duration was one month and trials should have been conducted in an outpatient setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and evaluated risk of bias. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (OR), and continuous data as mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence interval (CI) using Review Manager 5. Exacerbations were measured by counting the number of people experiencing one or more exacerbation.

Main Results

We included 11 studies comprising 9839 participants in our quantitative analysis. Most studies included people with moderate to severe COPD, without recent exacerbations. One pharmaceutical sponsored trial that included only people with recent exacerbations was the largest study and accounted for 37% of participants. All but one study were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, thus we rated them as having a high risk of 'other bias'. The unsponsored study was at high risk of performance and detection bias, and possible selective reporting. Five studies recruited GOLD Category B participants, one study recruited Category D participants, two studies recruited Category A/B participants, and three studies recruited participants regardless of category. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 52 weeks. Compared to the LABA+ICS arm, the results for the pooled primary outcomes for the LAMA+LABA arm were as follows: exacerbations, OR 0.82 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.96, P = 0.01, I² = 17%, low quality evidence); serious adverse events (SAE), OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.05, P = 0.18, I² = 0, moderate quality evidence); St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score change from the baseline, MD -1.22 (95% CI -2.52 to 0.07, P = 0.06, I² = 71%, low quality evidence); and trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) change from the baseline, MD 0.08 L (95% CI 0.06 to 0.09, P < 0.0001, I² = 50%, moderate quality evidence). Compared to the LABA+ICS arm, the results for the pooled secondary outcomes for the LAMA+LABA arm were as follows: pneumonia, OR 0.57 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79, P = 0.0006, I² = 0%, low quality evidence); all-cause death, OR 1.01 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.67, P = 0.88, I² = 0%, low quality evidence); and SGRQ total score change from the baseline of 4 points or greater (the minimal clinically important difference for the SGRQ is 4 points), OR 1.25 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.44, P = 0.002, I² = 0%, moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

For the treatment of COPD, LAMA+LABA has fewer exacerbations, a larger improvement of FEV 1, a lower risk of pneumonia, and more frequent improvement in quality of life as measured by an increase over 4 units or more of the SGRQ. These data were supported by low or moderate quality evidence generated from mainly participants with moderate to severe COPD in heterogeneous trials with an observation period of less than one year. Our findings support the recently updated GOLD guidance.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113iwPgX]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Module B: Management of acute COPD exacerbations — Patients presenting with an acute exacerbation to primary care are assessed/triaged and the need for emergency department or inpatient admission is determined. If there is such an indication, initiate short-acting acute bronchodilator therapy (albuterol ± ipratropium metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer or via nebulizer) and administer oxygen if necessary. If no indication exists, obtain history, physical exam, and tests as clinically indicated to evaluate for alternate diagnoses, and initiate short-acting acute bronchodilator therapy (albuterol ± ipratropium MDI with spacer or via nebulizer) and administer oxygen if necessary. Acute symptoms are evaluated for resolution; if not resolved, consider: continuing short-acting bronchodilator therapy; initiating long-acting bronchodilator therapy; initiating steroid therapy (see Sidebar 4); initiating antibiotic therapy (see Sidebar 5). If symptoms are resolved, arrange follow-up, instruct the patient to contact clinic if the condition deteriorates, and return to the primary care pathway (see Module A).

### Pharmacologic management of COPD exacerbations… [^115UED8i]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The goals for management of acute exacerbations of COPD include symptom resolution and recovery from the exacerbation episode via improving airflow and gas exchange in addition to reducing lung inflammation. Prevention or reduction of severity of subsequent exacerbation episodes is also a goal for many management and prevention strategies. Typical interventions used for the management of COPD exacerbations include corticosteroids, systemic antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators, and supplemental oxygen. Surprisingly, there is limited evidence for many of these treatments in this population. Several nonpharmacologic treatments have also been assessed for management and/or prevention of COPD exacerbations, including pulmonary rehabilitation programs, chest physiotherapy, and nutritional supplements. Chest physiotherapy includes the use of breathing techniques, vibration/percussion of the chest, and autogenic drainage.

Vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplements have also been highlighted as potential therapies for the prevention and management of acute exacerbations of COPD. Moderate quality of evidence showed that treatment of acute exacerbations with antibiotics improved the rate of clinical cure and decreased the rate of clinical failure in adult patients with COPD. 52 Another study assessed the effectiveness of an integrative approach with both telemedicine and discharge bundles. Patients in the integrative approach group had lower rates of hospital admissions and lower rates of readmission to the hospital for exacerbation episodes. 53 For acute treatment, integration of guideline recommendations for order sets have been used to standardize treatment of patients who present with acute exacerbations of COPD. 54 Order sets were shown to reduce length of hospital stay and readmissions. 55, 56 Additionally, standard order sets resulted in reduced errors in prescribing corticosteroids and antibiotics.

54, 55 Discharge bundles have also been used to provide additional patient education and other interventions to reduce hospital readmissions in patients with COPD. A 2017 systematic review assessed the effectiveness of different discharge bundles. Several services offered routinely in primary care are effective in preventing exacerbations of COPD, including smoking cessation counseling and immunizations. Hospitalization for acute exacerbations may serve as an opportunity to provide interventions for behavior change, such as smoking cessation counseling. 37, 38, 40 The AAFP recommendations for managing acute exacerbations of COPD are consistent with guidance from others. 37, 38 Both systemic antibiotics and corticosteroids were observed to significantly improve symptom resolution in this population as measured by increased clinical cure rates. Treatment with antibiotics also decreased clinical failure rate.

Treatment decisions should be based on clinical judgment and patient preferences and values, and involve shared decision-making by the patient and clinician.

### Guideline adherence in hospital recruited and population based COPD patients [^113ijXWQ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third-leading cause of death worldwide. COPD is characterized by chronic symptoms such as shortness of breath and coughing, and by exacerbations that are associated with a faster decline in lung function, increased socioeconomic burden, and mortality. There are several known environmental risk factors, like smoking, occupational exposure, and air pollution, which make effective disease prevention possible. Correct diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of its exacerbations have the potential of further reducing mortality, morbidity, and disease burden on the society.

There are several treatment options for COPD, and keeping up to date is time-consuming for health care providers. Reliable and regularly updated guidelines are therefore very valuable for clinicians, and help them provide the best care for their patients at any time. Despite available guidelines, these are not consistently implemented, and hence, their potential for reducing various aspects of disease burden is not taken advantage of.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) was launched in 1997 in collaboration with the National institute of Health in USA and the World Health Organisation. GOLD is an international organisation of COPD experts that has developed consensus documents for prevention and management of COPD based on the latest research and evidence. In many countries the GOLD recommendations are perceived as guidelines.

Evidence from several studies indicate that COPD is substantially under-diagnosed and that there is limited guideline adherence in several countries. So far, no systematic study on guideline adherence for COPD has been undertaken in Norway, and none of the mentioned studies from other countries have compared different sampling sources or patient categories. The reason for including both sampling sources was that previous studies have used differing samples and are therefore difficult to compare. Some show results from general practice, others from hospital-admitted or outpatient participants, and to our knowledge only one study has reported results from a general population. We wanted to evaluate both sampling sources with the same definitions and multivariate analyses to see if the results differed significantly.

The aim of the current study was to estimate and compare the guideline adherence to COPD treatment in hospital-recruited and population-based COPD patients. In addition, we analysed potential predictors of adherence that can help clinicians improve the care they provide.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116SWGkW]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Management of exacerbations — pharmacologic treatment: The goals for treatment of COPD exacerbations are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and to prevent subsequent events; short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an exacerbation, and maintenance therapy with long-acting bronchodilators should be initiated as soon as possible, with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to the double bronchodilator regimen considered in patients with frequent exacerbations and elevated blood eosinophil levels; in patients with severe exacerbations, systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time including hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days; antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should be 5 days; methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^112oFJDx]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — early prevention of rehospitalization with systemic corticosteroids: For patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD in the outpatient or inpatient setting, we suggest that systemic corticosteroids be given orally or intravenously to prevent hospitalization for subsequent acute exacerbations of COPD in the first 30 days following the initial exacerbation (Grade 2B). Underlying values and preferences place high value on reducing recurrent exacerbations in the first 30 days, recognize risks with short-term systemic corticosteroids including hyperglycemia, weight gain, and insomnia, and state that the benefits are believed to outweigh the risks.

### Factors associated with guideline-concordant maintenance inhaled medication for COPD: a population-based, longitudinal cohort study [^111fybMB]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite guideline recommendations, many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) do not receive or persist with guideline-concordant maintenance inhaled medications. We examined patient and health system factors associated with guideline concordance and persistence.

Methods

We conducted a population-based cohort study using administrative data from British Columbia, Canada (2011–2022). Patients aged ≥ 40 years with newly diagnosed COPD were included. Patients were classified as having high risk (≥ 2 outpatient or ≥ 1 inpatient exacerbation in the prior year) or low risk (≤ 1 outpatient exacerbation) of exacerbations, which we used to determine whether dispensed medications were concordant with guidelines. We used separate generalised linear models to evaluate the association between patient, clinical and health system factors and the initiation of guideline-concordant medications and subsequent persistence.

Results

We included 71996 patients with a mean follow-up of 6.15 years (SD 2.65). 30.42% of patients initiated guideline-concordant treatment. Among those who initiated, the mean proportion of days covered (PDC) by guideline-concordant regimens was 31.93%. Patients at high risk of exacerbations initiated guideline-concordant regimens more often than those at low risk (mean 70.4% vs 13.3%) and had a higher mean PDC (57.33% vs 26.35%) per patient-year. Pulmonologist care and additional outpatient visits increased both initiation (OR 5.14, 95%CI 4.88 to 5.41 and OR 1.25, 95%CI 1.24 to 1.26, respectively) and persistence (OR 1.13, 95%CI 1.09 to 1.17 and OR 1.019, 95%CI 1.015 to 1.024, respectively) with guideline-concordant medications.

Conclusion

Guideline-concordant use of maintenance inhaled medications is low. Increased access to outpatient and specialist care may support COPD management.

### Managing COPD exacerbations in primary care [^117WbJ1E]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common but underdiagnosed lung condition that is frequently managed inappropriately. It impacts poorest communities most, where health inequalities are greatest. New acute symptoms of breathlessness, cough, sputum production and wheeze should prompt clinical suspicion of underlying COPD in someone who is a current or ex-smoker (or has exposure to other risk factors) and be followed by referral for quality-assured spirometry once recovered. Management of COPD exacerbations in primary care includes use of short-acting bronchodilators if mild, and antibiotics and a short course of oral prednisolone if moderate/severe. Hospital at home schemes are safe and effective and should be considered for some patients exacerbating in the community; these are increasingly supported by remote monitoring ('virtual wards'). New or worsening hypoxia is an indication for hospital admission and therefore oxygen saturation monitoring is an important part of exacerbation management; clinicians should be aware of patient safety alerts around use of pulse oximeters. Exacerbations drive poor health status and lung function decline and therefore asking about exacerbation frequency at planned reviews and taking action to reduce these is an important part of long-term COPD care. An exacerbation is an opportunity to ensure that fundamentals of good care are addressed. Patients should be supported to understand and act on exacerbations through a supported self-management plan; prompt treatment is beneficial but should be balanced by careful antibiotic and corticosteroid stewardship. COPD rescue packs on repeat prescription are not recommended.

### REALizing and improving management of stable COPD in China: a multi-center, prospective, observational study to realize the current situation of COPD patients in China (REAL)-rationale, study design, and protocol [^113koWV2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fifth leading cause of death in China with a reported prevalence of 8.2% people aged ≥ 40 years. It is recommended that Chinese physicians follow Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and national guidelines, yet many patients with COPD in China remain undiagnosed. Furthermore, missed diagnoses and a lack of standardized diagnosis and treatment remain significant problems. The situation is further complicated by a lack of large-scale, long-term, prospective studies of real-world outcomes, including exacerbation rates, disease severity, efficacy of treatment, and compliance of COPD patients in China.

Methods/design

The REALizing and improving management of stable COPD in China (REAL) study is a 52-week multi-center, prospective, observational trial. REAL aims to recruit approximately 5000 outpatients aged ≥ 40 years with a clinical diagnosis of COPD per GOLD 2016. Outpatients will be consecutively recruited from approximately 50 tertiary and secondary hospitals randomly selected across six geographic regions to provide a representative population. Patients will receive conventional medical care as determined by their treating physicians.

The primary objective is to evaluate COPD patient outcomes including lung function, health status, exacerbations, hospitalization rate, and dyspnea following 1 year of current clinical practice. Secondary objectives are to assess disease severity, treatment patterns, adherence to medication, and associated risk factors. Data will be collected at two study visits, at patients' usual care visits, and by telephone interview every 3 months.

Discussion

Knowledge of COPD among physicians in China is poor. The REAL study will provide reliable information on COPD management, outcomes, and risk factors that may help improve the standard of care in China. Patient recruitment began on 30 June 2017 and the estimated primary completion date is 30 July 2019.
