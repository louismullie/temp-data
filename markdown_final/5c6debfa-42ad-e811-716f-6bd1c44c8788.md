## Question

Mrs. Brown paid her utility bills with 3 $50 bills and 2 $10 bills. How much are her utility bills?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much Mrs. Brown's utility bills total if she paid with 3 fifty-dollar bills and 2 ten-dollar bills. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the denomination and quantity of each bill. Then, I should calculate the total contribution from the fifty-dollar bills. Next, I will calculate the total contribution from the ten-dollar bills. Finally, I will add the two subtotals to get the final amount and double-check my arithmetic to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the components: Mrs. Brown used 3 bills of $50 each and 2 bills of $10 each, so the calculation will be (3 × $50) + (2 × $10) [^notfound].

> I will now examine the fifty-dollar bills: 3 × $50 equals $150, so the larger-denomination bills contribute $150 toward the total bill [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the ten-dollar bills: 2 × $10 equals $20, so the smaller-denomination bills contribute $20 toward the total bill [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to add the subtotals to get the final amount: $150 + $20 equals $170, so Mrs. Brown's utility bills total $170 [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the arithmetic one more time to ensure there wasn't a mistake: 3 × 50 is indeed 150, and 2 × 10 is 20, and 150 + 20 is 170. The calculation checks out [^notfound].

---

Mrs. Brown's utility bills total **$170**. This is calculated as (3 × $50) + (2 × $10) = $150 + $20 = $170.

---

## Calculation breakdown

| **Bill denomination** | **Quantity** | **Total value** |
|-|-|-|
| $50 | 3 | $150 |
| $10 | 2 | $20 |
| **Total** | ∅ | **$170** |

---

Therefore, Mrs. Brown's utility bills amount to **$170**.

### Weights for ordinal analyses of the modified rankin scale in stroke trials: a population-based cohort study [^5d8cde4f]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Similar non-linear relationships were observed between 3-month mRS and health/social care costs and QALE over post-stroke years 1 through 5 (Table.1. Appendix 22). Costs generally rose and QALE fell with rising mRS scores (Fig. 2), but again the curves were generally flatter between mRS 0–2 with a step-change at 2–3 (e.g. mean difference in 5-year QALE for mRS 0 versus 1 = 0.38, 95%CI 0.19–0.57; 1 vs 2 = 0.48, 0.31–0.66; 2 vs 3 = 1.15, 0.94–1.33). The lowest mean difference in QALYs at 5-years between two mRS grades in our cohort was 0.38 (mRS = 0 vs mRS = 1), which was considerably higher than the estimated MCIDs for utility of 0.04–0.10 in other diseases. Whereas QALEs showed a greater drop between mRS 4 and 5 than between mRS 3 and 4 (e.g. mean difference in 5-year QALE for mRS 3 vs 4: 0.57, 95%CI 0.31–0.81; 4 vs 5: 1.23, 0.90–1.57), there was essentially a linear trend in costs between mRS 3, 4, and 5 (e.g. mean difference at 5-years for mRS 3 vs 4: $19,476, 95%CI $5,700–33,318; 4 vs 5: $19,272, -$1,141–40,510). Similar results were obtained upon excluding patients with pre-morbid mRS > 2 or > 1 (Appendix 23 and 24). When results were stratified by age (Appendix 25 and 26) and sex (Appendix 27 and 28), the main difference was that cost curves between mRS 0–2 were flatter and changed little over 5-years for men and those aged < 75 (Appendix.25, 27). Generally higher healthcare utilization among women resulted in a less pronounced step-change in costs between mRS 2 and 3 in women (e.g. mean difference in 5-year costs for mRS 2 vs 3 in men: $38,462, 95%CI $25,768–51,242; in women: $25,275, $11,314–37,979). 3-month mRS = 5 was associated with near-zero QALE at all follow-up years, with mean 5-year QALE < 0 (-0.22) in those aged < 75. Overall, 5-year QALE "weights" estimated for different groups were similar to those from the whole cohort, generally differing by ≤ 0.50 (Appendix 29).

Materials and methods

Outcome measurement and choice of analysis

A cost-utility analysis (CUA) was carried out in this economic evaluation. CUA aims to compare the total costs and health effects of alternative interventions, to determine which intervention yields the highest utility for the associated costs. CUA is regularly performed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to inform decisions on treatment provisions in the NHS.

The costs associated with EC and NC along with the patient's degree of disability post-surgery were measured in pound sterling (£s). Outcomes were measured in terms of the patient's postoperative modified Rankin scale (mRS) grade, a widely used 6-point disability scale aiming to quantify a patient's functional outcome following a stroke. Each mRS health state is shown in Table 1.

The categorical nature of the scale, however, means the mRS score may not account for potentially unequal differences in perceived quality of life associated with certain 1-point changes compared to others. For example, in assigning patients to categories ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death), the mRS score does not account for patients who may prefer death over the mRS 5 health state (bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant assistance). To account for this, the Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR VII) called for the development of a utility-weighted mRS (UW-mRS) that associates each mRS score with an established health utility scale. Rebchuk et al. pooled together 24 studies exploring utility weightings for the mRS score, calculating average utility weights for each mRS score using both the time trade-off and person trade-off techniques. In this study, the mRS score was weighed against the Euro-QoL 5-dimension (EQ-5D).

### Weights for ordinal analyses of the modified rankin scale in stroke trials: a population-based cohort study [^3722f875]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, cohort-derived data for clinical endpoints or health-economic outcomes of interest can be used to inform prognostication, cost-effectiveness, and weighted ordinal analyses of the mRS in clinical trials. Analyses of other stroke cohorts could validate our findings. Cohort studies of other neurological conditions may derive similar weights for commonly-used ordinal scales to examine their predictive validity and facilitate clinically-meaningful ordinal analyses.

Discussion

The primary aim of this review was to collate the available data describing the relationship between costs and outcomes based on the mRS scale categories. Establishing a reliable estimation of costs by mRS categories is highly relevant since it may provide an indirect method for undertaking cost-effectiveness analyses of novel interventions to be compared against usual care. This review, however, found that it was not possible to effectively undertake any meaningful analyses due to the heterogeneous nature of the identified studies and lack of long-term follow-up data.

We identified 13 studies incorporating cost of stroke relating to an mRS score; only three studies provided an estimate of people who later died from stroke (mRS 6). However, there was significant methodological heterogeneity which precluded the ability to make any meaningful comparison between the stated costs either at a single mRS category or across the scale. Tables 1 and 2 highlight this heterogeneity, showing the diversity in time horizon (30–540 days), included resources and study perspectives.

The time horizon for the collection of costs in these studies will have a large influence on the overall costs associated with stroke. Among the 13 studies identified, five recorded costs up until discharge, five at 90 days and five included costs for longer time frames (6 to 18 months) post stroke. Baeten et al.and Hayes et al.included costs at multiple time points. Costs in stroke are highly dependent on the time of collection with the intervention, rehabilitation and associated hospital costs concentrated in the acute phase (up to 90 days), while longer term costs including home health care, social services assistance, as well as productivity loss are more significant across a broader time period. This is highlighted in the two studies that considered longer term costs. Fattore et al.and Spieler et al.provided evidence that direct medical costs were initially high, but quickly plateaued and remained steady after the first 90 days. However, indirect costs such as productivity losses and paid care increased over timehighlighting the importance of including of capturing costs across a broader time horizon when considering the health economic impact of stroke.

### Health utility weighting of the modified rankin scale: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0ea5d6ee]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

The utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (UW-mRS) has been proposed as a patient-centered alternative primary outcome for stroke clinical trials. However, to date, there is no clear consensus on an approach to weighting the mRS.

Objective

To characterize the between-study variability in utility weighting of the mRS in a population of patients who experienced stroke and its implications when applied to the results of a clinical trial.

Data Sources

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched from January 1987 through May 2019 using major search terms for stroke, health utility, and mRS.

Study Selection

Original research articles published in English were reviewed. Included were studies with participants 18 years or older with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or subarachnoid hemorrhage, with mRS scores and utility weights evaluated concurrently. A total of 5725 unique articles were identified. Of these, 283 met criteria for full-text review, and 24 were included in the meta-analysis.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

PRISMA guidelines for systematic review were followed. Data extraction was performed independently by multiple researchers. Data were pooled using mixed models.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The mean utility weights and 95% CIs were calculated for each mRS score and health utility scale. Geographic differences in weighting for the EuroQoL 5-dimension (EQ-5D) and Stroke Impact Scale-based UW-mRS were explored using inverse variance-weighted linear models. The results of 18 major acute stroke trials cited in current guidelines were then reanalyzed using the UW-mRS weighting scales identified in the systematic review.

Results

The meta-analysis included 22 389 individuals; the mean (SD) age of participants was 65.9 (4.0) years, and the mean (SD) proportion of male participants was 58.2% (7.5%). For all health utility scales evaluated, statistically significant differences were observed between the mean utility weights by mRS score. For studies using an EQ-5D-weighted mRS, between-study variance was higher for worse (mRS 2–5) compared with better (mRS 0–1) scores. Of the 18 major acute stroke trials with reanalyzed results, 3 had an unstable outcome when using different UW-mRSs.

Conclusions and Relevance

Multiple factors, including cohort-specific characteristics and health utility scale selection, can influence mRS utility weighting. If the UW-mRS is selected as a primary outcome, the approach to weighting may alter the results of a clinical trial. Researchers using the UW-mRS should prospectively and concurrently obtain mRS scores and utility weights to characterize study-specific outcomes.

### Prescription drug prices: an AAN position statement [^80f4610d]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

AAN rationale — cost burden of neurologic therapies — emphasizes high-value care goals, MACRA pressures, and extreme therapy prices limiting access. Neurologists seek to provide high-value care for patients with neurologic diseases at the lowest cost possible and are mandated to reduce resource use as part of the Quality Payment Program, or MACRA, yet many therapies for neurologic diseases are among the most expensive in the United States; for example, Zynteglo, a newly approved therapy for Cerebral Adrenoleukodystrophy, is priced at $2.8 million for the expected single round of treatment. Given limited less expensive therapies, mechanisms are needed to reduce costs or support methods of paying outside the standard reimbursement process, and such cost reductions will improve the quality of life for many patients with neurologic disease and reduce the need for emergency/aggressive treatments by properly treating neurologic disease from the start.

### Understanding the relationship between costs and the modified rankin scale: a systematic review, multidisciplinary consensus and recommendations for future studies [^591597dd]. European Stroke Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our findings have provided a valuable insight into the heterogeneity seen in health economic reporting in the field of stroke, in particular for the most commonly collected stroke outcome measure used in trials, the mRS. This heterogeneity undermined the meaningful comparison of the included studies and until further data are available for systematic analysis, we recommend readers refer to the original source data when assessing critical quality and relevance to ongoing research. It has also outlined a need for more real world and trial data investigating health economic outcomes in stroke looking at both short and long-term costs related to the mRS as an ordinal scale. This work has provided a foundation from which to address the need for the development of guidelines for health economic data and promotion of its importance amongst current and future trialists in the area of stroke.

### Public unawareness of physician reimbursement [^e5e48de2]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Total cost: perception and value. Graphic results for perception of the total bill and what respondents think it should be (mean), broken down by procedure type. The Medicare reimbursement for each procedure is listed, based off 2015 rates. The minimum and maximum values for each procedure are as follows:

- New pacemaker implant (patients: $500–$200,000, physicians: $10,000–$50,000)
- Cardiac ablation (patients: $1,600–$150,000, physicians: $10,000–$50,000)
- Single stent placement (patients: $2,500–$157,000, physicians: $5,000–$35,000)
- Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (patients: $2,000–$250,000, physicians: $1,100–$12,000)
- Inguinal hernia repair (patients: $240–$180,000, physicians $3,000–$12,000)
- Colonoscopy (patients $500–$1,000,000, physicians: $800–$8,800)

Figure 2 summarizes the respondents' estimation (perception) of the physician fees compared to what they thought it should be (value). On average for all six procedures, physicians overestimated by about $430 ($1,019.00 perceived versus $589.25 Medicare) and felt the fee should have been higher at $1,547.80. Patients overestimated the physician fees by about $7,000 ($7,694.33 perceived versus $589.25 Medicare) but felt the fees should be less at $6,817.50. Again, using pacemaker implant as an example, patients believed that physicians were paid $9,430 per implant, and should be paid less at $6,691; still over 13 times higher than the Medicare rate of $507.

Costs

Costs were derived from a previous study (Table 2). Short term costs (< 90 days) consisted of costs for treatment, hospitalization and management of adverse events. Long term costs were attributed to the different mRS states, based on the OXVASC study, including costs of personal social services, such as nursing and residential care costs.

Table 2
Model input — costs

* Cost of the average treatment was adjusted for the estimated frequency of the treatment according to different studies. For IAT eligible patients, we assumed 85% to receive both IAT and intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), 10% to receive IAT only, and 5% to receive IVT and going for IAT but who appeared revascularised during angiography. For non-IAT-eligible patients we assumed 40% to receive IVT based on previous study and our local medical center data

IAT, intra-arterial thrombectomy; mRS, modified Rankin Scale Costs are rounded to the nearest integer

All costs were inflated to the level of 2019 according to the Consumer Price Index from the Office of National Statistics of the UK and were discounted at 4% annually. We report all costs in US dollars to ease interpretation by applying the 2019 average exchange rate (£1 = $1.283).

Health outcome

The health outcomes have been described in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) with 0 meaning death and 1 being in perfect health. The mRS scores were utility weighted based on the MR Clean trial (Table 3). Utilities were discounted at a rate of 1.5% annually.

### Modified rankin scale at 90 Days versus National Institutes of Health stroke scale at 24 hours as primary outcome in acute stroke trials [^850bc444]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) are most often measured with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days. The mRS is a 7‐point ordinal scale representing functional neurological disability, ranging from 0 (no deficits at all) to 6 (death). Randomized controlled trials are conducted to test novel treatments for diseases, and choosing an appropriate outcome measure is a critical step when designing a trial. The choice of the outcome determines the statistical approach to data analysis and the sample size that will be required.

The mRS assessed at 90 days after stroke onset has become the dominant primary outcome for studies assessing any acute stroke intervention for several reasons, including its use in the initial trials assessing intravenous thrombolysis, clear patient preference data, and acceptance by regulatory agencies as an outcome that patients understand and find meaningful. Academic guidelines and regulatory agencies have recognized and endorsed this choice meaning that, de facto, any new treatment needs to provide evidence of efficacy using the mRS at 90 days in a phase 3 trial before it can become widely accepted and endorsed in stroke treatment guidelines. Similarly, many practicing physicians would expect a new treatment to improve outcomes as measured by the mRS at 90 days before they use it in routine clinical practice.

Nevertheless, challenges remain when using the mRS at 90 days as a primary trial outcome. First, the mRS may show a ceiling effect, and hence poor discriminative value, among patients with mild stroke deficits. Such patients often score an mRS of 0 or 1 at 90 days, despite low subjective health utility. Second, the 90‐day follow‐up period allows for poor outcomes to arise from subsequent developments well after the stroke event and its treatment, particularly in older patients, perhaps institutionalized in nursing homes, who have multiple comorbidities. Practically, a 90‐day follow‐up period also increases trial duration and cost. For dose‐finding and other trials using adaptive randomization, in which the next patient allocation to a particular study arm is driven in part by prior patient outcome, having to wait for 90‐day measures also reduces efficiency of response profile exploration.

### Adopting a patient-centered approach to primary outcome analysis of acute stroke trials using a utility-weighted modified rankin scale [^54056fcc]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most commonly used primary end point in acute stroke trials, its power is limited when analyzed in dichotomized fashion and its indication of effect size challenging to interpret when analyzed ordinally. Weighting the 7 Rankin levels by utilities may improve scale interpretability while preserving statistical power.

Methods

A utility-weighted mRS (UW-mRS) was derived by averaging values from time-tradeoff (patient centered) and person-tradeoff (clinician centered) studies. The UW-mRS, standard ordinal mRS, and dichotomized mRS were applied to 11 trials or meta-analyses of acute stroke treatments, including lytic, endovascular reperfusion, blood pressure moderation, and hemicraniectomy interventions.

Results

Utility values were 1.0 for mRS level 0; 0.91 for mRS level 1; 0.76 for mRS level 2; 0.65 for mRS level 3; 0.33 for mRS level 4; 0 for mRS level 5; and 0 for mRS level 6. For trials with unidirectional treatment effects, the UW-mRS paralleled the ordinal mRS and outperformed dichotomous mRS analyses. Both the UW-mRS and the ordinal mRS were statistically significant in 6 of 8 unidirectional effect trials, whereas dichotomous analyses were statistically significant in 2 to 4 of 8. In bidirectional effect trials, both the UW-mRS and ordinal tests captured the divergent treatment effects by showing neutral results, whereas some dichotomized analyses showed positive results. Mean utility differences in trials with statistically significant positive results ranged from 0.026 to 0.249.

Conclusions

A UW-mRS performs similar to the standard ordinal mRS in detecting treatment effects in actual stroke trials and ensures the quantitative outcome is a valid reflection of patient-centered benefits.

Outcomes of Reaching Out to Billing Offices

For 32 (95% CI, 13.7%-32.8%) respondents (21.8%) who reported that their household reached out about a household bill, their problem was not solved yet (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Among the remaining respondents, nothing changed for 30.6% (95% CI, 19.7%-44.2%) of them. One-third (32.9%; 95% CI, 21.8%-46.4%) had a bill corrected and 23.2% (95% CI, 13.2%-37.6%) reported a better understanding of their bill. Many received financial relief in the forms of bill cancellation (9.3%; 95% CI, 2.7%-27.9%), financial assistance (10.4%; 95% CI, 4.4%-22.5%), price reduction (19.4%; 95% CI, 10.7%-32.7%), and/or setting up a payment plan (19.8%; 95% CI, 11.1%-32.9%). These outcomes are not mutually exclusive; many respondents reported multiple outcomes.

We evaluated resolutions stratified by the bill problem and reasons for reaching out (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Among 34 participants who could not afford their bill and reached out, 14 (49.0%; 95% CI, 26.3%-72.0%) received financial aid, bill cancellation, and/or price reductions. An additional 11 (26.8%; 95% CI, 11.5%-50.8%) received a payment plan. Overall, 75.8% of the respondents who could not afford their bill and reached out received some form of financial relief. Among 37 participants who thought their bill was too high because of a mistake and reached out, 25 (73.7%; 95% CI, 50.2%-88.7%) had their bill corrected. Among 14 participants who reached out wanting to negotiate the price, 10 (61.8%; 95% CI, 10.6%-76.3%) reported that the price was reduced.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness threshold for U.S. clinical guidelines — the writing committee "recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines," with the threshold to be "periodically reexamined," "not be adjusted annually for inflation," and "revised every 10 years (or sooner…)." Supporting estimates include a 2024 Personal Consumption Expenditure update that "suggests a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY," a welfare economics approach indicating willingness to pay tied to income ("per capita disposable income of $60 300… approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY"), and a population-level framework using World Bank data estimating "$95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY," translating to "$112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY" after GDP growth; while "no single method… can be considered the 'gold standard,'" these three approaches "produced similar results."

Cost of stroke by mRS category

Table 1 shows the total cost of stroke by mRS grade alongside any measures of uncertainty. The data collected from the studies are heterogeneous, with diverse resources recorded and included in the overall total cost per mRS grade (Table 2).

Table 2.
Perspective and resources collected in identified studies.

Table 3 shows all mRS scores aggregated with associated costs in a common currency (Euro) adjusted for inflation and PPP and presented according to the time of assessment. The range of costs reported for mRS 1 is €1614 to €26,079 and for mRS 4: €4,754 to €35,050. The evaluated studies represent a range of follow-up time points at which the costs were recorded. The majority present costs and mRS scores at discharge or at 90 days; but some studies only recorded costs until 10 days or after the initial stroke event or until hospital discharge. In contrast, the studies of Fattore et al.and Spieler et al.focussed on longer term time points, reporting mean costs for mRS 3 of €5722 and €21,324 over 12 and 18 months, respectively.

### Understanding the relationship between costs and the modified rankin scale: a systematic review, multidisciplinary consensus and recommendations for future studies [^c3c3c365]. European Stroke Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Even when considering the studies that focussed on collecting data from comparable time horizons, there remained a high level of variability between costs reported at each category. This can be accounted for by the heterogeneity in reported resources (Table 2). Of the four studies looking at costs at 90 days using the full ordinal mRS Dawson et al.and Christensen and Morrisfocused on length of stay as their primary cost metric. Additionally, Christensen and Morrisalso included coverage of rehabilitation and home healthcare costs. Hayes et al.and Tanny et al.calculated costs related directly from a patient cohort and extrapolated out of hospital information from relevant local cost-of-illness studies applied to their cohort based on discharge destinations.

There was also a high level of heterogeneity in the reporting of outcomes with only 4 of 13 studies using the mRS as a complete ordinal scale. In other studies, the information on costs by mRS was dichotomised or trichotomised. This latter approach discards valuable information and undermined the ability to undertake meaningful comparisons between the included studies.

To be useful in cost-effectiveness evaluations, the mRS as a measure of functional ability beyond the acute phase of the disease needs to be costed from the perspective of society whereby the direct and indirect costs to the health sector, patients and other sectors, e.g. workforce are captured and summarised. Consistently, the identified studies provided evidence that increasing severity of mRS was associated with increasing direct medical costs. All studies but oneincluded direct medical costs such as treatment, diagnostic costs and imaging in the estimation of costs at each mRS category. Hospital stayalone was used as the cost metric in the final study and highlighted the correlation between increased length of stay, mRS severity and increased costs. Capturing finer grained direct medical costs in hospitals is important since a patient who has achieved an mRS of 0 through costly treatment such as thrombectomywill incur little or no out-of-hospital costs but high direct medical costs. This review has shown that the estimate of costs includes some, if not all of the direct medical costs for the patients care associated with mRS category. However, to allow for comparison and generic estimates to be generated, future studies require more consistency in their methods.

### Utility-weighted modified rankin scale scores for the assessment of stroke outcome: pooled analysis of 20 000 + patients [^f2c46124]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Patient-centered care prioritizes patient beliefs and values towards wellbeing. We aimed to map functional status (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] scores) and health-related quality of life on the European Quality of Life 5-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) to derive utility-weighted (UW) stroke outcome measures and test their statistical properties and construct validity.

Methods

UW-mRS scores were derived using linear regression, with mRS as a discrete ordinal explanatory response variable in 8 large international acute stroke trials. Linear regression models were used to validate UW-mRS scores by assessing differences in mean UW-mRS scores between the treatment groups of each trial. To explore the variability in EQ-5D between individual mRS categories, we generated receiver operator characteristic curves for EQ-5D to differentiate between sequential mRS categories and misclassification matrix to classify individual patients into a matched mRS category based on the closest UW-mRS value to their observed individual EQ-5D value.

Results

Among 22 946 acute stroke patients, derived UW-mRS across mRS scores 0 to 6 were 0.96, 0.83, 0.72, 0.54, 0.22, -0.18, and 0, respectively. Both UW-mRS and ordinal mRS scores captured divergent treatment effects across all 8 acute stroke trials. The sample sizes required to detect the treatment effects using UW-mRS scores as a continuous variable were almost half that required in trials for a binary cut point on the mRS. Area under receiver operator characteristic curves based on EQ-5D utility values varied from 0.66 to 0.81. Misclassification matrix showed moderate agreement between actual and matched mRS scores (kappa, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.67–0.68]).

Conclusions

Medical strategies that target avoiding dependency may provide maximum benefit in terms of poststroke health-related quality of life. Despite variable differences with mRS scores, the UW-mRS provides efficiency gains as a smaller sample size is required to detect a treatment effect in acute stroke trials through use of continuous scores.

### Association between disability measures and healthcare costs after initial treatment for acute stroke [^584a5812]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The distribution of 3-month modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores has been used as an outcome measure in acute stroke trials. We hypothesized that hospitalization and institutional care home stays within the first 90 days after stroke should be closely related to 90-day mRS, that each higher mRS category will reflect incremental cost, and that resource use may be less clearly linked to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or Barthel index.

Methods

We examined resource use data from the GAIN International trial comparing 90-day mRS with total length of stay in hospital or other institutions during the first 90 days. We repeated analyses using NIHSS and Barthel index scores. Relationships were examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni contrasts of adjacent score categories. Estimated costs were based on published Scottish figures.

Results

We had full data from 1717 patients. Length of stay was strongly associated with final mRS (P < 0.0001). Each mRS increment from 0 to 1–2 to 3–4 was significant (mean length of stay: 17, 25, 44, 58, 79 days; P < 0.0005). Ninety-five percent confidence limits for estimated costs (pound) rose incrementally: 2493 to 3412, 3369 to 4479, 5784 to 7008, 7300 to 8512, 10 095 to 11 141, 11 772 to 13 560, and 2623 to 3321 for mRS 0 to 5 and dead, respectively. Weaker relationships existed with Barthel and NIHSS.

Conclusions

Each mRS category reflects different average length of hospital and institutional stay. Associated costs are meaningfully different across the full range of mRS outcomes. Analysis of the full distribution of mRS scores is appropriate for interpretation of treatment effects after acute stroke and more informative than Barthel or NIHSS end points.

### Affordability of medical care among Medicare enrollees [^64d2d6ac]. JAMA Health Forum (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Unaffordability is a serious problem for millions of patients enrolled in Medicare, resulting in delayed care and financial strains, such as debt and involvement with collection agencies. These new prevalence data may raise awareness, spur well-targeted efforts to alleviate hardships, and provide a foundation for other research that will bring additional insights and evaluate future Medicare reforms.

### Advancing value-based medicine: why integrating functional outcomes with clinical measures is critical to our health care future [^e591f69c]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

The rising cost of disability — workers' compensation and disability benefits impose substantial burdens: Approximately $60 billion is paid annually from state workers' compensation programs for job-related injuries or illnesses, and the estimated total annual cost of disability benefits paid under these systems exceeds $100 billion annually. In 2014, SSDI paid out disability benefits to more than 10.2 million individuals, 90% of whom were disabled workers. In 2014, 3 million nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses were reported by private industry employers, half of which resulted in days away from work, job transfer, or job restrictions due to some level of disability; in addition, 722,300 injury and illness cases were reported among approximately 18.3 million US state and local government workers.

Exclusion

Subarachnoid haemorrhage or traumatic brain injury.
Protocols or methodologies for randomised controlled trials (RCT).
Cost-effectiveness studies comparing one or more intervention.

We assessed the included studies for reporting and methodological quality. Currently, there is no consensus on the best instrument for assessing the methodological and reporting quality of cost-of-illness studies. In this review, we followed the recommendation of Cochrane handbook and utilised the checklist developed by Drummond and Jefferson, as relevant to cost-of-illness studies This focuses on three domains: study design; data collection and analysis; and interpretation of results. This checklist can be applied to range of health economic designs encompassing both full cost-effectiveness studies and cost-of-illness studies.

The costs from the included studies were abstracted and then converted to relative 2015 costs in Euros accounting for inflation to allow for direct comparison of the results. Purchasing power parity (PPP) was used to calculate the relative value to each currency. Germany was chosen as having the most representative healthcare system and economy, and provided the 'baseline' Euro currency from which to calculate the PPP. The calculations were performed using a web-based calculator developed by Campbell and the Cochrane Economics Methods Group in conjunction with the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Coordinating Centre.

Our aims were to present an estimate of cost of illness relative to stroke severity as measured by the mRS. However, given the recognised heterogeneity in methods used in health economic studies such as cost-of-illness studies, where we were unable to make any meaningful comparison among studies, we have presented a narrative review of the findings.

Results

The literature search yielded 8486 unique full text articles that were screened for inclusion in the study (Figure 1). From these, we identified and selected 61 relevant studies for full text review. Of these, only 13 met the inclusion criteria and have been included for reporting in this review. The characteristics of the selected studies are shown in Table 1. We included one studythat had reported costs by individual mRS categories as part of a nested cohort study, whereby these cost-of-illness estimates were then later applied in a cost-effectiveness analysis of thrombolysis treatment.

Characteristics of included studies.

Description of included studies

Among the articles that we identified, the authors had investigated populations from diverse locations. Six studies were European (46%) and two were worldwide multicentre trials. Costs were quoted in three currencies: US dollars, Euros and Pounds Sterling. A broad range of methods had been used to determine costs in these currencies, but most had applied PPP to establish a common value to each currency worldwide. Patient data collection for the included studies was conducted from March 1998through December 2011. Eleven studies reported costs up to 90 days (84%); and in five studies, the longer term costs of stroke of between 6 to 18 months were reported.–

Quality assessment

The application of the Drummond et al.checklist to the studies shows the overall quality of the study was high (Table 4). However, presentation of results in both aggregate and disaggregate forms was handled poorly by the authors of these studies. Only 30% presented results as full ordinal mRS in relation to costs.

### Utility-weighted modified rankin scale as primary outcome in stroke trials: a simulation study [^d1df0950]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Ordinal outcome scales are also used in other neurological disorders besides stroke. Examples are the Glasgow Outcome Scale in traumatic brain injury and the Guillain-Barre syndrome disability score in Guillain-Barre syndrome. These ordinal outcomes could be transformed to patient-centered outcomes using utility values, similar to the UW-mRS. For randomized trials in patients with other neurological diseases, such as traumatic brain injury and Guillain-Barre syndrome, our study might, therefore, also implicate that ordinal analysis should remain the gold standard.

Our study has several strengths. The simulation study was based on data from the MR CLEAN trial, with relatively broad inclusion criteria. As such, our findings should be generalizable to future stroke trials. Furthermore, simulation is the most adequate method to evaluate statistical power. Also, we used utility values derived using the recommended time trade-off method, which should be less prone to bias compared with other elicitation methods.

Some limitations should also be acknowledged. As with all simulation studies, we do not know how far our findings may be extrapolated beyond the modeled situations. For instance, we only simulated a model with a uniform treatment effect across all mRS health state transitions, which, therefore, adheres perfectly to the proportional odds assumption. However, if the proportional odds assumption would be violated, and treatment effect would not be uniform across the different outcome categories, ordinal analysis would still be the most efficient. Nevertheless, further validation of our results is required. Finally, we used the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire assessed at 90 days after inclusion, which reflects neither short-term QoL nor the final health state. A better reflection of patient perception could be achieved by calculating QALYs based on multiple QoL measurements in 1 patient. Nevertheless, the aim of this study is not to describe QoL but to evaluate efficiency in detecting treatment effects.

In conclusion, the UW-mRS has been received as a promising new patient-centered outcome in stroke research. However, the UW-mRS does not capture individual variation in utilities within each mRS health state. Also, interpretation of treatment effect on the UW-mRS scale might be more challenging than was first suggested. Finally, clinicians and researchers should be aware of the reduction in power compared with ordinal analysis of the mRS when they use the UW-mRS as outcome measure in acute stroke intervention trials. More thorough evaluation of the UW-mRS in terms of its added value, analytic approach, and interpretation is required.

### Utility-weighted modified rankin scale as primary outcome in stroke trials: a simulation study [^c6b59dde]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Each of the 3 approaches yielded either a significant (P ≤ 0.05) or a nonsignificant treatment effect (P > 0.05, 2 sided). The power (or type 1 error in case of no treatment effect) of each statistical approach was estimated as the proportion of the 10 000 analyses, which resulted in a statistically significant treatment effect.

Associations were expressed as ORs or β with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), averaged over all simulations. All analyses were performed unadjusted and adjusted for the prespecified covariates identical to those mentioned above. Statistical analyses were performed with R software, version 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Missing data on time from stroke to randomization (0.4%) and level of vessel occlusion (0.2%) was statistically imputed using simple imputation (replacement by mean or mode, as applicable).

### Markup on services provided to Medicare beneficiaries by otolaryngologists in 2017: implications for surprise billing [^85881a36]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The degree of markup between provider charges and Medicare prices reflects the potential balance bill for out-of-network commercially insured patients. Using publicly available Medicare data, we performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of markup ratios (MRs; ie, the ratio of submitted charges to Medicare-allowed prices) for services commonly performed by otolaryngologists in 2017. Median MRs were as follows: 2.9 (interquartile range, 2.0–4.3) in facility settings (eg, hospital) and 2.1 (interquartile range, 1.7–2.9) in nonfacility settings (eg, physician office). Among the 10 highest-markup procedures performed by otolaryngologists in facility and nonfacility settings, there was no consistent increase in median MRs between 2012 and 2017 (compound annual growth rates, -4.6% for labyrinthotomy to 24.6% for ultrasound-guided biopsy). Median MRs for these procedures were not consistently lower in states with surprise billing protection laws. These findings may reflect the comparatively low potential to "balance bill" patients for elective otolaryngologic services and the limitations of state-level protections against surprise billing.

Results

Study Population

All 500 participants from the MR CLEAN trial were included in our analysis. The mRS at 90 days was available for all patients. The EQ-5D-3L assessments, and consequently the utility values, were available in 457 patients (including 108 patients who died before follow-up). In 43 patients (8.6%), mRS assessment could not be followed by an EQ-5D-3L assessment. In 192 patients (38%), the EQ-5D-3L was completed by a proxy.

The total study population had a mean age of 65 years (SD, 14 years), and most patients (58%) were men (Table 1). The intervention and control groups were similar in terms of baseline and treatment characteristics. The number of patients with poor outcome (mRS, 3–6) at 90 days was lower in the intervention group than in the control group (Figure 1).

Utility Weights

The mean utility values (SD) for mRS categories 0 to 6 were: 0.95 (0.08), 0.93 (0.13), 0.83 (0.21), 0.62 (0.27), 0.42 (0.28), 0.11 (0.28), and 0 (0), respectively (Table 2). We observed substantial variation in utility values within each mRS category (Figure 2). Within MR CLEAN, the mean UW-mRS for the intervention group was significantly higher when compared with the control group (Table 2).

### Ordinal vs dichotomous analyses of modified rankin scale, 5-year outcome, and cost of stroke [^70cb2f8b]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Second, our results highlight the substantial proportion of patients with premorbid disability who risk exclusion with dichotomous approaches. The 0–1/2–6 dichotomy would have excluded 30.5% of our cohort from attaining a favorable outcome even prestroke and was more likely to exclude older, female, and socioeconomically deprived patients. Defining a favorable outcome as mRS score 0–2 is less exclusionary, but would still have prevented 17.2% of our patients from demonstrating any treatment benefit. Previous inpatient studies have reported higher rates of premorbid disability. Even when trials use block randomization or actively enroll older patients, such as the Third International Stroke Trial, their sample will still be unrepresentative if they exclude patients with premorbid disability, as did the Third International Stroke Trial. Ageism has been noted in interventional stroke studies, and older patients, women, and socioeconomically deprived patients are less likely to receive appropriate acute stroke care. By permitting patients with premorbid disability to demonstrate treatment benefit, ordinal analysis can encourage trials to enroll such patients and better represent the stroke population. However, clinical trials have generally enrolled healthier patients to optimize the detection of treatment effects, and enrolling patients with various levels of premorbid disability can complicate sample-size calculations and add another factor for adjustment when comparing treatment and control arms.

Third, for acute stroke trials that still wish to dichotomize the mRS, our data suggest that in addition to promoting exclusion of more patients, trials using the 0–1/2–6 dichotomy risk ultimately comparing more similar patient groups with respect to long-term outcomes than those using a 0–2/3–6 dichotomy, since patients with a 3-month mRS score of 2 seem likely to fare similarly to those with an mRS of 1 — and much more favorably than those with mRS of 3 ("step change"), considering long-term outcomes. This is a concern given the 0–1/2–6 dichotomy's popularity in recent trials. However, 0–2/3–6 may not always be the most optimal dichotomy for trials based on other factors such as expected case mix and stroke severity. For example, trials of hemicraniectomy in malignant middle cerebral artery infarction used a dichotomy of 0–4/5–6.

### Ordinal vs dichotomous analyses of modified rankin scale, 5-year outcome, and cost of stroke [^d73a6191]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

Since we sought to relate the 3-month mRS (as used in trials) to 5-year clinical outcomes and costs, and 3-month mRS = 6 (death) would be perfectly correlated with 5-year death/disability, we focused on patients surviving 3 months past their index stroke. However, since 3-month deaths would contribute to the primary outcome analysis of a trial and might improve the associations of each mRS representation with long-term outcomes to different extents, we ran regressions for 1- and 5-year death both including and excluding these patients.

The proportions of 3-month survivors who had premorbid mRS score > 2 or > 1 were calculated both for the overall cohort and in relation to age (< 45, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, 75–84, ≥ 85 years), sex, and index of socioeconomic deprivation. The proportions disabled, dead/disabled, or dead at 1 year and 5 years were also calculated and stratified by 3-month mRS. Disability at 5 years was defined as mRS score > 2, but analysis was repeated using mRS score > 1. Logistic regression was used to adjust associations of 3-month mRS and long-term outcomes for age/sex. Proportions of interest were compared using χ 2 tests.

Analyses were censored at May 15, 2017. Since we did not yet have full 5-year data for patients recruited after May 15, 2012, we examined the effect of censoring on costs, partitioning the study period into smaller time periods (by day) within each of which the total cost incurred for all patients alive at the beginning of the period was calculated. Estimated costs of patients with complete data for each time period were weighted by the Kaplan-Meier sample average estimator and summed over all periods to estimate mean censor-adjusted costs. Costs were stratified by 3-month mRS and reported as means with 95% confidence intervals from 1,000-bootstrap estimates. To assess whether health/social care costs varied over time by 3-month mRS, we constructed generalized gamma linear models (GLMs) assuming a log identity, adjusted for age and sex. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.050.

### Weights for ordinal analyses of the modified rankin scale in stroke trials: a population-based cohort study [^37291cbb]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ordinal/shift analyses of ordered measures like the modified Rankin Scale(mRS) are underused as primary trial outcomes for neurological disorders - despite statistical advantages - potentially hindered by poor clinical interpretability versus dichotomies, and by valuing state-transitions equally (linear scale). Weighted ordinal analyses incorporating step-changes at key transitions might have greater statistical validity and clinical applicability.

Methods

In a prospective population-based cohort of ischaemic stroke (Oxford Vascular Study, recruited 2002–2014), we stratified 5-year outcomes of death, dementia, and/or institutionalization, health/social-care costs, and EuroQol-derived quality-adjusted life-expectancy(QALE) by 3-month mRS. We compared root-mean-square errors(RMSEs) from linear regressions for these outcomes with the mRS coded as a linear scale versus incorporating a spline at transitions 1–2, 2–3, or 3–4. We derived 3-month mRS weights for probability of 5-year death/dementia/institutionalization using age/sex-adjusted logistic regressions, and cost and QALE weights from 1000-bootstraps. We applied these weights to analyse recent trials of thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke.

Findings

Among 1,607 patients, a non-linear (S-shaped) relationship was observed between 3-month mRS and each 5-year outcome, with RMSEs 18–73% lower using a spline at mRS 2–3 versus a linear representation. Age/sex-adjusted probability weights for 5-year death/dementia/institutionalization were: mRS 0 = 0.19; 1 = 0.27; 2 = 0.41; 3 = 0.73; 4 = 0.77; 5 = 0.94 (mRS 6 = 1 by definition). Similar trends were seen with costs; estimated 5-year QALEs were: mRS 0 = 3.88; 1 = 3.49; 2 = 3.01; 3 = 1.87; 4 = 1.30; 5 = 0.06; 6 = 0. Results were similar stratifying by age/sex, and excluding pre-morbidly disabled patients. Using a weighted ordinal approach, estimates of thrombectomy impact were more favourable than estimates with dichotomous approaches, 5-year cost reductions being 29% higher than with 0–2/3–6, and over three-fold higher than with 0–1/2–6 dichotomy.

Interpretation

Our findings favour weighting the mRS in ordinal analyses for stroke and other neurological disorders, as state-transitions differ in clinical prognosis, quality-of-life, and costs. These weights could also be used for prognostication and cost-effectiveness analyses.

There are significant differences in the morning cohorts at 08:00–10:20 and 10:20–11:34, suggesting better functional outcome at 3 months, as well as in the end of work day cohorts at 15:55–17:15 and 18:55–20:55, suggesting poorer functional outcome at 3 months. CI = confidence interval; OR = odds ratio.

Data are organized into 12 equally sized cohorts over 24 hours starting at 8:00. Higher scores indicate better functional outcome. Green shading corresponds to cohorts with favorable functional outcome at 3 months; red shading corresponds to cohorts with poorer functional outcome at 3 months.

The proportion of patients with mRS of 0–2 at 90 days was 37.6% and 37.2% when EVT start times were between 08:00–10:20 and 10:20–11:34, respectively, vs only 22.5% and 19.0% for EVT start times at 15:55 and 18:55–20:55. Mortality at 90 days was lower in the morning in 12.8% patients with EVT start time at 08:00–10:20 (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.28–0.90; p = 0.028) and higher at the end of the work day in 32.5% of patients when EVT start times were 15:55–17:15 (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.21–2.79; p = 0.013).

### Association of mobile stroke unit care and spending, utilization, and death in New York city [^03dc485e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

Our primary outcomes were short‐term hospital outcomes as well as longer‐term health, usage, and spending outcomes. Short‐term hospital outcomes included the length of stay of the index hospitalization and whether a patient was discharged home. Longer‐term usage measures included whether a patient had any inpatient or emergency department visits within 1 year of discharge. We also examined total spending within 1 year of discharge as well as total spending by broad categories including inpatient, outpatient, post–acute care, and hospice. Finally, we measured 1 long‐term health outcome: death within 1 year after discharge.

The secondary outcome available for a subset of patients admitted to 2 Manhattan hospitals was a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) in electronic medical records collected at the time of discharge from an index admission. The mRS is a commonly used score that measures the degree of disability or dependence people experience after a stroke or other neurological event. It grades patients' function on a scale from 0 (indicating no symptoms) to 6 (indicating death).

### Affordability of medical care among Medicare enrollees [^e0bc05b4]. JAMA Health Forum (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Cost-sharing requirements can discourage patients from seeking care and impose financial hardship. The Medicare program serves many older and disabled individuals with multimorbidity and limited resources, but little has been known about the affordability of care in this population.

Objective

To examine the affordability of medical care among Medicare enrollees, in terms of the prevalence of delaying medical care because of costs and having problems paying medical bills, and risk factors for these outcomes.

Design Setting and Participants

Cross-sectional analyses conducted from November 1, 2019, to October 15, 2021, used logistic regression to compare the probability of outcomes by demographic and health characteristics. Data were obtained from the 2017 nationally representative Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (response rate, 61.7%), with respondents representing 53 million community-dwelling Medicare enrollees.

Main Outcomes and Measures

New questions about medical care affordability were included in the 2017 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey: difficulty paying medical bills, ongoing medical debt, and contact by collection agencies. A companion survey question asked whether individuals had delayed seeking medical care because of worries about costs.

Results

Respondents included 10 974 adults aged 65 years or older and 2197 aged 18 to 64 years; 54.2% of all respondents were women. The weighted proportions of Medicare enrollees with annual incomes below $25 000K were 30.7% in the older population and 67.4% in the younger group. Self-reported prevalence of delaying care because of cost was 8.3% (95% CI, 7.4%-9.1%) among enrollees aged 65 years or older, 25.2% (95% CI, 21.8%-28.6%) among enrollees younger than 65 years, and 10.9% (95% CI, 9.9%-11.9%) overall. Similarly, 7.4% (95% CI, 6.6%-8.2%) of older enrollees had problems paying medical bills, compared with 29.8% (95% CI, 25.6%-34.1%) among those younger than 65 years and 10.8% (95% CI, 9.8%-11.9%) overall. Regarding specific payment problems, 7.9% (95% CI, 7.0%-8.9%) of enrollees overall experienced ongoing medical debt, contact by a collection agency, or both. In adjusted analyses, older adults with incomes $15 000 to $25 000 per year had odds of delaying care more than twice as high as those with incomes greater than $50 000 (odds ratio, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.82–3.39), and their odds of problems paying medical bills were more than 3 times as high (odds ratio, 3.37; 95% CI, 2.81–5.21). Older adults with 4 to 10 chronic conditions were more than twice as likely to have problems paying medical bills as those with 0 or 1 condition.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study suggest that unaffordability of medical care is common among Medicare enrollees, especially those with lower incomes, or worse health, or who qualify for Medicare based on disability. Policy reforms, such as caps on patient spending, are needed to reduce Medical cost burdens on the most vulnerable enrollees.

### Concordance of disclosed hospital prices with total reimbursements for hospital-based care among commercially insured patients in the US [^c3fe9460]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

To improve health care price transparency and promote cost-conscious selection of health care organizations and practitioners, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) required that hospitals share payer-specific negotiated prices for selected shoppable health services by January 2021. While this regulation improves price transparency, it is unclear whether disclosed prices reflect total costs of care, since many hospital-based services are delivered and billed separately by independent practitioners or other health care entities.

Objective

To assess the extent to which prices disclosed under the new hospital price transparency regulation are correlated with total costs of care among commercially insured individuals.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used a large database of commercial claims from 2018 to analyze encounters at US hospitals for shoppable health care services for which price disclosure is required by CMS. Data were analyzed from November 2020 to February 2021.

Exposures

Whether the service was billed by the hospital or another entity.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes of interest were the percentage of encounters with at least 1 service billed by an entity other than the hospital providing care, number of billing entities, amounts billed by nonhospital entities, and the correlation between hospital and nonhospital reimbursements.

Results

The study analyzed 4 545 809 encounters for shoppable care. Independent health care entities were involved in 7.6% (95% CI, 6.7% to 8.4%) to 42.4% (95% CI, 39.1% to 45.6%) of evaluation and management encounters, 15.9% (95% CI, 15.8% to 16%) to 22.2% (95% CI, 22% to 22.4%) of laboratory and pathology services, 64.9% (95% CI, 64.2% to 65.7%) to 87.2% (95% CI, 87.1% to 87.3%) of radiology services, and more than 80% of most medicine and surgery services. The median (IQR) reimbursement of independent practitioners ranged from $61 ($52-$102) to $412 ($331-$466) for evaluation and management, $5 ($4-$6) to $7 ($4-$12) for laboratory and pathology, $26 ($20-$32) to $210 ($170-$268) for radiology, and $47 ($21-$103) to $9545 ($7750-$18 277) for medicine and surgery. The reimbursement for services billed by the hospital was not strongly correlated with the reimbursement of independent clinicians, ranging from r = -0.11 (95% CI, -0.69 to 0.56) to r = 0.53 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.78).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cross-sectional study found that independent practitioners were frequently involved in the delivery of shoppable hospital-based care, and their reimbursement may have represented a substantial portion of total costs of care. These findings suggest that disclosed hospital reimbursement was usually not correlated with total cost of care, limiting the potential benefits of the hospital price transparency rule for improving consumer decision-making.

### Endovascular treatment and thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke in patients with premorbid disability or dementia: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^d2db7aee]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Roadmap for future studies of acute stroke therapies in patients with prestroke disability or dementia — key research needs include that the stroke community has an obligation to generate higher-quality data to inform stroke care in this expanding population, and the ascertainment and measurement of premorbid disability or dementia in the setting of acute stroke continue to be a challenge. If we are to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials including patients with premorbid disability, we need harmonized, validated strategies to measure disability and capture these data, and we also need to develop better measures that not only are reliable in an acute stroke setting but also help elucidate the nature of a given patient's disability (eg, cognitive versus physical), currently not well captured by the mRS. In addition, 3-month mRS score dichotomies of 0 to 1/2 to 6 or 0 to 2/3 to 6 fail to capture the potential benefits of treatment in patients with a mix of different levels of prestroke disability; instead, ordinal mRS approaches, including measures like the ΔmRS score (capturing the change in mRS score from before to after stroke), or more inclusive dichotomous outcomes such as return to prestroke mRS score or avoidance of the devastating outcome of an mRS score of 5 to 6 should be strongly considered, being far more reflective of long-term outcomes. Other measures such as home time (time spent at home after stroke), health care costs, and quality of life also would be valuable in this population, at least as secondary outcomes, to facilitate cost-effectiveness analyses, and there is also a need for high-quality mixed-methods studies involving physicians, patients, and caregivers to better inform current policies and the design of future trials. Whereas there is a growing body of literature from observational studies (mostly treatment registries), these studies do not help us understand why the patients with prestroke disability/dementia captured in these studies were treated and, perhaps more important, how many others were not treated, why they were not treated, and how those untreated patients fared, and our failure to engage such patients in research on poststroke recovery and adaptation is unfortunate.

### Ordinal vs dichotomous analyses of modified rankin scale, 5-year outcome, and cost of stroke [^462bbe7c]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare how 3 common representations (ordinal vs dichotomized as 0–1/2–6 or 0–2/3–6) of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS)-a commonly used trial outcome measure-relate to long-term outcomes, and quantify trial ineligibility rates based on premorbid mRS.

Methods

In consecutive patients with ischemic stroke in a population-based, prospective, cohort study (Oxford Vascular Study; 2002–2014), we related 3-month mRS to 1-year and 5-year disability and death (logistic regressions), and health/social care costs (generalized linear model), adjusted for age/sex, and compared goodness-of-fit values (C statistic, mean absolute error). We also calculated the proportion of patients in whom premorbid mRS score > 1 or > 2 would result in exclusion from trials using dichotomous analysis.

Results

Among 1,607 patients, the ordinal mRS was more strongly related to 5-year mortality than both the 0–1/2–6 and 0–2/3–6 dichotomies (all p < 0.0001). Results were similar for 5-year disability, and 5-year care costs were also best captured by the ordinal model (change in mean absolute error vs age/sex: -$3,059 for ordinal, -$2,805 for 0–2/3–6, -$1,647 for 0–1/2–6). Two hundred forty-four (17.1%) 3-month survivors had premorbid mRS score > 2 and 434 (30.5%) had mRS score > 1; both proportions increased with female sex, socioeconomic deprivation, and age (all p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

The ordinal form of the 3-month mRS relates better to long-term outcomes and costs in survivors of ischemic stroke than either dichotomy. This finding favors using ordinal approaches in trials analyzing the mRS. Exclusion of patients with higher premorbid disability by use of dichotomous primary outcomes will also result in unrepresentative samples.

### Association of mobile stroke unit care and spending, utilization, and death in New York city [^c9a28459]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Results were broadly similar in sensitivity analyses. However, in analysis with a more conservative set of treatment observations (Data S1 and Table S1), MSU patients had significantly lower lengths of stay during the index hospitalization, and the mortality difference, while large, was not statistically significant (Table S2). In an analysis of patients with Medicare Part D and controlling for prior medication use, MSU patients had significantly more outpatient spending, and the mortality difference was also large but not statistically significant (Tables S3 and S4). Finally, in analysis using race as an additional demographic covariate, the mortality difference between MSU and control patients was large but not statistically significant (Tables S5 and S6).

In a secondary analysis examining patients for whom mRS scores were available at time of discharge, we found that MSU patients had similar mRS scores relative to non‐MSU patients (2.20 versus 2.48; difference, −0.28 [95% CI, −1.22 to 0.66]; P = 0.56; Tables S7 and S8).

American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) — discussion on integrating economic evidence explains that the CGC aims to improve health and health care by providing clinicians with recommendations based on the best available evidence and includes evaluating the cost of care, assessing the value of an intervention, incorporating economic evidence into recommendations, and discussing corresponding clinical considerations; it highlights limitations of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs), noting that willingness-to-pay thresholds commonly used in the United States do not reflect clinical, social, individual economic, and inflation considerations, economic evidence is sparse and poorly reported in the United States and analyses from outside the United States have low applicability, the certainty of economic evidence is often limited due to dynamic pricing and modeling assumptions, industry funding of CEAs is common and results cannot be easily repurposed in quantitative meta-analytic syntheses, many CEAs rely on surrogate outcomes and analyze medications individually rather than by class, and certainty in CEA results should be based on critically appraised certainty of clinical benefits and harms and model credibility.

### Long-term medical care utilization and costs among traumatic brain injury survivors [^bc7c618a]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine billing patterns and predictors of healthcare utilization and costs associated with traumatic brain injury.

Design

Retrospective cohort study of healthcare billings for 63 survivors of traumatic brain injury, over a 19-mo period, using a state-sponsored Medicaid program. The relationship of indicators of injury severity and disability to billings and payments was investigated. Mean age at time of injury was 33 yrs. Mean highest Glasgow Coma Scale rating immediately after brain injury was 8.

Results

A total of 795,635 US dollars was billed to Medicaid for 3,950 services and medications used. A total of 281,897 US dollars was paid for these billings out of the Medicaid account studied. Billings were used for statistical analyses, as they were considered the most stable indicator of cost. Motor deficits at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation (FIM motor score) showed inverse relationships to total billings (rho = -0.42, P < 0.001), subcategories of billings reflecting equipment and supplies (rho = -.26, P = 0.020), and outpatient billings (rho = -0.27, P = 0.015). Change in FIM motor scores during inpatient rehabilitation was inversely associated with billings (rho = -0.40). Change in FIM motor scores provided unique information in predicting utilization after accounting for demographic characteristics and severity of injury.

Conclusions

Motor disability and improvement during inpatient rehabilitation were significant predictors of billings after traumatic brain injury. Initial severity of brain injury was not a significant factor in utilization.

### Association of Medicare advantage enrollment with financial burden of care: a retrospective cohort study [^d991b37c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Compared with traditional Medicare (TM), Medicare Advantage (MA) plans typically offer supplemental benefits and lower copayments for in-network services and must include an out-of-pocket spending limit.

Objective

To examine whether the financial burden of care decreased for persons switching from TM to MA (TM-to-MA switchers) relative to those remaining in TM (TM stayers).

Design

Retrospective longitudinal cohort study comparing changes in financial outcomes between TM-to-MA switchers and TM stayers.

Setting

Population-based.

Participants

7054 TM stayers and 1544 TM-to-MA switchers from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 2014 to 2021.

Measurements

Individual health care costs (out-of-pocket spending and cost sharing), financial burden (high and catastrophic), and subjective financial hardship (difficulty paying medical bills, paying medical bills over time, and inability to pay medical bills).

Results

Compared with TM stayers, TM-to-MA switchers had small differences in out-of-pocket spending ($168 [95% CI, -$133 to $469]) and proportions of total health expenses paid out of pocket (cost sharing) (0.2 percentage point [CI, -1.3 to 1.7 percentage points]), families with out-of-pocket spending greater than 20% of their income (high financial burden) (0.3 percentage point [CI, -2.5 to 3.0 percentage points]), families reporting out-of-pocket spending greater than 40% of their income (catastrophic financial burden) (0.7 percentage point [CI, -0.1 to 1.6 percentage points]), families reporting paying medical bills over time (-0.2 percentage point [CI, -1.7 to 1.4 percentage points]), families having problems paying medical bills (-0.4 percentage point [CI, -2.7 to 1.8 percentage points]), and families reporting being unable to pay medical bills (0.4 percentage point [CI, -1.3 to 2.0 percentage points]).

Limitation

Inability to account for all medical care and cost needs and variations across MA plans, small baseline differences in out-of-pocket spending, and potential residual confounding.

Conclusion

Differences in financial outcomes between beneficiaries who switched from TM to MA and those who stayed with TM were small. Differences in financial burden ranged across outcomes and did not have a consistent pattern.

### What does a shoulder MRI cost the consumer? [^e490b488]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

More than 100 MRIs per 1000 inhabitants are performed in the United States annually, more than almost every other country. Little is known regarding the cost of obtaining an MRI and factors associated with differences in cost.

Questions/Purposes

By surveying all hospital-owned and independent imaging centers in Iowa, we wished to determine (1) the cost to the consumer of obtaining a noncontrast shoulder MRI, (2) the frequency and magnitude of discounts provided, and (3) factors associated with differences in cost including location (hospital-owned or independent) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services designation (rural, urban, and critical access).

Methods

There were 71 hospitals and 26 independent imaging centers that offered MRI services in Iowa. Each site was contacted via telephone and posed a scripted request for the cost of the technical component of a noncontrast shoulder MRI. Radiologists' reading fees were not considered. Statistical analysis was performed using standard methods and significance was defined as a probability less than 0.05.

Results

The mean technical component cost to consumers for an MRI was USD 1874 ± USD 694 (range, USD 500-USD 4000). Discounts were offered by 49% of imaging centers, with a mean savings of 21%. Factors associated with increased cost include hospital-owned imaging centers (USD 2062 ± USD 664 versus USD 1400 ± USD 441 at independent imaging centers; p < 0.001; mean difference, USD 662; 95% CI, USD 351-USD 893) and rural imaging centers, unless designated as a critical access hospital (USD 2213 ± USD 668 versus USD 1794 ± USD 680; p = 0.0202; mean difference, USD 419; 95% CI, USD 66-USD 772).

Conclusions

In Iowa, the cost to the consumer of a shoulder MRI is significantly less at independent imaging centers compared with hospital-owned centers. Referring physicians and healthcare consumers should be aware that there may be substantial price discrepancies between centers that provide advanced imaging services.

### Association between disability measures and short-term health care costs following intracerebral hemorrhage [^526f4751]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Small improvements in clinical outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) can have a substantial impact on overall health care costs, yet little data exists on the costs associated with the most commonly studied clinical outcomes in this type of stroke.

Methods

The Factor Seven for Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke (FAST) trial was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between May 2005 and February 2007 at 122 sites in 22 countries. The resource utilization associated with health care services was prospectively recorded in all patients up to day 90 after stroke onset. Measures of disability included the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and the Barthel Index (BI), while the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) measured neurological impairment. Relationships among resource use, health care costs, and disability/impairment were evaluated using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni testing.

Results

A total of 820 patients had complete data. Length of stay (LOS) and total costs varied significantly by mRS scores at 90 days (P < 0.0001). Mean LOS for mRS scores 0–5 and dead were 16, 29, 40, 61, 80, 79, and 14 days, respectively; all categories of mRS had significantly different total LOS from their adjacent categories except mRS 0–1 and mRS 4–5. Mean total costs were $9,500, $15,500, $18,700, $27,400, $27,300, $27,300, and $8,100, respectively; costs rose incrementally up to mRS 3, but were not significantly different for mRS 3, 4, and 5. Total LOS and total costs varied significantly by the Barthel Index scores (P < 0.0001) and NIHSS scores (P < 0.0001), yet significant incremental differences were only observed for the Barthel Index.

Conclusion

Health care costs vary significantly by levels of disability as measured by the mRS, but costs do not vary across the full range of mRS outcomes. The mRS is more informative than the Barthel index and NIHSS for discriminating the resource use and costs associated with different levels of disability after ICH.

### Ordinal vs dichotomous analyses of modified rankin scale, 5-year outcome, and cost of stroke [^cd7961d9]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Table 1
Patient sample and characteristics for 3-month survivors of ischemic stroke (n = 1,421; 3-month outcome available for 1,403 patients)

Figure 1
Proportion of 3-month survivors of ischemic stroke with premorbid disability

Premorbid disability was defined as a prestroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of > 2 (blue) or > 1 (red) and is presented by (A) age, (B) sex, and (C) socioeconomic deprivation index. Bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

At 5 years, 465 (32.6%) 3-month survivors were dead and 214 (27.3%) of those alive had a 5-year mRS score > 2 while 395 (50.3%) had an mRS score > 1. One hundred seventy-three patients (12.1%) had not yet reached 5-year follow-up, but 1-year follow-up data were available for 169 of these, including everyone with a 3-month mRS. When disability was defined as mRS score > 2, the proportion of survivors who were disabled at 5 years increased with 3-month mRS, with a bigger step change from mRS 2 to 3 vs mRS 1 to 2 (figure 2, A). Similar trends were observed with the composite outcome of 5-year death/disability (figure 2, B). On age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression, 3-month mRS was strongly related to 5-year disability (data available from Dryad, tables e-3 and e-4,) and 5-year death/disability (data available from Dryad, tables e-5 and e-6), with AUC ≥ 0.8 for all 3 models. Both when including/excluding patients with premorbid mRS score > 2, the AUCs for the ordinal model were consistently superior to the 0–2/3–5 and 0–1/2–5 dichotomies (e.g. for 5-year death/disability in all, ΔAUC [vs age/sex] = 0.132 for ordinal vs 0.124 for 0–2/3–5, p = 0.016; 0.080 for 0–1/2–5, p < 0.0001; ROC curves data available from Dryad, figures e-1 and e-2). When disability was defined as mRS score > 1 (figure 2, C and D, and data available from Dryad, tables e-7 to e-10), the 2 dichotomies became similar in their relationship to 5-year disability and death/disability but the ordinal model remained superior when including/excluding those with premorbid mRS score > 1 (ROC curves data available from Dryad, figures e-3 and e-4); e.g. for 5-year death/disability in all, ΔAUC = 0.071 for 0–2/3–5 vs 0.079 for 0–1/2–5, p = 0.22; 0.102 for ordinal, p = 0.0001.

### Quantifying the value of stroke disability outcomes: WHO global burden of disease project disability weights for each level of the modified rankin scale [^b9e97587]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) categorizes poststroke disability among 7 broad, ordinal grades, but the interval distances between these levels are spaced along the disability spectrum have not been previously investigated.

Methods

We used the person trade-off procedure developed by the World Health Organization Global Burden of Disease Project (WHO-GBDP) to generate disability weights (DWs) ranging from 0 (normal) to 1 (dead) for each of 7 mRS grades. The ratings of an international, 9-member panel of stroke experts were combined by a modified Delphi process.

Results

DWs (95% CI) were 0 for mRS 0, 0.046 (0.004 to 0.088) for mRS 1, 0.212 (0.175 to 0.250) for mRS 2, 0.331 (0.292 to 0.371) for mRS 3, 0.652 (0.625 to 0.678) for mRS 4, 0.944 (0.873 to 1.015) for mRS 5, and 1.0 for mRS 6. DWs of adjacent mRS levels were significantly different (P < 0.001 for all). Coefficients of variation showed a high degree of consensus for DWs among panel members. DWs placed each of the 5 intermediate mRS states in different disability class levels of the WHO-GBDP anchor conditions and identified natural clusters to use when reducing the mRS to fewer categories.

Conclusions

Formal DW assignment confirms that the mRS is an ordered but unequally spaced scale. The availability of DWs for each mRS level now permits direct comparison of each poststroke outcome state with the outcomes of hundreds of other diseases in the WHO-GBDP and the expression of stroke burden in different populations by using the uniform metric of disability-adjusted life-years lost.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^29113109]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Resource utilization (intervention cost) thresholds — The CGC reviews the distribution of costs required to provide an intervention for each guideline topic and judges whether there are meaningful differences in resource utilization among available interventions based on the distribution. The CGC does not use a predefined threshold across topics; ethical and equity considerations, clinical aspects of disease severity, and magnitude of clinical net benefit inform judgments. The CGC acknowledges that differences in resource utilization do not address all components of CEAs, and the cost of an intervention is not the sole determinant of value; high-cost interventions can have high value, and low-cost interventions can have low value.

### Health care expenses and financial hardship among Medicare beneficiaries with functional disability [^7e0965b7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Medicare beneficiaries with functional disabilities often require more medical care, leading to substantial financial hardship. However, the precise magnitude and sources of this hardship remain unknown.

Objectives

To quantify the financial burden from health care expenses by functional disability levels among Medicare beneficiaries.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used data, including demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health status, and health care use, from a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries from the 2013 to 2021 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Functional disability was measured using 6 questions and categorized into 3 levels: none (no difficulties), moderate (1–2 difficulties), and severe (≥ 3 difficulties). Data were analyzed from December 2023 to March 2024.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Financial hardship from health care expenses was assessed using objective measures (annual out-of-pocket spending, high financial burden [out-of-pocket spending exceeding 20% of income], and catastrophic financial burden [out-of-pocket spending exceeding 40% of income]) and subjective measures (difficulty paying medical bills and paying medical bills over time). We applied weights to produce results representative of national estimates.

Results

The sample included 31 952 Medicare beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 71.1 [9.7] years; 54.6% female). In weighted analyses, severe functional disability was associated with a significantly higher financial burden from health care expenses, with out-of-pocket spending reaching $2137 (95% CI, $1943-$2330) annually. This exceeded out-of-pocket spending for those without functional disability by nearly $700 per year ($1468 [95% CI, $1311-$1625]) and for those with moderate functional disability by almost $500 per year ($1673 [95% CI, $1620-$1725]). The primary factors that played a role in this difference were home health care ($399 [95% CI, $145-$651]) and equipment and supplies ($304 [95% CI, $278-$330]). Beneficiaries with severe functional disability experienced significantly higher rates of both high and catastrophic financial burden than those without disability and those with moderate disability (13.2% [12.2%-14.1%] vs 9.1% [95% CI, 8.6%-9.5%] and 9.4% [95% CI, 9.1%-9.7%] for high financial burden, respectively, and 8.9% [95% CI, 7.8%-10.1%] vs 6.4% [95% CI, 6.1%-6.8%] and 6.0% [95% CI, 5.6%-6.4%] for catastrophic financial burden, respectively). Similar associations were observed in subjective financial hardship. For example, 11.8% (95% CI, 10.3%-13.3%) of those with severe functional disability experienced problems paying medical bills, compared with 7.7% (95% CI, 7.6%-7.9%) and 9.3% (95% CI, 9.0%-9.6%) of those without functional disability and those with moderate functional disability, respectively. Notably, there were no significant differences in financial hardship among those with Medicaid based on functional disability levels.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study of Medicare beneficiaries, those with severe functional disability levels experienced a disproportionate burden from health care costs. However, Medicaid played a pivotal role in reducing the financial strain. Policymakers should explore interventions that effectively relieve the financial burden of health care in this vulnerable population.

### A systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses on endovascular thrombectomy in ischemic stroke patients [^8e4d896d]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the published cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) on endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in acute stroke patients, with a particular focus on the practice of accounting for costs and utilities.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of published CEAs on EVT in acute stroke patients from 1/1/2009 to 10/1/2019. Published CEAs were searched in Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science. Cost or comparative effectiveness analyses were excluded. Risk of bias and quality assessment was based on the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standard checklist.

Results

Twenty-one studies were included in the final analysis, from the USA, Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia. They all concluded EVT to be cost-effective, but with significant variations in methodology. Fifteen studies employed a long-term horizon (> 20 years), while only 11 incorporated risk of recurrent strokes. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold varied from $10,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) to $120,000/QALY, with $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY being the most commonly used. Five studies undertook a societal perspective, but only one accounted for indirect costs. Seventeen studies based outcomes on 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, and 9 of these 17 studies grouped outcomes by mRS 0–2 and 3–5. Among these 9 studies, the range of QALY score reported for mRS 0–2 was 0.71–0.85 QALY, and that of mRS 3–5 was 0.21–0.40.

Conclusions

Our study reveals significant heterogeneity in previously published thrombectomy CEAs, highlighting need for better standardization in future CEAs.

Key Points

- All included studies concluded thrombectomy to be cost-effective, from both long- and short-term perspectives.
- Only 5 out of 22 studies undertook a societal perspective, and only 1 accounted for indirect costs.
- The range of value for mRS 0–2 was 0.71–0.85 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and 0.21–0.40 QALY for mRS 3–5.

Matching the trends in healthcare utilization (Table 5), the greatest cost increases were associated with inpatient hospitalizations, including readmissions within 30 days of hospital discharge (Table 8). Smaller but substantial increases were associated with outpatient visits, including ED visits, and prescription claims. With the exception of ED visit costs, all cost increases were greatest among those admitted to the ICU during acute COVID-19 (Table 9).

2.3 Costs

The cost variable encompasses both the expenditure incurred by participants for the utilization of healthcare services and the intervention costs. Health resources utilization was assessed using an age‐adapted version of the Client Sociodemographic and Service Receipt Inventory (Roick et al.). The questionnaire requests information regarding the type and frequency of healthcare utilization over a period of 6 months prior to the baseline assessment and 2 months prior to the post‐assessment. Utilization was measured in terms of the frequency of contacts with general practitioners and specialists, the length of hospital stays and rehabilitation facilities, non‐physician services (e.g. physiotherapy), and the medication taken. The costs of all healthcare services were calculated using standard costs applicable to the German healthcare system (Bock et al.). The term "standard costs" refers to the average costs incurred for the utilization of a healthcare service, such as a visit to a general practitioner. Medication costs were calculated using the German prescription report, with net costs per defined daily dose (DDD) (Ludwig et al.). This study presents data on direct medical costs exclusively. Intervention costs represent the billing rate of a psychological psychotherapist, which is €19.09 per 10 min in 2025 costs, resulting in a rate of €95.45 for a 50‐min session (Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung). CEACs for a billing rate considering 2015 costs are shown in the Supporting Information.

### Ordinal vs dichotomous analyses of modified rankin scale, 5-year outcome, and cost of stroke [^d07df2ff]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Of 1,607 patients with an index ischemic stroke between 2002 and 2014, 181 (11.3%) died within 3 months. Complete baseline data were available for 1,421 (99.6%) 3-month survivors (table 1) and follow-up data for 1,403 (98.4%) survivors. Of the 23 excluded survivors, 19 refused inclusion and follow-up (refusal rate of 1.3%) and 4 had mRS assessments only beyond 3 months. Two hundred forty-three (17.1%) 3-month survivors had a premorbid mRS score > 2; this proportion increased with age from 5 patients (3.9%) younger than 55 years, to 228 (20.6%) older than 65 years, and 92 (37.9%) older than 85 years (figure 1, A). Four hundred thirty-three patients (30.5%) had a premorbid mRS score > 1, including 9 patients (7.0%) younger than 55 years, 402 (36.3%) older than 65, and 150 (60.7%) older than 85. Women were more likely than men to have a premorbid mRS score > 2 (155/670 [23.1%] vs 89/752 [11.8%]) or > 1 (264/670 [39.4%] vs 170/752 [22.6%], p < 0.0001; figure 1, B). Patients at or worse than the median socioeconomic deprivation index were more likely than those less deprived to have a premorbid mRS score > 2 (175/828 [21.1%] vs 68/593 [11.5%]) or > 1 (300/828 [36.2%] vs 133/593 [22.5%], p < 0.0001; figure 1, C). Even when considering only the 1,268 3-month survivors with first-in-lifetime strokes, 188 (14.8%) had a premorbid mRS score > 2 and 347 (27.4%) had a premorbid mRS score > 1. Age, female sex, and deprivation independently predicted premorbid disability on multivariable logistic regression even upon adjusting for significant comorbidities, including prior stroke (data available from Dryad, table e-2).

### Association of surprise-billing legislation with prices paid to in-network and out-of-network anesthesiologists in California, Florida, and new york: an economic analysis [^c346b388]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Several states have passed surprise-billing legislation to protect patients from unanticipated out-of-network medical bills, yet little is known about how state laws influence out-of-network prices and whether spillovers exist to in-network prices.

Objective

To identify any changes in prices paid to out-of-network anesthesiologists at in-network facilities and to in-network anesthesiologists before and after states passed surprise-billing legislation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective economic analysis used difference-in-differences methods to compare price changes before and after the passage of legislation in California, Florida, and New York, which passed comprehensive surprise-billing legislation between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2017, to 45 states that did not. Commercial claims data from the Health Care Cost Institute were used to identify prices paid to anesthesiologists in hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers. The final analytic sample comprised 2 713 913 anesthesia claims across the 3 treated states and the 45 control states.

Exposures

Temporal and state-level variation in exposure to surprise-billing legislation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The unit price (allowed amounts standardized per unit of service) paid to out-of-network anesthesiologists at in-network facilities and to in-network anesthesiologists.

Results

This retrospective economic analysis of 2 713 913 anesthesia claims found that after surprise-billing laws were passed in 3 states, the unit price paid to out-of-network anesthesiologists at in-network facilities decreased significantly in 2 of them: California, -$12.71 (95% CI, -$25.70 to -$0.27; P = 0.05) and Florida, -$35.67 (95% CI, -$46.27 to -$25.07; P < .001). In New York, a decline in the overall out-of-network price was not statistically significant (-$7.91; 95% CI, -$17.48 to -$1.68; P = 0.10); however, by the fourth quarter of 2017, the decline was -$41.28 (95% CI, -$70.24 to -$12.33; P = 0.01). In-network prices decreased in California by -$10.68 (95% CI, -$12.70 to -$8.66; P < .001); in Florida, -$3.18 (95% CI, -$5.17 to -$1.19; P = 0.002); and in New York, -$8.05 (95% CI, -$11.46 to -$4.64; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

This retrospective study found that prices paid to in-network and out-of-network anesthesiologists in hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers decreased after the introduction of surprise-billing legislation, providing early insights into how prices may change under the federal No Surprises Act and in states that have recently passed their own legislation.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^4483eea4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Figure 1 — comparative value of interventions — categorizes value by clinical net benefit and incremental cost for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with intervention versus comparator, where the incremental cost dimension reflects the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained. For favorable clinical net benefit, higher cost corresponds to high value (< $100 000), intermediate value ($100 000 to $200 000), or low value (> $200 000) with the intervention more effective and more costly; lower cost corresponds to high value with the intervention more effective and less costly (cost-saving). For unfavorable clinical net benefit, higher cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and more costly (cost-dominated), and lower cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and less costly.

This article presents the CGC's process for incorporating economic evidence, which encompasses cost-effectiveness analyses, economic outcomes in randomized controlled trials, and resource utilization (intervention cost) data. Economic evidence is one component of ACP recommendations. The CGC first and foremost assesses the certainty of evidence for clinical net benefit of interventions; it then considers patient values and preferences, and only then considers economic evidence to develop recommendations.

### Understanding the relationship between costs and the modified rankin scale: a systematic review, multidisciplinary consensus and recommendations for future studies [^1bf9aeee]. European Stroke Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Cost-of-illness studies often describe a single aggregate cost of a disease state. This approach is less helpful for a condition with a spectrum of outcomes like stroke. The modified Rankin Scale is the most commonly used outcome measure for stroke. We sought to describe the existing evidence on the costs of stroke according to individual modified Rankin Scale categories. This may be useful in future cost effectiveness modelling studies of interventions where cost data have not been collected, but disability outcome is known.

Methods

Systematic review of the published literature, searching electronic databases between 2004 and 2015 using validated search filters. Results were screened to identify studies presenting costs by individual modified Rankin Scale categories.

Results

Of 17,782 unique identified articles, 13 matched all inclusion criteria. In only four of these studies were costs reported by modified Rankin Scale categories. Most studies included direct medical costs only. Societal costs were assessed in two studies. Overall, studies had a high methodological and reporting quality. The heterogeneity in costing methods used in the identified studies prevented meaningful comparison of the reported cost data. Despite this limitation, the costs consistently increased with greater severity (increasing modified Rankin Scale score).

Conclusions

Few cost studies of stroke include information based on stroke recovery measured by individual modified Rankin Scale categories and the existing data are limited. To reliably capture this information, future studies are needed that preferably apply standardised costing methods to promote greater potential for use in cost-effectiveness analyses whereby direct collection of patient-level resource use has not been possible.

### Evaluation of spending differences between beneficiaries in Medicare advantage and the medicare shared savings program [^736dfe44]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, using administrative and electronic health record data from a large academic health system, we found that utilization and spending patterns vary considerably between MSSP and MA beneficiaries, even when controlling for rich metrics of clinical risk. Health system participation in MA may be more favorable than MSSP because of an inability to manage nonclinical risk factors; changes to program financial design and better accounting for unmeasured covariates may help to mitigate this disparity.

### Patient-provider communication among U.S. adults with food insecurity [^0aaa92be]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Food-insecure adults may experience poor patient-provider communication, potentially compromising care delivery, but this remains unclear. This study examined whether food-insecure adults face poorer patient-provider communication than food-secure adults and how this interplay affects access to care, health care utilization, and financial burden of care.

Methods

This study used data from the 2016, 2017, and 2021 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Outcomes included patient-provider communication, access to care, health care utilization, and financial burden of care. Key independent variables were patient-provider communication and food insecurity. Analysis was conducted in September 2024.

Results

Food-insecure adults reported poorer patient-provider communication than food-secure adults, with 9.0% (95% CI: 7.7–10.3) and 56.0% (53.9–58.2) in reporting low and moderate communication among food-insecure adults vs. 4.3% (4.1–4.6) and 50.7% (50.0–51.4) in reporting low and moderate communication among food-secure adults. Furthermore, food insecurity was associated with lower access to care, higher emergency departments visits, and greater financial burdens, particularly among adults with low communication. Among adults with low communication, the likelihood of having a usual source of care was lower for food-insecure adults than food-secure adults: 69.9% (61.3–78.6) vs. 84.2% (79.8–88.6). Among adults with low communication, food-insecure adults had higher rates of emergency department visits (40.2% [34.5–45.8] vs. 20.1% [17.6–22.6]) and reported experiencing problems paying medical bills (43.7% [37.6–49.8] vs. 20.1% [17.6–22.6]) than food-secure adults.

Conclusions

These results underscore the complex health care needs of food-insecure populations and highlight the need to enhance communication strategies to effectively address these challenges.

Neonatal health-care utilization for GD discharges by ICD-9-CM category

Range of mean and aggregate total charges, costs, and length of stay per discharge based on GD minimum and maximum discharges.

B billions, GD genetic disease, ICD-9-CM International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, K thousands, LOS length of stay, M millions, NA less than or equal to 10 discharges.

Discharges with GD-associated codes show significantly higher health-care utilization across all age groups compared with discharges with no GD-associated diagnoses. Adjusted mean total costs for discharges with no GD-linked codes were $2680 in neonates and $7599 in the remaining pediatric population (unadjusted values are shown in Table S9). Mean total charges for GD-associated discharges were at least 3–12 times higher in neonates, and at least 50% higher for pediatric patients, depending on the diagnosis category (Table 3 and Table S8). Overall, the aggregate total charges for all pediatric discharges in the US in 2012 were just over $124 billion, representing total costs of $37.3 billion (Table S10). While our maximum estimate of GD in neonates was only 10.2% of all neonatal discharges, aggregate costs in this population exceeded those neonatal discharges with no associated GD-linked codes ($8.7 billion versus $8.5 billion, P < 0.0001). In nonneonatal discharges with age less than 1 year, the aggregate cost of discharges with GD-associated codes was 60% higher than discharges with none (Figure S3). While the estimated genetic disease population in this data set comprises 2.6–14% of all discharges, it makes up a larger portion of the "national bill" - 11–46% of all aggregate total charges (Table 2).

Prospective data collected for a prespecified economic analysis of the trial were used. Data included hospital billing records for the initial stroke admission and subsequent detailed resource use after the acute hospitalization collected at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Cost of follow-up care varied 6-fold for patients in the lowest (0–1) and highest (20+) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale category at 5 days, and by modified Rankin Scale at 3 months. The kind of resources used postdischarge also varied between treatment groups. Incremental short-term cost-effectiveness ratios varied greatly when treatments were compared for patient subgroups. Patient subgroups predefined by stroke severity had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $97 303/quality-adjusted life year (severe stroke) and $3 187 805/quality-adjusted life year (moderately severe stroke).

Conclusions

Detailed economic and resource utilization data from IMS III provide powerful evidence for the large effect that patient outcome has on the economic value of medical and endovascular reperfusion therapies. These data can be used to inform process improvements for stroke care and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of endovascular therapy in the US health system for stroke intervention trials.

### 2018 guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^f9b7a415]. Stroke (2018). Medium credibility.

Economic impact and cost-effectiveness — Multiple studies evaluating fibrinolytic therapy and mechanical thrombectomy, alone or in combination, have demonstrated substantial cost-effectiveness of acute stroke treatment across multiple countries; in the United States, pre–mechanical thrombectomy era data indicate cost savings of approximately US $30 million if the proportion of all ischemic stroke patients receiving thrombolysis was increased to 8%, and before the implementation of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services diagnosis-related group 559 payment in 2005 treatment of acute stroke was economically discouraged at a hospital level because of a hospital cost-reimbursement ratio; in a single-hospital study, this ratio decreased from 1.41 (95% CI, 0.98–2.28) before diagnosis-related group 559 to 0.82 (95% CI, 0.66–0.97) after diagnosis-related group 559.

### Association of dermatologist density with the volume and costs of dermatology procedures among Medicare beneficiaries [^1ce0e6cc]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

The persistent shortage of dermatologists in the United States affects access to care and patient outcomes.

Objective

To characterize the effect of geographic variations in dermatologist density on the provision of dermatology procedures within Medicare.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a cross-sectional study using the 2013 Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Database. Dermatology-related procedures were defined by the top 50 billing codes accounting for more than 95% of procedures billed by dermatologists. Billing codes corresponding to evaluation and monitoring visits and dermatopathology were excluded. Total costs were estimated from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services physician fee schedule, based on the nonfacility national payment amount with no modifiers. Nationally representative administrative database that includes 100% of charges billed by noninstitutional clinicians covered under Medicare Part B. A total of 10 391 dermatologists practicing within the 50 states and Washington, DC, were included. The Medicare-eligible population was defined as all persons 65 years or older.

Exposures

Density of dermatologists, categorized into first (5.3 per 100 000 persons ≥ 65 years) through fifth (54.8 per 100 000 persons ≥ 65 years) quintiles.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Utilization of dermatology procedures (mean volume per 100 000 persons ≥ 65 years) and total cost (mean amount billed per person ≥ 65 years) by clinician type across quintiles of dermatologist density.

Results

In 2013, dermatologists billed Medicare for 28 million procedures costing $2.21 billion. Mean billed amount by dermatologists per person 65 years or older was $15.87 in the lowest-density quintile vs $92.02 in the highest-density quintile. This trend suggests that each interval increase of 10 dermatologists per 100 000 persons 65 years or older is correlated with a $14.81 increase in Medicare spending on dermatology procedures (95% CI, 8.28–21.34; P = 0.005). Utilization of these procedures differed among clinician types, with dermatologists largely performing destruction of premalignant lesions and PCPs primarily doing injections.

Conclusions and Relevance

There is evidence of supply-sensitive variation in the provision of dermatology procedures for the Medicare-eligible population; higher dermatologist density is correlated with increased utilization of dermatology procedures and subsequent billed charges to Medicare. Further research is needed to determine the effect of such variations on outcomes and whether incentives can better align dermatologists with areas of clinical need.

### Part 11: post-cardiac arrest care: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^892ce780]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest highlights that hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who achieve ROSC after OHCA, and most deaths attributable to brain injury after cardiac arrest are due to withdrawal of life support based on a predicted unfavorable neurological outcome; accurate neuroprognostication is important to avoid inappropriate withdrawal of life support in patients who may otherwise achieve meaningful recovery and to avoid ineffective treatment when poor outcome is inevitable. Neuroprognostication frequently incorporates assessment of structural injury (neuroimaging and biomarkers) or neurological function (neurophysiologic tests and clinical examination), and the ideal timing for neuroprognostication tests avoids the effects of confounding from temperature, medications, and systemic organ dysfunction. Multiple tests are incorporated to estimate the likelihood for recovery, and most neuroprognostic studies utilize dichotomized outcome scales with a favorable functional outcome defined by the ability to achieve independence as Glasgow–Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category Scores of 1–2 or modified Rankin Scale score of 0–3; these studies do not capture granular details of the functional state of patients nor consider their individual preferences or values, limiting their utility.

### Cataract surgery in the Medicare merit-based incentive payment system: episode-based cost measure development and evaluation [^703282eb]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Episode-Based Cost Measure Development

Clinical Subcommittee and Measure Development Process

Episodes were constructed with Medicare claims data only, with costs defined as the total amount paid by Medicare parts A and B fee-for-service claims, including beneficiary deductibles and coinsurance. An Ophthalmology Disease Management Clinical subcommittee — 10 clinician experts nominated from 8 clinical organizations, including the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the American Optometric Association, American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, and American Society of Retina Specialists — was convened to provide recommendations for cost measure specifications. Field testing was conducted on the basis of preliminary episode specifications, using Medicare claims data from June 1, 2016, to May 31, 2017. All clinicians who attributed ≥ 10 episodes during the measurement period received a confidential Field Test Report and had the opportunity to give feedback on the measure construction. The Clinical subcommittee refined the measure based on feedback and field-testing data (Fig 1) (Additional details in Supplemental Appendix).

Figure 1
Unadjusted distribution of mean provider (Taxpayer Identification Number) costs for episode-based versus nonselective measures. This is a simplified timeline of episode development. The Technical Expert Panel and the Clinical subcommittee convened several times over this time period. The Technical Expert Panel and the Person and Family Committee provided broad guidance to developing measures with a substantial impact on beneficiaries, clinicians, and Medicare spending. The Subcommittee provided detailed recommendations regarding the following: the clinical scenario to evaluate, the combination of Medicare claim codes that indicate the start of an episode (the trigger rules), the logic to identify the responsible clinician (attribution), patient attributes requiring risk adjustment or measure exclusion, the timeframe to measure costs (episode window), and the specific medical services to include in the cost calculation (service assignment). Measure construction is illustrated in the schematic as "Components of an Episode of Care." The goal of this episode of care is to measure the attributed ophthalmologist and include only relevant medical services (blue solid triangles). Unrelated services such as influenza admission or dermatology appointments (white triangles) were excluded from the cost calculation. The measure underwent national field testing among all eligible clinicians and was revised based on these feedbacks. The measure was proposed and finalized in the Physician Fee Schedule. Measure specifications are available online. CY = calendar year; PFS = physician fee schedule; MIPS = Merit-based Payment System; NQF = National Quality Forum.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Health care costs — Health care costs refer to the resources consumed in the production of health care that are then no longer available for other uses and include costs of drugs, devices, durable medical equipment, clinician and nonclinician time, inpatient hospitalization, emergency room visits, outpatient services, long-term care, and home-based services. There are 2 approaches to evaluating health care costs: micro-costing, which is a bottom-up approach that relies on direct enumeration and costing of all resources consumed or saved, and gross-costing, which is a top-down approach that assigns each episode of care an average aggregate cost based on known national reimbursement rates (eg, Medicare reimbursement for a Diagnosis-Related Group). The choice of approach used to estimate costs depends on the specific types of resources to be valued.
