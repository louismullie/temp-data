## Question

ESWT machine for tennis elbow

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) machines are effective for tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) and how to interpret the evidence and guidelines to make a recommendation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and natural history of tennis elbow. Then, I should appraise the highest-quality evidence, including Cochrane reviews and contemporary meta-analyses. Next, I will examine individual randomized controlled trials for signals that might contradict or refine the synthesis. After that, I should review professional guidelines and weigh cost, access, and safety. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically actionable recommendation with caveats about subgroups and protocols, and note what would change my mind if new high-quality data emerge.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and prognosis. Tennis elbow is common, often self-limited, and tends to improve over time even without active treatment; pooled data from placebo and no-treatment arms show roughly 90% global improvement by 1 year, with pain and disability halving about every 3–4 months, which sets a high bar for any intervention to demonstrate added value beyond natural history [^47de1d20] [^3bdcaf8f].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence. The 2005 Cochrane review of 9 placebo-controlled RCTs (1006 participants) concluded there is "platinum" level evidence that ESWT provides little or no benefit in pain or function for lateral elbow pain, with most pooled analyses showing no significant advantage over placebo; two pooled results favored ESWT, but these were not consistently reproduced across trials, and heterogeneity in devices, energies, and protocols complicates interpretation [^03227e61] [^fd1b92d7]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of any positive signals: the relative risk of treatment success at 12 weeks in two small trials was about 2.2, but this was an outlier and not supported by the broader pool of analyses, reinforcing that any benefit is inconsistent and likely small at best [^03227e61].

> I will now examine more recent syntheses to see if anything has changed. A 2020 meta-analysis of 12 RCTs (1104 participants) found no clinically important differences in pain or grip strength with ESWT versus sham, although a subgroup with symptoms longer than 6 months showed a small, statistically detectable but still not clinically meaningful improvement; importantly, effects did not persist beyond 24 weeks, arguing against durable benefit [^6d8c9e92]. A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis of 27 RCTs (1871 patients) likewise concluded low to moderate certainty evidence shows no clinically meaningful benefit of ESWT versus sham or versus corticosteroid injections, despite occasional statistically significant but small effects that do not cross minimal clinically important difference thresholds [^447d4d37]. Hold on, I should double-check the network meta-analysis signal: one 2022 network meta-analysis suggested ESWT ranked highly for short- and medium-term pain and grip strength, but this conflicts with the broader RCT synthesis and may reflect indirect comparisons and heterogeneity; given the weight of direct RCT evidence, I should prioritize the negative or neutral findings over indirect rankings [^ce58519f] [^447d4d37].

> Let me consider individual randomized trials for anomalies. Several contemporary RCTs show within-group improvements but no between-group superiority of ESWT over sham or alternative conservative measures such as wrist-extensor splinting, reinforcing a lack of specific efficacy; for example, a 2016 double-blind RCT of radial ESWT found no superiority to sham at 1–3 months, and multiple comparative studies against splinting found comparable outcomes between groups despite improvements within each arm [^47e76b91] [^e0c88e22] [^11fc48b6]. But wait, what if low-energy protocols or specific populations behave differently? A 2004 RCT in tennis players suggested benefit, yet this has not been consistently replicated, and its older, smaller design limits generalizability compared with larger, more recent negative trials [^dd6ef1ec].

> Next, I should review guidelines to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) recommends not offering ESWT for lateral epicondylalgia across acute, subacute, and chronic phases, citing lack of efficacy. This aligns with the Cochrane conclusion and contemporary meta-analyses [^c4e52a4f] [^e01fd793]. Primary care and sports medicine summaries similarly conclude that ESWT does not appear effective for tennis elbow, reinforcing that routine use is not supported by current evidence [^ab9e581e].

> I need to check safety, cost, and access considerations. ESWT is generally safe, with transient local pain, erythema, and rare bruising reported; however, it requires equipment, trained personnel, and in-person visits, which add cost and access barriers without proven benefit in this indication, making it hard to justify over simpler, evidence-aligned alternatives [^03227e61] [^6d8c9e92]. Hold on, I should verify whether any subgroup or protocol changes this calculus: even where small effects are seen in chronic symptoms, they are not clinically meaningful and do not persist, so the risk–benefit and cost–benefit remain unfavorable for routine ESWT in tennis elbow [^6d8c9e92].

> Let me synthesize. The balance of high-quality evidence shows that ESWT confers little to no clinically important benefit for pain or function in tennis elbow compared with sham or other conservative care, and any observed improvements are consistent with the condition's favorable natural history. Guidelines recommend against its routine use, and the intervention carries opportunity costs without clear advantages over watchful waiting, education, load management, and targeted exercise-based rehabilitation [^03227e61] [^447d4d37] [^c4e52a4f] [^47de1d20]. I should confirm that this applies across symptom durations; yes, even in chronic cases, benefits are small and transient, so ESWT should not be considered a standard treatment [^6d8c9e92].

> Now, I should translate this into a practical recommendation. For patients with tennis elbow, prioritize education on the self-limited course, activity modification, ergonomic adjustments, and a progressive loading/strengthening program with adjuncts such as forearm counterforce bracing as needed. Reserve ESWT, if considered at all, for refractory cases within a research or shared decision-making context where the patient understands the uncertain benefit and costs, and avoid implying that ESWT is a proven or routinely indicated therapy [^e01fd793] [^47de1d20]. Wait, let me verify whether any emerging protocol changes this stance; current evidence does not support specific energy levels, device types, or treatment schedules that reliably produce clinically meaningful benefit in tennis elbow, so off-label or investigational use should be framed as such [^447d4d37] [^6d8c9e92].

> Finally, I should note what would change my mind. High-quality, adequately powered RCTs with standardized protocols, sham controls, and patient-centered outcomes demonstrating clinically important and durable benefits could overturn the current consensus; until such data exist, ESWT should not be recommended as a routine treatment for tennis elbow [^03227e61] [^447d4d37]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all tendinopathies; ESWT has evidence in other conditions such as calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy, but that does not generalize to tennis elbow, so indications must be condition-specific and evidence-driven [^2bec7516] [^99a0704c].

---

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is **not recommended** for tennis elbow because high-quality evidence shows **no clinically meaningful benefit** over placebo or other conservative treatments [^03227e61] [^447d4d37]. ESWT may offer small, short-term pain improvements in some studies, but these effects are inconsistent, not durable, and generally fall below minimal clinically important differences [^6d8c9e92] [^447d4d37]. Professional guidelines advise against routine use of ESWT for tennis elbow, and it should not be considered first-line therapy [^c4e52a4f] [^e01fd793]. Patients should prioritize evidence-based options such as eccentric strengthening, physical therapy, and bracing, reserving ESWT for refractory cases only after careful counseling about uncertain benefits and costs.

## Clinical evidence on ESWT for tennis elbow

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses

- **Cochrane review (2005)**: Analyzed 9 placebo-controlled RCTs (1,006 participants) and found no significant benefit of ESWT over placebo in pain or function; most pooled analyses showed no difference, and the authors concluded ESWT provides little or no benefit [^03227e61].

- **Meta-analysis (2020)**: Included 12 RCTs (1,104 participants) and found no clinically important differences in pain or grip strength with ESWT versus sham; radial ESWT showed slightly better effects than focused ESWT, but differences remained below minimal clinically important thresholds [^6d8c9e92].

- **Systematic review (2021)**: Reviewed 27 RCTs (1,871 patients) and concluded that ESWT offers no clinically meaningful benefit versus sham or corticosteroid injections, despite occasional statistically significant but small effects [^447d4d37].

---

### Individual randomized controlled trials

- **Pettrone et al. (2004)**: 60 patients with untreated tennis elbow; no significant difference between ESWT and sham in treatment success or grip strength at 8 weeks [^ebc6f341].

- **Haake et al. (2002)**: 272 patients; no difference in success rates or secondary outcomes between ESWT and placebo at 12 weeks or 12 months [^889c176d].

- **Radwan et al. (2008)**: 68 patients; no significant differences between ESWT and subtherapeutic dose at 6 weeks, 3 months, or 6 months [^60920cc7].

- **Capan et al. (2016)**: 56 patients; radial ESWT was not superior to sham at 1 or 3 months [^47e76b91].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Professional organizations **advise against routine ESWT** for tennis elbow:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ACOEM (2013) | Strong recommendation against ESWT for acute, subacute, or chronic lateral epicondylalgia [^c4e52a4f] [^e01fd793] |
| AAFP (2007) | ESWT does not appear effective and should not be recommended [^ab9e581e] |

---

## Factors influencing ESWT effectiveness

Evidence suggests several factors may influence outcomes, though effects remain modest and inconsistent:

- **Symptom duration**: Some data suggest potential benefit in chronic cases (> 6 months), but effects are small and not durable [^6d8c9e92].

- **Energy level and protocol**: Low-energy protocols may be less effective; however, even higher-energy approaches have not consistently shown clinically meaningful benefits [^e72d108f].

- **Patient selection**: No clear patient characteristics reliably predict response, limiting targeted use [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other conservative treatments

ESWT has been compared with other conservative modalities, with **no consistent superiority** demonstrated:

- **Physical therapy**: Eccentric strengthening and multimodal physical therapy remain first-line and have stronger evidence of benefit than ESWT [^e01fd793].

- **Bracing**: Counterforce bracing is simple, inexpensive, and has supportive evidence for symptom relief [^e01fd793].

- **Injections**: Corticosteroid injections offer short-term relief but have poorer long-term outcomes; PRP shows mixed results and is not clearly superior to ESWT [^f0034dfe] [^3fa53cef].

---

## Safety and adverse effects

ESWT is generally safe, with **transient pain, redness, and bruising** the most common effects; serious complications are rare. However, given the lack of proven benefit, even minimal risks and costs may not be justified [^03227e61].

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

ESWT typically requires specialized equipment, trained personnel, and multiple sessions, increasing costs. Given the **absence of durable clinical benefit**, cost-effectiveness is unfavorable compared with simpler, evidence-based conservative care [^e01fd793].

---

## Current clinical practice and patient selection

ESWT is **not first-line** for tennis elbow. If considered, it should be reserved for refractory cases after exhausting established conservative therapies, with informed counseling about uncertain benefits and costs.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

ESWT is **not recommended** for tennis elbow due to a lack of clinically meaningful benefit. Patients should prioritize evidence-based conservative treatments such as eccentric strengthening, physical therapy, and bracing. ESWT may be considered only in select refractory cases after shared decision-making, with clear counseling about limited and inconsistent evidence.

### A randomized controlled trial of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) [^60920cc7]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The aims of this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial were to determine whether ultrasound-guided extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) reduced pain and improved function in patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) in the short term and intermediate term.

Methods

Sixty-eight patients from community-based referring doctors were randomized to receive 3 ESWT treatments or 3 treatments at a subtherapeutic dose given at weekly intervals. Seven outcome measures relating to pain and function were collected at followup evaluations at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after completion of the treatment. The mean changes in outcome variables from baseline to 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months were compared for the 2 groups.

Results

The groups did not differ on demographic or clinical characteristics at baseline and there were significant improvements in almost all outcome measures for both groups over the 6-month followup period, but there were no differences between the groups even after adjusting for duration of symptoms.

Conclusion

Our study found little evidence to support the use of ESWT for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis and is in keeping with recent systematic reviews of ESWT for lateral epicondylitis that have drawn similar conclusions.

### Shock wave therapy for lateral elbow pain [^843ad6c3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one in a series of reviews of interventions for lateral elbow pain. Lateral elbow pain, or tennis elbow, is a common condition causing pain in the elbow and forearm and lack of strength and function of the elbow and wrist. Shock wave therapy (ESWT) involves the application of single pulsed acoustic wave. Since the 1990's reports of benefit of ESWT in the treatment of tendon disorders have been appearing in the literature. A systematic review published in the German language appeared in 2000 (Boddeker 2000)

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of ESWT in the treatment of adults with lateral elbow pain.

Search Strategy

Comprehensive electronic searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and SCISEARCH were combined with searches of the Cochrane Clinical Trails Registrar and the Musculoskeletal Review Group's specialist trial database. Identified keywords and authors were searched again in an effort to identify as many trials as possible.

Selection Criteria

Two independent reviewers assessed all identified trials against pre-determined inclusion criteria. Randomised and pseudo randomised trials in all languages were evaluated for inclusion in the review provided they described individuals with lateral elbow pain and were comparing the use of ESWT as a treatment strategy.

Data Collection and Analysis

For continuous variables means and standard deviations were extracted or imputed to allow the analysis of weighted mean difference. Weighted mean difference using a random effects model was selected when outcomes were measured on standard scales. A fixed effects model was used to interpret results and assess heterogeneity. For binary data numbers of events and total population were analysed and interpreted as relative risk.

Main Results

Two trials of ESWT versus placebo are included in this review (~~Rompe 1996~~, ~~Haake 2001~~). Both trials included similar study populations consisting of participants with chronic symptoms who had failed other conservative treatment. The frequency of ESWT application and the doses and techniques used were similar in both trials. The first trial demonstrated highly significant differences in favour of ESWT whereas the second trial found no benefits of ESWT over placebo. When the data from the two trials were pooled, the benefits observed in the first trial were no longer statistically significant. The relative risk for treatment failure (defined as Roles-Maudsley score of 4) of ESWT over placebo was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.08 to 1.91) at six weeks and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.09 to 2.17) at one year. After 6 weeks, there was no statistically significant improvement in pain at rest [WMD pain out of 100 = - 11.40 (95% CI, -26.10 to 3.30)], pain with resisted wrist extension [WMD pain out of 100 = -16.20 (95% CI, -47.75 to 15.36)] or pain with resisted middle finger extension [WMD pain out of 100 = -20.51(95% CI, -56.57 to 15.56)]. Results after 12 or 24 weeks were similar.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The two trials included in this review yielded conflicting results. Further trials are needed to clarify the value of ESWT for lateral elbow pain.

### Tennis elbow [^fddcb058]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lateral pain in the elbow affects up to 3% of the population, and is considered an overload injury of the extensor tendons of the forearm where they attach at the lateral epicondyle. Although usually self-limiting, symptoms may persist for over 1 year in up to 20% of people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for tennis elbow? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 30 systematic reviews, RCTs or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, corticosteroid injections, exercise and mobilisation, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (oral and topical), orthoses (bracing), and surgery.

### Does the type of extracorporeal shock therapy influence treatment effectiveness in lateral epicondylitis? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^6d8c9e92]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been used in various musculoskeletal disorders, including lateral epicondylitis. However, in 2005, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that ESWT provides minimal or no benefit in terms of pain and function in patients with lateral epicondylitis. Since the review, several randomized controlled trials including different types of ESWT such as radial type for lateral epicondylitis have been published. Investigations of the effect modifiers such as symptom and follow-up duration on the effects of ESWT on lateral epicondylitis have not been performed.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Does ESWT reduce pain and improve grip strength in patients with lateral epicondylitis? (2) Which type of ESWT, radial or focused, is more effective? (3) Is the duration of symptoms associated with the efficacy of ESWT for lateral epicondylitis? (4) Do improvements in pain scores remain in patients with longer follow-up?

Methods

The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched up to July 2019 for articles published in English or Korean. Studies were included if patient allocation was randomized, the sample was composed of patients with lateral epicondylitis, interventions were ESWT (focused or radial), comparison group only received sham stimulation or no additional treatment, and the study outcome was pain intensity or grip strength. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Twelve studies including 1104 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The mean difference for pain reduction and improvement in grip strength was calculated.

Results

The meta-analysis showed no clinically important difference in the VAS score (2.48 ± 7.55 versus 3.17 ± 9.78, mean difference -0.68 [95% confidence interval -1.17 to -0.19]; p = 0.006) and grip strength (38.02 ± 70.56 versus 34.85 ± 108.26, mean difference 3.33 [95% CI 0.93 to 5.73]; p = 0.007) after ESWT relative to the comparison group's score. Even though radial ESWT showed more improvement than focused, the mean difference for VAS did not exceed the minimal clinically important differences threshold. There were no clinically important effects on the VAS scores of patients with lateral epicondylitis (2.78 ± 5.57 versus 3.92 ± 6.29, mean difference -1.13 [95% CI -1.84 to -0.42]; p = 0.002) and focused ESWT did not improve pain in patients with lateral epicondylitis. In the subgroup analysis, ESWT was effective in patients with a symptom duration of more than 6 months (2.28 ± 8.48 versus 3.31 ± 11.81, mean difference -0.95 [95% CI -1.75 to -0.15]; p = 0.02) but not for those with shorter symptom duration. The effects did not last beyond 24 weeks (2.52 ± 9.19 versus 3.34 ± 5.93, mean difference -0.82 [95% CI -2.57 to 0.93]; p = 0.36).

Conclusions

ESWT did not show clinically important improvement in pain reduction and grip strength. Radial ESWT, symptom duration of longer than 6 months, and short follow-up duration (less than 24 weeks) were related to better effects. Further studies are needed to determine the appropriate protocol and elucidate the effects according to the intervention type and specific disease condition.

### Shock wave therapy for lateral elbow pain [^03227e61]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one in a series of reviews of interventions for lateral elbow pain.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for lateral elbow pain.

Search Strategy

Searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Science Citation Index (SCISEARCH) were conducted in February 2005, unrestricted by date.

Selection Criteria

We included nine trials that randomised 1006 participants to ESWT or placebo and one trial that randomised 93 participants to ESWT or steroid injection.

Data Collection and Analysis

For each trial two independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality and extracted data. Methodological quality criteria included appropriate randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, number lost to follow up and intention to treat analysis. Where appropriate, pooled analyses were performed. If there was significant heterogeneity between studies or the data reported did not allow statistical pooling, individual trial results were described in the text.

Main Results

Eleven of the 13 pooled analyses found no significant benefit of ESWT over placebo. For example, the weighted mean difference for improvement in pain (on a 100-point scale) from baseline to 4-6 weeks from a pooled analysis of three trials (446 participants) was -9.42 (95% CI -20.70 to 1.86) and the weighted mean difference for improvement in pain (on a 100-point scale) provoked by resisted wrist extension (Thomsen test) from baseline to 12 weeks from a pooled analysis of three trials (455 participants) was -9.04 (95% CI -19.37 to 1.28). Two pooled results favoured ESWT. For example, the pooled relative risk of treatment success (at least 50% improvement in pain with resisted wrist extension at 12 weeks) for ESWT in comparison to placebo from a pooled analysis of two trials (192 participants) was 2.2 (95% CI 1.55 to 3.12). However this finding was not supported by the results of four other individual trials that were unable to be pooled. Steroid injection was more effective than ESWT at 3 months after the end of treatment assessed by a reduction of pain of 50% from baseline (21/25 (84%) versus 29/48 (60%), p<0.05). Minimal adverse effects of ESWT were reported. Most commonly these were transient pain, reddening of the skin and nausea and in most cases did not require treatment discontinuation or dosage adjustment.

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon systematic review of nine placebo-controlled trials involving 1006 participants, there is "Platinum" level evidence that shock wave therapy provides little or no benefit in terms of pain and function in lateral elbow pain. There is "Silver" level evidence based upon one trial involving 93 participants that steroid injection may be more effective than ESWT.

### Systematic review of the efficacy and safety of shock wave therapy for lateral elbow pain [^fd1b92d7]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for lateral elbow pain.

Methods

Systematic review of randomized controlled trials using Cochrane Collaboration methodology.

Results

Nine placebo-controlled trials (1006 participants) and one trial of ESWT versus steroid injection (93 participants) were included. The 9 placebo-controlled trials reported conflicting results, although 11 of 13 pooled analyses found no significant benefit of ESWT over placebo, e.g., weighted mean difference for improvement in pain (on a 100-point scale) from baseline to 4-6 weeks (pooled analysis of 3 trials, 446 participants) was -9.42 (95% CI -20.70 to 1.86). Two pooled results favored ESWT, e.g., relative risk of treatment success (at least 50% improvement in pain with resisted wrist extension at 12 weeks) for ESWT in comparison to placebo (pooled analysis of 2 trials, 192 participants) was 2.2 (95% CI 1.55 to 3.12). However, this finding was not supported by the results of 4 other trials that were unable to be pooled. Steroid injection was more effective than ESWT at 3 months after the end of treatment assessed by a reduction of pain of 50% from baseline [21/25 (84%) vs 29/48 (60%); p < 0.05]. Minimal adverse effects of ESWT were reported.

Conclusion

Based upon systematic review of 9 placebo-controlled trials, there is "platinum" level evidence that ESWT provides little or no benefit in terms of pain and function in lateral elbow pain. There is "silver" level evidence based upon one trial that steroid injection may be more effective than ESWT.

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^92d1cd09]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is a common disease characterized by decreased grip and upper-extremity strength, along with pain on the outside of the elbow. It is pathology of the musculoskeletal system, secondary to recurrent microtrauma because of overuse of the upper extremity, causing pain and tenderness in the elbow area.–It is also known as “tennis elbow”, and is observed in 5%–10% of tennis players.The annual incidence in the population is 1%–3%,with people aged 35–50 years and older being most commonly affected.Clinically, it is characterized by pain radiating from the lateral aspect of the elbow to the forearm and loss of function because of decrease in grip strength secondary to tenderness and pain at compression in the lateral epicondyle, and it is more frequently seen in the dominant hand.

Conservative approaches or surgical therapy can be used in the treatment of LE. The purpose of conservative treatment is to decrease pain, control inflammation, accelerate healing, and ensure that the patient performs daily life activities smoothly. While progressive strengthening is the most commonly used method among conservative treatment methods, other methods include watchful waiting, local injection, ultrasound, manipulation, manual therapy, Cyrax, lateral glide technique, extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (ESWT), laser, splinting, resting, hot–cold application, electrotherapy, massage, and oral or topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.Recently, ESWT has been used more commonly than other treatment methods, because it is noninvasive, well tolerated by patients, and has fewer side effects.However, the efficacy of ESWT in LE is controversial. Some studies have reported that ESWT is barely effective or as effective as placebo in LE.However, some other studies have reported that it is quite effective and could even be an alternative to surgery.

### How does surgery compare to sham surgery or physiotherapy as a treatment for tendinopathy? A systematic review of randomised trials [^92a15f50]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Methods

The present systematic review has been conducted and authored according to the ‘ Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses’(PRISMA) guidelines (figure 1).

Figure 1 
PRISMA flow diagram of included studies. PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Eligibility

Included studies had a randomised design and compared surgery to any mode of non-surgical management for any type of tendinopathy in terms of at least one of the following outcomes: ‘pain’, ‘function’, ‘ROM’, ‘force/strength’, ‘patient satisfaction’, ‘treatment success’, ‘QoL’, ‘complications’. Non-randomised observational studies, case reports, case series and literature reviews were excluded. Participants had to be over 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of tendinopathy with or without radiological signs. Studies including patients with full tendon tears were excluded. Duration of symptoms/signs was not a criterion, neither was length of conservative treatment and follow-up. Language criterion was not applied.

Search strategy

A thorough literature search was conducted by two of the authors (DC and CC) independently via Medline, EMBASE, Scopus and CINAHL in March 2018, with the following Boolean operators: ‘(tendinopathy OR tendinosis OR tendinitis OR tendonitis OR tennis elbow OR jumper’s knee OR lateral elbow tendinopathy OR lateral epicondylitis OR rotator cuff disease OR shoulder impingement OR patellar OR Achilles) AND (surgery OR surgical management OR surgical treatment OR tenotomy OR open surgery OR arthroscopic surgery) AND (conservative management OR conservative treatment OR physiotherapy OR eccentric exercises OR eccentric strengthening OR stretching OR shock-wave therapy OR ESWT OR extracorporeal shock wave therapy OR ultrasound OR iontophoresis OR laser OR LLLT OR polidocanol OR sclerotherapy OR botox OR botulinum toxin OR GTN OR glyceryl trinitrate OR nitroglycerin OR corticosteroid injections OR platelet rich plasma OR PRP OR autologous blood OR sham surgery)’.

Medical Subject Heading terms were not used to minimise the risk of missing relevant articles. Review articles were used to identify eligible articles that were missed at the initial search. Additionally, reference list screening and citation tracking in Google Scholar were performed for each relevant article.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the supportive care and rehabilitation of cancer patients [^d956740d]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cancer patients sometimes show immobilizing musculoskeletal conditions which prohibit active exercise due to severe bodily pain. Therefore, before starting a rehabilitative exercise program, the pain has to be reduced to enable the patient to participate actively in the exercise program. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT, the application of radial and/or focused shock waves with low or high energy) has been shown to be effective and efficient in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. However, one historical paradigm was the fact that, in the past, cancer was seen as a contraindication for the use of ESWT.

Methods

Clinical note to present indications, benefits, and contraindications of shock wave treatment in cancer patients.

Results

Malignant tumors in the treatment area have to be seen as a contraindication for the use of ESWT treatment. Cancer itself—in the form of the underlying disease—is not a contraindication for the treatment with radial and focused shock wave therapy with low or high energy. Plantar fasciitis and calcaneal spurs, calcified shoulder, tennis elbow or Achilles tendinopathy, and delayed healing and chronic wounds are typical approved standard indications for ESWT, and are allowed when the malignant tumor is not in the treatment area. There are also other musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal indications (e.g. myofascial syndrome, erectile dysfunction, polyneuropathy, and lymphedema) that are relevant for cancer survivors. These indications are recommended by the International Society for Medical Shockwave Treatment (ISMST) for “common empirically tested clinical use” and as exceptional indications/expert indications.

Conclusion

ESWT is a safe and relevant modality for the supportive care and rehabilitation of cancer patients.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials on physical interventions for lateral epicondylalgia [^c880fbb8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

A systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of physical interventions for lateral epicondylalgia (tennis elbow) was carried out. Seventy six randomised controlled trials were identified, 28 of which satisfied the minimum criteria for meta-analysis. The evidence suggests that extracorporeal shock wave therapy is not beneficial in the treatment of tennis elbow. There is a lack of evidence for the long term benefit of physical interventions in general. However, further research with long term follow up into manipulation and exercise as treatments is indicated.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the supportive care and rehabilitation of cancer patients [^282612be]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Cancer rehabilitation has been shown to be a relevant means to accelerate return to work and improve the work ability and social participation of cancer survivors. In cancer rehabilitation, physical modalities such as exercise to improve muscular strength, endurance capacity, sensorimotor functions, and flexibility are of a very high relevance. Nevertheless, some musculoskeletal conditions, such as plantar fasciitis or calcaneal spurs, calcifying tendinopathy of the shoulder, and tennis elbow or Achilles tendinopathy, immobilize the patient and prohibit active participation in exercise, due to severe bodily pain. Therefore, before starting a rehabilitative exercise program, the bodily pain has to be reduced to enable the patient to participate actively.

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in musculoskeletal disorders is a conservative treatment modality, which has been developed over the last 25 years, and has been shown to be both very effective and time- and cost-efficient. Nevertheless, there are several historical (and “traditional”) paradigms which have changed during this time period; one of them was the fact that, in the past, cancer represented a contraindication for the use of ESWT.

The International Society for Medical Shockwave Treatment (ISMST) (the managing board, the advisory board and the Senators of the ISMST) issued clinical recommendations for the use of therapeutic shock waves in clinical practice in October 2016.

These recommendations were assembled based on an assessment of the current published scientific and clinical information and accepted approaches to treatment, and were intended to aid the clinician in the use of ESWT. In particular, the guidelines were intended to clarify the indications and contraindications for treatment. Malignant tumors, metastasis, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma in the treatment area have to be seen as contraindications for treatment with radial and focused shock waves with low and high energy. Cancer itself, in the form of the underlying disease, is not a contraindication for ESWT. Active leukemia and leukemic phase of lymphoma (not in remission) are, however, contraindications for the use of ESWT. A minimum level of standard examinations before performing ESWT is necessary, including clinical examination, radiological imaging, and neurological and/or laboratory diagnostic tests.

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^87bb4df1]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Several studies have evaluated the efficacy of ESWT and WESs. However, there has been no study evaluating the efficacy of these two methods comparatively. In our study, we compared the efficacy of these methods. There was no statistically significant difference between demographic and clinical characteristics of patient groups after randomization. The homogeneous distribution of the groups may indicate that results obtained after treatment were highly independent of pretreatment values.

In a systematic review, it was reported that LE was observed equally in males and females, but more frequently in male tennis players than female tennis players.In addition, according to the literature, LE is observed in the dominant hand more frequently.In our study, numbers of female and male patients were similar to each other (ESWT male/female 15/17, WES 19/16). In addition, similarly to Dundar et al,we found that LE was seen in the dominant hand more frequently (ESWT 24/8, WES 27/8). In the majority of studies on LE, VAS has been used to evaluate pain, and it has been stated that a 1-point change in VAS score might be of clinical significance. In some studies, on the other hand, a 50% reduction in VAS score from baseline was considered significant.In our study, we obtained 2.4–2.9 points of change in VAS scores compared to baseline values and reduction >50% in both ESWT and WES groups. Measuring grip strength is an objective method of evaluating treatment response and functional recovery.In our study, we used a hand dynamometer to evaluate grip strength. We noted significant improvement in both groups (ESWT, WES).

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^e0c88e22]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (ESWT) and wrist-extensor splints (WESs) are two commonly used methods in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. In this study, the efficacy of these two methods was compared.

Methods

The study was planned as a prospective randomized controlled study. A total of 67 patients were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups: group 1 received ESWT (32 patients) and group 2 received WES (35 patients). Patients in group 1 underwent four sessions of ESWT once every week. In each session, an ESWT device at 10–12 Hz, 2,000 pulses, and 1.6–1.8 bar pressure was used. Patients in group 2 used a wrist splint, holding the wrist at 30°–45° extension for 4 weeks. Patients were assessed for handgrip strength, pain at rest, pain while working, and quality of life. Data were collected before and after treatment (at weeks 4, 12, and 24). A visual analog scale was used to evaluate pain at rest and while working, a hand dynamometer for handgrip strength, subscales of the SF36 Health Survey to evaluate quality of life, and the Turkish version of the patient-rated tennis-elbow evaluation was used to evaluate functioning of the affected arm during various daily life activities.

Results

In both ESWT and WES groups, although there were considerably significant improvements (P <0.001) in the parameters evaluated (pain at rest and while working, handgrip strength, Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation, Nirschl score, and SF36 subscales) were observed at 4, 12, and 24 weeks compared to pretreatment values, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of our evaluation parameters at the three time points (P >0.05).

Conclusion

Both ESWT and WES applications were found to yield significantly superior results when compared to pretreatment values. In comparison of the two groups, on the other hand, there was no statistically significant difference.

### Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy is not more effective than placebo in the management of lateral epicondylitis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^47e76b91]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) on pain, function, and grip strength in the treatment of patients with lateral epicondylitis unresponsive to previous treatments.

Design

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in outpatient clinics in a medical faculty hospital. Fifty-six patients with lateral epicondylitis were randomized to rESWT (n = 28) or sham rESWT (n = 28) groups. Both the patients and the outcome assessing investigator were blinded to group assignment. The rESWT was administered to the painful epicondyle at the elbow with a total of 2000 pulses of 10 Hz frequency at a 1.8 bar of air pressure at each session at three once weekly sessions. Sham rESWT was applied without the contact of the applicator at the same area. Study patients were assessed at baseline and at 1 and 3 mos after treatment using a visual analog scale for pain and Roles and Maudsley scale and Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation for pain and function. Grip strength of the affected extremity was also measured using a hand dynamometer.

Results

Both rESWT and sham rESWT groups showed a significant improvement in all outcome measures at posttreatment follow-up points. Favorable absolute and percentage changes in assessments at 1- and 3-mo posttreatment did not show any significant difference between groups.

Conclusions

The rESWT does not seem to be more effective either in reducing pain or improving function or grip strength in patients with lateral epicondylitis at least at 3 mos after treatment when compared with sham rESWT.

### Chronic lateral epicondylitis of the elbow: a prospective study of low-energy shockwave therapy and low-energy shockwave therapy plus manual therapy of the cervical spine [^da26af79]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) alone with a combination of ESWT and manual therapy of the cervical spine in treating chronic tennis elbow.

Design

Prospective, matched single-blind control trial.

Setting

University hospital clinic.

Patients

Thirty patients with unilateral chronic tennis elbow, an unsuccessful conservative therapy during the 6 months before referral, and clinical signs of cervical dysfunction (eg, pressure pain at the C4-5 and/or C5-6 level, protraction of the head).

Interventions

Three times at weekly intervals all patients received 1000 shockwave impulses of an energy flux density of.16mJ/mm(2) at the lateral elbow. Additionally, they underwent manual therapy of the cervical spine and the cervicothoracic junction 10 times (group I). For each patient, a control matched by age (3-yr range) and gender at first conservative treatment was drawn at random from 127 patients who had undergone low-energy shockwave therapy in the same unit in the past 3 years (group II). Follow-up examinations took place at 12 weeks and at 12 months.

Main Outcome Measures

The Roles and Maudsley outcome score at 12 months, defining an excellent or good result with no or only occasional discomfort without limitation of activity and range of motion.

Results

Neither group differed statistically before the study, with a poor rating for all patients (p >.05). At 12 months, there was still no significant difference, with the outcome being excellent or good in 56% in group I, and in 60% in group II (p >.05). Each group showed significant improvement compared with the respective prestudy evaluation (p <.0001).

Conclusion

ESWT may be an effective conservative treatment method for unilateral chronic tennis elbow. The efficacy of additional cervical manual therapy for lateral epicondylitis remains questionable.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the supportive care and rehabilitation of cancer patients [^941e31a0]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Only a qualified physician should use focused shock wave therapy to treat pathologies which have been determined by diagnostic testing.

For ESWT, there are approved standard indications (for example, plantar fasciitis, with or without heel spur; calcifying tendinopathy of the shoulder; lateral epicondylopathy of the elbow/tennis elbow or Achilles tendinopathy; bone non-union/pseudarthroses; delayed or non-healing wounds), common empirically tested clinical uses (for example, bone marrow edema, different tendinopathies, myofascial syndrome), and so-called “exceptional indications” (expert indications, for example, erectile dysfunction, polyneuropathy, and lymphedema).

In cancer rehabilitation, there are typical side-effects to overcome, such as polyneuropathy, lymphedema, musculoskeletal pain, and reduced physical performance. These side-effects need effective and, in most cases, time-efficient treatment. The interdisciplinary field of physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) has its clinical research focus on the treatment of musculoskeletal pain, polyneuropathy, and lymphedema, and on an improvement of physical performance by the use of exercise. At our department, we have a strong expertise in the use of ESWT for different conditions such as calcaneal spurs, calcific tendinitis of the shoulder, tennis elbow, and musculoskeletal pain syndromes. Secondary complications of cancer and its treatment, such as lymphedema and polyneuropathy, are of great relevance for many cancer patients. Since a specific causal therapy for those disorders does not exist, they are currently the focus of our research.

ESWT as a physical treatment option is only contraindicated at the tumor site. Unfortunately, many physicians still deem cancer as a general contraindication for the use of ESWT. As a result, many cancer patients remain undertreated and, in the worst cases, cannot be mobilized due to bodily pain. There are, however, additional conditions (e.g. polyneuropathy or lymphedema) for the use of ESWT in cancer patients recommended by the ISMST as exceptional indications or expert indications. For these indications (polyneuropathy and lymphedema), in our opinion, a superficial area-wide ESWT treatment (not at the tumor site) of the affected limb is suggested.

Erectile dysfunction is another condition of interest in cancer rehabilitation. This indication can also be treated with ESWT, but has to be managed in an interdisciplinary setting.

### The clinical efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy combined with platelet-rich plasma and exercise for lateral epicondylitis: prospective randomized sham-controlled ultrasonographic study [^61445750]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the combined effect of 2 different regenerative therapies, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP), along with therapeutic exercise, in patients with lateral epicondylitis (LE).

Design

Prospective, randomized, sham-controlled trial.

Settings

Outpatient clinic.

Participants

Ninety-one patients (N=91) with LE for >3 months were randomly allocated into 3 groups.

Interventions

Participants were assigned to PRP+ESWT, Sham PRP+ESWT, or ESWT only treatment group. All groups received exercise therapy.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score. Secondary outcomes included handgrip strength, Patient-rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE), Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (Quick DASH), Short Form 36, ultrasonographic assessments (common extensor tendon [CET] measurement and total ultrasonography scale score [TUSS]), and isokinetic evaluation. Participants were evaluated 3 times: pre-treatment (T0), after 4 weeks (T1), and after 12 weeks (T2).

Results

The PRP group showed superiority over other groups in terms of VAS (activity and night) scores at follow-ups. With regard to the secondary outcomes, in the short term, the PRP group demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the PRTEE-function. In the 12th week, PRP outperformed only against ESWT in all PRTEE parameters, and also showed superior Quick DASH scores to the other groups. In handgrip strength, the PRP group demonstrated superiority over the Sham PRP group at T1 and over both groups at T2. In the isokinetic evaluation, PRP group showed superiority over the Sham PRP group in both wrist flexion/extension peak torque scores during follow-ups. No significant differences were found in any of the ultrasonographic parameters, including CET thickness and TUSS scores, between the groups at the 4th and 12th week.

Conclusions

The combined application of ESWT and PRP in the management of LE has demonstrated superior efficacy, as evidenced by significant improvements in clinical parameters.

### Repetitive low-energy shock wave treatment for chronic lateral epicondylitis in tennis players [^dd6ef1ec]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

There is conflicting evidence regarding extracorporeal shock wave treatment for chronic tennis elbow.

Hypothesis

Treatment with repetitive low-energy extracorporeal shock wave treatment is superior to repetitive placebo extra-corporeal shock wave treatment.

Methods

Seventy-eight patients enrolled in a placebo-controlled trial. All patients were tennis players with recalcitrant MRI-confirmed tennis elbow of at least 12 months' duration. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either active low-energy extracorporeal shock wave treatment given weekly for 3 weeks (treatment group 1) or an identical placebo extracorporeal shock wave treatment (sham group 2). Main outcome measure was pain during resisted wrist extension at 3 months; secondary measures were >50% reduction of pain and the Upper Extremity Function Scale.

Results

At 3 months, there was a significantly higher improvement in pain during resisted wrist extension in group 1 than in group 2 (mean [SD] improvement, 3.5 [2.0] and 2.0 [1.9]; P =.001 for between-group difference of improvement) and in the Upper Extremity Function Scale (mean [SD] improvement, 23.4 [14.8] and 10.9 [14.9]; P <.001 for between-group difference of improvement). In the treatment group, 65% of patients achieved at least a 50% reduction of pain, compared with 28% of patients in the sham group (P =.001 for between-group difference).

Conclusion

Low-energy extracorporeal shock wave treatment as applied is superior to sham treatment for tennis elbow.

### Surgery for lateral elbow pain [^f2cf09bd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Surgery is sometimes recommended for persistent lateral elbow pain where other less invasive interventions have failed.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and safety of surgery for lateral elbow pain.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science unrestricted by date or language (to 15 December 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and controlled clinical trials assessing a surgical intervention compared with no treatment or another intervention including an alternate surgical intervention, in adults with lateral elbow pain.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.

Main Results

We included five trials involving 191 participants with persistent symptoms of at least five months duration and failed conservative treatment. Three trials compared two different surgical procedures and two trials compared surgery to a non-surgical treatment. All trials were highly susceptible to bias. Meta-analysis was precluded due to differing comparator groups and outcome measures. One trial (24 participants) reported no difference between open extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) surgery and radiofrequency microtenotomy, although reanalysis found that pain was significantly lower in the latter group at three weeks (MD -2.80 points on 10 point scale, 95% CI -5.07 to -0.53). One trial (26 participants) reported no difference between open ECRB surgery and decompression of the posterior interosseous nerve in terms of the number of participants with improvement in pain pain on activity, or tenderness on palpation after an average of 31 months following surgery. One trial (45 participants) found that compared with open release of the ERCB muscle, percutaneous release resulted in slightly better function. One trial (40 participants) found comparable results between open surgical release of the ECRB and botulinum toxin injection at two years, although we could not extract any data for this review. One trial (56 participants) found that extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) improved pain at night compared with percutaneous tenotomy at 12 months (MD 5 points on 100 point VAS, 95% CI 1.12 to 8.88), but there were no differences in pain at rest or pain on applying pressure.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to a small number of studies, large heterogeneity in interventions across trials, small sample sizes and poor reporting of outcomes, there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of surgery for lateral elbow pain. Further well-designed randomised controlled trials and development of standard outcome measures are needed.

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^2b6f33ea]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

The SF36 Health Survey form was used to evaluate patients’ quality of life. Koçyigˇit et al evaluated the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of this questionnaire.The SF36 is composed of 36 items, and the scale contains eight subscales: physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health. Scores in each subscale range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.The Turkish version of the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE-T) questionnaire was used to evaluate functioning of the affected arm during various daily life activities. The PRTEE-T questionnaire was validated by Altan et alin measuring changes in functional impairment. The PRTEE is composed of two subscales: pain (five questions); functional disability (ten questions), with functional disability composed of two subtitles – specific activities (six questions) and usual activities (four questions) – and 15 questions. In calculation, the average of the sum of specific activities and usual activities scales and the sum of pain scale are evaluated over 100. Low scores indicate that daily life activities are better. The questionnaire has considerably high reliability.We used Nirschl scores to assess pain in the affected arm during exercise. Patients were then instructed to mark the most appropriate option indicating the severity of pain during exercise on a Nirschl scale of 1–7 to evaluate pain in the affected arm during exercise. Low scores indicated lower intensity of pain during exercise in the affected arm.Three males and one female in the ESWT group and one male in the WES group failed to complete the treatment. These patients were excluded from the study.

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^4279116c]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

In many studies, the PRTEE scale was used to assess arm disability.–PRTEE was shown to be an appropriate test in evaluating LE. In our study, we used the PRTEE-T. We obtained statistically significant results in PRTEE scores at 4, 12, and 24 weeks compared to pretreatment values. Similarly, SF36 subscales have been used to evaluate quality of life in many studies. It has been emphasized that it is an important scale evaluating the quality of life.–We also used SF36 subscales in our study. We obtained improvements in both ESWT and WES groups compared to pretreatment values. We planned a four-session treatment with a similar design to that of Pettrone et alwith 2,000 pulses per session. Although application interval varies, in our study we applied ESWT with 7-day intervals, because generally accepted opinion for sufficient level of effectiveness is applying sessions with 5- to 7-day intervals.

In the literature, there have been conflicting reports on the efficacy of ESWT in the treatment of LE. According to some publications, there is a reduction in pain and increase in functions and grip strength after ESWT application,,,while according to some other studies, strong evidence was provided that ESWT has little or no benefit for lateral elbow pain.–On the other hand, there have been studies advocating that ESWT is a treatment method yielding successful results, especially in persistent LE cases.The reason for these conflicting results might be differences in the number of pulses delivered, frequency, duration of application, treatment interval, and different devices used, depending on the different treatment protocols used. This is because when the literature is examined, it is seen that ESWT does not have a standard treatment protocol for LE, and different numbers of pulses, frequencies, duration of application, treatment intervals, and device applications are available.

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^e90af66a]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

In the statistical evaluation of our data, SPSS 15.0 for Windows program was used. Quantitative variables are presented as mean ± SD and categorical variables as number and percentage. Data were tested for normal distribution. The independent t -test was used for paired comparisons of normally distributed variables of the ESWT and WES groups at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Variables of the ESWT and WES groups without normal distribution at 4, 12, and 24 weeks were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. In comparison to the variables of the ESWT and WES groups at 4, 12, and 24 weeks, analysis of variance was used in repeated measurements. The χ 2 -test was used to compare qualitative variables of the groups. Hypotheses were two-tailed, and P ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. While the power analysis of the number of subjects we set for randomization was 0.82 for each group (n=41), the power analysis of the number of subjects remaining after exclusion criteria was 0.76 for each group (n=36). In addition, the power analysis of the total number of all subjects taken into the study (n=67) was calculated to be 0.92.

### Does kinesiotaping improve pain and functionality in patients with newly diagnosed lateral epicondylitis? [^b092faf8]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to compare the short-term effects of kinesiotaping and extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) along with physiotherapy on pain, functionality, and grip strength in patients with newly diagnosed lateral epicondylitis undergoing rehabilitation.

Methods

Forty-five voluntary patients (mean age 48 years) were randomly assigned to three groups. Patients in all groups received physiotherapy consisting of a cold pack and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation five times per week for a total of 15 sessions and a home exercise programme including stretching and eccentric strength exercises. In the second group, patients received kinesiotaping 5 days a week for 3 weeks. In the third group, ESWT was applied three times for 3 weeks. Patients were assessed by visual analogue scale for pain intensity, pain-free grip strength using a hand dynamometer, Cyriax Resisted Muscle Test, and Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation Scale. All measurements were collected at baseline and after treatment.

Results

There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the patients in all groups at baseline. Intra-group analysis revealed that pain intensity decreased, whereas maximum grip strength and functionality increased in all groups at the end of the treatment (p < 0.05). Inter-group analysis revealed that the kinesiotaping group yielded better results in decreasing pain intensity than the other groups (p < 0.05). The kinesiotaping group (p < 0.001) and ESWT group (p = 0.002) yielded better results in improving functionality than the physiotherapy group. There were significant differences in recovering pain-free grip strength in the kinesiotaping group (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

Kinesiotaping was found to be effective for decreasing pain intensity, recovering grip strength, and improving functionality in patients with lateral epicondylitis undergoing rehabilitation.

Level Of Evidence

Therapeutic study, Level II.

### Extracorporeal acoustic shock waves to treat complications of polymethylmethacrylate [^fea718c5]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Acoustic shock waves (ASWs) were first applied as extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) to PMMA in some experimental studies of total hip arthroplasty revision in dogs and pigs. Arthroplasty revision surgery has a significant morbidity, which can be partially attributed to PMMA cement. The ASWs were described as facilitating the extraction of PMMA.

Hach et al. demonstrated an evident decrease in the force necessary for extracting bone cement after applying shock waves. They found no macroscopically evident damage to the cortical bone and the surrounding tissues.

Shock waves were used in vivo for the disintegration of renal and ureteral calculi in 1980. The therapy was named extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Shortly after that, in 1985, its use was extended to the rupture of gallbladder stones. In 1988, the use of acoustic shock waves for the treatment of pseudarthrosis of long bone fractures was successfully tested in Germany. In the 1990s, they were applied to treating plantar fasciitis, lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow), and calcific tendonitis of the rotator cuff. Application fields multiply over the years.

Although the breakdown of urinary and gallstones is purely mechanical, low-energy shock waves have shown a mechanotransduction effect on the biochemistry of the cell. This aspect permits us to understand the healing powers of acoustic shock waves in various tissues. In fact, when applied in non-urological indications, the mechanisms of action of shock waves are not linked to the direct mechanical effect but to the different types of biological reactions induced by acoustic stimulations through mechanotransduction. Mechanotransduction is a particular biological response of many cell types, which involves the conversion of biomechanical forces from the extracellular environment into biochemical responses after the perception of these biomechanical forces and the processing of the resulting signalling. The biochemical reactions consist of the modulation of some fundamental cellular functions such as migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

### Focused extracorporeal shock wave therapy for hemiplegic shoulder pain: a randomized crossover pilot study in stroke patients [^60308332]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Peripheral musculoskeletal factors and central pain mechanisms such as maladaptive neuroplastic changes, central sensitization, and altered sensory processing are increasingly recognized as important contributors to persistent HSP in stroke survivors.One promising intervention is extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), which involves the use of shock waves to stimulate tissue repair and regeneration, reduce pain, and facilitate functional recovery.Based on the method of operation, ESWT can be divided into focused and radial ESWT (F-ESWT and R-ESWT, respectively), which differ in their shockwave propagation and energy characteristics. R-ESWT, which is generated using pneumatic devices, creates low-energy linear pressure waves that penetrate approximately 3 cm into the skin and cover a broader treatment area. By contrast, F-ESWT uses electromagnetic, electrohydraulic, or piezoelectric sources to produce high-pressure pulses (10–100 MPa), concentrating acoustic energy at a penetration depth of up to 12 cm.Among the various F-ESWT generation methods, the piezoelectric type offers distinct advantages, including precise focal targeting, consistent energy delivery, and the ability to stimulate deep tissue structures with minimal discomfort.To our knowledge, its application in stroke-related HSP has not been previously investigated, representing a novel approach in this clinical context. Additionally, F-ESWT typically involves a relatively short treatment duration and minimal recovery time, enhancing its appeal as a noninvasive therapeutic option.Recently, F-ESWT has been demonstrated to be superior to R-ESWT in terms of long-term pain relief in treating non-calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy, which is the most frequent lesion in HSP.Furthermore, a randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial of patients with lateral epicondylitis reported that F-ESWT was more effective than R-ESWT in terms of pain and functional measurements of the painful lateral elbow.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy shows superiority over injections for pain relief and grip strength recovery in lateral epicondylitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^ce58519f]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To examine the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) and injection therapies by synthesizing direct and indirect evidence for all pairs of competing therapies for lateral epicondylitis.

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched for all appropriate randomized controlled trials (RCTs), assessing the effect of ESWT or injection therapies. The primary outcome was short-term (≤3 months) and medium-term (>3 months but ≤12 months) pain, while the secondary outcomes were grip strength and patient-reported outcome measures. All outcomes were assessed using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) and were ranked using surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) probabilities to determine a hierarchy of treatments. Sensitivity analysis was performed to eliminate potential therapeutic effects of normal saline (NS) and exclude trials that included patients with acute lateral epicondylitis (LE).

Results

40 RCTs were included to evaluate ESWT and five different injection therapies, including corticosteroids (CSs), autologous whole blood, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A), and dextrose prolotherapy (DPT). DPT (-.78 [-1.34 to -.21]), ESWT (.57 [-.89 to -.25]), PRP (-.48 [-.85 to -.11]), and BoNT-A (-.43 [-.84 to -.02]) outperformed placebo for short-term pain relief; ESWT (-.44 [-.85 to -.04]) outperformed placebo for medium-term pain relief. DPT was ranked as the most optimal short-term and medium-term pain reliever (SUCRA, 87.3% and 98.6%, respectively). ESWT was ranked as the most optimal short-term and medium-term grip strength recovery (SUCRA; 79.4% and 86.4%, respectively).

Conclusions

DPT and ESWT were the best two treatment options for pain control and ESWT was the best treatment option for grip strength recovery. CSs were not recommended for the treatment of LE. More evidence is required to confirm the superiority in pain control of DPT among all these treatment options on LE.

### Treatment of lateral epicondylitis [^ab9e581e]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis is a common overuse syndrome of the extensor tendons of the forearm. It is sometimes called tennis elbow, although it can occur with many activities. The condition affects men and women equally and is more common in persons 40 years or older. Despite the prevalence of lateral epicondylitis and the numerous treatment strategies available, relatively few high-quality clinical trials support many of these treatment options; watchful waiting is a reasonable option. Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, ultrasonography, and iontophoresis with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs appear to provide short-term benefits. Use of an inelastic, nonarticular, proximal forearm strap (tennis elbow brace) may improve function during daily activities. Progressive resistance exercises may confer modest intermediate-term results. Evidence is mixed on oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, mobilization, and acupuncture. Patients with refractory symptoms may benefit from surgical intervention. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy, laser treatment, and electromagnetic field therapy do not appear to be effective.

### Editorial commentary: arthroscopic debridement of tennis elbow nonresponsive to nonoperative measures is a good Option And clinical outcomes are associated with radiographic outcomes [^4a239fa6]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic lateral epicondylitis, or "tennis elbow," is rare and affects 1% to 3% of adults annually. The initial treatment should be nonoperative and include physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, rest, bracing, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, and injection therapy with various agents such as autologous blood, dextrose, corticosteroids, or platelet-rich plasma. The condition is self-limited, and approximately 80% of cases resolve. In refractory cases, arthroscopic release with debridement is a good surgical option but is not superior to open or percutaneous techniques. Recent research shows that a reduction in magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity in patients who respond to arthroscopic treatment correlates with pain reduction and functional outcome improvement.

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^11fc48b6]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Mean VAS scores for pain at rest and pain while working before treatment in the WES group were 4.7±1.5 and 7.3±2.5, respectively, whereas mean VAS scores after treatment were 2.1±1.1 and 3.3±1.9 at 4 weeks (55.4% and 54.8% reduction in pain), 1.9±1.2 and 3.1±1.8 at 12 weeks (59.6% and 57.6% reduction in pain), and 2.4±1.2 and 3.4±1.9 at 24 weeks (49.0% and 53.5% reduction in pain). There were statistically significant increases in grip strength at 4, 12, and 24 weeks after treatment compared to pretreatment values (P <0.001). There were significant increases in PRTEE-T and Nirschl scores evaluating functioning and pain of the affected arm in various daily life activities at 4, 12, and 24 weeks compared to pretreatment values (P <0.001). In addition, there were significant improvements in all subscales of the SF36 at 4, 12, and 24 weeks compared to pretreatment values (P <0.001; Table 3).

However, when results for WES patients in the ESWT and WES groups before treatment (at week 0) and after treatment (at weeks 4, 12, and 24) were compared, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups in terms of VAS scores for pain at rest, pain while working, grip strength, PRTEE-T and Nirschl scores evaluating functioning and pain of the affected arm in various daily life activities, or any subscale of the SF36 (P >0.05; Table 4).

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^9c387e7c]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Study groups

Patients receiving ESWT were designated as group 1 (32 patients) and those receiving WES as group 2 (35 patients). In the ESWT group (group 1 – 32 LE), four sessions of ESWT were delivered once per week. In each session, an ESWT device (DolorClast; EMS, Nyon, Switzerland) at 12 Hz, 2,000 pulses, and 1.8 bar pressure was used. Shock waves can be focal or radial. Focal shock waves have deeper tissue penetration (10 cm) and a higher power effect (0.08–0.28 mJ/mm 2). Focal shock waves are not used for musculoskeletal disorders, because of their high energy and difficulty of application. Radial shock waves have lower penetration (3 cm), lower effect (0.02–0.06 mJ/mm 2), and limited biological effect.Radial ESWT has been shown to be effective in more superficial musculoskeletal disorders, because of the limited amount of energy, simplicity of use, no need for sedation, and no need for monitoring with radiographic or echographic devices.Radial ESWT is commonly used in musculoskeletal diseases. The application was performed while the patient was in a sitting position with the shoulder at 45° abduction, elbow flexed, and forearm supported in a supine position. ESWT was applied to the most tender spot on the lateral epicondyle and surrounding area. No local anesthetic or analgesic medication was administered before or during application. In the WES group (group 2 – 35 LE), a wrist splint (Manu Comfort; Ottobock, Duderstadt, Germany) holding the wrist at 30°–45° extension was applied for 4 weeks. The patients were randomized using a numbered-envelope method. Both groups were given wrist-and forearm-strengthening isokinetic exercises.

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^64977f23]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Presently, there is no universally accepted and standardized LE-treatment program. For this reason, we examined the effectiveness of ESWT and WESs both in themselves and in comparison with each other. Both treatment methods were noninvasive, painless, and easy to apply. In conclusion, we found that ESWT and WES were considerably effective in decreasing pain, improving grip strength, increasing quality of life, and alleviating arm pain during daily life activities in the treatment of LE. It can be said that ESWT and WES are effective conservative treatment options in the treatment of LE. As both methods are comparable in terms of efficacy, when we evaluate ESWT and WES in terms of cost-effectiveness and efficacy, WES seems to be slightly more advantageous than ESWT, because WES is cheap, easy to apply, and does not cause complications. We recommend the use of WES in terms of cost-effectiveness and efficacy. Our study has some limitations. The SF36, PRTEE, and Nirschl questionnaires are patient-reported instruments, and the number of patients in the study was low.

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^b63e1383]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The was a planned prospective randomized controlled study, and conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association, Declaration of Helsinki, and the International Council for Harmonisation guidelines for good clinical practice. The study protocol was approved by the Dicle University Medical School ethics committee (DUTF-2013–79). In addition, participants were informed about the study. Written and verbal consent was received from all participants. In the scope of the study, a total of 67 patients (33 females and 34 males) who had been treated based on a diagnosis of unilateral LE between September 2015 and May 2017 were evaluated. The mean age was 38.84±6.77 years in the ESWT group and 37.94±6.45 years in the WES group, and the mean body mass index was 27.21±1.38 in the ESWT group and 26.340±2.29 in the WES group. Figure 1 shows the schema for the patients’ records.

The clinical diagnosis of LE was made with physical examination. In addition, standard anteroposterior and lateral elbow radiographs were obtained. Patients with pain in the lateral elbow, local tenderness to palpation on the lateral epicondyle, pain in the lateral elbow with resisted wrist extension, and patients with positive Mill’s testresults were included in the study. Patients with bilateral LE, carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, previous elbow surgery, previous conservative and surgical treatment for LE, neurological deficits in the upper extremity, systemic disease, other diseases in the neck and shoulder region, lateral epicondylar tendon ruptures, tumors in the forearm and elbow, osteoporosis, and hemophilia were excluded from the study. All patients were instructed to avoid taking painkillers during the treatment and follow-up period. All patients were provided information on the procedures of the study.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a randomized multicenter trial [^889c176d]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2002). Low credibility.

Background

On the basis of observational trials, numerous investigators have recommended extracorporeal shock wave therapy as an alternative treatment for chronic lateral epicondylitis of the elbow. However, there has been no evidence of its efficacy from well-designed randomized clinical trials. The objective of this study was to find out whether extracorporeal shock wave therapy in combination with local anesthesia was superior to placebo therapy in combination with local anesthesia.

Methods

A randomized multicenter trial with a parallel-group design was conducted. Following administration of local anesthesia, either extracorporeal shock wave therapy with three treatments of 2000 pulses each and a positive energy flux density (ED+) of 0.07 to 0.09 mJ/mm (2) or placebo therapy was applied on an outpatient basis. Treatment allocation was blinded for patients and for observers. The primary end point was based on the rate of success, as determined with the Roles and Maudsley score and whether additional treatment was required, twelve weeks after the intervention. Crossover was possible after assessment of the primary end point. Secondary end points were the Roles and Maudsley score, subjective pain rating, and grip strength after six and twelve weeks and after twelve months. The planned number of 272 patients was included in the study.

Results

The primary end point could be assessed for 90.8% of the patients. The success rate was 25.8% in the group treated with extracorporeal shock wave therapy and 25.4% in the placebo group, a difference of 0.4% with a 95% confidence interval of -10.5% to 11.3%. Similarly, there was no relevant difference between groups with regard to the secondary end points. Improvement was observed in two-thirds of the patients from both groups twelve months after the intervention. Few side effects were reported.

Conclusions

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy as applied in the present study was ineffective in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. The previously reported success of this therapy appears to be attributable to inappropriate study designs. Different application protocols might improve clinical outcome. We recommend that extracorporeal shock wave therapy be applied only in high-quality clinical trials until it is proved to be effective.

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^c41504ba]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

There have been many studies comparing ESWT and different treatment methods in the treatment of LE. In a study in which ESWT and cryoultrasound were compared in a 1-year follow-up, Vulpiani et al obtained results in favor of ESWT at 6 months and at the end of 1 year in terms of VAS scores and patient satisfaction.Lee et al compared the efficacy of ESWT and corticosteroid injection in their study on patients with newly diagnosed LE and medial epicondylitis.They concluded that ESWT was as effective as injections after treatment and during the 8-week follow-up. Ozturan et aldivided 60 patients with a complaint >6 months into three treatment groups and compared the effectiveness of corticosteroid injection, autologous blood, injection, and ESWT. In their study, while evaluating patients with the Thomsen test, upper-extremity function scores and grip strength during a 52-week follow-up were measured and found that the corticosteroid group was superior to the other groups at 4 weeks in terms of VAS and grip strength, but this superiority did not continue in the subsequent follow-ups. It was reported at 52 weeks of follow-up period that the corticosteroid injection had a success rate of 50%, autologous blood injection had a success rate of 83%, and ESWT had a success rate of 89%. Radwan et al stated that ESWT could be an alternative noninvasive treatment method to surgery. They reported that complications of ESWT were minor, it was easy to administer and noninvasive, yielded successful results close to surgery, and had a significant advantage in terms of cost-effectiveness.However, no study was found in the literature comparing ESWT and splint application. In this sense, our study is an important work in this area.

### Clinical effectiveness of shockwave therapy in lateral elbow tendinopathy: systematic review and meta-analysis [^447d4d37]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy compared with other interventions on pain, grip strength and disability in patients with lateral elbow tendinopathy.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library and clinical trial registries.

Review Methods

We included randomized controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy alone or as an additive intervention compared with sham or other interventions. Pain intensity, grip strength and elbow disability were used as primary outcome measures. We assessed methodological quality with the PEDro score and quality of evidence with the GRADE approach.

Results

Twenty-seven studies with 1871 patients were finally included. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduced pain intensity at mid-term follow-up (standardized mean difference: -1.21, 95% confidence interval:-1.53, -0.89, P <0.001) and improved grip strength at very short- (mean difference:3.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.91, 6.94, P =0.01) and short-term follow-up (mean difference:4.87, 95% confidence interval:2.24, 7.50, P <0.001) compared with sham treatment. However, no clinically significant results were found between comparators in all outcomes and follow-up times. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy presented clinically better compared to Laser in grip strength at short-term (mean difference:3.50, 95% confidence interval:2.40, 4.60, P <0.001) and ultrasound in pain intensity at very-short-term follow-up (standardized mean difference: -1.54, 95% confidence interval: -2.60, -0.48, P =0.005).

Conclusion

Low to moderate certainty of evidence suggests that there are no clinical benefits of extracorporeal shockwave therapy compared to sham interventions or corticosteroid injections. Based on very-low and moderate certainty of evidence, extracorporeal shockwave therapy outperforms against Laser and ultrasound, respectively. Level of Evidence: Therapy, level 1a.

### Comparison of two ultrasonographic localization techniques for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis with extracorporeal shock wave therapy: a randomized study [^1a204be1]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe and compare two ultrasonographic localization techniques for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis with extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT).

Design

Forty-one subjects selected through clinical examination were randomly assigned to two groups of treatment.

Interventions

Each subject received a three-session ultrasound-guided ESWT (performed weekly). Lateral tangential focusing was used in group A, whereas back tangential focusing was used for group B.

Main Outcome Measures

Total Elbow Scoring System (TESS) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) were used to evaluate each subject before the treatment and at six months follow-up.

Results

TESS and VAS pretreatment scores were homogeneous between the groups (p > 0.05). In both groups there was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the TESS score and a decrease in the VAS score but there was no resolution of the pain. TESS and VAS follow-up scores were homogeneous between the two groups (p > 0.05).

Conclusions

There was no difference between the two techniques of using ESWT.

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^e0a08922]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Splinting, another conservative treatment method, is one of the most commonly used methods in LE, because it is noninvasive, painless, and easy to apply. Although splints are usually prescribed in LE, their efficacy remains controversial.In the chronic period of LE, most commonly forearm-counterforce braces and wrist-extensor splints (WESs) are used as proprioceptive input.A WES inhibits contraction of extensor muscles and thus muscle expansion in the proximal third of the forearm, decreases the movement of tendinous structures, and thus decreases stress at the common extensor origin.Although clinical examination is easily accepted by patients because of painless and easy diagnosis, conservative treatment is either not completed or delayed by patients, since treatment options take a long time and restrict daily life activities. In this study, we planned to evaluate clinical and demographic characteristics, pain, and quality of life in patients with LE receiving ESWT and WES and compare the data of two groups.

### Is it time to reconsider the indications for surgery in patients with tennis elbow? [^431621b0]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Another important issue is the interpretation of studies dealing with tennis elbow. Observational studies showing high rates of recovery after an intervention are largely redundant as recovery is, most of the time, not explained by the intervention. Furthermore, we should be suspicious when large long-term effects of any intervention are found in a trial, as the known excellent prognosis for patients with this condition does not provide room for large effects. In our review, we identified three control groups which had strikingly poor long-term outcomes for no apparent reason, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. - These studies showed large long-term benefits for the active intervention. However, if we compare the active groups from these studies with the average trajectory across all studies, there would have been no effect at all. The long-term effect may have occurred because of an unexplained poorer prognosis in the no-treatment group (i.e. baseline imbalance), but such large effects are not plausible outside these studies, since most patients recover without treatment. Large effects could be achieved only by identifying a subgroup of patients who do not recover spontaneously and treating them with an effective form of treatment.

### A systematic review of shockwave therapies in soft tissue conditions: focusing on the evidence [^dff51460]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

'Shock wave' therapies are now extensively used in the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries. This systematic review summarises the evidence base for the use of these modalities.

Methods

A thorough search of the literature was performed to identify studies of adequate quality to assess the evidence base for shockwave therapies on pain in specific soft tissue injuries. Both focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy (F-ESWT) and radial pulse therapy (RPT) were examined.

Results

23 appropriate studies were identified. There is evidence for the benefit of F-ESWT and of RPT in a number of soft tissue musculoskeletal conditions, and evidence that both treatment modalities are safe. There is evidence that F-ESWT is effective in the treatment of plantar fasciitis, calcific tendinitis, and that RPT is effective in plantar fasciitis. Where benefit is seen in F-ESWT, it appears to be dose dependent, with greater success seen with higher dose regimes. There is low level evidence for lack of benefit of low-dose F-ESWT and RPT in non-calcific rotator cuff disease and mixed evidence in lateral epicondylitis.

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^dbddb4f2]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Throughout the study period, no unfavorable condition was observed in the ESWT or WES groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics or evaluation parameters before treatment (Table 1). In terms of the occupation of the patients in the ESWT group, two were unemployed, nine were workers, 12 were office employees, two were retired, and seven were housewives. In the WES group, there were three unemployed, 10 workers, 13 office employees, one retired, and eight housewives. There was no significant difference between the two groups according to the occupational distribution of the patients (P >0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of disease duration either (ESWT 27.69±7.92, WES 27.49±8.15; P >0.05; Table 1).

Mean VAS scores for pain at rest and pain while working before treatment in the ESWT group were 4.8±1.4 and 7.2±2.6, respectively, whereas mean VAS scores after treatment were 2.2±1.0 and 3.2±1.7 at 4 weeks (54.17% and 55.6% reduction in pain), 1.9±0.9 and 2.9±1.7 at 12 weeks (60.5% and 59.8% reduction in pain), and 2.4±1.1 and 3.7±1.8 at 24 weeks (50.0% and 48.7% reduction in pain). There were statistically significant increases in grip strength at 4, 12, and 24 weeks after treatment compared to pretreatment values (P <0.001). There were significant increases in PRTEE-T and Nirschl scores, which evaluated function and pain in the affected arm in various daily life activities at 4, 12, and 24 weeks compared to pretreatment values (P <0.001). In addition, there were considerably significant improvements in all subscales of the SF36 (general health, physical functioning, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, and vitality) at 4, 12, and 24 weeks compared to pretreatment values (P <0.001; Table 2).

### Comparing the use of physiotherapy, shockwave therapy, prolotherapy, and platelet-rich plasma for chronic lateral epicondylosis: a prospective, randomized controlled trial with 2-year follow-up [^e3ea26f5]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lateral epicondylosis is a degenerative condition affecting 1% to 3% of adults annually. Concerns over the sustained efficacy of corticosteroids have increased interest in regenerative treatments like platelet-rich plasma (PRP), prolotherapy, and extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), but comparative data remain limited.

Purpose

To evaluate whether PRP, prolotherapy, and ESWT provide superior clinical outcomes at 24 months compared with physiotherapy alone in patients with chronic lateral epicondylosis.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

Adults older than 35 years with lateral elbow pain lasting >6 months, diagnosed via physical examination and ultrasound, and refractory to at least 3 months of nonoperative treatment, were included. Exclusion criteria included recent corticosteroid or botulinum toxin injections and complete extensor tendon rupture. Patients were randomized into 4 treatment groups: physiotherapy, ESWT, prolotherapy, or PRP. The primary outcome was the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, and the secondary outcome was the Subjective Satisfaction Score (SSS). Patients were followed for 2 years to assess the treatment efficacy.

Results

A total of 231 patients were enrolled, with 202 completing the study. Baseline DASH scores were comparable across the groups ( P = .526). At 24 months, PRP significantly reduced DASH scores by 31.18 points compared with physiotherapy (18.70 points) and ESWT (17.62 points) ( P < .01). Prolotherapy (21.02 points) also showed greater improvement than physiotherapy at 18 months (15.61 points) ( P < .01). PRP yielded the highest SSS (4.60 ± 0.9), outperforming physiotherapy (3.00 ± 1.9) and ESWT (3.43 ± 1.7) ( P < .01). Prolotherapy also yielded higher SSS (4.24 ± 1.2) compared with physiotherapy ( P < .01) and ESWT ( P < .01) at 24 months. At 24 months, all groups demonstrated DASH score reductions exceeding the minimal clinically important difference of 10 points, indicating clinically meaningful improvement: PRP (31.18), prolotherapy (20.70), ESWT (17.62), and physiotherapy (18.70).

Conclusion

PRP and prolotherapy yielded better clinical and functional outcomes than ESWT and physiotherapy in chronic lateral epicondylosis over a 2-year follow-up. The findings support the potential of these therapies as effective nonsurgical options for long-standing cases.

### Evidence for the effectiveness of electrophysical modalities for treatment of medial and lateral epicondylitis: a systematic review [^ae3a7ca5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Several treatments are available to treat epicondylitis. Among these are instrumental electrophysical modalities, ranging from ultrasound, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to laser therapy, commonly used to treat epicondylitis.

Objectives

To present an evidence-based overview of the effectiveness of electrophysical modality treatments for both medial and lateral epicondylitis (LE).

Methods

Searches in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Pedro were performed to identify relevant randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality. A best-evidence synthesis was used to summarise the results.

Results

A total of 2 reviews and 20 RCTs were included, all of which concerned LE. Different electrophysical regimes were evaluated: ultrasound, laser, electrotherapy, ESWT, TENS and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy. Moderate evidence was found for the effectiveness of ultrasound versus placebo on mid-term follow-up. Ultrasound plus friction massage showed moderate evidence of effectiveness versus laser therapy on short-term follow-up. On the contrary, moderate evidence was found in favour of laser therapy over plyometric exercises on short-term follow-up. For all other modalities only limited/conflicting evidence for effectiveness or evidence of no difference in effect was found.

Conclusions

Potential effectiveness of ultrasound and laser for the management of LE was found. To draw more definite conclusions high-quality RCTs examining different intensities are needed as well as studies focusing on long-term follow-up results.

### Recommendations for use of extracorporeal shockwave therapy in sports medicine: an international modified Delphi study [^96ae5eeb]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

While extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) may be an efficacious adjunctive treatment option for musculoskeletal injuries, current research is limited by significant heterogeneity within treatment protocols. This study aims to establish international expert consensus recommendations on ESWT terminology, parameters, procedural considerations, contraindications and side effects in the application of ESWT to sports injuries.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed on the use of ESWT for musculoskeletal and sports medicine injuries to identify potential panellists, followed by the development of a steering committee-led questionnaire. A three-stage, modified Delphi questionnaire was provided to a panel of 41 international clinical and research experts across 13 countries. Panellists had the opportunity to suggest edits to existing statements or recommend additional statements in Round 1. Consensus was defined as≥75% agreement.

Results

All 41 panellists completed Rounds 1, 2 and 3. Consensus was reached on 69/118 statements (58.5%), including recommendations on terminology and fundamental concepts, indications for use, procedural aspects for tendinopathy and bone pathologies, treatment correlations with imaging, periprocedural and postprocedural considerations, absolute and relative contraindications and potential side effects. Of the 49 statements that did not reach consensus, 17/49 (34.7%) were related to procedural aspects of bone pathology.

Conclusion

This international panel presents recommendations on ESWT terminology, indications and treatment considerations to guide ESWT use and decision-making by sports medicine clinicians. While our panel supported the use of ESWT in the treatment of bone pathologies, certain procedural aspects of ESWT specific to these injuries did not reach consensus and require further investigation.

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^c80063ca]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

When comparisons of ESWT with other physical therapy modalities were examined, ESWT was reported to be as effective as and even more effective than cryoultrasound, corticosteroid injection, autologous blood injection, massage, and laser applications, and that it could be an alternative to surgery. In our study, we also found that ESWT is as effective as WES.

Splinting is one of the conservative methods commonly used in the treatment of LE. The most commonly used orthoses are forearm-counterforce braces, resting hand–wrist splints, and WESs, which allow the muscle to rest in the acute phase and provide proprioceptive input in the chronic phase.Splints can make daily life activities easier, decrease pain, and increase grip strength, and they are affordable. However, there have been no definite conclusions reported on the effectiveness of orthoses in the treatment of LE, because of variability in control groups, outcome measures, type of splint used, duration of complaints, prognostic factors, and low number of patients.In a study conducted by Altan et al,a reduction in pain was detected with the use of an LE band and a wrist-resting splint, which held the wrist slightly dorsiflexed, in patients with LE <3 months. However, there was no significant difference between the two splints in terms of effectiveness in the long term. Similarly to Altan et al, we also used a splint in our study, which held the wrist in extension (dorsiflexion). We achieved significant pain relief and improvement in grip strength and quality of life. In general terms, although there have been studies reporting that splinting in LE was effective in decreasing pain and improving grip strength,,–in a retrospective cohort study conducted by Derebery et al,it was reported that patients with LE who were followed with splinting had higher revisit rates and longer treatment duration compared with patients who were treated without splinting. It was stated that early mobilization might be more effective than resting and immobilization provided by bandage might delay healing. In a systematic review of studies that compared splinting with conservative therapies, no difference was found between splinting, physiotherapy, or topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, whereas in one study corticosteroid injection was found to be superior in the early period.In our study, we found that WES was as effective as ESWT in decreasing pain, increasing grip strength, and improving quality of life.

### Effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the treatment of previously untreated lateral epicondylitis: a randomized controlled trial [^ebc6e341]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is a relatively new therapy used in the treatment of chronic tendon-related pain. Few randomized controlled trials have been performed on it, and no studies have examined the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy as a frontline therapy for tendon-related pain.

Hypothesis

Subjects treated with active extracorporeal shock wave therapy will have higher rates of treatment success than subjects treated with sham extracorporeal shock wave therapy.

Design

Double-blind randomized controlled trial.

Methods

Sixty subjects who had previously untreated lateral epicondylitis for less than 1 year and more than 3 weeks were included in this study. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive 1 session per week for 3 weeks of either sham or active extra-corporeal shock wave therapy. Subjects in the active therapy group received 2000 pulses (energy flux density, 0.03-0.17 mJ/mm(2)). All subjects were provided with a forearm-stretching program. After 8 weeks of therapy, subjects were classified as either treatment successes or treatment failures according to fulfillment of all 3 criteria: (1) at least a 50% reduction in the overall pain visual analog scale score, (2) a maximum allowable overall pain visual analog scale score of 4.0 cm, and (3) no use of pain medication for elbow pain for 2 weeks before the 8 week follow-up. Visual analog scale scores were also collected for pain at rest, during sleep, during activity, at its worst, and at its least, as well as for quality of life (using the EuroQoL questionnaire) and grip strength.

Results

Success rates in the sham and active therapy groups were 31% and 39%, respectively. No significant difference was detected between groups (chi(2)(1)= 0.3880, P = .533). Mean change in quality of life over 8 weeks was an increase of 1.3 and 3.3 for sham and active therapy groups, respectively, and mean change in grip strength over 8 weeks was an increase of 7.4 kg and 6.8 kg for sham and active therapy groups, respectively.

Conclusions

Despite improvement in pain scores and pain-free maximum grip strength within groups, there does not appear to be a meaningful difference between treating lateral epicondylitis with extracorporeal shock wave therapy combined with forearm-stretching program and treating with forearm-stretching program alone, with respect to resolving pain within an 8-week period of commencing treatment.

### ESWT for tendinopathy: technology and clinical implications [^9c13ac63]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The general consensus that tendinopathy, at least in the chronic stage, is mainly a degenerative condition and inflammation plays a minor role has led to a shift from treatments that target inflammation towards treatment options that promote regeneration. One of these treatments is extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), a physical therapy modality that uses pressure waves to treat tendinopathy. This review was undertaken to give an overview of the literature concerning this treatment, and special attention is given to the differences between focused and radial ESWT.

Methods

A narrative description of wave characteristics, generation methods and in vitro effects of ESWT is given. The literature on ESWT as a treatment for one common tendinopathy, patellar tendinopathy, was systematically reviewed.

Results

Waves that are generated for focused and radial ESWT have very different physical characteristics. It is unclear how these characteristics are related to clinical effectiveness. Studies into the biological effects of ESWT have mainly used focused shockwave therapy, showing a number of effects of shockwaves on biological tissue. The systematic review of studies into the clinical effects of ESWT for patellar tendinopathy showed conflicting evidence for its effectiveness.

Conclusion

Physical characteristics of focused and radial waves differ substantially, but effect on clinical effectiveness is unclear. Whereas in vitro studies often show the effects of ESWT on tendon tissue, results of clinical studies are inconsistent. Based on the review of the literature, suggestions are given for the use of ESWT in clinical practice regarding timing and treatment parameters.

### Autologous blood and platelet-rich plasma injection therapy for lateral elbow pain [^f0034dfe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Autologous whole blood or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections are commonly used to treat lateral elbow pain (also known as tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis or epicondylalgia). Based on animal models and observational studies, these injections may modulate tendon injury healing, but randomised controlled trials have reported inconsistent results regarding benefit for people with lateral elbow pain.

Objectives

To review current evidence on the benefit and safety of autologous whole blood or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection for treatment of people with lateral elbow pain.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for published trials, and Clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal for ongoing trials, on 18 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing autologous whole blood or PRP injection therapy to another therapy (placebo or active treatment, including non-pharmacological therapies, and comparison between PRP and autologous blood) for lateral elbow pain. The primary comparison was PRP versus placebo. Major outcomes were pain relief (≥ 30% or ≥ 50%), mean pain, mean function, treatment success, quality of life, withdrawal due to adverse events, and adverse events; the primary time point was three months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 32 studies with 2337 participants; 56% of participants were female, mean age varied between 36 and 53 years, and mean duration of symptoms ranged from 1 to 22 months. Seven trials had three intervention arms. Ten trials compared autologous blood or PRP injection to placebo injection (primary comparison). Fifteen trials compared autologous blood or PRP injection to glucocorticoid injection. Four studies compared autologous blood to PRP. Two trials compared autologous blood or PRP injection plus tennis elbow strap and exercise versus tennis elbow strap and exercise alone. Two trials compared PRP injection to surgery, and one trial compared PRP injection and dry needling to dry needling alone. Other comparisons include autologous blood versus extracorporeal shock wave therapy; PRP versus arthroscopic surgery; PRP versus laser; and autologous blood versus polidocanol. Most studies were at risk of selection, performance, and detection biases, mainly due to inadequate allocation concealment and lack of participant blinding. We found moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) to show that autologous blood or PRP injection probably does not provide clinically significant improvement in pain or function compared with placebo injection at three months. Further, low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) suggests that PRP may not increase risk for adverse events. We are uncertain whether autologous blood or PRP injection improves treatment success (downgraded for bias, imprecision, and indirectness) or withdrawals due to adverse events (downgraded for bias and twice for imprecision). No studies measured health-related quality of life, and no studies reported pain relief (> 30% or 50%) at three months. At three months, mean pain was 3.7 points (0 to 10; 0 is best) with placebo and 0.16 points better (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 better to 0.29 worse; 8 studies, 523 participants) with autologous blood or PRP injection, for absolute improvement of 1.6% better (6% better to 3% worse). At three months, mean function was 27.5 points (0 to 100; 0 is best) with placebo and 1.86 points better (95% CI 4.9 better to 1.25 worse; 8 studies, 502 participants) with autologous blood or PRP injection, for absolute benefit of 1.9% (5% better to 1% worse), and treatment success was 121 out of 185 (65%) with placebo versus 125 out of 187 (67%) with autologous blood or PRP injection (risk ratio (RR) 1.00; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19; 4 studies, 372 participants), for absolute improvement of 0% (11.1% lower to 12.4% higher). Regarding harm, we found very low-certainty evidence to suggest that we are uncertain whether withdrawal rates due to adverse events differed. Low-certainty evidence suggests that autologous blood or PRP injection may not increase adverse events compared with placebo injection. Withdrawal due to adverse events occurred in 3 out of 39 (8%) participants treated with placebo versus 1 out of 41 (2%) treated with autologous blood or PRP injection (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.92; 1 study), for an absolute difference of 5.2% fewer (7.5% fewer to 14.8% more). Adverse event rates were 35 out of 208 (17%) with placebo versus 41 out of 217 (19%) with autologous blood or PRP injection (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72; 5 studies; 425 participants), for an absolute difference of 2.4% more (4% fewer to 12% more). At six and twelve months, no clinically important benefit for mean pain or function was observed with autologous blood or PRP injection compared with placebo injection.

Authors' Conclusions

Data in this review do not support the use of autologous blood or PRP injection for treatment of lateral elbow pain. These injections probably provide little or no clinically important benefit for pain or function (moderate-certainty evidence), and it is uncertain (very low-certainty evidence) whether they improve treatment success and pain relief > 50%, or increase withdrawal due to adverse events. Although risk for harm may not be increased compared with placebo injection (low-certainty evidence), injection therapies cause pain and carry a small risk of infection. With no evidence of benefit, the costs and risks are not justified.

### Platelet-rich plasma injection for tennis elbow: did it ever work? [^10ea8e08]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Clinical science: what went wrong?

Many factors have contributed to the widespread adoption of PRP into clinical practice in the absence of rigorous evidence support its use. Since PRP is not considered a medication or medical device, the robust oversight, clinical trial and approval processes, normally required for the adoption of a new treatment/device into clinical practice, were not followed. Consequently, several early phases of the development pathway were bypassed. For example, the optimal doses of the different cytokines, immune cells and proteins being delivered in PRP or how frequently they should be administered is still unclear.Clinical trials have therefore been limited by the variability of PRP preparations and delivery protocols used, limiting the generalisability of results.

First signs of possible benefits of PRP in the treatment of tennis elbow were published in 2006.A non-randomised comparative study including 20 participants found that by 2 months, there was a 60% reduction in pain in the active group (n=15), increasing to 93% by final follow-up at 25 months. This compared with only 16% reduction in the control group (n=5) by 2 months and most of the control subjects left the study to seek active treatment. This may seem impressive, but regression to the mean and natural course could explain most of the improvement in the active group. Furthermore, non-randomised studies are known to overestimate the benefits of experimental interventions.

Instead of widespread clinical use, we should have conducted rigorous efficacy trials. However, only two of the following 18 randomised trials published during the next decade compared PRP with placebo. The remarkable effect in the first non-randomised study was elusive when tested in a blinded trial: Krogh et al found no difference between saline and PRP, and Mishra et al found a significant difference only in a dichotomised pain outcome in a subset of participants at post hoc time point.

Trials using various active controls (corticosteroid injection, shock wave therapy, laser, polidocanol injection, surgery) did not improve our understanding of the effects of PRP since the effect of comparators is unclear. Nevertheless, comparisons against corticosteroid injection and the pioneer studiesconvinced many, while some authors remained sceptical—and with hindsight, rightfully so.

### Percutaneous tendon dry needling and thrust manipulation as an adjunct to multimodal physical therapy in patients with lateral elbow tendinopathy: a multicenter randomized clinical trial [^87963d4b]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lateral elbow tendinopathy, also referred to as lateral epicondylalgia, lateral epicondylitis, and tennis elbow, is a common presentation of pain and resultant disability in the elbow. The overall incidence of lateral elbow tendinopathy is approximately 3%, and as high as 10% in those between 40 and 50 years of age in the United States.Originally thought to be an inflammatory process of the common extensor tendon at the lateral epicondyle, lateral elbow tendinopathy has recently been identified as a pathology of the tendon at or close to its enthesis. Repeated mechanical loading in this area results in histological changes within the tendon.– Importantly, other structures including the radial collateral ligament, annular ligament, radiocapitellar joint, radial nerve, and cervical spine should be included in the differential diagnosis.

Nonoperative management of lateral elbow tendinopathy includes physical therapy, injection (corticosteroid, platelet rich plasma, botulinum toxin), – extracorporeal shockwave therapy, and high-power laser therapy.Multimodal physical therapy treatment programs including local manual therapy and exercise, have shown beneficial effects in reducing pain and disability, and are supported in recent clinical practice guidelines.Multimodal physical therapy seems to have similar benefits to corticosteroid injections in the short term (4–6 weeks),, superior short-term success rates compared to wait and see,and a much lower recurrence rate (5%) compared to corticosteroid injection (55%) at 1-year follow up.Unfortunately, this type of multimodal approach seems to result in similar outcomes as wait and see intervention or corticosteroid injection/placebo injection at 1-year follow up.

### Effect of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy in combination with autologous platelet-rich plasma in the treatment of elbow tendinopathy [^c6eac8ac]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Background

Tendinopathy is a condition seen in both the athletic and general population and is commonly associated with significant pain and debility.Management options for tendinopathy include use of simple analgesics, oral anti-inflammatories, physiotherapy, corticosteroids and more recent interventions such as extracorporeal shockwave therapy and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection to the affected site. These interventions have varying levels of evidence and success with lack of evidence of structural healing. Additionally, the use of corticosteroids has been questioned due to worse long-term outcomes in comparison to placebo injections.Recalcitrant cases of tendinopathy may require surgical intervention, which has a variable outcome and is complicated by a prolonged recovery and return to pre-injury activity.

Common extensor origin (CEO) tendinopathy was first described by Runge in 1873 and is commonly termed ‘tennis elbow’.CEO tendinopathy is the most commonly diagnosed musculoskeletal injury of the elbow and affects 1%–3% of the population each year.Up to 40% of tennis players will report symptoms of CEO tendinopathy.

Causality of CEO tendinopathy is known to involve a number of factors, including overuse, strength deficits and training errors, resulting in observed tendon degenerative change within the extensor carpi radialis brevis and extensor digitorum communis at the lateral epicondyle.Current understandings of the process of tendinopathy suggests a model of degeneration and failed healing.While originally called tendinitis, this name fell out of favour due to lack of inflammatory cell infiltrate within the tendon and yet more recent identification of inflammatory cytokines within and around areas of tendon degeneration has seen ‘itis’ re-emerge within the descriptive vernacular.

The ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to differentiate along a mesodermal cell lineage—including tenocytes—has seen them explored as a reparative therapy in musculoskeletal conditions. It is, however, now better understood that their mechanism of action is likely due to paracrine mechanisms through expression of cytokines and secretomes/exosomes, which directly influences the local micro-environment by modulation of the local immune response and also stimulating repair.

### Comparing the effectiveness of radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy (rESWT) and three conventional treatment approaches for biceps brachii muscle in exercise-induced delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS): a protocol for a randomised clinical trial [^329a0c64]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Study procedure

After the trial registration, the researcher will start communicating with the students of JUST and estimate the population who agreed to participate in the trial voluntarily. Then, a specialised exercise programme will be held to induce the DOMS. After more than 12 hours of the exercise programme, the participants who feel pain in their non-dominant elbow flexor muscle will account for the study population. Then, in a computer-based random serial, the first 120 people will be pooled for enrolment in three study groups. On the first day, an assessor blinded to group allocation will take the pretest assessment. Then, the participant will be treated in three treatment approaches, and each group will receive either (1) rESWT with cryotherapy, (2) MFR with cryotherapy or (3) stretching with cryotherapy. Every treatment will be provided immediately, 24 and 48 hours after DOMS induction. Then, measurements will be taken before DOMS induction and before and after every treatment session, and the final post-test will be measured after 72 hours. So, the measurements are pretest, then post-test-1 immediately after treatment, after 24 hours post-test-2, 48 post-test-3 and 72 hours post-test-4. Participants will be instructed not to exercise during this time. The primary outcome measurement will be pain intensity at rest and movement, which will be assessed by a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and pressure pain threshold (PPT) over the biceps muscle belly by pressure algometry and measure ROM inclinometer (active force-2). There will be a separate assessor for each of the treatment set-ups. Patients who do not take treatment after one or two sessions will be considered drop-outs. For this potential, researchers will follow Standard Protocol Items: Interventional Trials 2013 (SPIRIT) guidelines to maintain the quality of the interventional trial (table 1).

### ESWT for tendinopathy: technology and clinical implications [^aeddc655]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tendon injuries (tendinopathies) are common in the entire population, especially in relation to sports and occupation. Tendinopathy has a complex pathophysiology. It consists of a short acute inflammatory stage but after some time, it gradually becomes a degenerative condition.

Because both conservative and surgical management of tendinopathy is not always successful, new treatment modalities have been developed. One of these modalities is extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT). In 2002, Chung and Wiley published a review about ESWT for treating tendinopathies. At that time, they concluded based on the literature that there was strong evidence for the effectiveness of ESWT for chronic tendinopathy and that further research was required to settle debates concerning applied energy, number of pulses and number of treatment sessions.

Over the last decade, next to increased knowledge about the pathogenesis of tendinopathy, there have been technical developments and an accumulation of studies examining the working mechanisms of ESWT and its effectiveness. One of the main technical developments is that nowadays two different kinds of ESWT are used for treating tendinopathy: focused ESWT (FSWT) and radial ESWT (RSWT). RSWT is relatively new and has made ESWT more affordable and more widely available. These new technologies are the rationale for this review. Most research has been done using FSWT, but research on RSWT is starting to be published. The aim of the present review is to give an up-to-date description of ESWT, with a special focus on differences between FSWT and RSWT, and review the literature about this treatment method. The overview consists of a description of wave characteristics, methods to generate shockwaves, and in vitro and clinical effects of ESWT, the latter by performing a systematic review with methodological quality assessment on the effects of ESWT for patellar tendinopathy, as an example of a common tendinopathy.

BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The strength of this study is its baseline data where the populations are young adults, and they attend the study voluntarily. The main thing is that the sample will be selected by voluntarily participating in an exercise-induced DOMS programme where DOMS will induce a specific muscle by a specific exercise, which can help maintain the baseline injury severity and help to determine rigorous evidence. The use of objective outcome measurement scales helps to study more robustly. The limitation of the study is that it only evaluates the effectiveness of rESWT on DOMS. Still, it would be better if rESWT were compared with fESWT. This study has some challenges; at first, the study population has to participate voluntarily. It will be difficult to collect samples by minimising any adverse effects. There might be some ethical issues regarding participant health in this procedure. However, to overcome this conflict, the author set specific inclusion criteria, and a person who wants to participate voluntarily will be the sample.

Trial status

The trial is not recruiting participants yet.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^de144460]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

Spasticity management—extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT): At the mid-term network meta-analysis (NMA), botulinum toxin (WMD: -0.44; 95% CI: -0.62—-0.26), fESWT (WMD: -0.74; 95% CI: -1.26—-0.23), and rESWT (WMD: -0.79; 95% CI: -1.07—-0.51) were statistically superior in reducing spasticity compared with control; however, the Work Group felt that although these results were statistically significant, they were not clinically significant, interpretation has limitations because of variations in ESWT dosing and the timing of therapy following stroke was varied, and the included studies did not specifically report rates of severe adverse effects though side effects might include transient skin petechiae or localized pain; some variation occurs in patient preferences, ESWT might be a reasonable non-pharmacologic option as part of an individualized care plan, and the intervention requires the acquisition of the machine and in-person treatments by a trained provider, thereby limiting access for some clinics and patients; the evidence was categorized as Reviewed, New-added and the Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was low, leading to the recommendation: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against extracorporeal shock wave therapy for spasticity management.

### Extracorporeal shockwave therapy for patellar tendinopathy: a review of the literature [^70701eba]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (EWST) has become a popular treatment for patellar tendinopathy. The purpose of this review was to study the effectiveness of ESWT treatment for patellar tendinopathy; to draft guidelines for an effective treatment protocol of ESWT treatment; and to identify topics for further research.

Methods

A computerised search of the Medline and Embase databases was conducted on 1 August 2007, to identify studies dealing with the effectiveness of ESWT for patellar tendinopathy.

Results

Seven articles describing the effectiveness of ESWT on patellar tendinopathy, all published after 2000, were included. These studies included a total of 283 patients (298 tendons), 204 of whom (215 tendons) were assigned to ESWT treatment. The treatment results were positive but most studies had methodological deficiencies, small numbers and/or short follow-up periods. Method of application and shockwave generation, energy level, number and frequency of treatments, use of (local) anaesthesia and method of localisation were variable.

Conclusion

ESWT seems to be a safe and promising treatment for patellar tendinopathy with a positive effect on pain and function. Based on current knowledge it is impossible to recommend a specific treatment protocol. Further basic and clinical research into the working mechanism and effectiveness of ESWT for patellar tendinopathy are necessary.

### Non-surgical treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^3fa53cef]. Hand (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Non-surgical approaches to treatment of lateral epicondylitis are numerous. The aim of this systematic review is to examine randomized, controlled trials of these treatments.

Methods

Numerous databases were systematically searched from earliest records to February 2013. Search terms included "lateral epicondylitis," "lateral elbow pain," "tennis elbow," "lateral epicondylalgia," and "elbow tendinopathy" combined with "randomized controlled trial." Two reviewers examined the literature for eligibility via article abstract and full text.

Results

Fifty-eight articles met eligibility criteria: (1) a target population of patients with symptoms of lateral epicondylitis; (2) evaluation of treatment of lateral epicondylitis with the following non-surgical techniques: corticosteroid injection, injection technique, iontophoresis, botulinum toxin A injection, prolotherapy, platelet-rich plasma or autologous blood injection, bracing, physical therapy, shockwave therapy, or laser therapy; and (3) a randomized controlled trial design. Lateral epicondylitis is a condition that is usually self-limited. There may be a short-term pain relief advantage found with the application of corticosteroids, but no demonstrable long-term pain relief. Injection of botulinum toxin A and prolotherapy are superior to placebo but not to corticosteroids, and botulinum toxin A is likely to produce concomitant extensor weakness. Platelet-rich plasma or autologous blood injections have been found to be both more and less effective than corticosteroid injections. Non-invasive treatment methods such as bracing, physical therapy, and extracorporeal shockwave therapy do not appear to provide definitive benefit regarding pain relief. Some studies of low-level laser therapy show superiority to placebo whereas others do not.

Conclusions

There are multiple randomized controlled trials for non-surgical management of lateral epicondylitis, but the existing literature does not provide conclusive evidence that there is one preferred method of non-surgical treatment for this condition. Lateral epicondylitis is a condition that is usually self-limited, resolving over a 12- to 18-month period without treatment.

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^a2d9d6f3]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Measurement parameters

Patients were evaluated for grip strength, pain at rest, pain while working, and quality of life. The same physiotherapist was blind to the randomization. Evaluation data were collected before and after treatment at weeks 4, 12, and 24. A 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate pain at rest and while working (0 indicated no pain and 10 the worst pain). A Jamar hand dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument, Lafayette, IN, USA) was used to evaluate handgrip strength. The Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer has the ability to measure grip strength via an analogue display in two separate units (pounds and kilograms) up to 200 lb or 90 kg. Five different positions can be set for people with different hand sizes. Three measurements were performed while the elbow was at 90° flexion and the wrist in neutral position, and the average was recorded.

FSWT versus RSWT

There are two important differences in wave characteristics between focused shockwaves and radial shockwaves. First, radial shockwaves have a more superficial effect, compared to focused shockwaves, which reach a maximal energy in the focus that is located deeper into the body tissues (Fig. 2). It was shown that a RSWT device generates a pressure field extending to 40 mm in water, whereas the pressure field generated during FSWT may reach a distance that is about twice as high. How these measures relate to biological tissue is not known. These measures are also dependent of the device that is used and the energy setting. In general, focused shockwaves will travel further and have more impact on deeper located tissues.

Second, research has shown that pressure waves generated by RSWT from a fundamental point of view cannot be called shockwaves because they lack the characteristic physical features of shockwaves (Fig. 3) such as a short rise time, a high peak pressure and non-linearity. A reason for this is that the speed of sound in tissue is around 1,500 m/s, whereas the projectile during radial pressure wave generation can only reach a speed of around 20 m/s. This speed is not high enough to generate a real shockwave. Chitniss and Cleveland found that the rise time (tr) of the generated wave was 25–40 ns for two focused devices (EH), whereas it was 600 ns for a radial shockwave device. Although 25–40 ns is longer than the definition given above of a shockwave, the waves generated with the EH devices showed the features that are typical for a shockwave (Fig. 1), whereas the wave generated with the radial device lacked these characteristics. Based on these findings, it may be more correct to use the term radial pressure wave therapy instead of RSWT. Radial pressure wave devices also come with ‘focused’ applicators. However, Cleveland et al. showed that these applicators do not generate real shockwaves either.

Fig. 3 
Differences in pressure–time profile of a shockwave (generated with a focused shockwave device) and a pressure wave (generated with a radial shockwave device) (reprinted from)

Because it is not clear which wave characteristics generate therapeutic effects, it is difficult to relate physical differences between focused shockwaves and radial pressure waves to clinical effectiveness.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the treatment of chronic tendinopathies [^e72d108f]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Many clinical trials have evaluated the use of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for treating patients with chronic tendinosis of the supraspinatus, lateral epicondylitis, and plantar fasciitis. Although extracorporeal shock wave therapy has been reported to be effective in some trials, in others it was no more effective than placebo. The multiple variables associated with this therapy, such as the amount of energy delivered, the method of focusing the shock waves, frequency and timing of delivery, and whether or not anesthetics are used, makes comparing clinical trials difficult. Calcific tendinosis of the supraspinatus and plantar fasciitis have been successfully managed with extracorporeal shock wave therapy when nonsurgical management has failed. Results have been mixed in the management of lateral epicondylitis, however, and this therapy has not been effective in managing noncalcific tendinosis of the supraspinatus. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy has consistently been more effective with patient feedback, which enables directing the shock waves to the most painful area (clinical focusing), rather than with anatomic or image-guided focusing, which are used to direct the shock wave to an anatomic landmark or structure.

BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Eligibility criteria

The inclusion criteria of this study will be (1) people between 18 years and 30 years of age, (2) people who will participate voluntarily in the trial and (3) healthy and physically fit males and females having DOMS within 24 hours. The exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) pregnancy, musculoskeletal disease, systemic neurological disease, cancer, mental illness, drug addiction, allergy to the shockwave gel, cardiac illness, vascular disease of the limb or the central nervous system, regional scars, loss of sensation, history of surgery, fracture and infections. (2) People who have recently taken analgesics or NSAIDs. (3) History of DOMS within the last week.

Induction of delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS)

At baseline, DOMS of the non-dominant elbow flexors will be experimentally induced using a standardised exercise protocol. The non-dominant biceps brachialis muscle will be selected to provoke DOMS (when an unaccustomed exercise is introduced). Every participant will sit at a bench and perform isolated biceps curls with a dumbbell. At first, every individual repetition maximum (1RM, ie, the maximum weight lifted with one concentric contraction) will be determined for the elbow flexors by loading the dumbbell with free weights in 0.5 kg increments. Participants were encouraged verbally to exert their maximal effort. The 1RM will then be used to induce DOMS through eccentric contractions. For this, the experimenter lifted the dumbbell until the participant’s elbow was fully flexed, and the subject lowered the weight eccentrically as slowly as possible until the elbow was fully extended. This procedure will continue until the participant’s subjective exhaustion.

In the treatment procedure, all patients will be lying in a supine position, elbow and shoulder, respectively, flexed at 90 0 and abducted at 45 0 with the forearm leaned on a plan, and shockwave applicators will be positioned perpendicular to the site of the biceps muscle belly and myotendinous junction. The aqua sonic gel will be used at the application site to make better contact with the skin and shockwave projectile head. Patients will receive one treatment session within 12 hours after the pretest.The cryotherapy will be implemented alongside rESWT. This group will use an ice pack for 15 min in the muscle tender site of the biceps muscle.

Group 2: myofascial release (MFR) with cryotherapy

The myofascial release technique will be held in the bicep’s brachialis muscle, where the average time to resolve densification is 5 min one repetition.During the MFR procedure, the therapist will locate the trigger or tender points in the bicep’s brachialis muscle. Then, he gently applies pressure for 30–45 s and continues for 3–4 min. The cryotherapy will be implemented alongside MFR. This group will use an ice pack for 15 min in the muscle tender site of the biceps muscle.

Group 3: stretching exercise with cryotherapy

Stretching of the biceps muscle will be held by the therapist passively. The therapist will position the participants in sitting and then pull the muscle for three sets of 17 stretching with a 10 s hold.Cryotherapy will be implemented alongside stretching. This group will use an ice pack for 15 min in the muscle tender site of the biceps muscle.

### Is it time to reconsider the indications for surgery in patients with tennis elbow? [^3bdcaf8f]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The direct and indirect costs related to the treatment of tennis elbow are considerable. Registry studies have shown an annual incidence of 30 to 45/10,000 people in the USA, suggesting a high use of primary healthcare resources. Of these patients, an estimated one in 50 eventually undergo surgery, and up to one in ten of those with symptoms for > six months have surgery,despite the lack of evidence that this provides benefit. - According to an insurance database study, the costs of surgery doubled between 2007 and 2014.Tennis elbow is also associated with high indirect costs (e.g. lower productivity or absence from work), particularly for blue collar workers.

In order to study the clinical course of tennis elbow, we pooled data from patients in the control arms of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying the effects of various forms of treatment.Our data suggest that the symptoms of tennis elbow have a half-life of between three and four months. At every three- to four-month interval, half of the patients in the control arms (those not receiving active treatment) reported that their symptoms were either much better or had resolved completely. This rate seemed constant, with only 10% of patients reporting no recovery after one year despite most having symptoms for many months before joining the trial. The mean pain and disability (on a group level) followed a similar half-life trajectory. The mean pain and disability halved every four months, approaching between 15% and 20% of the baseline values at the end of the first year.

### Persistent tennis elbow symptoms have little prognostic value: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^47de1d20]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tennis elbow is a common painful enthesopathy of the lateral elbow that limits upper limb function and frequently results in lost time at work. Surgeons often recommend surgery if symptoms persist despite nonsurgical management, but operations for tennis elbow are inconsistent in their efficacy, and what we know about those operations often derives from observational studies that assume the condition does not continue to improve over time. This assumption is largely untested, and it may not be true; meta-analyzing results from the control arms of tennis elbow studies can help us to evaluate this premise, but to our knowledge, this has not been done.

Questions/Purposes

The aims of this systematic review were to describe the course of (1) global improvement, (2) pain, and (3) disability in participants who received no active treatment (placebo or no treatment) in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on tennis elbow. We also assessed (4) whether the duration of symptoms or placebo effect is associated with differences in symptom trajectories.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL from database inception to August 12, 2019, for trials including participants with tennis elbow and a placebo or a no-treatment arm and a minimum follow-up duration of 6 months. There were no language restrictions or exclusion criteria. We extracted global improvement, pain, and disability outcomes. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess the risk of bias of included trials. To estimate the typical course of tennis elbow without active treatment, we pooled global improvement (the proportion of participants who reported feeling much better or completely recovered), mean pain, and mean disability using baseline, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up data. We transformed pain and disability data from the original papers so that at each timepoint the relevant outcome was expressed as change relative to baseline to account for different baseline values. We used meta-regression to assess whether the placebo effect or duration of symptoms before enrollment was associated with differences in symptom trajectories. We included 24 trials with 1085 participants who received no active treatment.

Results

The number of patients who were not improved decreased exponentially over time. The half-life of global improvement was between 2.5 and 3 months (that is, every 2.5 to 3 months, 50% of the remaining symptomatic patients reported complete recovery or greatly improved symptoms). At 1 year, 89% (189 of 213; 95% CI 80% to 97%) of patients experienced global improvement. The mean pain and disability followed a similar pattern, halving every 3 to 4 months. Eighty-eight percent of pain (95% CI 70% to 100%) and 85% of disability (95% CI 60% to 100%) had resolved by 1 year. The mean duration of symptoms before trial enrollment was not associated with differences in symptom trajectories. The trajectories of the no-treatment and placebo arms were similar, indicating that the placebo effect of the studied active treatments likely is negligible.

Conclusion

Based on the placebo or no-treatment control arms of randomized trials, about 90% of people with untreated tennis elbow achieve symptom resolution at 1 year. The probability of resolution appears to remain constant throughout the first year of follow-up and does not depend on previous symptom duration, undermining the rationale that surgery is appropriate if symptoms persist beyond a certain point of time. We recommend that clinicians inform people who are frustrated with persisting symptoms that this is not a cause for apprehension, given that spontaneous improvement is about as likely during the subsequent few months as it was early after the symptoms first appeared. Because of the high likelihood of spontaneous recovery, any active intervention needs to be justified by high levels of early efficacy and little or no risk to outperform watchful waiting.

Stroke rehabilitation—extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for spasticity: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against extracorporeal shock wave therapy for spasticity management (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). Low-quality evidence from an SR of 13 RCTs reported MAS improvements versus sham ESWT or conventional physiotherapy at short-term (1–2 weeks after treatment), mid-term (>3 and <4 weeks after treatment), and long-term (up to 12 weeks after treatment), but effects were interpreted by the Work Group as not clinically significant; the included studies evaluated patients (n=677), with MAS analyses including 11 short-term (n=533), 9 mid-term (n=421), and 4 long-term (n=285). An NMA of 33 RCTs (n=1,930) found in short-term analyses that botulinum toxin, fESWT, and rESWT significantly reduced spasticity and were more effective than control, while in mid-term analyses there were no significant differences; overall, the evidence available is limited in determining clinical significance, and the SR authors did not review the reported complications of the RCTs’ interventions.

### Is ultrasound-guided lavage an effective intervention for rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy? A systematic review with a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^f48dbeeb]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

While our conclusions, based on low-quality evidence, state that US-guided lavage is to be preferred over shockwave therapy, previous meta-analyses for shockwave therapy conclude that it is superior to a placebo to improve function and to decrease the calcification size in individuals with chronic RC calcific tendinopathy.Then, it may still be clinically relevant to offer to patients a less invasive intervention such as shockwave therapy. Therefore, it is recommended to consider shockwave therapy and US-guided lavage when the initial conservative treatment fails, while arthroscopic surgery should only be considered as a last option.

Based on one low risk of bias RCT,the addition of US-guided lavage to a corticosteroid injection appears to be more beneficial to improve function. The magnitude of the difference could be considered clinically important. Yet the measured effect was not consistently observed for all functional outcome measures and therefore more methodologically sound trials are warranted to formally conclude regarding US-guided lavage efficacy.

In regard to pain outcome, our results strengthen the conclusions of the reviews of Arirachakaran et al and Wu et al.However, our results related to function contrast with those from Arirachakaran et al.It is important to highlight that Arirachakaran et al performed a network meta-analysis including only one RCT on US-guided lavage.They performed a direct comparison between US-guided lavage and a corticosteroid injection and indirect comparisons with a placebo and to US-guided needling fragmentation with shockwave which needs to be interpreted cautiously.We also excluded two RCTs which had been previously included in other systematic review because the intervention consisted of US-guided needling fragmentation and not US-guided lavage.In the RCT published by Kim et al,US-guided needling was found to be statistically more effective than extracorporeal shockwave therapy to improve function and to decrease pain at 1 year but not at 23 months. Moreover, US-guided needling was more effective to decrease calcification size at 23 months. In the other RCT on US-guided needling, Krasny et al observed that the addition of US-guided lavage to ESWT further improved function at a mean 4.1 months. There was no between group statistical difference in calcification size; still the rate of complete disappearance of calcium deposit was statistically higher in the US-guided needling group at a mean 4.1 months. It would be interesting to compare US-guided needling with US-guided lavage on pain and on function in a future RCT.

### Is it time to reconsider the indications for surgery in patients with tennis elbow? [^cdae25f1]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

On an individual level, a steady half-life means that the duration of symptoms or length of follow-up could be largely irrelevant and provides little prognostic value. It also means that the future course is completely unpredictable. Recovery seems to be a random process akin to the biological half-life of drugs. A molecule lasting several half-lives is no different from a molecule that is eliminated first. This does not mean that a patient should expect their symptoms to halve every four months, but rather that the probability of recovery in future persists irrespective of the time passed.

While the underlying mechanisms for the half-life pattern are unclear, these findings have relevance for everyday clinical practice and future research. In this annotation we discuss what the findings mean for the usual practice of operating on patients whose symptoms fail to settle with nonoperative treatment. Second, we consider how the findings influence the interpretation of other studies. Finally, we discuss what our advice should be to patients who are frustrated by long-standing symptoms and seek advice about whether surgery should be undertaken.

### Is ultrasound-guided lavage an effective intervention for rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy? A systematic review with a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^ce64157f]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Results

From the nine potentially relevant articles identified through titles and abstract review, three RCTs met the eligibility criteria after full-text review,one including the original publication and a 5-year follow-up(figure 1). Characteristics of included studies are presented in table 1.

Figure 1 
Schematic breakdown of literature search results. RCT, randomised controlled trial.

In every RCT, the population was composed of adults with chronic RC calcific tendinopathy of at least 3to 6 months’ duration.RC calcific tendinopathy was confirmed by radiography and/or ultrasound. The mean age of participants ranged from 49 to 53 years. In two trials, the population was strictly composed of participants who previously failed a conservative treatment.

Interventions and comparators

One RCT compared US-guided lavage with aspiration and a corticosteroid injection to a corticosteroid injection alone.Two RCTs compared US-guided lavage with aspiration followed by a corticosteroid injection to shockwave therapy. De Boer et al used radial shockwave therapy for four sessions while Del Castillo-Gonzalez et al used extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) for eight sessions.

Outcome measures

For pain assessment, one RCT used a visual analogue scaleand one used the numerical rating scale.However, the method to assess pain was not further described in either studies. For self-reported function, the study by De Boer et al used the Oxford Shoulder Score while the study by de Witte et al used the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff questionnaire (WORC) and the Disability of the Shoulder, Arm and Hand questionnaire (DASH). These two RCTs also reported the Constant-Murley Score (CMS) which is a composite functional measure with sections on pain, function, strength and ROM. Two RCTs also monitored the reduction in the calcification size (mm).

Results

A total of 57 articles published in 38 journals were included in our review.Publication date ranged from 2006 to 2020, journal IFs ranged from 0 to 59.102 (mean 4.7, median 2.55). The journal with the most published SRs of RCTs on tendinopathy interventions was the British Journal of Sports Medicine (n=6) and the most commonly investigated tendinopathy in isolation was shoulder (calcific and non-calcific; n=24), followed by lateral elbow (n=10) and patellar (n=8). A total of 10 reviews assessed tendinopathy as a generic condition and assessed the same intervention(s) on more than one location of tendinopathy and two reviews included RCTs of ‘lower limb tendinopathies’. The most frequently assessed intervention in isolation was extracorporal shock-wave therapy (n=10), followed by platelet-rich plasma (n=7), however, several SRs included more than one ‘related’ intervention (ie, ‘non-surgical therapies’, ‘conservative treatments’, ‘injection therapies’, etc).

### Shock wave therapy for patients with lateral epicondylitis of the elbow: a one-to two-year follow-up study [^323c3940]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The results of both nonoperative and surgical treatments for lateral epicondylitis of the elbow have been inconsistent. Shock wave therapy has been shown to have a favorable short-term effect in treating this condition.

Hypothesis

Shock wave therapy is an effective treatment for patients with lateral epicondylitis of the elbow and long-term results will be as favorable as short-term ones.

Study Design

Case series.

Methods

The effect of shock wave therapy was investigated in 57 patients with lateral epicondylitis of the elbow. Forty-three patients (24 men and 19 women with an average age of 46 years) with 1 to 2 years of follow-up were included in this study. In addition, six patients were treated with a sham procedure as a control group. Each patient was treated with 1000 impulses of shock wave therapy at 14 kV to the affected elbow. A 100-point scoring system was used for evaluating pain, function, strength, and elbow range of motion.

Results

Twenty-seven elbows (61.4%) were free of complaints, 13 (29.5%) were significantly better, 3 (6.8%) were slightly better, and 1 (2.3%) was unchanged. In the control group, the results were unchanged in all six patients. There were no device-related problems and no systemic or local complications.

Conclusions

Shock wave therapy is a safe and effective modality in the treatment of patients with lateral epicondylitis of the elbow.

### ESWT for tendinopathy: technology and clinical implications [^ac356420]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Types of ESWT

There are two types of shockwave therapy: focused shockwave therapy (FSWT) and radial shockwave therapy (RSWT). This section will describe wave characteristics of both methods.

FSWT

FSWT is called focused because a pressure field is generated that converges in the adjustable focus at selected depth in the body tissues, where the maximal pressure is reached (Fig. 2 a). There are three methods to generate focused shockwaves for FSWT: electrohydraulic (EH), electromagnetic (EM) and piezoelectric (PE). All three have in common that the waves are generated in water (inside the applicator). Focused shockwaves are generated in water because the acoustic impedance of water and biologic tissue is comparable. As a result of this, reflection is limited and waves are better transferred into the body.

Fig. 2 
a Pressure field of a focused shockwave device (EH-generated by means of spark gap). b Pressure field of a radial shockwave device

A difference between these three methods is the moment at which the shockwave forms. EH generators produce focused shockwaves at origin, immediately after the spark gap, while EM and PE generators form shockwaves nanoseconds later by means of focusation of waves that are generated.

RSWT

The term radial refers to the diverging pressure field of RSWT devices, which reach a maximal pressure already at the source (Fig. 2 b), not at a selected depth in the body. Radial shockwaves for RSWT are generated by accelerating a projectile, using compressed air, through a tube on the end of which an applicator is placed. The projectile hits the applicator and the applicator transmits the generated pressure wave into the body. In contrast to focused shockwave, radial pressure waves are not generated in water.

### Sesamoid osteonecrosis treated with radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy [^49aabffe]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Sesamoid osteonecrosis is a disabling condition resulting in severe forefoot pain, for which there are limited treatment options. We present a 52-year-old man with 1-year history of pain, aggravated by walking and playing tennis. On examination, pain was localised to plantar aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Imaging revealed evolving end-stage avascular necrosis of lateral sesamoid with early secondary degenerative changes. Previous exhaustive conservative treatment had been unsuccessful in alleviating his pain. As an alternative to surgery, radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) was proposed. Treatment protocol was 2000 pulses at frequency of 5Hz, and pressure was varied from 1.2 to 1.8bar according to patient tolerance. A total of eight sessions were delivered. At completion of treatment, the patient reported minimal discomfort to no pain and was able to return to playing tennis with no recurrence. We propose rESWT to be an effective novel conservative treatment for sesamoid osteonecrosis.

### Updated recommendations on the therapeutic role of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for Peyronie's disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^80081606]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The therapeutic role of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) for Peyronie’s disease (PD) has been controversial in a long term. We aimed to further evaluate the therapeutic effect of ESWT for PD on the basis of available high-quality studies.

Methods

The PubMed, CENTRAL and Embase databases were searched for articles published from January 1st, 2000 to December 31, 2022. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using ESWT to treat PD were included. Meta-analysis and forest plots were carried out using Review Manager 5.4.1 software, and outcomes were reviewed by 2 authors independently. Using the Risk of Bias assessment form (ROB-2) by Cochrane Collaboration for quality assessment. PRISMA 2020 guidelines were used in this article to achieve the quantitative and qualitative synthesis of data.

Results

A total of four RCTs were included. 151 patients in the ESWT group and 150 patients in the control group. The meta-analysis results showed that ESWT could significantly reduce plaque size (OR 2.59, 95%CI 1.15 to 5.85, P = 0.02) and relieve pain (MD -1.55, 95%CI -2.46 to -0.64, P = 0.0008); but it has no significant effect on reducing the penile curvature (OR 1.93, 95%CI 0.87–4.26, P = 0.11) and improving sexual function (MD 2.6, 95%CI -1.63 to 6.83, P = 0.23), there is also no significant difference in complication rates between groups (OR 2.94, 95%CI 0.66 to 13.03, P = 0.16). The risk of bias of results is low. The limitations of this study are that the number of included studies is too small, some experimental outcomes are missing, and the expression of outcomes is not unified.

Conclusions

For PD, ESWT can be considered as a safe short-term treatment, which can reduce plaque size and relieve pain, but cannot improve penile curvature and sexual function. Its long-term efficacy remains to be discussed.

### Is it time to reconsider the indications for surgery in patients with tennis elbow? [^e36c9317]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis or lateral elbow tendinopathy) is a self-limiting condition in most patients. Surgery is often offered to patients who fail to improve with conservative treatment. However, there is no evidence to support the superiority of surgery over continued nonoperative care or no treatment. New evidence also suggests that the prognosis of tennis elbow is not influenced by the duration of symptoms, and that there is a 50% probability of recovery every three to four months. This finding challenges the belief that failed nonoperative care is an indication for surgery. In this annotation, we discuss the clinical and research implications of the benign clinical course of tennis elbow.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy for tennis elbow (...) [^a116bb89]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Is extracorporeal shock wave therapy effective in treating lateral epicondylitis. Setting: Outpatient Study Design: Randomized controlled trial Allocation: Concealed. Synopsis: The authors randomly assigned 60 patients with previously untreated lateral epicondylitis to receive extracorporeal shock wave therapy or sham therapy. The patients also were instructed in forearm extensor stretching exercises. The primary outcome of this eight-week study was “treatment success, ” as defined by at least a 50 percent reduction in elbow pain, a pain score no higher than 4 on a scale of 10, and no analgesic use in the past two weeks of the study. The person evaluating these outcomes was not told which treatment the patients received and the outcome was assessed via intention to treat.

Treatment was successful in 12 of the 31 patients who received extracorporeal shock wave therapy, compared with nine of the 29 patients who received sham therapy. The difference in success was not significant. The study was powerful enough to detect a modest difference in effect if one were present. Bottom Line: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is no more effective than sham therapy in patients with lateral epicondylitis. Other studies also have found this therapy to be ineffective for lateral epicondylitis. The few studies that show a difference usually are small and are funded by the companies that make the machines. .

### ACOEM practice guidelines: elbow disorders [^3aa497e7]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Elbow disorders discussion—trial evidence scope: Nineteen high-quality and 89 moderate-quality randomized controlled trials were identified to provide a foundation for treatment of the most common MSDs of the elbow, and most trials (89.8%) addressed lateral epicondylalgia; much of the consensus guidance is based on analogy to other comparable disorders for which there are quality trials.
