## Question

A 29-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain and mild vaginal bleeding. She has a positive urine pregnancy test. Her last menstrual period was 7 weeks ago. On examination, she is hemodynamically stable. A transvaginal ultrasound is performed, which shows an adnexal mass adjacent to the ovary, but the radiologist is uncertain whether the mass is within the ovary or separate from it. There is no intrauterine gestational sac seen. The clinical team is considering the possibility of an ovarian ectopic pregnancy.

Based on current guidelines, what is the recommended approach regarding the use of specific transvaginal ultrasound criteria for diagnosing ovarian ectopic pregnancy in this patient?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended approach to diagnosing suspected ovarian ectopic pregnancy using transvaginal ultrasound criteria, given an indeterminate adnexal mass and no intrauterine pregnancy at 7 weeks' gestation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the differential diagnosis. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about ovarian ectopic pregnancy and whether there are validated ultrasound criteria. Next, I will examine the most reliable sonographic discriminators and pitfalls, especially distinguishing ovarian ectopic from corpus luteum. After that, I should integrate serum hCG dynamics and the concept of pregnancy of unknown location. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise management plan with safety checks and follow-up, and I will double-check where MRI or other modalities fit if ultrasound remains equivocal.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the key differentials. At 7 weeks' gestation with a positive pregnancy test, no intrauterine gestational sac, and an adnexal mass of uncertain origin, the possibilities include early intrauterine pregnancy below the discriminatory threshold, pregnancy of unknown location, tubal ectopic pregnancy, ovarian ectopic pregnancy, and heterotopic pregnancy, with ovarian ectopic being rare and often mimicking a corpus luteum on ultrasound [^c2cc7d01] [^583614e6] [^0ade8cff].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on ovarian ectopic ultrasound criteria. The RCOG Green-top guideline explicitly states there are no specific agreed ultrasound criteria for diagnosing ovarian ectopic pregnancy and that evidence is insufficient to recommend specific sonographic standards, which means we should not overcall an intraovarian thick-walled cyst as an ovarian ectopic without definitive intraovarian embryonic content [^ecae64f1] [^df965f2f]. I should also confirm that ACOG emphasizes transvaginal ultrasound as the primary modality but does not provide ovarian-specific diagnostic criteria, reinforcing that we must rely on general ectopic principles and careful correlation rather than a rigid ovarian-specific checklist [^9b2b0dcd] [^8d6c7e5a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the most reliable sonographic discriminators that reduce false positives. The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound consensus advises that ovarian ectopic pregnancy should only be diagnosed when a yolk sac, embryo, or cardiac activity is definitively identified within an intraovarian gestational sac, because most intraovarian thick-walled cysts represent corpus luteum and can mimic an ectopic; without yolk sac or embryo, the diagnosis should not be made on ultrasound alone [^b97f2c56] [^583614e6]. Let me consider ancillary signs: a claw sign of ovarian parenchyma partially surrounding the cyst favors corpus luteum, whereas a mass that moves separately from the ovary with the sliding sign supports an extraovarian tubal ectopic rather than an ovarian implantation, and echogenicity can help distinguish a hyperechoic tubal ring from a hypoechoic corpus luteum rim, though color Doppler is not reliably discriminative in this context [^b7774b55] [^c1448076] [^dc7fcfc8].

> I should double-check the role of hCG and the discriminatory zone. Initially, I thought a discriminatory threshold around 1,500–2,000 mIU/mL would apply here, but wait, let me verify applicability. That threshold pertains to expecting visualization of a normal intrauterine pregnancy and does not directly diagnose ectopic location; moreover, ectopic pregnancies can present at any hCG level, so I should not use a single hCG value to exclude ectopic disease or to diagnose ovarian ectopic specifically, and instead must correlate serial hCG with ultrasound evolution and symptoms [^ae5d3dd5] [^4a52b57c] [^068ad0d5]. I need to ensure I frame this as pregnancy of unknown location with risk stratification rather than a diagnostic hCG cutoff for ovarian ectopic, which does not exist [^27e7a555] [^09d23a07].

> Next, I should review how to classify the current ultrasound. With no intrauterine pregnancy and no extrauterine yolk sac or embryo, this fits pregnancy of unknown location rather than definite or probable ectopic; importantly, an adnexal mass without yolk sac or embryo is not sufficient to label an ovarian ectopic, and the absence of an intrauterine gestational sac at 7 weeks raises concern but is not diagnostic of ectopic by itself [^27e7a555] [^8ef627d3] [^583614e6]. Let me reconsider the risk: in PUL populations, ectopic risk is roughly 4–8%, and clinical judgment plus serial evaluation is essential to avoid missed ectopic while protecting desired pregnancies [^09d23a07] [^c21939b1].

> I will now examine a practical, stepwise approach. First, confirm hemodynamic stability and obtain a quantitative serum hCG if not already done, because management hinges on stability and trending hCG alongside repeat ultrasound. Second, arrange close follow-up with repeat transvaginal ultrasound in 48–72 hours and serial hCG measurements, since dynamic change is more informative than a single static study. Third, during repeat imaging, actively look for intraovarian yolk sac or embryo to meet the strict SRU criterion for ovarian ectopic, and use the sliding sign and echogenicity to distinguish tubal ring from corpus luteum. Fourth, if the mass is clearly extraovarian and separate from the ovary, that supports tubal ectopic rather than ovarian, which changes management considerations. Fifth, if the diagnosis remains uncertain but suspicion persists, involve early pregnancy unit or gynecology for specialist review and consider 3D ultrasound where available to clarify anatomy and relationships [^9b2b0dcd] [^b97f2c56] [^c1448076] [^bb9fa2a1].

> But wait, what if ultrasound remains equivocal and the patient is high risk or the clinical picture worsens? I should confirm when advanced imaging is appropriate. MRI without contrast can be a problem-solving tool in complex or equivocal cases, particularly to better define non-tubal ectopics or to distinguish mimickers, though availability and expertise vary; this is a second-line adjunct rather than a routine first step in stable patients [^2bdcd54a] [^32261a78]. If the patient becomes unstable or if there is significant hemoperitoneum or a large adnexal mass with concerning features, surgical exploration is indicated, and if laparoscopy is performed and ovarian ectopic is confirmed, definitive surgical management is recommended by RCOG given the diagnostic uncertainty and risk profile of ovarian pregnancies [^2aec5c13] [^e0904755].

> Let me think about counseling and safety. I should explain that ovarian ectopic pregnancy is rare, that our current ultrasound cannot confirm it today without seeing a yolk sac or embryo inside the ovary, and that our plan is designed to detect ectopic early while avoiding harm to a possible early intrauterine pregnancy. I need to ensure the patient knows red flags such as syncope, severe pain, or shoulder pain and has clear return precautions and a scheduled follow-up within 48–72 hours with repeat ultrasound and hCG [^c2cc7d01] [^9b2b0dcd].

> In summary, I should confirm that there are no validated, guideline-endorsed ultrasound criteria specific to ovarian ectopic pregnancy, and the most reliable approach is to reserve the diagnosis for cases with definitive intraovarian yolk sac or embryo while otherwise managing as pregnancy of unknown location with serial hCG and repeat transvaginal ultrasound, careful differentiation from corpus luteum using sliding sign and echogenicity, and escalation to specialist input or MRI if the diagnosis remains uncertain and suspicion remains high [^ecae64f1] [^b97f2c56] [^27e7a555] [^2bdcd54a].

---

There are **no validated ultrasound criteria** for diagnosing ovarian ectopic pregnancy [^ecae64f1]; diagnosis relies on identifying a **gestational sac with yolk sac or embryo within the ovary** [^b97f2c56] and excluding an intrauterine pregnancy [^583614e6]. Because ovarian ectopic pregnancy is rare and easily confused with a corpus luteum, **definitive diagnosis requires either yolk sac or embryo within an intraovarian sac** [^583614e6]. If uncertain, manage as pregnancy of unknown location with serial hCG and repeat ultrasound [^9b2b0dcd], and consider MRI [^2bdcd54a] or laparoscopy if the diagnosis remains unclear or the patient becomes unstable [^2aec5c13].

---

## Ultrasound features suggestive of ovarian ectopic pregnancy

While there are **no validated criteria**, the following ultrasound features are suggestive of ovarian ectopic pregnancy:

- **Intraovarian gestational sac**: A gestational sac located within the ovarian parenchyma, separate from the uterus and fallopian tube [^b97f2c56].

- **Yolk sac or embryo**: Presence of a yolk sac, embryo, or fetal cardiac activity within the intraovarian gestational sac [^583614e6].

- **Absence of intrauterine pregnancy**: No gestational sac or signs of intrauterine pregnancy on ultrasound [^c2cc7d01].

- **Corpus luteum**: Often present in the same ovary, which can complicate diagnosis and lead to misinterpretation [^b7774b55].

---

## Limitations and challenges in ultrasound diagnosis

Ultrasound diagnosis of ovarian ectopic pregnancy is challenging because of the following:

- **Rarity**: Ovarian ectopic pregnancy is rare, accounting for approximately 0.5–3% of all ectopic pregnancies [^notfound].

- **Mimics corpus luteum**: The gestational sac can mimic a corpus luteum cyst, making differentiation difficult [^583614e6].

- **Operator dependence**: Diagnosis heavily relies on operator expertise and experience [^3e1ef21e].

- **Lack of validated criteria**: No specific ultrasound criteria or guidelines have been established for ovarian ectopic pregnancy [^ecae64f1].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

Given the lack of validated ultrasound criteria, the following diagnostic approach is recommended:

- **Transvaginal ultrasound**: Perform detailed transvaginal ultrasound to identify intraovarian gestational sac with yolk sac or embryo [^b97f2c56].

- **Exclude intrauterine pregnancy**: Ensure no intrauterine pregnancy is present to avoid misdiagnosis [^c2cc7d01].

- **Serial hCG measurements**: Use serial hCG levels to monitor pregnancy progression and assist in diagnosis [^9b2b0dcd].

- **MRI or laparoscopy**: If ultrasound findings are inconclusive, consider MRI [^2bdcd54a] or laparoscopy for definitive diagnosis [^2aec5c13].

---

## Management implications

Accurate diagnosis of ovarian ectopic pregnancy is critical for appropriate management. Medical management with **methotrexate** is often effective for stable patients [^8d6c7e5a], whereas surgical intervention — either **laparoscopy or laparotomy** — is indicated for unstable patients or when medical management fails [^2aec5c13].

---

There are **no validated ultrasound criteria** for diagnosing ovarian ectopic pregnancy. Diagnosis relies on identifying a gestational sac with yolk sac or embryo within the ovary and excluding an intrauterine pregnancy. If uncertain, manage as pregnancy of unknown location with serial hCG and repeat ultrasound, and consider MRI or laparoscopy if the diagnosis remains unclear or the patient becomes unstable.

### SOGC clinical practice guidelines. ultrasound evaluation of first trimester pregnancy complications. number 161, June 2005 [^ef503c7e]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

First, to review normal embryonic development and the sonographic evidence of early pregnancy failure; second, to review sonographic evidence of ectopic pregnancy.

Outcomes

First, prediction of pregnancy failure, second, sonographic identification of ectopic pregnancy.

Evidence

A MEDLINE search and review of bibliographies in identified articles was conducted.

Values

The evidence was reviewed by the Diagnostic Imaging Committee along with the principal authors. A quality of evidence assessment was undertaken as outlined in the report of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination (Table 1).

Benefits, Harms, and Costs

Women presenting with first trimester bleeding may be incorrectly diagnosed with a missed abortion and (or) may be inappropriately reassured about viability. Transvaginal ultrasound provides improved resolution allowing description of early embryonic development characteristics. Improvement in the identification of the sonographic landmark of normal embryonic development and awareness of the sonographic risk factors of pregnancy failure may lead to more successful management strategies. Diagnosis of suspected ectopic pregnancy often involves an assessment of both hormonal markers and sonographic features. Maternal morbidity and mortality can be reduced with an early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.

Recommendations

There is good (class A) evidence that current ultrasound technology can distinguish between normal and abnormal pregnancies in the first trimester. There is good (class A) evidence that transvaginal ultrasound in conjunction with quantitative-HCG can diagnose ectopic pregnancy.

Indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound — β-hCG utility and management: Level A recommendations are "None specified." Level B recommendations state, "Do not use the β-hCG value to exclude the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in patients who have an indeterminate ultrasound." Level C recommendations state, "Obtain specialty consultation or arrange close outpatient follow-up for all patients with an indeterminate pelvic ultrasound." Most emergency department literature reports an indeterminate study rate of 20% to 30%, and the ACEP 2003 clinical policy provided a Level B recommendation that patients with an indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound and a β-hCG level above 2,000 mIU/mL have follow-up arranged because they have a higher risk of ectopic pregnancy.

American College of Emergency Physicians clinical policy — early pregnancy in the emergency department — revises the 2003 policy and frames evidence-based recommendations through three critical questions. It asks whether the emergency physician should obtain a pelvic ultrasound in a clinically stable pregnant patient with abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding and a beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level below a discriminatory threshold; in patients with an indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound, what is the diagnostic utility of β-hCG for predicting possible ectopic pregnancy; and, in patients receiving methotrexate for confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy, what are the implications for emergency department management. Evidence was graded and recommendations were developed.

Corpus luteum on transvaginal ultrasound — Characteristic features include a round, hypoechoic, thick-walled structure with a central cystic space and peripheral vascularity, which can mimic a tubal ring of ectopic pregnancy; a helpful feature to diagnose a corpus luteum is a claw sign of partially surrounding ovarian parenchyma confirming an ovarian origin. Additionally, the rim of chorionic tissue in an IUP and EP is hyperechoic whereas a corpus luteum is hypoechoic, and echogenicity can help distinguish a tubal ring from a corpus luteum.

Transvaginal ultrasonography — diagnostic findings include that ultrasonography can definitively diagnose an ectopic pregnancy when a gestational sac with a yolk sac, or embryo, or both, is noted in the adnexa; a mass or mass with a hypoechoic area separate from the ovary raises suspicion but its positive predictive value is only 80%; an early intrauterine gestational sac may be visualized as early as 5 weeks of gestation, yet definitive intrauterine pregnancy evidence requires visualization of a gestational sac with a yolk sac or embryo; visualization of a definitive intrauterine pregnancy eliminates ectopic pregnancy except in the rare case of a heterotopic pregnancy; and a hypoechoic "sac-like" uterine structure can represent a pseudogestational sac.

### Diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy [^1173fad7]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy affects 1% to 2% of all pregnancies and is responsible for 9% of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States. When a pregnant patient presents with first-trimester bleeding or abdominal pain, physicians should consider ectopic pregnancy as a possible cause. The patient history, physical examination, and imaging with transvaginal ultrasonography can usually confirm the diagnosis. When ultrasonography does not clearly identify the pregnancy location, the physician must determine whether the pregnancy is intrauterine (either viable or failing) or ectopic. Use of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (ß-hCG) discriminatory level, the ß-hCG value above which an intrauterine pregnancy should be visualized by transvaginal ultrasonography, may be helpful. Failure to visualize an intrauterine pregnancy when ß-hCG is above the discriminatory level suggests ectopic pregnancy. In addition to single measurements of ß-hCG levels, serial levels can be monitored to detect changes. ß-hCG values in approximately 99% of viable intrauterine pregnancies increase by about 50% in 48 hours. The remaining 1% of patients have a slower rate of increase; these patients may have pregnancies that are misdiagnosed as nonviable intrauterine or ectopic. After an ectopic pregnancy has been confirmed, treatment options include medical, surgical, or expectant management. For patients who are medically unstable or experiencing life-threatening hemorrhage, a surgical approach is indicated. For others, management should be based on patient preference after discussion of the risks, benefits, and monitoring requirements of all approaches.

Serum hCG level thresholds with transvaginal ultrasound — when sonographic abnormalities are present, a serum hCG level greater than 1,500 mIU/mL indicated ectopic pregnancy with virtual certainty; without these sonographic abnormalities, a serum hCG level greater than 2,000 mIU/mL increased the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy and excluded viable intrauterine pregnancy; smaller prospective studies identified all viable intrauterine pregnancies above 1,025 mIU/mL and above 1,000 mIU/mL, and in a study of 52 pregnant women all viable intrauterine pregnancies were identified with hCG levels above 750 mIU/mL; Level B recommendations: Arrange follow-up for patients with a nondiagnostic transvaginal ultrasound and a serum hCG level above 2,000 mIU/mL because they have an increased likelihood of ectopic pregnancy.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: management of undesired pregnancy of unknown location and abortion at less than 42 days of gestation [^2fb1d6c1]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) diagnosis — terminology and ultrasound correlation: The guideline recommends using standardized nomenclature and definitions for intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), probable IUP, pregnancy of unknown location (PUL), probable ectopic pregnancy (probable EP), ectopic pregnancy (EP), and early pregnancy loss (EPL) (Best Practice). It also states that gestational duration and serum quantitative hCG levels correlate with transvaginal ultrasonography findings, and that a gestational sac is usually seen 35 days after the last menstrual period (LMP).

### Normal and abnormal US findings in early first-trimester pregnancy: review of the society of radiologists in ultrasound 2012 consensus panel recommendations [^3955261f]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

Since being introduced more than 30 years ago, endovaginal ultrasonography (US) and quantitative testing of serum levels of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin have become the standard means of establishing the presence of normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), failed IUP, and ectopic pregnancy. Appropriate use of these powerful tools requires clear, standardized interpretations based on conservative criteria to protect both the pregnancy and the mother. Since diagnoses are assigned earlier and available medical treatments for ectopic pregnancy and failed IUP are expanding, emphasis must carefully shift toward watchful waiting when the mother is clinically stable and a definitive location for the pregnancy cannot be established with US. To this end and to prevent inadvertent harm to early normal pregnancies, the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound convened a consensus panel of radiologists, obstetricians, and emergency medicine physicians in 2012 with the goal of reviewing current literature and clinical practices and formulating modern criteria and terminology for the various first-trimester outcomes.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^4a52b57c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

β-hCG discriminatory threshold and ultrasound decision-making in early pregnancy — concepts and risks: Algorithms guiding the evaluation of abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy generally incorporate the results of quantitative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) measurements and pelvic ultrasonography. Many algorithms apply the principle of the discriminatory threshold, historically defined as the level at which the sensitivity of ultrasound was thought to approach 100% for the detection of intrauterine pregnancy; the commonly reported range for radiologist-performed transvaginal sonography is 1,000 to 2,000 mIU/mL. The text notes that ectopic pregnancies can present at almost any β-hCG level, high or low, and that rupture has been documented at very low β-hCG levels; an indeterminate study is also called "nondiagnostic" or a "pregnancy of unknown location."

Early pregnancy emergency department — transvaginal ultrasound for ectopic pregnancy at low human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels: In a prospective cohort of 439 symptomatic women, Fifty-six had ectopic pregnancy and 21 had initial hCG less than 1,000 mIU/mL; initial transvaginal ultrasound showed specificity 100% and sensitivity 19% for ectopic pregnancy among patients with hCG less than 1,000 mIU/mL, and Four ultrasound-diagnostic cases had hCG less than 1,000 mIU/mL. A retrospective review of 111 patients with initial hCG less than 1,000 mIU/mL found Twenty-three ectopic pregnancies, with 9 (39%) diagnostic on initial transvaginal ultrasound and 5 with hCG less than 500 mIU/mL. Level C recommendations: Consider transvaginal ultrasound because it may detect ectopic pregnancy when the serum hCG level is below 1,000 mIU/mL.

### Does this woman have an ectopic pregnancy? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^068ad0d5]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The rapid identification and accurate diagnosis of women who may have an ectopic pregnancy is critically important for reducing the maternal morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy and precision of the patient history, clinical examination, readily available laboratory values, and sonography in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in women with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding during early pregnancy.

Data Sources

We conducted MEDLINE and EMBASE searches for English-language articles from 1965 to December 2012 reporting on the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.

Study Selection

The analysis included prospective studies of 100 or more pregnant women with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding that evaluated patient history, physical examination, laboratory values, and sonography compared with a reference standard of either (1) direct surgical visualization of ectopic pregnancy or (2) clinical follow-up for all pregnancies to prove that ectopic pregnancy was not missed. Of 10,890 articles identified by the search, 14 studies with 12,101 patients met the inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors (J.R.C. and M.V.C.) independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each study. A third author (L. A.B.) resolved any discrepancies.

Results

All components of the patient history had a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) less than 1.5. The presence of an adnexal mass in the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy on transvaginal sonography (LR+ 111; 95% CI, 12–1028; n = 6885), and the physical examination findings of cervical motion tenderness (LR+ 4.9; 95% CI, 1.7–14; n = 1435), an adnexal mass (LR+ 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6–3.7; n = 1378), and adnexal tenderness (LR+ 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0–3.5; n = 1435) all increase the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy. A lack of adnexal abnormalities on transvaginal sonography (negative LR [LR-] 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03–0.55; n = 6885) decreases the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy. Existing studies do not establish a single serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level that is diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Transvaginal sonography is the single best diagnostic modality for evaluating women with suspected ectopic pregnancy. The presence of abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding during early pregnancy should prompt a transvaginal sonogram and quantitative serum hCG testing.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^6e28114c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Early pregnancy with indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound — β-hCG-level measurements for ectopic pregnancy risk stratification: In a prospective observational cohort of stable, consecutive pregnant patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy, the objective was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of initial and repeat β-hCG-level measurements in patients with an indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound. Transvaginal ultrasound was considered diagnostic of IUP when an "intrauterine gestational sac" was seen; ectopic pregnancy was diagnosed only in the presence of an extrauterine gestational sac with yolk sac or fetal pole; otherwise, the transvaginal ultrasound was considered indeterminate. Results included 354 patients with an indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound; 58 had an adnexal mass, 14 had free fluid, and 20 had both findings but were included as indeterminate; LR for ectopic pregnancy in patients without adnexal mass or free fluid, stratified by β-hCG level (mIU/mL), was: < 1,000 (n = 36): 0.62 (95% CI 0.5 to 0.8), 1,000–1,499 (n = 2): 0.31 (95% CI 0.1 to 1.3), 1,500–1,999 (n = 1): 0.63 (95% CI 0.1 to 5), and ≥ 2,000 (n = 24): 19 (95% CI 6.8 to 52).

### A lexicon for first-trimester US: society of radiologists in ultrasound consensus conference recommendations [^27e7a555]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) — definition, diagnostic context, and consensus usage: A PUL is used "when the transvaginal US examination of a patient with a positive hCG shows neither an IUP nor EP." As "most IUPs will be seen with transvaginal US when hCG is 3000 mIU/mL or higher," the differential for a lower hCG includes "(a) nonvisualized early IUP, (b) nonvisualized EP, or (c) an early pregnancy loss that has completely passed," and "Correlation with trending hCG values and follow-up US is helpful to differentiate these scenarios." To avoid ambiguity, "The consensus is to use the original definition whereby any signs of an IUP or EP, probable or definite, would not qualify as a PUL," and the lexicon clarifies "that there should be no evidence of probable or definite intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) or ectopic pregnancy (EP) to qualify as a PUL;" moreover, "An empty gestational sac is considered a probable pregnancy… and should not be termed a PUL."

### Diagnosing ectopic pregnancy: decision analysis comparing six strategies [^f28e6abc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare six published methods of diagnosing ectopic pregnancy.

Methods

Decision analysis compared six diagnostic algorithms involving combinations of clinical examination, transvaginal ultrasound, serum progesterone, serum hCG, and D&C. The population was composed of hemodynamically stable women who presented to a tertiary care university emergency department with abdominal pain or bleeding in their first trimesters. Outcome measures included number of missed ectopic pregnancies, potentially interrupted intrauterine pregnancies, surgical and diagnostic procedures, time until diagnosis, and cost.

Results

Ultrasound followed by serum hCG in women with nondiagnostic scans yielded the most favorable outcomes; no ectopic pregnancy was missed, only 1% of all potential intrauterine pregnancies were interrupted, and time to diagnosis averaged 1.46 days. Quantitative hCG measurement followed by ultrasound only in women with hCG levels above the discriminatory zone was optimal if sensitivity of ultrasound to diagnose intrauterine pregnancy was less than 93%. Serum progesterone measurement was not favored because it was associated with missed ectopic pregnancies (2.6%).

Conclusion

Given the current accuracy of tests for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy, algorithms using a combination of ultrasound and hCG resulted in the best outcomes. Ultrasound as the first step was the most efficient and accurate method of diagnosing ectopic pregnancies.

First-trimester ultrasound lexicon — tubal ring versus corpus luteum differentiation is clarified as follows: When no intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) is visualized, an extraovarian mass or a tubal ring has a high likelihood of representing a tubal ectopic pregnancy (EP), but color Doppler peripheral vascularity is not discriminatory between an empty tubal ring and a corpus luteum. A tubal ring is usually more echogenic than a corpus luteum; a location completely within the ovary or a claw sign of ovarian tissue favors corpus luteum, and a sliding sign with transvaginal probe pressure can help confirm that a mass or tubal ring moves separately from the ovary. Alternate terms include "adnexal ring" and "adnexal GS," while the vernacular descriptors "blob," "bagel," and "donut sign" are to be avoided.

First-trimester ultrasound lexicon — ovarian ectopic pregnancy (EP) refers to a pregnancy in or on an ovary, is exceedingly rare, and often mimics a corpus luteum. Because most intraovarian thick-walled cysts represent a corpus luteum, the diagnosis of ovarian EP should not be made unless a yolk sac, embryo, or cardiac activity is definitely seen in the intraovarian lesion.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaClinically suspected adnexal mass, No acute symptoms [^aa46e1f6]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are approximately 9.1 pelvic surgeries performed for every histologically confirmed adnexal malignancy in the United States, compared to 2.3 surgeries per malignancy (in oncology centers) and 5.9 surgeries per malignancy (in other centers) in Europe. An important prognostic factor in the long-term survival in patients with ovarian malignancy is the initial management by a gynecological oncologist. With high accuracy of imaging for adnexal mass characterization and consequent appropriate triage to subspecialty referral, the better use of gynecologic oncology can improve treatment outcomes. Ultrasound, including transabdominal, transvaginal, and duplex ultrasound, combined with MRI with contrast can diagnose adnexal masses as benign with specific features (ie, functional masses, dermoid, endometrioma, fibroma, pedunculated fibroid, hydrosalpinx, peritoneal inclusion cyst, Tarlov cyst), malignant, or indeterminate. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ESR essentials: gynaecological causes of acute pelvic pain in women: a primer for emergent evaluation-practice recommendations by the European society of emergency radiology [^4e91ed96]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Key recommendations

In skilled hands, transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound is the best first modality in suspected gynaecological pathology. It will help identify ectopic pregnancy, adnexal torsion, causes of ovarian cysts and their complications, and may be of value in pelvic inflammatory disease (Level of evidence high).
CT is a relatively non-specific test which is often the first imaging investigation due to its easy availability 24/7. It can be used when non-gynaecological causes of pain are suspected and when US is non-conclusive (Level of evidence moderate).
MRI has high diagnostic accuracy and is very helpful in further characterisation after US ± CT. It has limited availability in an emergency setting and may be used in differentiating pelvic inflammatory disease and tubo-ovarian abscesses. MRI is useful in pregnancy when US is inconclusive (Level of evidence moderate).

### Validation of models to diagnose ovarian cancer in patients managed surgically or conservatively: multicentre cohort study [^7b7fc048]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

This study was conducted by using interim data from the IOTA phase 5 study (IOTA5), an international multicentre prospective cohort study. IOTA5 recruited consecutive patients with an adnexal mass examined by using transvaginal ultrasound, irrespective of whether patients subsequently underwent surgery or were managed conservatively with follow-up visits. Appendix 1 presents the IOTA5 protocol. IOTA5 recruitment took place from January 2012 to October 2016, but follow-up will continue until all patients receiving conservative management have been followed up for at least five years. The current interim analysis includes patients recruited until 1 March 2015 and follow-up data until 30 June 2017. Thirty six centres in 14 countries recruited patients to the study. The contributing centres were either oncology referral centres (tertiary centres with a specific gynaecological oncology unit) or other types of centre. We obtained approval from the ethics committee of the University Hospitals Leuven as the coordinating centre (B32220095331/S51375) and the local ethics committee of each contributing centre. We report the study according to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) guidelines.

Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 or older at recruitment and presented with at least one adnexal mass (ovarian, para-ovarian, or tubal) on ultrasound examination. Informed consent was obtained and then local clinicians examined patients following a standardised research protocol. Exclusion criteria were lesions presumed to be physiological if the largest diameter was less than 3 cm, refusal to provide informed consent, or withdrawal of informed consent. Pregnancy was not an exclusion criterion. We excluded patients if they had an adnexal mass that was already being followed up in the recruitment centre before the start of the study.

### Enhancing decision-making in tubal ectopic pregnancy using a machine learning approach to expectant management: a clinical article [^eeea875a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ectopic Pregnancy (EP), commonly ampullar occurs in approximately 1–2% of pregnancies. Long-term adverse outcomes, particularly regarding fertility, emphasize the need for optimal management to minimize risks.

Advancements in non-invasive diagnostics have evolved EP management, enabling early diagnosis and prompt decision-making. Common evaluation methods include sequential measurements of serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) levels and transvaginal sonography.

There are three main options for managing a confirmed EP: surgical removal (salpingectomy or salpingostomy), methotrexate (MTX) treatment, and expectant management. Typically, this requires surgery (salpingostomy or salpingectomy) or MTX treatment. The literature provides criteria to aid in deciding between MTX treatment or surgical. Clinicians rely on clinical judgment and patient preferences due to insufficient evidence-based data.

Recent data indicate that expectant management can be a viable approach for certain cases of ectopic pregnancy However, there are no established guidelines or specific serum βhCG level thresholds. Information regarding the safety and effectiveness of this approach are insufficient.

Current practice suggests that expectant management may be an option for hemodynamically stable patients presenting with low serum βhCG concentrations and minimal sonographic findings, while closely monitoring βhCG levels. However, the definition of "low βhCG" differs among guidelines and rely mostly on follow-up according to MTX treatment guidelines. Most guidelines include criteria for stable patients with an initial βhCG level < 1500 mIU/ml or decline of more than 13% in βhCG levels between two tests within a 48-hour timeframe.

Guideline recommendations regarding the rate of decline in sequential βhCG measurements and the timing between these tests are inconsistent.

The objective of this study was to optimize the decision-making process for expectant management at the time of EP diagnosis using machine learning model. We aimed to identify the correlations between parameters at admission with an EP diagnosis and the success rates of expectant management using a machine learning tool. Additionally, the study presents the management protocol adopted in our unit to support and contextualize the development of this model.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^023dd73c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Emergency department early pregnancy — transvaginal ultrasound diagnostic accuracy across the beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) discriminatory zone is summarized as follows: In a retrospective chart review comparing patients below versus above 1,500 mIU/mL, 333 patients were included, with 269 having β-hCG level > 1,500 mIU/mL and 64 having β-hCG level < 1,500 mIU/mL; overall ectopic pregnancy incidence was 8%, but it was 25% in patients with β-hCG level < 1,500 mIU/mL. For intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) in the < 1,500 mIU/mL group, sensitivity was 33% (95% confidence interval [CI] 10% to 65%) and specificity 98% (95% CI 90% to 100%); for ectopic pregnancy in this group, sensitivity was 25% (95% CI 5% to 57%) and specificity 96% (95% CI 87% to 99%). Transvaginal ultrasounds were performed by radiologists, and the relatively small number of patients with β-hCG level < 1,500 mIU/mL resulted in wide CI around the estimates of sensitivity and specificity.

### Utility of a routine ultrasound for detection of ectopic pregnancies among women requesting abortion: a retrospective review [^bda78ec7]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Box 1
The usual flow of clinical care (pre COVID-19 guidelines)

Women self-refer to the abortion service or are referred by their general practitioner (GP) as soon as they have a positive pregnancy test result. There is no need to wait until a certain gestation before referral is accepted.
All women attend an in-person clinic appointment at which they undergo a transabdominal ultrasound scan performed by an ultrasonographer at the centre, unless they have had a previous ultrasound scan elsewhere in the health service during this pregnancy. A transvaginal scan is done if the views are suboptimal or if the pregnancy is not visualised by the transabdominal scan.
If an intrauterine pregnancy is identified* and the criteria of the 1967 Abortion Act are met, women are offered either medical or surgical abortion as per their preference. Medical abortion could be in a clinical setting or at home depending on gestation, social circumstances and the patient's request.
If the results are inconclusive (eg, empty uterus) then serial serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurements are obtained. If the hCG level rises appropriately (> 66% over 48 hours), the woman is invited for a repeat scan in 7–10 days. An ectopic pregnancy is suspected if there is a suboptimal rise or plateau, and the woman is referred to the regional early pregnancy unit (EPU) for further investigation, monitoring and treatment.
If an ectopic pregnancy is identified on the scan, women are referred to the regional EPU, which will then arrange treatment depending on guidance at the time (ie, salpingectomy, methotrexate or, more recently, conservative management).

All women with symptoms indicative of an ectopic pregnancy were referred to the early pregnancy unit (EPU) at the regional hospital for further management including conservative (serial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) monitoring), medical (methotrexate) or surgical management.

Data on cases were entered into Microsoft Excel and analysed using descriptive statistics.

Ethical approval was not required. The project was approved by the NHS Lothian Sexual and Reproductive Health Quality Improvement Team. Patients and the public were not involved in the study design. The data had patient identifiable information removed and conformed to the Caldicott guidelines.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^a70e6128]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Episodes of PID often go unrecognized. Although certain cases are asymptomatic, others are not diagnosed because the patient or the health care provider do not recognize the implications of mild or nonspecific symptoms or signs (e.g. abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, and vaginal discharge). Even women with mild or asymptomatic PID might be at risk for infertility. Because of the difficulty of diagnosis and the potential for damage to the reproductive health of women, health care providers should maintain a low threshold for the clinical diagnosis of PID. The recommendations for diagnosing PID are intended to assist health care providers to recognize when PID should be suspected and when additional information should be obtained to increase diagnostic certainty. Diagnosis and management of other causes of lower abdominal pain (e.g. ectopic pregnancy, acute appendicitis, ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, or functional pain) are unlikely to be impaired by initiating antimicrobial therapy for PID. Presumptive treatment for PID should be initiated for sexually active young women and other women at risk for STIs if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, or if one or more of the following three minimum clinical criteria are present on pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness.

More specific criteria for diagnosing PID include endometrial biopsy with histopathologic evidence of endometritis; transvaginal sonography or magnetic resonance imaging techniques demonstrating thickened, fluid-filled tubes with or without free pelvic fluid or tubo-ovarian complex, or Doppler studies indicating pelvic infection (e.g. tubal hyperemia); and laparoscopic findings consistent with PID. A diagnostic evaluation that includes some of these more extensive procedures might be warranted in certain cases. Endometrial biopsy is warranted for women undergoing laparoscopy who do not have visual evidence of salpingitis because endometritis is the only sign of PID for certain women.

Requiring that all three minimum criteria be present before the initiation of empiric treatment can result in insufficient sensitivity for a PID diagnosis. After deciding whether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also consider the risk profile for STIs. More elaborate diagnostic evaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis and management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity. For example, the presence of signs of lower genital tract inflammation (predominance of leukocytes in vaginal secretions, cervical discharge, or cervical friability), in addition to one of the three minimum criteria, increases the specificity of the diagnosis. One or more of the following additional criteria can be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical criteria and support a PID diagnosis:

Ovarian lesions are common and require a consistent approach to diagnosis and management for best patient outcomes. In the past 20 years, there has been an evolution in the approach to abnormal ovarian lesions, with increasing emphasis on reducing surgery for benign disease, standardizing terminology, assessing risk of malignancy through use of evidence-based scoring systems, and triaging suspicious abnormalities to dedicated oncology centers. This article provides an evidence-based review of how these changes in diagnosis and management of ultrasound-detected abnormal ovarian lesions have occurred. Current recommended practices are summarized. The current literature on transvaginal screening for ovarian cancer also is reviewed and summarized.

Mateer et al — bedside transvaginal ultrasound in the emergency department (ED) was assessed for diagnostic accuracy using a prospective observational convenience sample of pregnant patients > 18 y presenting to the ED with abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, orthostasis, adnexal tenderness, or risk factors for ectopic pregnancy, excluding those with hypotension or beyond 16 weeks of gestation, with scans performed by emergency physicians and predefined diagnostic categories for definite intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), probable abnormal IUP, ectopic pregnancy, and "no definite IUP," with final diagnoses based on follow-up records. Among patients with "no definite IUP" on transvaginal ultrasound, 41 patients were identified; of these, 5/11 (45%) with β-hCG level > 2,000 mIU/mL had an ectopic pregnancy and 8/30 (27%) with β-hCG level < 2,000 mIU/mL had an ectopic pregnancy.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® first trimester vaginal bleeding: 2025 update [^2bdcd54a]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is a relatively common occurrence in the first trimester of pregnancy, but can be distressing for both patients and clinicians. Differential considerations include normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), a nonviable IUP, an ectopic pregnancy (EP), or much less commonly gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). Although the diagnosis of EP, nonviable IUP, and GTD is important, it is also crucial to avoid harming potentially normal pregnancies through early medical or surgical treatment. Fortunately, most diagnoses can be made using a combination of ultrasound (US), serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels, and physical examination. When a diagnosis is in question, serial examinations and close clinical evaluation is paramount. Occasionally, MRI of the pelvis without contrast may be helpful in problem-solving for challenging cases, where grayscale US is limited or when there is high concern for nontubal EP. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### A lexicon for first-trimester US: society of radiologists in ultrasound consensus conference recommendations [^c2dee8ee]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy (EP) lexicon — definition, locations, and reporting details are specified as follows: EP is defined as a pregnancy implanted in an abnormal location, whether intrauterine or extrauterine. When reporting EP, the location should precede the term EP, and ectopic locations include tubal, interstitial, cervical, cesarean scar, ovarian, abdominal, and intramural. Though tubal EP locations can be further characterized as isthmic, infundibular, and ampullary, these terms are optional since the precise location of a tubal EP is typically not evident at US. The description of an EP should also include the presence of a yolk sac, embryo, fetus, or cardiac activity when present to assist with treatment planning, and it should also describe laterality, when applicable. In most scenarios, an EP should be described as probable if there is no yolk sac or embryo.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute pelvic pain in the reproductive age group: 2023 update [^9c62ed0d]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

This review focuses on the initial imaging in the reproductive age adult population with acute pelvic pain, including patients with positive and negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels with suspected gynecological and nongynecological etiology. For all patients, a combination of transabdominal and transvaginal pelvic ultrasound with Doppler is usually appropriate as an initial imaging study. If nongynecological etiology in patients with negative β-hCG is suspected, then CT of the abdomen and pelvis with or without contrast is also usually appropriate. In patients with positive β-hCG and suspected nongynecological etiology, CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast and MRI of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast may be appropriate. In patients with negative β-hCG and suspected gynecological etiology, CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast, MRI of pelvis without contrast, or MRI of pelvis with and without contrast may be appropriate. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

### Ultrasound diagnosis of early pregnancy loss in an in-vitro fertilization population [^03535504]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, the diagnosis of early pregnancy loss is made based primarily on ultrasonographic findings. In an in-vitro fertilization (IVF) population the date of embryo transfer into the uterus is known accurately. This should allow for more specific guidelines for the diagnosis of early pregnancy loss in a woman who has undergone IVF and has an intrauterine pregnancy.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent embryo transfer at a tertiary medical center in the USA between 1 January 2012–31 December 2022, had a positive quantitative hCG, and had at least one transvaginal ultrasound demonstrating a gestational sac. Multiple and ectopic pregnancies were excluded. IVF gestational age (GA IVF) was calculated from day of egg retrieval (expected ovulation). Ultrasound gestational age (GA US) was calculated using Daya's formula. Data was retrieved from the infertility center database and ultrasound records. The primary outcome was early pregnancy loss.

Results

16,369 patients underwent IVF at the center in the study period, and 6638 met eligibility criteria. 4926 patients were included in the initial analysis. 997 had an early pregnancy loss. At or after 45–49 days GA IVF, 100% of pregnancies in the ongoing pregnancy group had a yolk sac, embryo and fetal cardiac activity visible on ultrasound. At or after 45 days GA IVF, the sonographic finding of either no embryo or an embryo without cardiac activity had a 100% positive predictive value that the pregnancy would end in early pregnancy loss. These findings were replicated in a further cohort of 875 patients.

Conclusions

IVF dating can be used to accurately diagnose early pregnancy loss at an earlier gestational age than currently used diagnostic criteria, allowing for quicker resolution. Adoption of these new diagnostic criteria would result in an important change in the management of IVF pregnancies.

### Ultrasound assessment of haemoperitoneum in ectopic pregnancy: derivation of a prediction model [^8282ffe6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The combination of transvaginal ultrasound (US) and serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) determination has proven to be reliable for the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy (EP). The goal of early diagnosis is the prevention of tubal rupture, which is the cause of most EP-related deaths, and is a surgical emergency. Accordingly, suspicion of tubal rupture is an absolute contraindication for medical treatment of EP using methotrexate.

Although, the diagnosis of tubal rupture is obvious when patients are haemodynamically unstable, symptoms in most cases of tubal rupture are more subtle. The only diagnostic method to rule out tubal rupture would be to perform a laparoscopy in all cases.

However, considering that most tubal rupture would cause significant haemoperitoneum and that the latter would often correspond to tubal rupture is clinically sound. Evidence for haemoperitoneum is usually found on US examination. Nevertheless, the various US criteria used to quantify the amount of the haemoperitoneum prior to surgery have not been validated yet.

The aim of our study was therefore to identify criterias in the pre operative work-up that could be useful to predict the haemoperitoneum volume, in a homogeneous series of patients operated upon EP.

### Use of the abbott I-STAT® 1 point of care device for hCG quantification in early pregnancy [^fe6e2185]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Women experiencing vaginal bleeding and/or pelvic pain in the first trimester are referred to Early Pregnancy Units (EPUs) for clinical examination and ultrasound assessment to determine pregnancy status. The differential diagnosis may encompass pregnancy of unknown location (PUL), an ongoing or failing intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), ectopic pregnancy, or molar pregnancy.PUL describes a situation where the pregnancy test is positive, but there is no visual pregnancy on transvaginal ultrasound. With trained sonographers using high‐quality ultrasonography, the PUL rate is generally less than 15%.PUL is a provisional diagnosis that will eventually become reclassified as an early IUP (35%–40%), failing pregnancy (44%–69%), or ectopic pregnancy (8%–14%).

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) threshold of 1500 IU/L, above which a high‐quality ultrasound examination, performed by a trained sonographer, should detect an intrauterine pregnancy. This applies to a singleton pregnancy in a woman with a normal body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) and a normal uterus without fibroids. The provenance of hCG thresholds cited in clinical guidelines is unclear. They are likely based on older hCG radioimmunoassays, which are no longer routinely used in diagnostic laboratories and in which hCG concentrations may differ significantly from modern, high‐throughput immunoassays.

Serial hCG monitoring is frequently requested in PUL, as the change in hCG concentrations over a 48‐h period can help to predict a developing ectopic pregnancy. According to clinical practice guidelines, a rise in hCG of greater than 63% within 48 h indicates an ongoing pregnancy, whereas a decline of over 50% suggests a failing pregnancy. If the change falls between these thresholds, women are classified as being at higher risk for ectopic pregnancy and require prompt medical review. Logistic regression models can further classify PUL cases as low or high risk based on the hCG ratio between 0 and 48 h.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^9e63c9a8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Early pregnancy evaluation in the emergency department (ED) — Mateer et al prospective observational study evaluated bedside transvaginal ultrasound by emergency physicians and reported ectopic pregnancy risk among patients with indeterminate scans by beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level. A convenience sample of stable patients > 18 y of age presenting to the ED with abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, orthostasis, adnexal tenderness, and/or risk factors for ectopic pregnancy was included, excluding patients beyond 16 weeks of gestation. Ultrasound criteria specified definite intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) as gestational sac plus yolk sac or fetal pole or double decidual sign plus thick concentric echogenic ring; ectopic pregnancy required extrauterine gestational sac with yolk sac or fetal pole; and "no definite IUP" was none of the above; final diagnosis was determined by clinic follow-up records, surgical records, pathology report, subsequent ultrasound, or labor and delivery records. Among 95 patients with indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound ("no definite IUP"), rates of ectopic pregnancy by β-hCG level were 16/28 (57%) with β-hCG level > 2,000 mIU/mL and 19/67 (28%) with β-hCG level < 2,000 mIU/mL; in the "no definite IUP" subgroup diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy, 18 (51%) had an abnormal adnexal mass or free fluid.

Asymptomatic adnexal masses are commonly encountered in daily radiology practice. Although the vast majority of these masses are benign, a small subset have a risk of malignancy, which require gynecologic oncology referral for best treatment outcomes. Ultrasound, using a combination of both transabdominal, transvaginal, and duplex Doppler technique can accurately characterize the majority of these lesions. MRI with and without contrast is a useful complementary modality that can help characterize indeterminate lesions and assess the risk of malignancy is those that are suspicious. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Novel ultrasound classification of tubal ectopic pregnancy: exploring underlying connections among sonographic and serum markers [^511c5673]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ectopic pregnancy (EP) accounts for approximately 2% of all pregnancies, and 18% of patients who visit the emergency department with early-pregnancy-related abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding are diagnosed with EP. Among these, tubal ectopic pregnancy (TEP) is the most common type. Management of TEP involves medical, surgical, or expectant approaches, with decisions depending on comprehensive clinical information.

Current guidelines incorporate adnexal mass size and β-hCG levels into treatment algorithms, but recommendations differ. The 2023 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline advised surgery as first-line management for any TEP with an adnexal mass ≥ 3.5 cm, irrespective of β-hCG level. In contrast, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists considers a mass > 4 cm a relative, rather than absolute, contraindication to methotrexate therapy, without specifying absolute β-hCG cutoff values. This variability underscores the clinical challenge posed by discordant mass sizes and β-hCG levels, which often arise because TEPs present diverse sonographic appearances. The absence of a unified ultrasound classification further hinders the integration of sonographic findings with biochemical markers. Categorizing these ultrasound patterns offers a potential solution to address this discrepancy and guide more precise management of this condition.

Therefore, in this study, a novel morphology-based ultrasound classification is proposed to address these gaps. Using this new classification, we aim to further analyze the relationships among serum markers and sonographic indices, which may provide new insights into the individualized management of TEP.

### Common questions about the evaluation of acute pelvic pain [^51cf553a]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute pelvic pain is defined as lower abdominal or pelvic pain of less than three months' duration. It is a common presentation in primary care. Evaluation can be challenging because of a broad differential diagnosis and because many associated signs and symptoms are nonspecific. The most common diagnoses in reproductive-aged women with acute pelvic pain are idiopathic pelvic pain, pelvic inflammatory disease, acute appendicitis, ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy, and endometriosis. Among postmenopausal women, cancer must be considered. Findings from the history and physical examination can point to likely diagnoses, and laboratory testing and imaging can help confirm. Women of reproductive age should take a pregnancy test. In early pregnancy, transvaginal ultrasonography and beta human chorionic gonadotropin levels can help identify ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion. For nonpregnant women, ultrasonography or computed tomography is indicated, depending on the possible diagnosis (e.g., ultrasonography is preferred when ovarian pathology is suspected). If ultrasonography results are nondiagnostic, magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in pregnant women when acute appendicitis is suspected. If magnetic resonance imaging is unavailable, computed tomography may be indicated.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 193: tubal ectopic pregnancy [^013ffd93]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy that occurs outside of the uterine cavity. The most common site of ectopic pregnancy is the fallopian tube. Most cases of tubal ectopic pregnancy that are detected early can be treated successfully either with minimally invasive surgery or with medical management using methotrexate. However, tubal ectopic pregnancy in an unstable patient is a medical emergency that requires prompt surgical intervention. The purpose of this document is to review information on the current understanding of tubal ectopic pregnancy and to provide guidelines for timely diagnosis and management that are consistent with the best available scientific evidence.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: management of undesired pregnancy of unknown location and abortion at less than 42 days of gestation [^c21939b1]. Contraception (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy of unknown location is a condition in which a pregnancy test is positive, but no intrauterine or extrauterine pregnancy is visualized using transvaginal ultrasonography. We recommend using standardized nomenclature and definitions to describe intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), probable IUP, pregnancy of unknown location (PUL), probable ectopic pregnancy (probable EP), and ectopic pregnancy (EP) (Best Practice). Among abortion-seeking patients found to have a PUL, the incidence of EP is 4% to 8%. We recommend clinical judgment in assessing the risk for EP in the setting of PUL; the absence of an intrauterine gestational sac (GS) or yolk sac should not delay care (GRADE 1B). In asymptomatic individuals with an undesired PUL who prefer to proceed with immediate treatment (medication or procedural management without delay) and have a low risk of EP, as determined by the clinician based on history, symptoms, and all other available data, we recommend medication management with mifepristone and misoprostol or procedural management via uterine aspiration and clear plans for ensuring pregnancy resolution in a timely fashion (GRADE 1B). While both medication and procedural management of undesired PUL are associated with earlier pregnancy resolution and identification of EP, the two main risks of inadequate follow-up include ongoing pregnancy and missing or delaying a subsequent diagnosis of EP. For individuals with PUL choosing immediate treatment with medication management, we recommend clinicians obtain a baseline serum quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at the time of medication provision to aid in diagnosis and follow-up (GRADE 1A). Following medication management of PUL with mifepristone and misoprostol, we suggest a repeat serum quantitative hCG level, with pregnancy resolution defined as either a 50% decline or greater at 48 to 72 hours after misoprostol or an 80% decline or greater at 7 days after mifepristone or 5 to 10 days after misoprostol (GRADE 2B). We recommend against direct extrapolation of follow-up recommendations from no-test abortion clinical protocols to individuals with a documented PUL treated with mifepristone and misoprostol, given the higher risk of EP among individuals with a known PUL (GRADE 1C). When uterine aspiration is performed at less than 42 days of gestation, including for individuals with PUL or probable IUP, and both chorionic villi and GS are not visualized, we recommend repeat ultrasonography (if an IUP or probable IUP was seen initially), serum quantitative hCG follow-up, or both (GRADE 1B). When both chorionic villi and GS are not visualized after uterine aspiration and serial serum hCG follow-up is warranted, we recommend testing on the day of the procedure and 24 to 72 hours later, with pregnancy resolution defined as greater than 50% decline 24 hours after aspiration, greater than 70% by 48 hours, or greater than 80% by approximately 72 hours (GRADE 1B).

Tubal ectopic pregnancy — Implantation in the fallopian tube distal to the interstitial segment accounts for the majority of EPs (84%–93%). The most frequent observation is an adnexal mass of variable echogenicity and vascularity, separate from the ovary, for which the term extraovarian mass is used; adnexal mass is an alternate term favored when the ovary is not visualized. The second most common observation is a tubal ring, a round or oval fluid collection with a hyperechoic rim representing the gestational sac in the adnexa.

### Ectopic pregnancy: diagnosis and management… [^c2cc7d01]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Making the Diagnosis SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Ectopic pregnancy should be considered in any pregnant patient with vaginal bleeding or lower abdominal pain when intrauterine pregnancy has not yet been established. 10 Vaginal bleeding in women with ectopic pregnancy is due to the sloughing of decidual endometrium and can range from spotting to menstruation-equivalent levels. 10 This endometrial decidual reaction occurs even with ectopic implantation, and the passage of a decidual cast may mimic the passage of pregnancy tissue. Thus, a history of bleeding and passage of tissue cannot be relied on to differentiate ectopic pregnancy from early intrauterine pregnancy failure. The nature, location, and severity of pain in ectopic pregnancy vary. It often begins as a colicky abdominal or pelvic pain that is localized to one side as the pregnancy distends the fallopian tube. The pain may become more generalized once the tube ruptures and hemoperitoneum develops.

Other potential symptoms include presyncope, syncope, vomiting, diarrhea, shoulder pain, lower urinary tract symptoms, rectal pressure, or pain with defecation. 11 The physical examination can reveal signs of hemodynamic instability in women with ruptured ectopic pregnancy and hemoperitoneum. 12 Patients with unruptured ectopic pregnancy often have cervical motion or adnexal tenderness. 13 Sometimes the ectopic pregnancy itself can be palpated as a painful mass lateral to the uterus. There is no evidence that palpation during the pelvic examination leads to an increased risk of rupture.
10. 15 A slower-than-expected rate of increase or a decrease in β-hCG levels suggests early pregnancy loss or ectopic pregnancy. The rate of increase slows as pregnancy progresses and typically plateaus around 100, 000 mIU per mL at 10 weeks' gestation.

16 A decrease in β-hCG of at least 21% over 48 hours suggests a likely failed intrauterine pregnancy, whereas a smaller decrease should raise concern for ectopic pregnancy.
17. TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASONOGRAPHY Intrauterine pregnancy visualized on transvaginal ultrasonography essentially rules out ectopic pregnancy except in the exceedingly rare case of heterotopic pregnancy. 5 The definitive diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy can be made with ultrasonography when a yolk sac and/or embryo is seen in the adnexa; however, ultrasonography alone is rarely used to diagnose ectopic pregnancy because most do not progress to this stage. 5 More often, the patient history is combined with serial quantitative β-hCG levels, sequential ultrasonography, and, at times, uterine aspiration to arrive at a final diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.

PREGNANCY OF UNKNOWN LOCATION Ultrasonography showing neither intrauterine nor ectopic pregnancy in a patient with a positive pregnancy test is referred to as a pregnancy of unknown location. In a desired pregnancy, β-hCG levels and serial ultrasonography combined with patient reports of pain or bleeding guide management. 5, 15–17, 21 If chorionic villi are not seen after uterine aspiration, it is imperative to initiate treatment for ectopic pregnancy or repeat β-hCG measurement in 24 hours to ensure at least a 50% decrease. Ectopic precautions and serial β-hCG levels should be continued until the level is undetectable. Management of Ectopic Pregnancy It is appropriate for family physicians to treat hemodynamically stable patients in conjunction with their primary obstetrician. Patients with suspected or confirmed ectopic pregnancy who exhibit signs and symptoms of ruptured ectopic pregnancy should be emergently transferred for surgical intervention.

### Accuracy of single progesterone test to predict early pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding: meta-analysis of cohort studies [^322a241a]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are the most common causes of consultation in early pregnancy; 30% of women will experience pain or bleeding in their first trimester. These symptoms lead to anxiety and can be the first signs of a possible miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. Miscarriage occurs in 10–20% of all recognised pregnancies, and the prevalence of ectopic pregnancies in the United Kingdom is 1.6%, which is raised to 3% in women with symptoms. Most women seeking medical advice have a transvaginal ultrasound scan to confirm a viable pregnancy, a miscarriage, or an ectopic pregnancy. However, even with expert use of transvaginal ultrasound, confirming if a pregnancy is intrauterine or extrauterine may not be possible in 8–31% of cases at the first visit. An observational study of pregnancies with inconclusive ultrasound results has shown that 50% spontaneously resolve (decreasing concentrations of β human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG)), 27% are subsequently diagnosed as viable, and 14% are diagnosed as ectopic pregnancies. The high incidence of miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies in women with inconclusive ultrasound results warrants further tests to reach a diagnosis. Measurement of serum β-hCG can be useful, but often more than one β-hCG measurements is needed to make a diagnosis.

Serum progesterone has been proposed as a useful test to distinguish a viable pregnancy from a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Low progesterone values are associated with miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies, both considered non-viable pregnancies, and high progesterone concentrations with viable pregnancies. Knowledge about the diagnostic accuracy of a single serum progesterone measurement to determine the viability of the pregnancy may accelerate diagnosis, avoiding further tests and unnecessary interventions, and improve outcomes. National recommendations refrain from defining how this test should be used in diagnostic algorithms. The reason for this is that clinical practice is informed by individual small studies with unstable inferences and conflicting results on the accuracy of a single serum progesterone measurement in determining the viability of the pregnancy. A meta-analysis in 1998 did not take into account the recent widespread use of transvaginal ultrasound, which may improve the accuracy of this test. The aim of our review was to evaluate the accuracy of a single progesterone measurement, by a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies, to predict pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding in early pregnancy with or without an inconclusive ultrasound diagnosis.

### Adnexal masses: diagnosis and management [^993bce9d]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Pelvic masses occur in up to 20% of women throughout their lifetime. These masses represent a spectrum of gynecologic and nongynecologic conditions. Adnexal masses-found in the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and surrounding areas-are mostly benign. Evaluation includes assessment for symptoms that may suggest malignancy, such as abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, and early satiety. A family history of ovarian, breast, or certain heritable syndromes increases the risk of malignancy. For women of reproductive age, ectopic pregnancies must be considered; a beta human chorionic gonadotropin level should be obtained. Transvaginal ultrasonography is the imaging test of choice for evaluating adnexal masses for size and complexity. Adnexal cysts that are greater than 10 cm, contain solid components, or have high color flow on Doppler ultrasonography are high risk for malignancy. Further imaging, if warranted, should be completed with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, particularly if there is concern for disease outside the ovary. Multimodal assessment tools that use ultrasonography and biomarkers, such as the risk of malignancy index, are useful in the diagnosis and exclusion of malignant causes. Asymptomatic masses that are determined to be benign may be observed and managed expectantly. In symptomatic or emergent cases, such as ectopic pregnancy or ovarian torsion, a gynecologist should be consulted. In any adnexal mass with high risk for malignancy, a consultation with gynecologic oncology is indicated.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^28eea8fa]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Early pregnancy emergency department evaluation — Barnhart et al prospective observational study evaluated a β-hCG–guided diagnostic algorithm and its outcomes. Pregnant patients with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding were included, while those with hemodynamic instability, peritonitis, an open os suggestive of incomplete abortion, or a recent termination of pregnancy were excluded. The algorithm specified that patients with β-hCG level > 1,500 mIU/mL had transvaginal ultrasound; if no intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) was seen, laparoscopy or uterine curettage was performed, whereas patients with β-hCG level < 1,500 mIU/mL did not have transvaginal ultrasound and were discharged with 48-h follow-up. Final diagnoses were categorized as normal IUP, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, or lost to follow-up. The discriminatory zone, based on 68 consecutive transvaginal ultrasounds, was established to be 1,500–2,000 mIU/mL; 167 stable patients received a final diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Of these, 69 (41%) had a β-hCG level < 1,500 mIU/mL with ultrasound deferred, and in this group the mean time to diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was 5.2 days. Transvaginal ultrasounds were performed by radiologists, and 5 of 85 patients not initially receiving a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy had evidence of rupture at the time of diagnosis at follow-up; it was not reported whether these patients had ultrasound deferred because of an initial β-hCG level < 1,500 mIU/mL.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaFirst trimester vaginal bleeding [^66ddf2ad]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is not uncommon in the first trimester of pregnancy. The majority of such patients will have a normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), a nonviable IUP, or an ectopic pregnancy. Ultrasound (US) is the primary imaging modality in evaluation of these patients. US, along with clinical observations and serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels, can usually distinguish these causes. Although it is important to diagnose ectopic pregnancies and nonviable IUPs, one should also guard against injury to normal pregnancies due to inappropriate treatment with methotrexate or surgical intervention. Less common causes of first trimester vaginal bleeding include gestational trophoblastic disease and arteriovenous malformations. Pulsed methods of Doppler US should generally be avoided in the first trimester when there is a normal, or a potentially normal, IUP. Once a normal IUP has been excluded, Doppler US may be useful when other diagnoses such as retained products of conception or arteriovenous malformations are suspected. MRI may occasionally be helpful as a problem-solving tool. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^17735829]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome — ultrasound assessment and PCOM thresholds in adults and adolescents specify that follicle number per ovary (FNPO) ≥ 20 in at least one ovary should be considered the threshold for PCOM in adults, and when older technology or limited image quality is used, ovarian volume (OV) ≥ 10 mL or follicle number per section (FNPS) ≥ 10 in at least one ovary in adults should be considered the threshold. There are no definitive criteria to define polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound in adolescents, hence it is not recommended in adolescents. When an ultrasound is indicated, if acceptable to the individual, the transvaginal approach is the most accurate for the diagnosis of PCOM, while transabdominal ultrasound should primarily report OV with a threshold of ≥ 10 mL or FNPS ≥ 10 in either ovary in adults. In patients with irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, an ovarian ultrasound is not necessary for PCOS diagnosis. Thresholds for PCOM should be revised regularly with advancing ultrasound technology, and age-specific cut-off values for PCOM should be defined. Training and standardized protocols are recommended for PCOM reporting on ultrasound, including at a minimum documentation of the last menstrual period or stage of cycle, transducer bandwidth frequency, approach/route, total number per 2–9 mm follicles per ovary, measurements in three dimensions (in cm) or volume of each ovary, other ovarian features and/or pathology including dominant follicles (≥ 10 mm) which should not be included in ovarian volume calculations, reliance on the contralateral ovary FNPO where a dominant follicle is noted, and uterine features including endometrial thickness and pattern.

Retrospective study of 89 patients operated upon EP between January 1999 and March 2003 in a French Gynaecology and Obstetrics department in a university hospital. Transvaginal sonograms, clinical and biological variables from patients with haemoperitoneum ≥ 300 mL at surgery were compared with those from patients with haemoperitoneum < 300 mL or no haemoperitoneum. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated for each parameter after appropriate dichotomization. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to select the best combination at predicting haemoperitoneum ≥ 300 ml.

Results

Three parameters predicted haemoperitoneum ≥ 300 mL independently: moderate to severe spontaneous pelvic pain, fluid above the uterine fundus or around the ovary at transvaginal ultrasound, and serum haemoglobin concentration < 10 g/dL. A woman with none of these three criteria would have a probability of 5.3% for haemoperitoneum ≥ 300 ml. When two or more criterias were present, the probability for haemoperitoneum ≥ 300 mL reached 92.6%.

Conclusion

The proposed model accurately predicted significant haemoperitoneum in patients diagnosed to have EP.

### Nontubal ectopic pregnancies: overview of diagnosis and treatment [^b82ac6d6]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Nontubal ectopic pregnancies occur as a result of embryo implantation outside the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes. Sites include ovary, cervix, abdominal cavity, interstitial portion of fallopian tube, and cesarean scar. Nontubal pregnancies are uncommon. Nonspecific signs and symptoms of nontubal ectopic pregnancies make diagnosis challenging and, in many cases, significantly delayed, resulting in a high rate of morbidity. Although surgical management remains the mainstay of treatment, there is growing evidence that some of these can be managed medically or with the use of a combination of medical and surgical approaches with good outcome. This review summarizes the current diagnostic modalities, therapeutic options, and outcomes for nontubal ectopic pregnancies. Diagnostic and management options may be limited, especially in resource-restricted settings. Therefore, an understanding of the available options is critical. It needs to be emphasized that the rarity of cases and the difficulties in organizing ethically justified randomized trials result in the lack of well-established management guidelines for nontubal ectopic pregnancies.

### ESR essentials: gynaecological causes of acute pelvic pain in women: a primer for emergent evaluation-practice recommendations by the European society of emergency radiology [^3e1ef21e]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pelvic pain (APP) is a common presentation in women of all ages and has both gynaecological and non-gynaecological causes. In the emergency department, the suspected differential diagnosis dictates the chosen imaging modality. For premenopausal patients with APP, transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) are first-line investigations with high sensitivity and specificity for ectopic pregnancy, adnexal torsion, and ovarian cysts and their complications. US may also be valuable in pelvic inflammatory disease. When a non-gynaecological cause is suspected, contrast-enhanced CT (± transabdominal US) is indicated and has the advantage of 24/7 availability and lack of operator dependence. CT, however, may reveal an unexpected gynaecological cause of APP. When available, MRI is an excellent second test to improve diagnostic certainty in pregnant women when US is inconclusive-both for gynaecological and non-gynaecological conditions. MRI has a high diagnostic accuracy for pelvic inflammatory disease and tubo-ovarian abscesses. This article will enable readers to refresh their knowledge of common causes of APP and understand the histopathological processes involved in gynaecological causes of APP and how the imaging findings correlate. It will outline why different modalities are useful in different pathologies and help understand the limitations of each modality, including the requirement for operator expertise (US), relative lack of specificity/sensitivity (CT), and limited availability (MRI). This article excludes pregnancy-related causes of APP (apart from ectopic pregnancy) and also excludes non-gynaecological causes of APP. KEY POINTS: In female patients with acute pelvic pain, ultrasound is the best first modality in suspected gynaecological pathology. CT can be used when non-gynaecological causes of pain are suspected and when US is inconclusive. MRI has limited availability in an emergency setting and may be used in pelvic inflammatory disease and in pregnancy when US is inconclusive.

Abstract

Acute pelvic pain (APP) is a common presentation in women of all ages and has both gynaecological and non-gynaecological causes. In the emergency department, the suspected differential diagnosis dictates the chosen imaging modality. For premenopausal patients with APP, transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) are first-line investigations with high sensitivity and specificity for ectopic pregnancy, adnexal torsion, and ovarian cysts and their complications. US may also be valuable in pelvic inflammatory disease. When a non-gynaecological cause is suspected, contrast-enhanced CT (± transabdominal US) is indicated and has the advantage of 24/7 availability and lack of operator dependence. CT, however, may reveal an unexpected gynaecological cause of APP. When available, MRI is an excellent second test to improve diagnostic certainty in pregnant women when US is inconclusive — both for gynaecological and non-gynaecological conditions. MRI has a high diagnostic accuracy for pelvic inflammatory disease and tubo-ovarian abscesses. This article will enable readers to refresh their knowledge of common causes of APP and understand the histopathological processes involved in gynaecological causes of APP and how the imaging findings correlate. It will outline why different modalities are useful in different pathologies and help understand the limitations of each modality, including the requirement for operator expertise (US), relative lack of specificity/sensitivity (CT), and limited availability (MRI). This article excludes pregnancy-related causes of APP (apart from ectopic pregnancy) and also excludes non-gynaecological causes of APP.

Key Points

In female patients with acute pelvic pain, ultrasound is the best first modality in suspected gynaecological pathology.
CT can be used when non-gynaecological causes of pain are suspected and when US is inconclusive.
MRI has limited availability in an emergency setting and may be used in pelvic inflammatory disease and in pregnancy when US is inconclusive.

### A lexicon for first-trimester US: society of radiologists in ultrasound consensus conference recommendations [^b9054b4c]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

First-trimester ultrasound terminology for ectopic and heterotopic pregnancy — The terms "live", "living", and "viable" should be avoided when describing cardiac activity in an ectopic pregnancy (EP). Heterotopic pregnancy describes coexistence of an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) and an EP and, while extremely rare, occurs with increased frequency in patients undergoing infertility treatment.

Methods

Study setting and design

This study was designed as a Retrospective Observational study based at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH). Study population was all women admitted to AKUH with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy that was surgically managed between the period of January 1st 2011 to December 31st 2020. Data was collected from clinical records during admission at AKUH. All patients were subjected to a full history taking and physical examination and laboratory tests including complete blood count, qualitative or quantitative Beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), transvaginal and/or transabdominal ultrasound with determination of adnexal mass if present and presence and quantification of intraperitoneal haemorrhage. This was as per the management protocols at AKUH.

### Ectopic pregnancy: a resident's guide to imaging findings and diagnostic pitfalls [^3d9cf69f]. Emergency Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is a term used to describe any pregnancy which does not implant into the uterine cavity. There are several types of EPs: tubal, interstitial, ovarian, abdominal, heterotopic, cervical, and cesarean scar. Ectopic pregnancies can acutely rupture and are the number one cause of maternal death in the first trimester of pregnancy. Therefore, prompt recognition and accurate localization have significant clinical implications on patient outcome. Unfortunately, EPs have many mimickers, which can make the diagnosis challenging in certain cases. In this review, we aim to describe and illustrate sonographic findings of each type of EP, as well as present mimickers and various imaging pitfalls. We will clarify how to avoid potential misdiagnoses that could adversely affect patient outcomes. Lastly, we will briefly address management of each type of EP and discuss potential complications.

### Nonsurgical management of primary ovarian pregnancy with transvaginal ultrasound-guided local administration of methotrexate [^b2942453]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary ovarian pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic gestation and one that is often diagnosed only at the time of surgery. We report the first case to our knowledge of a live primary ovarian pregnancy diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasonography and successfully treated with transvaginal-guided aspiration and injection of methotrexate. Primary ovarian pregnancy can be diagnosed early in gestation with transvaginal sonography, affording the opportunity to successfully be managed with local administration of methotrexate.

### A lexicon for first-trimester US: society of radiologists in ultrasound consensus conference recommendations [^f73e793a]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

First-trimester ultrasound lexicon — cervical ectopic pregnancy (EP) considerations include that a pregnancy implanting in the cervix can mimic a cervical EP and a passing pregnancy; diagnostic criteria to differentiate cesarean scar EP from a cervical EP and a passing gestational sac (GS) are available in the medical literature. The term "cervical pregnancy" should be avoided.
