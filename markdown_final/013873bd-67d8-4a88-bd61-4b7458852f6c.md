## Question

renoprotective effects of sglt2 inhibitors

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, including mechanisms, clinical evidence, patient selection, safety, and practice implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental mechanism of action and the primary hemodynamic hypothesis. Then, I should verify the clinical trial hierarchy and extract outcome data across key studies. Next, I will examine benefits in diabetic versus non-diabetic CKD and stratification by eGFR and albuminuria. After that, I should review safety signals and practical implementation. Finally, I will integrate mechanisms and align with contemporary guideline recommendations to draw conclusions and note limitations.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism so I don't jump to conclusions. SGLT2 inhibition blocks proximal tubular glucose and sodium reabsorption, causing glycosuria and natriuresis; increased sodium delivery to the macula densa triggers tubuloglomerular feedback and afferent arteriolar constriction, reducing intraglomerular pressure and correcting diabetic hyperfiltration, which is the central hemodynamic mechanism underpinning renoprotection, independent of glycemic control [^115vdLKq] [^1132wMib].

> Wait, let me verify the hemodynamic signal we expect to see clinically. An initial reversible eGFR dip of about 3–5 mL/min/1.73 m² within 1–4 weeks of initiation reflects reduced intraglomerular pressure and should not prompt stopping therapy; this early decline predicts longer-term kidney protection and is mechanistically coherent with the TGF hypothesis [^116APRys] [^113ifqV2].

> Hold on, I should review additional mechanisms that may explain benefit beyond hemodynamics. Reduced proximal tubular workload and glycolytic stress, improved mitochondrial efficiency via mild ketogenesis, anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic signaling, erythropoiesis with higher hematocrit, and uricosuria all plausibly contribute to slowed CKD progression. These pathways help explain efficacy even when glycemic effects are minimal at low eGFR [^113rasBi] [^1164FbkR] [^1172KRTw] [^114XpE19].

> Next, I should examine the strength of evidence and the trial hierarchy. Early CVOTs (EMPA-REG, CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58) showed consistent signals for renal composites, but the first dedicated renal trial, CREDENCE, demonstrated a 30% relative risk reduction in the primary composite of ESKD, doubling of creatinine, or renal/CV death with canagliflozin, confirming class benefit in diabetic CKD with albuminuria on background RAS blockade [^116eT7i9] [^11682JDh].

> I need to check whether benefits extend to non-diabetic CKD. DAPA-CKD showed a 39% reduction in the composite kidney outcome with dapagliflozin, with similar effects in participants with and without diabetes, establishing a class effect across albuminuric CKD; EMPA-KIDNEY later confirmed a 28% reduction in kidney disease progression with empagliflozin across diverse CKD etiologies, including non-diabetic disease, solidifying the indication beyond T2D [^113qnwvm] [^111jFD2C].

> Let me consider whether effects vary by kidney function and albuminuria, because I don't want to overgeneralize. Meta-analyses and the SMART-C consortium show consistent reductions in CKD progression across eGFR strata down to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and across albuminuria categories, with absolute benefits greatest at higher albuminuria; notably, benefits persist even with minimal albuminuria, supporting broad applicability [^112Bdena] [^112nwVEQ].

> I should double-check safety and monitoring so we don't miss practical pitfalls. SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with increased genital mycotic infections and a small increase in euglycemic ketoacidosis risk; rare amputation and fracture signals were observed with canagliflozin in CANVAS but not consistently across the class, and large renal trials did not reproduce the amputation signal; an initial reversible eGFR dip is expected, and AKI risk is not increased and may be reduced, but clinicians should mitigate volume depletion and pause therapy around major illness or surgery [^1161MHDV] [^112a9K3P] [^116APRys].

> But wait, what about real-world confirmation and comparative effectiveness. Observational data and comparative analyses suggest SGLT2 inhibitors slow eGFR decline by roughly 1 mL/min/1.73 m²/year versus other glucose-lowering drugs and outperform GLP-1 receptor agonists for kidney function preservation in CKD, reinforcing trial signals in everyday practice [^111NuxpB].

> I need to ensure our practice implications align with guidelines. Contemporary standards recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with T2D and CKD with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² to slow CKD progression and reduce heart failure events, independent of glycemic targets. For non-diabetic CKD, KDIGO and related guidance endorse SGLT2 inhibitors in albuminuric CKD given consistent benefits, and emphasize integration with RAS blockade for additive renoprotection [^112TtxQw] [^116APRys].

> Let me reconsider mechanisms one more time to ensure coherence. The convergent data support a model in which natriuresis-driven restoration of tubuloglomerular feedback lowers intraglomerular pressure, albuminuria declines promptly, tubular energetics improve with mild ketogenesis, inflammation and fibrosis are attenuated, and neurohumoral remodeling occurs, collectively slowing GFR loss and reducing hard renal endpoints. Glycemia-independent mediation is supported by analyses showing benefits despite minimal HbA1c change in CKD [^113rasBi] [^111sixdr].

> Limitations and uncertainties should be acknowledged. Evidence is strongest in albuminuric CKD. Effects in advanced non-albuminuric CKD, including certain glomerulopathies and hereditary nephropathies, are less certain, and mechanistic constraints may limit benefit where hyperfiltration is not the dominant driver. Ongoing trials and subgroup analyses will refine patient selection and expected effect sizes in these phenotypes [^1111Mq5z] [^111jFD2C].

> In summary, I should confirm the core clinical message. SGLT2 inhibitors provide robust, class-wide renoprotection across diabetic and non-diabetic CKD, with benefits evident from preserved eGFR down to advanced CKD and across albuminuria strata. Mechanistically, hemodynamic correction of hyperfiltration is primary, supplemented by metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects. Implementation should anticipate an early eGFR dip, integrate with RAS blockade, monitor volume status and ketoacidosis risk, and prioritize patients with albuminuria and declining GFR for maximal absolute benefit [^112Bdena] [^112nwVEQ] [^116APRys].

SGLT2 inhibitors provide **renoprotection** by reducing intraglomerular pressure via tubuloglomerular feedback [^115vdLKq], lowering albuminuria [^112qQcLt], and slowing eGFR decline [^112Bdena]. They also reduce **intrarenal inflammation** [^1132wMib], oxidative stress [^113rasBi], and fibrosis, and lower blood pressure and uric acid [^116zKeuZ], with benefits independent of glycemic control [^111sixdr]. Clinically, they reduce the risk of CKD progression, ESKD, and renal death [^111jFD2C] across diabetic and non-diabetic CKD [^112Bdena], with the strongest effects in patients with albuminuria and reduced eGFR [^113CdobS].

---

## Mechanisms of renoprotection

### Hemodynamic effects

- **Tubuloglomerular feedback**: SGLT2 inhibition increases distal sodium delivery to the macula densa, triggering afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and reducing intraglomerular pressure, thereby mitigating hyperfiltration and glomerular injury [^115vdLKq] [^1139Z5Zy].

- **Blood pressure reduction**: Modest BP lowering (≈3–5 mmHg) from natriuresis and osmotic diuresis reduces renal perfusion pressure and proteinuria [^113ifqV2].

- **Uric acid lowering**: Reduced serum uric acid may lessen intrarenal inflammation and vascular injury [^116zKeuZ].

---

### Non-hemodynamic effects

- **Anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects**: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce renal inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, potentially via suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways [^1132wMib] [^115wSsXx].

- **Metabolic effects**: Increased ketone body availability may improve mitochondrial efficiency and reduce tubular workload, while mTORC1 inhibition may limit podocyte injury and proteinuria [^115QSKY9].

- **Reduction in albuminuria**: Consistent 30–40% reductions in albuminuria [^113ifqV2] indicate structural glomerular benefit [^116C19EC].

## Clinical evidence of renoprotective effects

| **Trial** | **Population** | **Key renal outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| EMPA-REG OUTCOME | T2D with CVD | - 39% ↓ progression/worsening nephropathy <br/> - 46% ↓ renal composite (doubling creatinine, RRT, renal death) [^111jFD2C] |
| CANVAS Program | T2D with CVD risk | - 40% ↓ renal composite (doubling creatinine, RRT, renal death) <br/> - Consistent benefits across eGFR/UACR [^113CdobS] |
| DECLARE-TIMI 58 | T2D with CVD risk | - 47% ↓ renal composite (≥ 40% eGFR decline, ESKD, renal/CV death) <br/> - Benefits in CKD subgroups [^1119Smno] |
| CREDENCE | T2D with CKD and albuminuria | - 30% ↓ primary renal composite (ESKD, doubling creatinine, renal/CV death) <br/> - 34% ↓ renal-specific composite [^113dK1fT] |
| DAPA-CKD | CKD with/without T2D | - 39% ↓ primary composite (≥ 50% eGFR decline, ESKD, renal/CV death) <br/> - Similar benefits in non-diabetic CKD [^113qnwvm] |
| EMPA-KIDNEY | CKD with/without T2D | - 28% ↓ CKD progression <br/> - Benefits independent of diabetes [^111jFD2C] |

---

## Patient populations benefiting from SGLT2 inhibitors

- **Diabetic kidney disease**: Consistent benefits across eGFR and albuminuria strata, including advanced CKD [^112Bdena].

- **Non-diabetic CKD**: DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY show benefits irrespective of diabetes, supporting class effects in CKD [^111jFD2C].

- **High-risk phenotypes**: Greater absolute benefits in patients with albuminuria and reduced eGFR [^113CdobS].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Acute kidney injury**: No excess AKI risk; may reduce AKI events [^1161MHDV] [^115SB6bf].

- **Genital infections**: Increased risk manageable with hygiene and education [^112qQcLt].

- **Euglycemic ketoacidosis**: Rare; monitor in high-risk patients [^115fmAvN].

- **Volume depletion**: Caution in elderly or diuretic users; monitor electrolytes and volume status [^113ifqV2].

---

## Limitations and ongoing research

Limited data exist for **eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m²** and dialysis; trials in these populations are ongoing [^112V9Nbi]. The relative contributions of hemodynamic versus metabolic mechanisms remain under investigation [^115vdLKq]. Long-term effects on **ESKD, dialysis, and transplantation** require continued follow-up [^112V9Nbi].

---

SGLT2 inhibitors confer **renoprotection** through hemodynamic and non-hemodynamic mechanisms, reducing CKD progression, ESKD, and renal death across diabetic and non-diabetic CKD, with the most pronounced benefits in patients with albuminuria and reduced eGFR [^113rasBi].

### SGLT2 inhibitors' interaction with other renoactive drugs in type 2 diabetes patients: still a lot to learn [^111FvbiT]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

The first cardiovascular (CV) safety trial conducted with a sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitor, Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), reported not only remarkable risk reductions in CV outcome, but also impressive improvements in renal outcome. Changes in renal hemodynamics could be involved in the benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal outcomes. Considering that all patients of EMPA-REG OUTCOME had established atherosclerotic CV disease at baseline, many patients were also treated with several CV drugs at baseline, including RAS blockers, diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These drugs also impact renal physiology and possibly renal outcome, which could cause relevant drug-drug interactions. This topic is addressed in this issue of Kidney International by Mayer and colleagues. In their manuscript, the impact of empagliflozin on kidney function, renal outcome, and renal safety is presented with stratification for background therapy. Although the beneficial effects of empagliflozin and its safety profile are consistent among all groups, we wonder, do we really understand the renal effects of all these drugs in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients as studied in the large outcome trials?

### Renohemodynamic effects of combined empagliflOzin and losARtan (RECOLAR) [^115CYQMF]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

The study was terminated early due to overwhelming beneficial effects. Yet, at this point in time, the renoprotective mechanisms involved with SGLT2 inhibition still remain speculative, though a consistent finding is that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce estimated GFR after first dosing, which is reversible after treatment cessation. This "dip" indicates a renal hemodynamic phenomenon reminiscent of the RAS blockers and is thought to reflect a reduction in intraglomerular pressure. In short, reduced sodium reabsorption at the level of the proximal tubule leads to increased sodium chloride delivery at the downstream located macula densa, which in turn increases afferent arteriolar resistance and reduces glomerular filtration and hydrostatic pressure. In the recent RED trial the investigators assessed whether this is also true in T2DM patients.

Suprisingly, this study showed that the renohemodynamic actions of SGLT2 inhibition in T2DM are not due to afferent vasoconstriction but rather efferent vasodilation. This is also the proposed working mechanism of inhibitors of the RAS system in T2DM, although dedicated studies in humans are scarcely done. Indeed, people with T2DM that do not respond to RAS blockers in terms of albuminuria reduction, also do not respond to SGLT2 inhibitor treatment. In conclusion: Despite multifactorial treatment approaches, residual risk for the development and progression of DKD remains high, and novel therapies or strategies to halt renal burden in T2DM are urgently needed. SGLT2 inhibitors and RAS inhibitors both induce glucose-independent renoprotective effects and improve renal outcome, seemingly via an at least partly equal mechanism, the dilation of the efferent glomerular arteriole resulting in an eGFR dip.

The use of combination therapy with these agents could lead to an additive or even synergistic renoprotective effect in T2DM. As such, combined use of an SGLT2 inhibitor and RAS inhibitor may enhance individual benefits. Drug: Empagliflozin 10 MG Drug: Losartan 50Mg Tab Other: Placebo

### Why Do SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of renal glucose reabsorption in humans? [^112y7HAX]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin is the most advanced SGLT2 inhibitor in clinical trials. In addition, multiple other SGLT2 inhibitors are in phase II to III trials (Fig. 1). However, none of these SGLT2 inhibitors are able to inhibit > 30–50% of the filtered glucose load, despite in vitro studies indicate that 100% inhibition of the SGLT2 transporter should be achieved at the drug concentrations in humans. In this perspective, we shall examine potential explanations for this apparent paradox. Resolution of the paradox has important clinical implications with regard to the efficacy of this class of drugs and the development of more efficacious SGLT2 inhibitors.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^116APRys]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Clinical utility of SGLT2 inhibitors — early eGFR changes, glycemia-related adjustments, and salutary effects are described. SGLT2 inhibitor initiation is associated with a reversible decline in eGFR of 3–5 mL/min/1.73 m² in the first 4 weeks of therapy, after which GFR typically stabilizes during ongoing SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. Because SGLT2 inhibitor therapy reduces blood glucose in persons with preserved eGFR, reduction of insulin or insulin secretagogues may be needed to avoid hypoglycemia in those with eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73 m². These agents reduce risk of hyperkalemia, without causing hypokalemia, and mitigate fluid retention, and therefore SGLT2 inhibitors can facilitate initiation and persistent use of other guideline-directed medical therapies for CKD and heart failure.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: extending the indication to non-diabetic kidney disease? [^113dK1fT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

This year the medical community was pleasantly surprised by the results of the first large outcome trial that primarily examined the renal effects of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin (CANA) in subjects with diabetes and impaired kidney function. The Evaluation of the Effects of Canagliflozin on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Participants With Diabetic Nephropathy (CREDENCE) trial showed that CANA, relative to placebo, reduces the risk for end-stage renal disease, doubling of creatinine or renal death by 34% [hazard ratio 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.53–0.81]. These effects were consistent across baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and haemoglobin A1c subgroups. In this review we combine the results of the CREDENCE trial with those of several cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors and show that, unexpectedly, patients with lower eGFR levels may have greater benefit with respect to cardiovascular outcome than patients with normal kidney function. The cardio- and renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors seem to be independent of their glucose-lowering effects, as shown in several post hoc analyses. In this review we discuss the alleged mechanisms of action that explain the beneficial effects of this novel class of drugs. Moreover, we discuss whether these findings indicate that this class of drugs may also be beneficial in non-diabetic chronic kidney diseases.

### Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition and cardiorenal protection: JACC review topic of the week [^117TrJsM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with the development of cardiovascular and renal complications, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Intensive glycemic control has been a major focus for clinical trials and novel drug development. However, narrow treatment strategies developed strictly for glycemic control did not confer a large risk reduction in cardiovascular events. There were also only modest effects in reducing the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Recent cardiovascular safety trials and the dedicated renal protection trial CREDENCE (Canagliflozin on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Participants with Diabetic Nephropathy) have shown that the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a newer generation of antihyperglycemic agents, improve both cardiovascular and renal outcomes when added to guideline-recommended treatment. This review examines the current evidence on the mechanism underlying the cardiorenal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and summarizes clinical trial evidence and safety data related to the use of SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiovascular and renal protection.

### SGLT2i: beyond the glucose-lowering effect [^112TRHK6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a new type of glucose-lowering drug that can reduce blood glucose by inhibiting its reabsorption in proximal tubules and by promoting urinary glucose excretion. SGLT2i are widely used in the clinical treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In recent studies, SGLT2i were found to not only reduce blood glucose but also protect the heart and kidney, which can significantly reduce cardiovascular events, delay the progression of renal failure, greatly improve the quality of life of patients, and reduce medical expenses for families and society. As adverse cardiac and renal events are the most common and serious complications of T2DM, it is very important to understand the cardio- and renoprotective mechanisms of SGLT2i. This article reviews the historical development, pharmacological mechanism, heart and kidney protection and safety of SGLT2i. The information presented provides a theoretical basis for the clinical prevention and treatment of diabetes and its complications and for the development of new glucose-lowering drugs.

### Role of glycosuria in SGLT2 inhibitor-induced cardiorenal protection: a mechanistic analysis of the CREDENCE trial [^113r71PS]. Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to provide pronounced reductions in cardiorenal outcomes, including cardiovascular death, heart failure, and renal failure. The mechanisms underlying these benefits remain uncertain. We hypothesized that the effects could be attributed to the elevated glycosuria induced by these drugs. Urine concentrations of glucose, creatinine, and ketones were measured at baseline and after 1 year of treatment with either placebo or canagliflozin 100 mg/day, in approximately 2,600 individuals from the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial (enrolling patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and albuminuria). Associations between glycosuria and the primary composite end point from CREDENCE, and secondary outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Canagliflozin treatment increased fractional urinary glucose excretion (± SD) from 3 ± 9% at baseline to 30 ± 26% at year 1 (vs. 5 ± 19% with placebo; P < 0.001). Patients in the canagliflozin arm and in the top quartile of urine glucose to creatinine ratio at year 1 were significantly protected for the primary end point (hazard ratio [HR] 0.42; 95% CI 0.30–0.61); similar results were seen for cases of hospitalized heart failure (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.27–0.73) and all-cause death (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.39–0.80). These associations persisted when adjustments were made for multiple conventional risk factors. Among patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD treated with canagliflozin, individuals with the highest glycosuria levels had the strongest protection against multiple cardiorenal outcomes.

### The renoprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes with or without prevalent kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112qQcLt]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) concerning kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with or without prevalent kidney disease.

Materials and Methods

PubMed, Web of science, Embase and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment with SGLT2is versus placebo in patients with T2DM. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied for continuous variables, and the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% CI were used for dichotomous outcomes. Patients were categorized according to whether the baseline mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was less or was more than 60mL/min/1.73 m².

Results

A total of 25 eligible studies with 43721 participants were included. There was an initial and small decrease in eGFR during the early treatment period (WMD, -4.63; 95% CI, -6.08 to -3.19mL/min/1.73 m²), which was noted at 1–6 weeks and gradually narrowed over time, with a decline in protection from eGFR in the long term (WMD, 3.82; 95% CI, 2.80–4.85mL/min/1.73 m²). SGLT2is significantly delayed albuminuria progression (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.66–0.76), promoted albuminuria regression (RR,1.71; 95% CI, 1.54–1.90), improved the composite of ≥ 40% decrease in eGFR, in the need for renal-replacement and in death from renal causes (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.49–0.66), and reduced all-cause mortality (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.94). At the same time, they significantly increased the risk of genital infection (RR, 3.43; 95% CI, 2.87–4.10) vs placebo in patients with T2DM. Meta-regression analyses showed that eGFR-preservation effects were not significantly associated with basic patient characteristics (age, BMI, HbA1c, eGFR level), but were influenced by drug administration (treatment duration, type, dosage of SGLT2is). Subgroup analyses showed that the relative effects on renal outcomes of SGLT2is vs placebo were similar across eGFR subgroups (P heterogeneity > 0.05).

Conclusions

SGLT2is slowed eGFR decline, lowered albuminuria progression, improved adverse renal endpoints and reduced all-cause mortality, but increased risk of genital infections vs placebo in patients with T2DM. The indication of consistent renal benefits across categories of baseline eGFR levels may allow additional individuals to benefit from SGLT2is therapy.

### Challenges and opportunities in real-world evidence on the renal effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors [^112FG5Zo]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

A substantial advancement in the field has been achieved by the DAPA‐CKD study. The trial enrolled 4304 patients with (67.6%) or without diabetes, with an eGFR between 25 and 75 mL/min/1.73 m² and a urinary albumin/creatinine ratio between 200 and 5000 mg/g, who were randomized to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. As occurred in CREDENCE, the trial was terminated earlier because of manifest efficacy after a median follow‐up of 2.4 years. The primary composite endpoint of sustained decline in eGFR, ESKD or death from renal or cardiovascular causes occurred in 9.4% of patients in the dapagliflozin group versus 14.5% in the placebo group, yielding a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.61 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51‐0.72). The effects of dapagliflozin were similar in patients with or without T2D, showing nominal superiority over placebo in both groups. The DAPA‐CKD trial provides compelling evidence for the efficacy of the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin against the progression of albuminuric CKD. Despite extending the renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors to the nondiabetic population, DAPA‐CKD still has limited generalizability to patients at lower renal risk. Indeed, an outstanding question remains as to whether SGLT2 inhibitors also protect from DKD in patients with T2D and normal albuminuria and/or normal baseline kidney function. Although such primary prevention of DKD is unlikely to be tested in dedicated trials, new results from DECLARE‐TIMI 58 show that the renal‐specific endpoint (a composite ≥ 40% decline in eGFR to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², ESKD, or death from renal causes) was improved even in patients with an albumin excretion rate of less than 15 mg/g or between 15 and < 30 mg/g. Moreover, meta‐analyses suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors have the potential to reduce the rates of adverse renal outcomes even in patients with eGFR greater than 90 mL/min/1.73 m², thus supporting a beneficial role for these drugs across the entire continuum of DKD. In the absence of further evidence from clinical trials and objective limitations in designing trials dealing with all the different CKD/DKD phenotypes, well‐designed observational real‐world studies (RWSs) have the potential to confirm trial findings and extend their results to different populations of patients, including those in primary renal prevention.

### Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes mellitus: cardiovascular and kidney effects, potential mechanisms, and clinical applications [^113ifqV2]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, are now widely approved antihyperglycemic therapies. Because of their unique glycosuric mechanism, SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce weight. Perhaps more important are the osmotic diuretic and natriuretic effects contributing to plasma volume contraction, and decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 4 to 6 and 1 to 2 mmHg, respectively, which may underlie cardiovascular and kidney benefits. SGLT2 inhibition also is associated with an acute, dose-dependent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate by ≈5 mL·min⁻¹·1.73 m⁻² and ≈30% to 40% reduction in albuminuria. These effects mirror preclinical observations suggesting that proximal tubular natriuresis activates renal tubuloglomerular feedback through increased macula densa sodium and chloride delivery, leading to afferent vasoconstriction. On the basis of reduced glomerular filtration, glycosuric and weight loss effects are attenuated in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL·min⁻¹·1.73 m⁻²). In contrast, blood pressure lowering, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuric effects are preserved, and perhaps exaggerated in chronic kidney disease. With regard to long-term clinical outcomes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease randomly assigned to empagliflozin versus placebo reported a 14% reduction in the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and > 30% reductions in cardiovascular mortality, overall mortality, and heart failure hospitalizations associated with empagliflozin, even though, by design, the hemoglobin A1c difference between the randomized groups was marginal. Aside from an increased risk of mycotic genital infections, empagliflozin-treated patients had fewer serious adverse events, including a lower risk of acute kidney injury. In light of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results, some diabetes clinical practice guidelines now recommend that SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit be prioritized in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not achieved glycemic targets and who have prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. With additional cardiorenal protection trials underway, sodium-related physiological effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical correlates of natriuresis, such as the impact on blood pressure, heart failure, kidney protection, and mortality, will be a major management focus.

### Mechanisms of cardiovascular benefits of sodium glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: a state-of-the-art review [^112mqvdL]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

From a List To Synthesis: What Mechanisms Most Likely Explain The Benefits Observed?

A number of clinical trials have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors have impressive beneficial cardiovascular effects in both patients with diabetes and patients who do not have diabetes, but do have heart failure. As a result, SGLT2 inhibitors are a new weapon that can be added to the arsenal of weapons used to treat heart failure. However, it remains unclear exactly how SGLT2 inhibitors produce their impressive clinical benefits in patients with heart failure (Central Illustration). It is clear that its classical actions of lowering blood glucose cannot fully explain these benefits. The early onset of the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical trials suggests that these benefits are not occurring as a result of slowing the atherosclerotic process. Whereas the published reports are replete with numerous proposed mechanisms linking SGLT2 inhibition to cardiovascular protection, how do we synthesize and prioritize these to help explain the observed clinical benefits? Taking a bedside-to-bench approach, the clinical data would suggest that the mechanism(s) involved must account for the following key elements: 1) efficacy in the treatment and prevention of heart failure; 2) efficacy on top of excellent background therapy, including neprilysin inhibition; 3) rapid onset of the benefit; 4) efficacy independent of glycemic status; and 5) association with renal protection. We opine that the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are an important mechanism of action and that some of the cardiovascular benefits are secondary to this. According to this theory, SGLT2 inhibition result in an early hemodynamic effect at the level of the proximal renal tubule. This in turn promotes sodium and water loss while also, through tubule-glomerular feedback, promoting afferent arteriolar constriction. The ensuring reduction in intraglomerular pressure leads to renal protection. Improving renal function and/or reducing renal stress can indirectly improve cardiac function through various pathways, including a reduction in afferent SNS activation, reduction in inflammation, and ROS generation. We propose that future studies are required to examine these possibilities. We also argue that the renal hemodynamic effects are observed independent of glycemia, because in the DAPA-HF trial an initial drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate was observed in people both with and without diabetes. The increase in EPO production may also be secondary to an improvement in renal health and may explain why the hematocrit is increased to a similar extent in people both with and without diabetes in DAPA-HF. Additional intriguing mechanisms for the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in heart failure include improving cardiac energy metabolism and decreasing cardiac inflammation. Further studies are needed to examine SGLT2 inhibition impacts on these pathways in the setting of heart failure, as well as the potential inter-relationship between these 2 pathways (because ketones can inhibit the inflammatory pathway). Further studies should help elucidate exactly how SGLT2 inhibitors exert these impressive cardiovascular effects.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112TtxQw]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are prioritized based on kidney and cardiovascular benefits: SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for people with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² and type 2 diabetes to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce heart failure risk independent of glucose management, while GLP-1 RAs are suggested for cardiovascular risk reduction if such risk is predominant. Selection of glucose-lowering medications should also consider an individual's cardiovascular and kidney risks, effects on weight, adverse effects, preferences, and cost, and both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs have shown cardiovascular and kidney protection.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: a novel choice for the combination therapy in diabetic kidney disease [^111afXVV]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors and ACEI/ARBs clearly play different roles in different places on the kidney. Figure 1 shows the action sites of SGLT2 and RASS inhibitors and the potential synergistic mechanism of their combined therapy in T2DM. Figure 2 shows the synergistic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and ACEI/ARBs in DKD therapy.

In an experimental model study, Bautista et al. found that a higher expression of SGLT2 in hypertensive rats than in normotensive rats. And the levels of protein and mRNA were decreased in rats treated with either ramipril or losartan. Therefore, they suggested that in renovascular hypertension, Ang II induced SGLT2 via the Ang II type 1 receptor possibly contributing to increased absorption of Na and thereby to the development or maintenance of hypertension.

Although SGLT2 inhibitors or ACEI/ARBs have effects on albuminuria- and BP-lowering in patients with DKD, the effects of monotherapy are always unsatisfactory. Considering their complementary mechanisms on the kidneys, theoretically, SGLT2 inhibitors and ACEI/ARBs should have synergistic action. Recently several studies indicated that the combination of SGLT2 inhibitors with ACEI/ARBs satisfactorily afforded greater renoprotection than administration of either drug alone. These results demonstrated a long-term control of hyperglycemia and BP, reduction of hyperfiltration and proteinuria, and attenuation of the development of renal injury in Dahl-STZ rat model and patients of DKD.

### EMPA-REG OUTCOME: the nephrologist's point of view [^114B6UXE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have renoprotective effects, as demonstrated by the renal analyses from clinical trials including Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), CANagliflozin Treatment And Trial Analysis versus SUlphonylurea (CANTATA-SU), and the dapagliflozin renal study. The potential mechanisms responsible are likely multifactorial, and direct renovascular and hemodynamic effects are postulated to play a central role. This report reviews the renal outcomes data from key SGLT2 inhibitor clinical trials, discusses the hypotheses for SGLT2 inhibitor-associated renoprotection, and considers the main renal safety issues associated with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment.

### Renoprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and underlying mechanisms [^117LqQw9]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Emerging data have demonstrated that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors prevent cardiovascular events, especially heart failure-associated endpoints. Cardiovascular outcome trials have also suggested their renoprotective effects. One large clinical trial investigated renal primary endpoints and demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors slowed the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). This review summarizes clinical trial data on renal outcomes and discusses potential underlying mechanisms.

Recent Findings

The EMPA-REG, CANVAS, and DECLARE-TIMI 58 studies revealed that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and concomitantly suggested that these drugs slow the progression of kidney disease in type 2 diabetes. The CREDENCE trial on patients with high-risk type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease demonstrated that canagliflozin treatment reduced the relative risk of a composite outcome, including end-stage kidney disease, serum creatinine doubling, and renal/cardiovascular death, by 30% in these patients. Animal experiments revealed that oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, and tubuloglomerular feedback are underlying renoprotective mechanisms behind SGLT2 inhibitors.

Summary

Recent clinical trials have established the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. Further investigations on mechanisms of these renoprotective effects will provide deeper insights and understanding of pathogenetic properties of DKD.

### The renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and a mini-review of the literature [^111Ksoxf]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new and promising class of antidiabetic agents which target renal tubular glucose reabsorption. Their action is based on the blockage of SGLT2 sodium-glucose cotransporters that are located at the luminal membrane of tubular cells of the proximal convoluted tubule, inducing glucosuria. It has been proven that they significantly reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), along with fasting and postprandial plasma glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The glucosuria-induced caloric loss as well as the osmotic diuresis significantly decrease body weight and blood pressure, respectively. Given that SGLT2 inhibitors do not interfere with insulin action and secretion, their efficacy is sustained despite the progressive β-cell failure in T2DM. They are well tolerated, with a low risk of hypoglycemia. Their most frequent adverse events are minor: genital and urinal tract infections. Recently, it was demonstrated that empagliflozin presents a significant cardioprotective effect. Although the SGLT2 inhibitors' efficacy is affected by renal function, new data have been presented that some SGLT2 inhibitors, even in mild and moderate renal impairment, induce significant HbA1c reduction. Moreover, recent data indicate that SGLT2 inhibition has a beneficial renoprotective effect. The role of this review paper is to explore the current evidence on the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors.

### SGLT2 inhibitors improve all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in… [^115Dgcmn]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What effect do sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors have on mortality and cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with and without diabetes mellitus, heart failure, or kidney disease. Bottom Line SGLT2 inhibitors — medications ending in -flozin, such as canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin — reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients regardless of the presence of type 2 diabetes, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. Similar mortality reduction occurs in patients with diabetes regardless of comorbid heart failure, and in patients with heart failure regardless of the presence of diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce the progression of renal disease in all patients.

Synopsis Two researchers independently searched three databases, including Cochrane CENTRAL, with the bibliographies of identified studies and abstracts of major cardiology meetings, to identify randomized studies in any language that evaluated the impact of treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with or without heart failure or type 2 diabetes. Two researchers independently abstracted the data. The researchers followed PRISMA guidelines and assessed the quality of evidence. They included eight studies of 59, 747 patients, comprising three studies that included patients without diabetes. Treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor reduced the risk of mortality due to all causes, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure compared with placebo, and reduced a composite of end-stage kidney disease, a doubling of the serum creatinine level, and kidney-related mortality. There were similar mortality and renal benefits for patients with or without diabetes and patients with or without heart failure. Heterogeneity among study results was moderate for mortality outcomes and low for heart failure hospitalization and kidney outcomes.

Potential Mechanisms Underpinning the Renoprotective Action of SGLT2I Treatments

Conclusive evidence concerning the mechanisms responsible for the renoprotective effects observed with SGLT2i drugs is lacking, but several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the apparent slowing of DKD progression over time associated with these medicines. It is possible that a combination of several mechanisms may be responsible for the effect observed in practice.

The primary cardiovascular and renal outcomes of the SGLT2 inhibitor outcome trials per baseline HbA1c subgroup. The primary cardiovascular outcome was defined as 3-point MACEs. Renal outcomes were defined as a sustained 40% decrease of eGFR, renal replacement therapy or renal death for the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial; composite of doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage kidney disease or renal death for the CANVAS trial; and a composite of doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage kidney disease and renal or cardiovascular death for the CREDENCE trial. A description of the methods can be found in the Supplementary data.

CKD can lead to nephron loss, resulting in an increased single-nephron GFR in the remaining glomeruli. This causes intraglomerular hypertension, which in turn can damage the remaining glomeruli, resulting in proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. Looking at the renoprotective mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors, one can think of several kidney diseases that might benefit specifically from SGLT2 inhibitor therapy; for example, obesity-induced CKD, hypertensive nephrosclerosis or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Obesity-induced CKD is characterized by renal haemodynamic changes resulting in increased renal plasma flow, GFR and filtration fraction, possibly due to afferent arterial vasodilation. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce glomerular hyperfiltration by afferent arterial vasoconstriction and promote BW loss. Both are highly desirable effects in patients with obesity-induced CKD. In patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis, increased renal plasma flow and glomerular hypertension are a result of arterial stiffening. SGLT2 inhibition can potentially decrease intraglomerular pressure and reduce arterial stiffness in these patients, which could help to slow disease progression. Patients with FSGS or with immunoglobulin A nephropathy might also benefit from SGLT2 inhibition. These glomerular-based diseases often result in proteinuria and hypertension. Most patients respond to RAAS blockade, but not all. Of note, RAAS inhibitors have different mechanisms of action than SGLT2 inhibitors. RAAS inhibitors reduce the intraglomerular pressure by limiting angiotensin II–induced vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole, while SGLT2 inhibitors activate the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism, as explained in the previous section. SGLT2 inhibition can therefore be used as an alternative treatment or in addition to RAAS inhibition to further delay the decline of kidney function. However, it is still unclear whether SGLT2 inhibitors are truly effective in non-diabetic kidney diseases.

### Review of SGLT2i for the treatment of renal complications: experience in patients with and without T2D [^117Exp7m]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) involves decreasing plasma glucose levels and reducing cardiovascular and microvascular complications. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), defined as presence of albuminuria, impaired glomerular filtration, or both, is an insidious microvascular complication of diabetes that generates a substantial personal and clinical burden. The progressive reduction in renal function and increased albuminuria results in an increase of cardiovascular events. Thus, patients with DKD require exhaustive control of the associated cardiovascular risk factors. People with diabetes and renal impairment have fewer options of antidiabetic drugs because of contraindications, adverse effects, or altered pharmacokinetics. Sodium–glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce blood glucose concentrations by blocking the uptake of sodium and glucose in the proximal tubule and promoting glycosuria, and these agents now have an important role in the management of T2D. The results of several cardiovascular outcomes trials suggested that SGLT2i are associated with improvements in renal endpoints in addition to their reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality, which represents a major advance in the care of this population. The dedicated kidney outcomes trials have confirmed the renoprotective action of SGLT2i across different glomerular filtration and albuminuria values, even in patients with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease. Notably, this improvement in kidney function may indirectly benefit cardiac function through multifaceted interorgan cross talk, which can break the cardiorenal vicious circle linked to T2D. In this article, we briefly review the different mechanisms of action that may explain the renal beneficial effects of SGLT2i and disclose the results of the key renal outcome trials and the subsequent update of related clinical guidelines.

### Effects of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors by diabetes status and level of albuminuria: a meta-analysis [^112nwVEQ]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

There is uncertainty about the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in participants with chronic kidney disease, with guidelines offering different strengths of recommendation based on diabetes status and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR).

Objective

To assess the relative and absolute effects of SGLT2 inhibitor use across efficacy and serious safety outcomes in participants stratified by diabetes status and UACR (≥ 200 mg/g or < 200 mg/g).

Data Sources and Study Selection

Included 8 randomized clinical trials that studied an SGLT2 inhibitor with a label indication for use in kidney disease and recorded longitudinal kidney outcomes and baseline data on albuminuria.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were combined using inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis; group-specific absolute effects were estimated by applying relevant relative risks to the event rates of the placebo groups.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Assessed the effects of SGLT2 inhibitor use on clinical efficacy and safety outcomes. Heterogeneity by baseline level of UACR was assessed separately by diabetes status.

Results

A total of 58 816 participants (mean age, 64 [SD, 10] years; 35% were female; 48 946 with diabetes and 9870 without diabetes) were included from trials comparing an SGLT2 inhibitor vs placebo. Allocation to an SGLT2 inhibitor produced a lower rate of kidney disease progression (33 vs 48 for placebo per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.65 [95% CI, 0.60–0.70] in those with diabetes and 32 vs 46 per 1000; HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.63–0.85] in those without diabetes), a lower rate of acute kidney injury (14 vs 18 per 1000 [HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69–0.87] with diabetes and 13 vs 18 per 1000 [HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56–0.92] without diabetes), a lower rate of any hospitalization (202 vs 231 per 1000 [HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87–0.92] with diabetes and 203 vs 237 per 1000 [HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83–0.95] without diabetes), and a lower rate of any death (42 vs 47 per 1000 [HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.91] with diabetes and 42 vs 48 per 1000 [HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.78–1.05] without diabetes). Diabetes-specific HRs were similar in participants (with a UACR ≥ 200 mg/g vs with a UACR < 200 mg/g) considered separately. Higher absolute risk at a UACR of 200 mg/g or greater meant larger estimated absolute benefits on kidney disease progression were evident in this subgroup. Clear absolute benefits were evident for other efficacy outcomes, and particularly hospitalization, in participants with a UACR less than 200 mg/g. Net absolute benefits remained in the analyses of non-heart failure populations and when estimated glomerular filtration rate was less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m².

Conclusions and Relevance

Within the studied participants, there were clear absolute benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney, hospitalization, and mortality outcomes irrespective of diabetes status and level of UACR.

### Impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on renal function in participants with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease with normoalbuminuria [^1172wdmt]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that more favorable effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal function were observed in participants with type 2 diabetes and CKD with normoalbuminuria than in participants with macroalbuminuria. These findings suggest that the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in participants with CKD can vary depending on the degree of albuminuria.

### Are the cardiorenal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors due to inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system? [^1123Ge5m]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

Although Herat et al. are to be congratulated for their elegant study design, and for presenting cogent data linking SGLT2 inhibition to cardiorenal benefit, a few questions remain unanswered. First, the paper would have been further strengthened with details on cardiac structure and function, particularly in response to pressure overload or coronary artery occlusion. Second, the SNS is also a regulator of myocardial energetics, which has been implicated as a mechanism of benefit for SGLT2 inhibitors. Data on ketone bodies and measures of myocardial energetics (PGC1α) would have been beneficial. Probably the most important issue pertains to ascribing cause and effect. The benefits to lower tissue levels of SNS activation with SGLT2 inhibitors may simply represent a "bystander response" secondary to improvements in hemodynamics and metabolic stress and not causally related to the cardiovascular benefits observed. In mice that have SNS inactivated by chemical denervation, is there a heart failure benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors? Last, Herat et al. did not provide much information on how the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the kidney may affect central SNS activity. One tantalizing hypothesis is that the primary effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is a renal hemodynamic effect and that through reducing renal stress, there are secondary benefits of attenuating renal afferent SNS activity. As discussed previously, a rise in EPO may represent a marker of generalized improvements in renal function, and the reduction in SNS activity may also be simply be secondary to a renoprotective effect. Cardiac function studies of SGLT2 inhibitors in models of nephrectomy may help shed light on this, as would studies of patients on dialysis.

The remarkable translational story of SGLT2 inhibitors continues. Although we continue to search for answers to explain these formidable cardiorenal benefits, we must be cognizant that these mechanisms are likely multifactorial and interrelated. Translational data from large clinical trials and correlating biomarkers to clinical outcomes may help get us closer.

### Renoprotection with SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes over a spectrum of cardiovascular and renal risk [^1119Smno]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

In a population with relatively less renal impairment, DECLARE-TIMI 58 did not report a significant difference in the efficacy of dapagliflozin as measured by the renal composite outcome based on patient baseline eGFR or UACR, although there were some numeric differences suggesting that the renoprotective effects of dapagliflozin may be slightly larger in patients with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2: HR: 0.50; 95% CI 0.34, 0.73; and eGFR 60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2: HR: 0.54; 95% CI 0.40, 0.73; eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2: HR: 0.60; 95% CI 0.35, 1.02) and those with macroalbuminuria (UACR > 300 mg/g: HR: 0.38; 95% CI 0.25, 0.58; UACR < 30 mg/g: HR: 0.52; 95% CI 0.37, 0.74; and UACR 30–300 mg/g: HR: 0.59; 95% CI 0.39, 0.87). Approximately 13.1% of DECLARE-TIMI 58 participants had CKD (defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, UACR > 300 mg/g, or both) at baseline. In these patients, dapagliflozin treatment was associated with a significantly lower rate of ESKD or renal death, compared with placebo (HR: 0.41; 95% CI 0.20, 0.82), which was mostly driven by a lower rate of ESKD (HR: 0.31; 95% CI 0.13, 0.79).

### SGLT2 inhibition to address the unmet needs in diabetic nephropathy [^116C19EC]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

6.2 Progression and regression of albuminuria and SGLT2i

In CVOT with SGLT2i, treatment with empagliflozin and canagliflozin reduced the risk of new onset macroalbuminuria by ~40% and the shift to higher albuminuria category by ~30%, indicating efficacy of SGLT2 inhibition in reducing albuminuria progression. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibition also enhanced the likelihood of albuminuria regression by approximately 60 to 70% 31, 34, 35, 36 (Figure 1).

In agreement with these data, analyses treating UACR as a continuous variable showed that placebo‐adjusted UACR was significantly reduced in patients with either microalbuminuria (EMPA‐REG −30% and CANVAS −34%) or macroalbuminuria (EMPA‐REG −32% and CANVAS −36%). 34, 35, 36

The magnitude of these changes in albuminuria is clinically relevant and comparable to that of RAS inhibitors. Furthermore, most patients (~80%) were already on RAS blockers, suggesting a benefit of adding SGLT2i to current therapy. In addition, the reduction in UACR was consistent across eGFR strata and dapagliflozin also displayed anti‐proteinuric properties in DM2 patients with stage 3‐4 CKD. 37, 38

Therefore, treatment with SGLT2i may be a valuable approach for providing greater reduction in albuminuria and ultimately renoprotection. Whether microalbuminuria/macroalbuminuria is solely a biomarker or a surrogate end‐point for renal outcomes is still matter of debate; however, a meta‐analysis of large clinical trials suggested that a 30% decline in albuminuria, as reported in CVOT with SGLT2i, might translate in a 24% ESRD risk reduction, assuming that risk factors and other biomarkers are unchanged. 39

The underlying mechanism of the SGLT2i anti‐proteinuric effect is unknown. However, in the EMPA‐REG, reduction of UACR in patients with albuminuria persisted, at least in part, after cessation of treatment, 36 implying that SGLT2 inhibition may reduce the glomerular injury leading to albuminuria (see below the section on mechanisms).

Taken together these data indicate that current treatment of DN with anti‐hyperglycemic drugs, BP lowering agents, and RAS blockers is effective, but substantial gaps in care still remain. Desirable properties of an "ideal" new drug for DN therapy should include (1) prevention of microalbuminuria, (2) an additive/synergistic effect in combination with RAS blockers on albuminuria, (3) marked reduction of CKD progression to prevent long‐term major renal events, and (4) cardio‐protection.

### Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: a consensus statement [^116bWx9U]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are glucose-lowering drugs that have beneficial effects on blood pressure and bodyweight, indirectly exerting renoprotection. They also reduce albuminuria and are postulated to have direct hemodynamic effects on the kidney. Large-scale CV outcome trials (CVOTs) of SGLT2i, conducted to meet regulatory requirements and ensure CV safety, have shown promising effects on a range of albuminuria and kidney outcomes in the populations studied.

With this background, in this consensus statement, we discuss the treatment approaches and the role of SGLT2i in managing as well as delaying the progression of DKD in people with T2DM.

Conclusions

All the researches, mentioned above, demonstrating the SGLT2 inhibitors with their novel mechanism and associated benefits on glucose-lowering, renoprotection, body weight, CV safety, etc. have proved to be promising choices either as monotherapy or as combination therapy for patients with DKD. Moreover, large RCTs are necessary to investigate the combination therapy of SGLT2 inhibitors with the above mentioned drugs and thereby provide the direct evidences of renoprotection and CV safety in DKD patients.

### Renoprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors [^112a9K3P]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Over the past two years, our understanding of anti-hyperglycemic medications used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has fundamentally changed. Before the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, agents used to lower blood glucose were felt to prevent or delay the development of microvascular complications, but were not known to definitively reduce cardiovascular risk or mortality. Previous studies with then novel sodium-glucose cotransport-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors demonstrated improvements in several cardiovascular and renal risk factors, including HbA1c, blood pressure, weight, renal hyperfiltration, and albuminuria. However, as with other antihyperglycemic drugs, it could not be known if these salutary effects would translate into improved cardiorenal outcomes. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, SGLT2 inhibition with empagliflozin reduced the primary outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while also reducing mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and progression of diabetic kidney disease. In the CANVAS Program trials using canagliflozin, the rates of the 3-point MACE endpoint, the risk of heart failure and the renal composite endpoint were also reduced, albeit with an increased risk of lower extremity amputation and fracture. As a result, clinical practice guidelines recommend the consideration of SGLT2 inhibition in high-risk patient subgroups for cardiovascular risk reduction. Ongoing primary renal endpoint trials will inform the cardio-metabolic-renal community about how to optimally treat patients with chronic kidney disease - including those with and without diabetes. Our aim is to review the rationale for renal protection with SGLT2 inhibitors, and their current place in the clinical management of patients with kidney disease.

### Safety and efficacy of antihyperglycaemic agents in diabetic kidney disease [^114TqTFC]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

7 GLYCOSURICS

7.1 SGLT‐2 Inhibitors

Sodium glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are the newest class of antihyperglycaemic drugs on the market, being first approved in 2013. These agents act on the sodium glucose cotransporter 2, which is in charge of reabsorbing glucose in the proximal tubular epithelial cells of the kidney. SGLT2 is located in the brush border of the S1 and S2 segments of the proximal tubule and it is in charge to reabsorb about 90% of glucose that is filtered through the glomerulus. 84 As a result, agents that inhibit this cotransporter specifically cause a decrease in the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule and promote urinary glucose loss, creating a glucose‐lowering effect that is independent of insulin. 85 Experimental studies strongly suggest that these agents may provide renoprotection through a hemodynamic mechanism that regulates tubuloglomerular feedback mediated by increase distal delivery of sodium, which in turn increase afferent arteriole tone reducing glomerular hyperfiltration. However, the possibility that SGLT‐2 inhibitors may interfere with the metabolic function of tubular cells or may affect neoglucogenesis remains to be tested. Furthermore, the recent evidence that agents from this class can affect the function of the Na/H exchanger 1 (NHE‐1) in cardiofibroblasts challenges their specificity and open the avenue for a different interpretation of their claimed mechanism of action. 86 Irrespectively of the mechanism responsible for renoprotection, further studies are also needed to understand the reported decreased urinary excretion of ketone bodies in some patients, predisposing them to ketoacidosis. 85, 87, 88

### Mechanisms leading to differential hypoxia-inducible factor signaling in the diabetic kidney: modulation by SGLT2 inhibitors and hypoxia mimetics [^1172KRTw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors exert important renoprotective effects in the diabetic kidney, which cannot be readily explained by their actions to lower blood glucose, blood pressure, or glomerular filtration pressures. Their effects to promote erythrocytosis suggest that these drugs act on hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs; specifically, HIF-1α and HIF-2α), which may underlie their ability to reduce the progression of nephropathy. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by renal hypoxia, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and defective nutrient deprivation signaling, which (acting in concert) are poised to cause both activation of HIF-1α and suppression of HIF-2α. This shift in the balance of HIF-1α/HIF-2α activities promotes proinflammatory and profibrotic pathways in glomerular and renal tubular cells. SGLT2 inhibitors alleviate renal hypoxia and cellular stress and enhance nutrient deprivation signaling, which collectively may explain their actions to suppress HIF-1α and activate HIF-2α and thereby augment erythropoiesis, while muting organellar dysfunction, inflammation, and fibrosis. Cobalt chloride, a drug conventionally classified as a hypoxia mimetic, has a profile of molecular and cellular actions in the kidney that is similar to those of SGLT2 inhibitors. Therefore, many renoprotective benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors may be related to their effect to promote oxygen deprivation signaling in the diabetic kidney.

### Renoprotection with SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes over a spectrum of cardiovascular and renal risk [^117Rkk38]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

In contrast to these positive results, some studies have found no significant benefit, in terms of markers of renal function, with SGLT2 inhibitors in people with T2D at low renal risk. An analysis of 12 randomized, double-blind clinical trials involving 4545 patients found that more than 90% of patients, whose baseline renal function was largely preserved or only mildly compromised (eGFR 84.6–86.7 mL/min/1.73 m²), remained in the normal albuminuria category in both dapagliflozin and placebo groups, with the proportion of patients with worsening albuminuria at week 24 similar for dapagliflozin and placebo irrespective of baseline eGFR category (normal renal function and mild or moderate renal impairment). A dose-dependent increase in microalbuminuria has also been reported in a single phase 2 study with empagliflozin in people with T2D. Over 24 weeks, treatment with ipragliflozin was also found to reduce UACR to a lesser degree in patients with mild renal impairment (− 1.28 mg/g versus placebo) compared with those with moderate impairment (− 55.18 mg/g versus placebo). In addition, dapagliflozin therapy was associated with a non-significant reduction in UACR compared to placebo [mean difference: − 17.0% (95% CI − 33.2, 3.4)] in people with CKD without T2D.

### Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: a consensus statement [^113DKG2Z]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) occurs in approximately 20–40% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with DKD have a higher risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and antihyperglycemic drugs form the mainstay of DKD management and aim to restrict progression to more severe stages of DKD. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) control hyperglycemia by blocking renal glucose reabsorption in addition to preventing inflammation, thereby improving endothelial function and reducing oxidative stress; consequently, this class of prescription medicines is emerging as an important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME, DECLARE TIMI 58, and CANVAS trials demonstrated the renoprotective effects of SGLT2i, such as restricting decline in glomerular filtration rate, in the progression of albuminuria, and in death due to renal causes. The renoprotection provided by SGLT2i was further confirmed in the CREDENCE study, which showed a 30% reduction in progression of chronic kidney disease, and in the DELIGHT study, which demonstrated a reduction in albuminuria with dapagliflozin compared with placebo (− 21.0%, confidence interval [CI] − 34.1 to − 5.2, p = 0.011). Furthermore, a meta-analysis demonstrated a reduced risk of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease (relative risk 0.67; 95% CI 0.52–0.86; p = 0.0019) and a 45% risk reduction in worsening of renal function, end-stage renal disease, or renal death (hazard ratio 0.55, CI 0.48–0.64, p < 0.0001) with SGLT2i, irrespective of baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate. Thus, there is emerging evidence that SGLT2i may be used to curb the mortality and improve the quality of life in patients with DKD. However, clinicians need to effectively select candidates for SGLT2i therapy. In this consensus statement, we have qualitatively synthesized evidence demonstrating the renal effects of SGLT2i and proposed recommendations for optimal use of SGLT2i to effectively manage and delay progression of DKD.

### Drugs that slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease: are renoprotective effects attenuated in heart failure? [^111rfppN]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the occurrence of end-stage kidney disease in large-scale trials of patients with heart failure, and contrasting mechanisms of progressive of kidney disease in Type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure. ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme; SGLT2, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2.

What might explain differences in the results with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with Type 2 diabetes vs. those with heart failure? One possibility is that cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations are 15–20 times more common than renal events in patients with heart failure, and the occurrence of a major heart failure event might represent a competing risk for the occurrence of a major renal event. At least theoretically, the prevention of heart failure events might increase the likelihood that physicians would identify the occurrence of a marked worsening of kidney function as a renal event (rather than a heart failure event), thus making patients in the active treatment arm more vulnerable to the apparent occurrence of attributable renal events and potentially biasing the estimates for any effect of treatment on renal events toward the null. However, it should be noted that, in large-scale trials of patients with type 2 diabetes, a heightened ratio of heart failure events to end-stage kidney disease is also observed and worsening heart failure events are prevented by active treatment, and yet, angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, mineralo-corticoid receptor antagonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors exert a striking renoprotective effect in diabetic patients.

### Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors: Do we need them for glucose-lowering, for cardiorenal protection or both? [^11213fcA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors are the newest addition to our treatment armamentarium for the management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. Glucose-lowering per se reduces the risk of microvascular complications, but not the risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart failure and cardiovascular mortality. Also, even when embedded in optimal cardiovascular prevention, a large residual risk remains with respect to progression of diabetic kidney disease. SGLT-2 inhibitors lower blood glucose levels by inducing glucosuria. Through various proposed mechanisms, among which diuretic and natriuretic effects, SGLT-2 inhibitors decrease heart failure hospitalization, reduce cardiovascular mortality, and mitigate progression of diabetic kidney disease. In this perspective, we will discuss the glucose-lowering and other protective effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on the cardiorenal axis, both in primary and secondary prevention. By comparing the glycemic and pleiotropic effects of these agents to other glucose-lowering drugs, we will address questions around whether SGLT-2 inhibitors should be considered primarily as glucose-lowering agents, cardiorenal drugs or both.

As the SGLT2-i therapy progressively carves out a forte in the management of diabetes, multiple equally significant questions justly occupy the medical mind. Aspects pertinent to the influence of this therapy on the renal pathophysiology, the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and considerations for their safe use, hold immense relevance to clinical practice. This review attempts to make an appropriate clinical interpretation of the existing evidence, to evolve a practical perspective on some of these yet unanswered aspects.

### Sodium-glucose linked transporter-2 inhibitor renal outcome modification in type 2 diabetes: evidence from studies in patients with high or low renal risk [^114RfDMn]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Data from three completed cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs), EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS Program and DECLARE-TIMI 58, add to the evidence supporting the potential renoprotective effects of sodium-glucose linked transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes. Despite recommendations in recent guidelines, it is difficult to support a view that definitive evidence for renoprotection exists from these SGLT2 inhibitor CVOT results. To date, the only dedicated trial to report definitive data on the renal impact of SGLT2 inhibition is CREDENCE. Notably, the total number of patient-relevant renal endpoint events (dialysis, transplant or renal death) observed in CREDENCE was significantly higher than the total for all three CVOTs collectively (183 events/4401 patients vs. 69 events/34 322 patients, respectively), which shows the increased statistical power of CREDENCE for these renal endpoints. Treatment with canagliflozin was associated with a 30% relative risk reduction (RRR) in the primary composite endpoint of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes and a 34% RRR for the renal-specific elements of this primary endpoint (P < 0.001). Canagliflozin has therefore become the first US-approved SGLT2 inhibitor to include an indication for RRR, in addition to type 2 diabetes glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk reduction. While confirmatory of the exploratory data from CVOTs, CREDENCE provides the first robust data on the effects of canagliflozin on patient-relevant renal endpoints. Extrapolation to a conclusion of a SGLT2 inhibitor class effect cannot be made until additional renal trials with other SGLT2 inhibitors are reported.

Mechanisms underlying the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors

After it became clear that the beneficial renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors were largely independent of the blood glucose–lowering effect of these drugs, intensive research focused on disclosing what mechanism may underlie their renoprotective effect. Multiple mechanisms have been hypothesized to be responsible. Several recent reviews have addressed the various alleged mechanisms leading to renal protection in detail. Therefore this issue will be only briefly discussed here.

Systemic mechanisms involve a decrease in HbA1c, BW, inflammation and blood pressure that are caused by SGLT2 inhibition, which are known risk factors for the development and progression of CKD. SGLT2 inhibition might also contribute to reverse systemic inflammatory and fibrotic processes, as indicated by the decreases in plasma tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, inerleukin-6 (IL-6), matrix metallopeptidase 7 and fibronectin 1 during CANA therapy. The effects on blood pressure are not restricted to daytime, as nocturnal blood pressure is also decreased, which is a predictor for cardiovascular and renal disease progression. A few articles have also reported that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce aortic stiffness, but others were not able to replicate this. Decreases in blood pressure and arterial stiffness might decrease the cardiac afterload. Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors might improve the cardiac preload by lowering plasma volume as a result of osmotic and natriuretic diuresis, secondary to urinary sodium and glucose excretion. These systemic haemodynamic mechanisms can beneficially influence the heart as well as the kidneys.

### A review of the mechanism of action, metabolic profile and haemodynamic effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors [^117KHHTZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Inhibition of glucose transport in the kidney, to produce glucosuria and thus directly lower blood glucose seems a remarkably simple way to treat diabetes (type 1 or type 2). The development of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and their subsequent clinical development has on one hand shown this to be true, but at another level has helped reveal a complex web of interacting effects starting in the kidney and modulating multiple metabolic pathways in a variety of other organs. These underlie the now clear benefits of this class of drugs in the management of type 2 diabetes from glucose lowering, weight loss and blood pressure reduction through to the reductions in cardiovascular and renal complications observed in long-term outcomes trials. They also explain some of the adverse effects that have emerged, including the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. This review describes the effects of SGLT2 inhibition in relation to this complex physiology, and shows how this can favourably alter the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.

Effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on uric acid

A systematic review found the following reductions in serum uric acid levels with SGLT2 inhibitors compared with placebo or standard care: canagliflozin weighed mean difference (WMD): − 36.72 µmol/L (95% CI − 38.12, − 35.33), dapagliflozin WMD: − 38.05 µmol/L (95% CI − 44.47, − 31.62), and empagliflozin WMD: − 42.07 µmol/L (95% CI − 46.27, − 37.86) This is an important finding because studies with allopurinol and other uric acid-lowering agents have suggested that decreasing uric acid is itself renoprotective, with a number of potential mechanisms proposed, including the prevention of formation and subsequent adherence of uric acid crystals onto renal epithelial cells and the resulting inflammatory response, and the reduction of glomerular hypertension by preventing uric acid-induced vascular smooth muscle proliferation in the afferent arterioles. In EMPA-REG H2H-SU, empagliflozin reduced uric acid levels by 52 (SD: 82) μmol/L from baseline, whereas glimepiride-treated patients showed a mean increase of 16 (SD: 90) μmol/L. Likewise, in a study involving 814 people with T2D and low CV and renal risk, the use of dapagliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin was associated with a mean reduction of uric acid from baseline of 45.2 (SE: 3.4) μmol/L, compared with an increase of 16.1 (SE: 3.4) μmol/L in glipizide-treated patients. Similar results were obtained in a 102-week randomized study with dapagliflozin in low-risk metformin-treated people with T2D. Reductions in uric acid suggestive of improvements in kidney function have also been reported in a number of other studies with empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ipragliflozin. However, other trials have reported no notable differences in various measures of renal function, including serum creatinine and uric acid, with canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or tofogliflozin.

One reason for these conflicting results might be that trials investigating low-risk patients may be unlikely to reach statistical significance, particularly in subgroup analyses and for secondary or exploratory endpoints, owing to low numbers of observed events and hence low statistical power for tested outcomes. As a result, these findings should be interpreted with caution.

### Impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on patient outcomes: a network meta-analysis [^115ie5Y9]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

The rationale of renoprotective and cardioprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors

The human kidney filters up to 162 g of glucose daily and reabsorbs 80–90% of this filtered glucose from the urine through the SGLT2 located in the proximal tubules. The kidney-protective effect of SGLT2 inhibitors may be due to their ability to inhibit glucose and sodium reabsorption, which subsequently results in a reduction in intra-glomerular pressure. SGLT2 inhibitors not only inhibit cardiac sodium transporters and alter ion homeostasis but also reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. Additionally, they attenuate cardiac microvascular ischemia/reperfusion injury through improving endothelial function and mitochondrial homeostasis. This off-target effect contributes to cardiovascular benefit, a reduction in frailty among patients with diabetes and hypertension. The natriuretic, glycosuric and osmotic diuretic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce cardiac preload, lung and systemic congestion, resulting in a cardioprotective effect. Moreover, our findings reveal that in individuals suffering from type 2 diabetes and experiencing acute myocardial infarction, the utilization of SGLT2 inhibitors yielded favorable outcomes, manifesting in reduced inflammatory burden and diminished infarct sizes when compared to alternative oral anti-diabetic agents, irrespective of glucose control.

In response to SGLT2 inhibition, the expression or activity of SGLT1 might be elevated in renal proximal tubules to compensate and avoid hypernatriuresis and diuresis 32. Several previous studies have demonstrated the renoprotective and cardioprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in various clinical settings.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: a novel choice for the combination therapy in diabetic kidney disease [^113tkZdd]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

As mentioned above, DPP-4 inhibitor add-on to SGLT2 inhibitor meets a need for pharmacological agents with complementary mechanisms that can be applied to effectively improve glycemic control and thereby protect kidney and have potential CV safety in patients with DKD (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Illustration of potential synergistic effects of SGLT2 inhibitor with DPP-4 inhibitor in DKD therapy.

A phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study showed that the combination of SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors resulted in the reductions of HbA1c (mean baseline 7.90–8.02% [62.8–64.1 mmol/mol]), FPG, serum uric acid, SBP, and hypoglycemic risk were superior to those with the individual components in patients with T2DM. As for, the SBP-lowering mechanisms of DPP-4 inhibitor may complement or augment SGLT2 inhibitor-induced plasma volume reduction and other mechanism. Of note, a higher proportion of subjects with microalbuminuria at baseline decreased to no albuminuria at the end of combination treatment. Mean changes from baseline in UACR and eGFR were small and similar across treatment groups. Furthermore, the combined therapy had CV safety and did not induce weight gain in several large prospective CV outcome studies, as well as potential renoprotection. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic (PK–PD) study investigated in healthy individuals found no drug–drug interaction in combination therapy of SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors.

### The RENAL LIFECYCLE trial: a RCT to assess the effect of… [^112V9Nbi]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

There is emerging evidence from experimental studies and post hoc-analyses of randomized clinical trials that SGLT2 inhibitors may also be effective in preventing cardiovascular and mortality outcomes in these patients with severe CKD, including patients receiving dialysis or living with a kidney transplant. For instance, subgroup analysis of the DAPA-CKD trial comparing 624 patients with an eGFR < 30 to the remainder of the trial population with better kidney function, demonstrated that the efficacy of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in reducing cardiovascular, heart failure and renal outcomes persisted in the population with impaired kidney function. Furthermore, in the DAPA-CKD trial patients continued to use dapagliflozin or placebo when dialysis was initiated. In the subgroup of patients who initiated dialysis, dapagliflozin was associated with a relative risk reduction for mortality of 21%.

Finally, in kidney transplant recipients, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to be effective in lowering HbA1c, body weight, blood pressure and stabilize kidney function, and these agents were well tolerated and safe. Taken these findings together there is a sound rationale to study the long-term reno- and cardioprotective efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with severe CKD. There are two cardiac sub-studies: the cardiac MRI substudy and the echocardiography sub-study. Novel aspects: A unique patient population with severe chronic kidney disease at very high risk of adverse outcomes for whom very few proven effective therapies exist. The initiation and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin, has not been studied before in this population. However, SGLT2 inhibitors have the potential to be very effective and well tolerated which would imply a major advance in the pharmacotherapy of these patients.

SGLT-2 inhibitor use is associated with better preservation of cognitive function in patients with CKD including those on hemodialysis and after kidney transplantation compared to placebo. Patients will be requested to perform the symbol digit modalities test at the same time as the questionnaires, i.e. at baseline, visit 5 and visit 6, once every year after visit 6 and at EoT/EET. The primary outcome of the cognition sub study is the change over time in the number of correct answers in the symbol digit modalities test within 90 seconds.

The renoprotective benefits of the SGLT-2 inhibitors have thus been shown in the cardiovascular outcome trials but the level of benefit is substantially less than that seen in CREDENCE, which enrolled CKD patients with a mean eGFR of 56 ml/min/1.73 m² and 60% of patients had eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m². As a consequence, there were 176 sustained renal replacement therapy events adjudicated in CREDENCE, whereas only 11 and 19 similar events were seen in EMPA-REG and CANVAS-R, respectively. What was unclear until the recent publication of Dapagliflozin in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) was whether the renal benefit shown in CREDENCE was a class effect, or specific to canagliflozin, and whether benefits extended to non-diabetic CKD.

DAPA-CKD has clarified that other SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with improved cardiovascular and renal outcomes. This trial involved 4304 participants and was stopped early due to clear efficacy. Over a median follow-up of 2.4 years a clear renal benefit was illustrated with the HR for a renal outcome (defined as sustained decline of eGFR of at least 50%, ESKD or death from a renal cause) of 0.56 (95% CI 0.45–0.68). The HR for a cardiovascular outcome was 0.71 (95% CI 0.55–0.92). Of note, the benefit was similar in those with or without diabetic CKD.EMPA-KIDNEYis due to be completed in 2022, and it will be interesting to see whether it shows similar results. It should also be noted that CREDENCE and the other SGLT-2 RCT demonstrated an improvement in heart failure hospitalisation (a secondary end point in CREDENCE) and this benefit has been conclusively demonstrated in DAPA-HF, in which dapagliflozin was shown significantly to reduce heart failure hospitalisation and death from cardiovascular causes in patients with reduced left ventricular function, irrespective of whether the patients had diabetes (which affected 42%).

### Sodium glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors and heart failure [^113mqqLm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) receptors are primarily located in the proximal convoluted tubule of the nephron. These receptors are responsible for almost 90% to 95% of tubular reabsorption of the glucose in the nephron. In patients with diabetes mellitus, due to upregulation of SGLT2 receptors, glucose reabsorption is further increased. The Food and Drug Administration approved SGLT2 inhibitors, such as canagliflozin, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and ertugliflozin, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In addition to their positive effect on blood glucose, additional cardioprotective and renoprotective functions have been demonstrated in major trials such as EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI-58, and CREDENCE. Unlike other antihyperglycemic drugs, reduction in hospitalization for heart failure (HF) was also seen as a class effect with this group, mechanisms of which are probably multifactorial. Subgroup analysis from these major trials indicated a reduction in progression of nephropathy and HF readmission with SGLT2 inhibitors. Although this unique property of canagliflozin was further analyzed in the CREDENCE trial, similar trials for empagliflozin (EMPERIAL-Reduced and EMPERIAL-Preserved) and dapagliflozin (DAPA-HF) are currently underway. Recently released phase III results from DAPA-HF trial indicate that dapagliflozin shows significant reduction in death due to cardiovascular causes and hospitalization in HF compared with the placebo, in both diabetics and nondiabetics. In this review article, the authors attempt to explore the possible underlying molecular mechanisms and data from existing trials pertaining to the HF related outcomes associated with SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Cardiorenal protective effects of canagliflozin in CREDENCE according to glucose lowering [^111sixdr]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Glycemia-independent effects of SGLT2 inhibition have been previously inferred from the study of cardiovascular and kidney benefits of canagliflozin that are observed despite a modest lowering of HbA1c when kidney function is impaired. Indeed, the mean decrease of 0.16% in HbA1c that we observed with canagliflozin compared with placebo in this analysis is considerably smaller than that seen in either short-term (approximately 0.7%–1.0%) or longer outcome trials (0.4%–0.6%). We have already reported that baseline HbA1c level did not predict the impact of canagliflozin on study outcomes in the CREDENCE trial. The current, analyses extend these findings by demonstrating that neither the initial HbA1c, the extent of initial reduction in HbA1c at 13 weeks, nor the time-averaged HbA1c during the whole study period, influenced the clinical benefits associated with randomization to canagliflozin as compared with placebo. Furthermore, reduction in cardiovascular and kidney risks were robust regardless of background diabetes therapies. These results therefore support the hypothesis that the cardiovascular and renoprotective effects of canagliflozin in this population of patients with both type 2 diabetes and CKD are largely independent of changes in glycemic status and suggest that non-glycemic mechanisms are operative. This analysis is consistent with findings from the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study in which markers of glycemic control did not explain kidney outcomes in a mediation analysis, while albuminuria, hemoglobin, and hematocrit did, suggesting that anti-inflammatory effects, antifibrotic effects, effect on volume status, improvements in renal hypoxia, or other mechanisms of action are more important in explaining clinical benefits. This conclusion is supported by a recent prespecified analysis of the DAPA-CKD study, which recruited 4304 participants with CKD of whom 738 had normoglycemia, 660 had prediabetes, and 2906 had type 2 diabetes at baseline. The effects of dapagliflozin on the primary outcome (a composite of doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage kidney disease, or death due to a renal or cardiovascular cause) were consistent in those with normoglycemia (HR 0.62 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.01)), prediabetes (HR 0.37 (0.21 to 0.66)), and type 2 diabetes (HR 0.64 (0.52 to 0.79)) with no effect modification on other outcomes (including all-cause mortality) when adjusted for baseline glycemic status. This analysis, however, did not examine the impact of the level of glycemic control during the study on these clinical outcomes, although there were no differences in HbA1c between treatments arms in participants with normoglycemia or prediabetes at baseline. Trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure have also indicated that the cardiovascular benefits of these drugs, particularly on hospitalization for worsening heart failure, are also observed in participants with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction who do not have type 2 diabetes at the time of randomization.

### Safety and efficacy of antihyperglycaemic agents in diabetic kidney disease [^113Rz5GV]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, the most recent Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study trial (CANVAS) evaluated patients with T2DM to receive either canagliflozin or placebo. After a follow‐up to 338 weeks, patients treated with canagliflozin demonstrated a regression of albuminuria (89.4 participants per 1000 patient‐years vs 128.7 participants per 1000 patient‐years (P < 0.05) and renal function preservation compared to placebo, suggesting and supporting a renoprotective effect in DKD. 97 Nonetheless, it is important to highlight the amputation rate increase in patients in treatment with canagliflozin compared to placebo as a secondary outcome as well, with 6.3 participants per 1000 patient‐years vs 3.4 participants per 1000 patient‐years (P < 0.05). 97 Nonetheless, this adverse effect still remains to be studied and proven, as it may simply reflect the higher probability of these patients to be accepted for surgery as they present a better preoperatory glycaemic control. Another ongoing trial for canagliflozin, named the Evaluation of the Effects of Canagliflozin on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Participants with Diabetic Nephropathy (CREDENCE) is expected to complete in 2019. 97, 98 It aims to analyse the risk of canagliflozin vs placebo in terms of renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with established kidney disease, by enrolling 4401 adults with T2DM with eGFR between 30 and 90 mL/min/1.73 and albuminuria. 98, 99

Dapagliflozin has also been suggested to exert direct renoprotection. A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study that included 252 patients with CKD stage 3A/B showed significant shifting to lower categories for albuminuria despite no significant difference in eGFR and HbA1c, strongly suggesting that renoprotection by SGLT2 inhibitors may strongly depend on eGFR. 100 Ongoing clinical trial evaluating the long‐term effect of dapagliflozin on renal outcomes and cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD (DAPA CKD) is expected completion in 2020. This trial is focused on the effect of this SGLT2‐inhibitor compared to placebo on renal outcomes/mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD, with an estimated enrolment of 4000 participants. 101 Aside from cardiovascular and renal protection, this class of agents is also associated with a reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of −4.0 mm Hg and −1.6 mm Hg, respectively. 101, 102

### SGLT2 inhibitors between Reno protective effects and impact on… [^116BWMpE]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

- Assess the role of sodium glucose co transporter 2 inhibitors in regression of ongoing kidney and cardiac diseases among diabetic or non-diabetic patients with lupus nephritis under different immunosuppressive therapies.
- Investigate the impact of SGLT2i on bone and mineral metabolism in these patients. Participants will be randomized into two groups:

- **Study group**: will receive SGLT2i as add on drug or replace another drug according to the patient clinical situation, Dapagliflozin 10 mg will be used once daily with or without food.
- Control group: will be maintained on their medication. Study sitting: Nephrology and renal transplant unit at urology and nephrology center in Mansoura University. The patients will be randomized into two groups Study group: will receive SGLT2i as add on drug or replace another drug according to the patient clinical situation, Dapagliflozin 10 mg will be used once daily with or without food.

### Renoprotection with SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes over a spectrum of cardiovascular and renal risk [^11682JDh]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately half of all patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) develop a certain degree of renal impairment. In many of them, chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses over time, eventually leading to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis and conveying a substantially increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Even with widespread use of renin-angiotensin system blockers and tight glycemic control, a substantial residual risk of nephropathy progression remains. Recent cardiovascular outcomes trials investigating sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have suggested that these therapies have renoprotective effects distinct from their glucose-lowering action, including the potential to reduce the rates of ESKD and acute kidney injury. Although patients in most cardiovascular outcomes trials had higher prevalence of existing cardiovascular disease compared with those normally seen in clinical practice, the proportion of patients with renal impairment was similar to that observed in a real-world context. Patient cardiovascular risk profiles did not relevantly impact the renoprotective benefits observed in these studies. Benefits were observed in patients across a spectrum of renal risk, but were evident also in those without renal damage, suggesting a role for SGLT2 inhibition in the prevention of CKD in people with T2D. In addition, recent studies such as CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD offer a greater insight into the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD. This review outlines the evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors may prevent the development of CKD and prevent and delay the worsening of CKD in people with T2D at different levels of renal risk.

Summary of the renal outcomes trials with SGLT2i

*The trial ended early because of loss of funding

CI confidence interval, CV cardiovascular, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, ESKD end-stage renal disease, HF heart failure, HR hazard ratio, MI myocardial infarction, NA not applicable, NNT number needed to treat; UACR, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio

In the CVOT evaluating dapagliflozin (DECLARE-TIMI 58), approximately 13.1% of the participants had CKD (defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, UACR > 300 mg/g, or both) at baseline. In the whole patient sample, dapagliflozin treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk (− 47%) of the renal composite of decline in eGFR of ≥ 40% to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, ESKD or renal death, compared with placebo. To further confirm this benefit, the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse outcomes in CKD (DAPA-CKD) trial investigated the safety and renal outcomes of dapagliflozin in patients with CKD, the majority of them (97%) already receiving RAAS blockers as background renoprotective therapy. Unlike CREDENCE, the DAPA-CKD trial also included people without T2D, to explore whether the benefits of SGLT2i may extend to patients with non-DKD. A total of 4304 patients with CKD were enrolled, 2906 (68%) of them with T2D. Dapagliflozin demonstrated a clear reduction (− 39% lower risk) in primary composite outcome events (sustained decline in the eGFR of ≥ 50%, ESKD, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes), regardless of the presence of diabetes. Additionally, dapagliflozin reduced all three secondary endpoints compared with placebo: decline in eGFR of ≥ 50%, ESKD, or death from renal causes (− 44%), hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death (− 29%), and all-cause mortality (− 31%) (Table 3). There were no significant differences in the primary endpoint between patients with diabetes and without, indicating that the renal benefit associated with dapagliflozin is at least similar in patients with non-DKD, such as chronic glomerulonephritides, ischemic or hypertensive CKD, or CKD of other or unknown cause. The baseline glycemic status (normoglycemic, prediabetes, or T2D) of DAPA-CKD trial participants did not modify the effect of dapagliflozin on the primary composite endpoint, and recent sub-analyses have shown that dapagliflozin significantly reduced albuminuria, slowed long-term eGFR decline, and reduced the risk of abrupt declines in kidney function. In addition to this, and in a similar fashion to DAPA-HF, dapagliflozin treatment in DAPA-CKD led to a numerical reduction in the cases of new T2D onset, which reaches statistical significance when pooled with DAPA-HF data (33% relative risk reduction).

### Impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on patient outcomes: a network meta-analysis [^114kVTYP]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Comparisons of different SGLT2 inhibitors in the patients with CKD, DM, and those without DM

SGLT2 inhibitors have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of composite outcomes, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality, when compared to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that SGLT-2 inhibitors demonstrated a higher efficacy in reducing HHF when compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes. In the current meta-analysis, TSA demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors had conclusive renoprotective effects in the patients with and without DM, and cardioprotective effects in the patients with and without DM as well as those with CKD. Our results also showcased that dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, the two SGLT2 inhibitors with the highest SGLT2 selectivity, were associated with superior CV death or HHF and renal outcomes in these patients than placebo, which is in agreement with previous meta-analyses. Moreover, in the patients with DM, the beneficial effect of empagliflozin on mortality was significantly greater than that of dapagliflozin. SGLT2 inhibitors also have gained significant market attention for treating type 2 diabetes, with dapagliflozin being a notable example. However, a study revealed that despite expectations, dapagliflozin inhibited glucose reabsorption by only 30–50%. In contrast, empagliflozin, which exhibited higher concentration levels in the market following administration, might explain its observed lower risk of DM death in our research compared to dapagliflozin. These findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors with greater selectivity for SGLT2 may be advantageous for these patients.

### When metformin is not enough: pros and cons of SGLT2 and DPP-4 inhibitors as a second line therapy [^115fmAvN]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

The newer oral therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, have advantages over older agents. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors are weight neutral and have few adverse effects. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have additional benefits: weight loss, blood pressure reduction, cardiovascular risk reduction, and renoprotective effects. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have increased risk of urogenital infections and possible risk of "euglycaemic" diabetic ketoacidosis. It is important to balance the benefits over the older-oral therapies as these agents are more expensive; yet some analyses suggest that they are within the limits of what is considered cost-effective in health care. We discuss the relative merits and drawbacks of these 2 classes and consider their roles in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. We suggest a number of patient profiles where early use of these agents could be used. We favour the use of SGLT2 inhibitors over DPP-4 inhibitors as add on therapy to metformin when glycaemic targets have not been achieved given their similar glycaemic efficacy and the additional benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors. We particularly favour SGLT2 inhibitors in those where additional weight loss and blood pressure reductions are desired, and in patients with heart failure or cardiovascular disease. Care should be taken to warn patients about genital fungal infections and to avoid use in people with risk factors for SGLT2 associated ketoacidosis. We favour DPP-4 inhibitors in those where side effects of other agents are of concern, the frail elderly population, and those with renal disease precluding SGTL2 inhibitor use.

### Renal physiology of glucose handling and therapeutic implications [^112eVwqh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

While the mechanisms and clinical efficacy for SGLT2 inhibition in heart failure remain unknown, the renal protective effects observed with canagliflozin in CREDENCE are unequivocal. Indeed, the results of the CREDENCE trial are pivotal and practice-changing for albuminuric patients with T2D. Observations from this trial have also, finally, demonstrated an effective adjunctive renoprotective therapy to RAS blockade after a long period of neutral CKD trials dating back to the Reduction of Endpoints in Non insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan study and the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial. Importantly, in CVOTs with SGLT2 inhibitors and in CREDENCE, CV and renal benefits are seen regardless of the use of RAS blockers at baseline. While many mechanisms may be at play for renoprotection with SGLT2 inhibitors in DKD, natriuresis may be a mechanism that explains both early protective effects, as well as benefits in patients with established DKD, and the reduction in hospitalization for heart failure. Ongoing renal protection trials such as EMPA-KIDNEY and Dapa-CKD with further knowledge in this field by assessing whether or not benefits from CREDENCE extend to other CKD populations, including those with nondiabetic CKD, to patients with lower eGFR and no albuminuria and, in the case of EMPA-KIDNEY, patients with T1D (Figure 2). Nevertheless, despite these benefits, until further data are available, there are some clinical conditions in which SGLT2 inhibitor use should be avoided, as listed in Table 2.

### Renal protection by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and its underlying mechanisms in diabetic kidney disease [^113uXRqr]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most frequent cause of mortality and morbidity, leading a global health burden. This review will focus on the potential therapeutic interventions using Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors that could prevent the development and progression of DKD.

Results

SGLT2 inhibitors have been widely used as anti-diabetic drugs. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that these drugs, which improve glycemic control and hypertension and decrease body weight, decrease the risk of renal function impairment and heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes. With regard to long-term clinical outcomes, the Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), the EMPA-REG Renal OUTCOME, and the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) program which have been integrated from CANVAS and CANVAS-Renal (CANVAS-R) trials reported significant risk reductions in primary combined major adverse cardiovascular events. Furthermore, regarding renal outcomes, the EMPA-REG Renal OUTCOME and CANVAS program clearly showed improvements in renal outcomes, including decreases in albuminuria and progression of nephropathy, doubling of serum creatinine levels, and initiation of renal replacement therapy.

Conclusions

Potential mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors related to renoprotection can be divided into two categories: hemodynamic actions and metabolic actions.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^115xUfkv]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease — Recommendation 4.2.1 states: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min per 1.73 m² with an SGLT2 inhibitor (1A). The commentary notes that the discovery of the cardiorenal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors has been a turning point for the treatment and prognosis of patients with T2D and CKD and that the magnitude of their mitigating effect on cardiorenal end points and consistency across trials is a rarity in clinical research; it also states that the CVOT with ertugliflozin did not meet statistical significance for its primary cardiovascular or kidney outcomes.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: a novel choice for the combination therapy in diabetic kidney disease [^11138qKb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors combined with MRAs therapy

It has been reported that Aldosterone contributes to renal injury. MRAs have effect on renoprotection by reducing the concentration of aldosterone in DKD patients. But MRAs are limited by notable side effect hyperkalaemia. An experimental model study demonstrated that spironolactone prevented the STZ-induced increase in the renal aldosterone synthase CYP11B2 mRNA content and did not influence glycemic level or BP in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Moreover, controlling blood glucose with AHAs also attenuated the renal expression of mRNA for CYP11B2. These results indicated that spironolactone exerted renoprotective effects and inhibited local angiotensin-converting enzyme expression and the hyperglycemia-induced overexpression of CYP11B2 in the kidney.

The novel drug finerenone of MRAs is more selective for the mineralocorticoid receptor than spironolactone and has greater affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor than eplerenone, and shows less incidence of hyperkalemia as compared to spironolactone. Hence, it can efficiently reduce the concentration of aldosterone and play a role in renoprotection. Furthermore, a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the renoprotective effect of finerenone in DKD is currently ongoing (FIDELIO-DKD).

As previously mentioned, SGLT2 inhibitors played roles in lowering glucose, renoprotection and CV safety. It was worth noting that SGLT2 inhibitors were not increasing the risks of hyperkalemia or severe hypokalemia. The apparent mechanism of action in SGLT2 inhibitors and MRAs suggests that there exists a potential synergistic renoprotective effect of combination therapy to slow the progression of DKD. Large RCTs are imperative to investigate if this combination therapy can provide effective renoprotection in DKD.

Further research is needed to better understand the incidence of acute kidney injury with SGLT2 inhibitors and the overall renal safety and potential benefits of these agents. The ongoing, prospective, dedicated renal outcome studies Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE; Identifier: NCT02065791) and CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study ‐ renal outcomes (CANVAS‐R; NCT01989754) will provide definitive evidence on the renal safety and renoprotective effects of canagliflozin in patients with T2DM and chronic kidney disease or a history/risk of cardiovascular disease, respectively.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and acute kidney injury [^1161MHDV]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are glucose-lowering agents that inhibit glucose reabsorption by the proximal tubules of the kidney. Since the introduction of the first SGLT2 inhibitor in 2012, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and empagliflozin have been developed and been rapidly integrated into clinical medicine, initially to manage type 2 diabetes. Over a short period of time, however, it has become apparent that SGLT2i not only reduces blood glucose but also provides long-term protective effects on the kidneys and heart. In this review, we present physiological data on what is known about SGLT2i effects on the kidney, present the ever-expanding clinical data relating to the effects of SGLT2i on the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and integrate what is known about molecular mechanisms with clinical experience. We conclude that SGLT2i may reduce the risks for AKI in humans. We speculate on mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors may protect against AKI.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors: a deeper dive into their renal protective properties beyond glycemic control and proteinuria reduction [^11689eE4]. American Journal of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent and associated with increasing burden on patients and healthcare system. Its complex causes and diverse manifestation pose considerable challenge in slowing the disease progression. Over the last few decades, the pharmacotherapeutic strategies have primarily focused on reducing albuminuria, managing complications, and alleviating symptoms. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, known for their glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits in diabetic patients, have shown promise in renal protection, offering hope for slowing CKD progression in a broader patient population.

Summary

The DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY trials have provided compelling evidence that dapagliflozin and empagliflozin reduced the risk of a series of renal events and slowed the chronic decline of eGFR in patients with CKD, irrespective of diabetic status. The results of these trials strongly support the notion that SGLT-2 inhibitors are effective in renal protection across CKD patients with diverse primary diseases and in varying CKD risk categories. EMPA-KIDNEY also demonstrated that empagliflozin can potentially slow CKD progression in patients without albuminuria, a finding collaborated by results from several other studies. The long-term cardiorenal benefits of empagliflozin were further demonstrated in the post-trial follow-up sub-study of EMPA-KIDNEY. The synergistic effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors with other drugs that have different mechanisms of action is being researched for broader applications.

Key Messages

Emerging evidence underscores the potential of SGLT-2 inhibitors to benefit a wide range of CKD patients, regardless of causes and albuminuria status. Further research in this area will improve our understanding of the roles of this new class of drug in renal protection and potentially shift the paradigm of CKD management.

### Renoprotective effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors among type 2 diabetes patients with different baseline kidney function: a multi-center study [^115in2Zb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Meta-analysis procedures

Once the results of study outcomes were available from individual healthcare delivery systems, a meta-analysis was conducted to pool the results across the systems to summarize the estimates. Even though data from different healthcare delivery systems were transformed into a CDM, the generic inverse-variance method with random effects in the meta-analysis was applied because heterogeneity in patient characteristics across individual health systems might still exist. The random-effects approach assumes that a normal distribution of effects exists and is weighted with both the within- and between-studies variances, resulting in a more conservative estimate with a wider CI. RevMan5 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) software was used for the meta-analysis.

### Sodium-glucose linked transporter-2 inhibitors: potential for renoprotection beyond blood glucose lowering? [^114V2bYo]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The proximal tubule's sodium-glucose linked transporter-2 (SGLT2) accounts for the vast majority of glucose reabsorption by the kidney. Its selective inhibition, accordingly, leads to substantial glycosuria, lowering blood glucose, and facilitating weight loss in individuals with diabetes. During the past year, two SGLT2 inhibitors, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Beyond their anti-hyperglycemic properties, however, this new class of drugs has several other attributes that provide a theoretical basis for kidney protection. Like agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce single-nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) in the chronically diseased kidney, though by quite different mechanisms. Additional potentially beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibition include modest reductions in blood pressure and plasma uric acid. Finally, cell culture studies indicate that glucose uptake from the tubular lumen, as well as from the basolateral compartment, can contribute to proximal tubular production of extracellular matrix proteins. Whether such attributes will translate into reducing the progression of chronic kidney disease will require the undertaking of long-term, dedicated studies.

### Impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on renal function in participants with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease with normoalbuminuria [^111BYa8o]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Large randomized clinical trials have indicated that sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors can significantly ameliorate renal outcomes in participants with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors were found to reduce the risk of renal disease progression by 45%, and show similar benefits for patients with and without established cardiovascular disease in a systematic review and meta-analysis. Although a beneficial effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was observed in participants with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD), it remains unclear whether the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors vary depending on the degree of albuminuria. In the present study, we compared the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal function in participants with type 2 diabetes and CKD categorized into three groups: normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, and macroalbuminuria.

### Why Do SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of renal glucose reabsorption in humans? [^115KSLcv]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a novel and promising treatment for diabetes under late-stage clinical development. It generally is accepted that SGLT2 mediates 90% of renal glucose reabsorption. However, SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical development inhibit only 30–50% of the filtered glucose load. Why are they unable to inhibit 90% of glucose reabsorption in humans? We will try to provide an explanation to this puzzle in this perspective analysis of the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical trials and examine possible mechanisms and molecular properties that may be responsible.

### SGLT2 inhibition mediates protection from diabetic kidney disease by promoting ketone body-induced mTORC1 inhibition [^115QSKY9]. Cell Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors offer strong renoprotection in subjects with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). But the mechanism for such protection is not clear. Here, we report that in damaged proximal tubules of high-fat diet-fed ApoE-knockout mice, a model of non-proteinuric DKD, ATP production shifted from lipolysis to ketolysis dependent due to hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). We further found that empagliflozin raised endogenous ketone body (KB) levels, and thus its use or treatment with 1,3-butanediol, a KB precursor, prevented decreases in renal ATP levels and organ damage in the mice. The renoprotective effect of empagliflozin was abolished by gene deletion of Hmgcs2, a rate-limiting enzyme of ketogenesis. Furthermore, KBs attenuated mTORC1-associated podocyte damage and proteinuria in diabetic db/db mice. Our findings show that SGLT2 inhibition-associated renoprotection is mediated by an elevation of KBs that in turn corrects mTORC1 hyperactivation that occurs in non-proteinuric and proteinuric DKD.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: slowing of chronic kidney disease progression in type 2 diabetes [^115nD3Dp]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a topic of increasing concern among clinicians involved in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is a progressive and costly complication associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular (CV) and renal outcomes and mortality. Ongoing monitoring of the estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate alongside the urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) is recommended during regular T2DM reviews to enable a prompt DKD diagnosis or to assess disease progression, providing an understanding of adverse risk for each individual. Many people with DKD will progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), typically haemodialysis or kidney transplantation. A range of lifestyle and pharmacological interventions is recommended to help lower CV risk, slow the advancement of DKD and prevent or delay the need for RRT. Emerging evidence concerning sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) agents suggests a role for these medicines in slowing eGFR decline, enabling regression of albuminuria and reducing progression to ESKD. Improvements in renal end points observed in SGLT2i CV outcome trials (CVOTs) highlighted the possible impact of these agents in the management of DKD. Data from the canagliflozin CREDENCE trial (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) have since demonstrated the effectiveness of this medicine in reducing the risk of kidney failure and CV events in a population comprising individuals with T2DM and renal disease. CREDENCE was the first SGLT2i study to examine renal outcomes as the primary end point. Real-world studies have reaffirmed these outcomes in routine clinical practice. This article summarises the evidence regarding the use of SGLT2i medicines in slowing the progression of DKD and examines the possible mechanisms underpinning the renoprotective effects of these agents. The relevant national and international guidance for monitoring and treatment of DKD is also highlighted to help clinicians working to support this vulnerable group.

### SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD: are they really effective in all patients? [^1111Mq5z]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

INSIGHTS FROM MOLECULAR AND ANIMAL STUDIES

Molecular and animal studies provide further context for the limitations of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD subtypes where hyperfiltration is not the dominant driver of progression. Expression of SGLT2 has been reported in a limited number of cell types beyond the proximal tubule, such as cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, peritoneal cells and even podocytes. However, single-cell RNA sequencing datasets reveal that SGLT2 mRNA expression is predominantly restricted to the kidney, even in diabetes, suggesting the amount of SGLT2 expressed by these cells even in inflammatory conditions is minimal in comparison to that expressed by the proximal tubule. Protein data from the Human Protein Atlas corroborate these findings, showing minimal SGLT2 expression in tissues outside the proximal tubule. This restricted expression suggests that effects beyond the kidney are unlikely to play a significant role in the renoprotective benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Animal models reinforce these findings. In mouse models of Alport nephropathy, SGLT2 inhibitors showed no additive benefit when combined with RAS blockers and were less effective than RAS blockers alone. Similarly, in APOL1 nephropathy models, SGLT2 inhibitors had no significant impact on CKD progression. Finally, renoprotective mechanisms-of-action of SGLT2 inhibition in diabetic kidney disease do not apply to chronic oxalosis, a non-diabetic form of CKD. Together, these findings highlight the mechanistic constraints of SGLT2 inhibitors and their limited applicability to CKD subtypes driven by alternative pathophysiologies.

### SGLT2 inhibition in chronic kidney disease: a preventive strategy against acute kidney injury at the same time? [^115SB6bf]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are known to slow down progression of chronic kidney disease. However, theoretical concerns still exist that SGLT2 inhibitors could increase the risk of acute kidney injury. Heerspink et al. revealed that dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of abrupt declines in kidney function during the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial. Their findings may serve to reassure clinicians prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors to patients with chronic kidney disease.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and the kidney: effects and mechanisms [^116Fivqr]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Numerous clinical trials have shown that sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors exert a favorable effect on the indices of renal function (albuminuria, glomerular filtration rate decline over time) and the incidence of hard renal endpoints such as renal death or time to initiation of renal replacement therapy.

Materials and Methods

In this review, we describe in detail the evidence regarding the nephroprotective mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors and describe the risk factors that may predispose to the development of acute kidney injury in patients receiving these drugs.

Results

Although the impact of these drugs on renal hemodynamics seems to represent the most important renoprotective mechanism of action, many other effects of these compounds, including beneficial effects on metabolism and blood pressure, have been proposed to contribute to the observed clinical benefit.

Conclusions

SGLT2 inhibitors clearly act beneficially in terms of kidney function with many proposed mechanisms.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and kidney outcomes by glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria: a meta-analysis [^112Bdena]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in individuals with type 2 diabetes, CKD, or heart failure. However, their effects in those with stage 4 CKD or little to no albuminuria remain uncertain.

Objective

To assess whether estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or degree of albuminuria, measured by urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), modifies the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes.

Data Sources

SGLT2 inhibitor trials participating in the SGLT2 Inhibitor Meta-Analysis Cardio-Renal Trialists' Consortium (SMART-C).

Study Selection

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials within SMART-C evaluating an SGLT2 inhibitor with label indications for reducing CKD progression including at least 500 participants in each group with at least 6 months of follow-up.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Treatment effects in individual trials were pooled using inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

CKD progression, defined as kidney failure, at least 50% reduction in eGFR, or death due to kidney failure. Other outcomes included annual rate of eGFR decline and kidney failure.

Results

Among 70 361 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.8 [8.7] years; 24 595 [35.0%] females) in 10 randomized trials, 2314 (3.3%) experienced CKD progression and 988 (1.4%) reached kidney failure. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of CKD progression (25.4 vs 40.3 events per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.62 [95% CI, 0.57–0.68]), irrespective of baseline eGFR (HR of 0.61 [95% CI, 0.52–0.71] for eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²; 0.57 [95% CI, 0.47–0.70] for eGFR of 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²; 0.64 [95% CI, 0.54–0.75] for eGFR of 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²; and 0.71 [95% CI, 0.60–0.83] for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; P for trend = .16) and baseline albuminuria (HR of 0.58 [95% CI, 0.44–0.76] for albuminuria ≤ 30 mg/g; 0.74 [95% CI, 0.57–0.96] for > 30–300 mg/g; and 0.57 [95% CI, 0.52–0.64] for more than 300 mg/g; P for trend = .49). Although the magnitude of protection varied, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the annual rate of eGFR decline across all eGFR and UACR subgroups, including when participants with and without diabetes were analyzed separately. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of kidney failure alone (HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58–0.75]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this meta-analysis, SGLT2 inhibitors were found to lower the risk of CKD progression regardless of baseline eGFR or albuminuria, including in patients with stage 4 CKD or minimal albuminuria, supporting their routine use to improve kidney outcomes across the full spectrum of kidney function among patients with type 2 diabetes, CKD, or heart failure.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^115tnt21]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The advent of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represents a major advance for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The results of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial have clearly demonstrated that canagliflozin prevents kidney failure and cardiovascular events. The results from three other large-scale randomized trials, collectively enrolling > 30 000 participants, have provided further evidence that the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on major kidney outcomes in people with T2DM may be present across the class, although this will only be known for certain when Dapagliflozin and Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with CKD (DAPA-CKD) (NCT03036150) and The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection with Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) (NCT03594110) are reported over coming years. Importantly, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition have been achieved in addition to the current standard of care. This review summarizes evidence for SGLT2 inhibition in people with T2DM and CKD, evaluates key patient characteristics and concomitant drug use that may influence the use of these drugs in people with CKD, discusses current guideline recommendations and explores how these drugs may be used in people with CKD in the future, including in combination with other treatments.

The Potential of SGLT2 Inhibitors as Treatment for Patients with T2DM and HF or CKD

SGLT2 inhibitors are a relatively new class of treatment that improve glycaemic control in patients with T2DM by decreasing renal glucose reabsorption and increasing urinary glucose excretion. In addition to glycaemic effects, SGLT2 inhibitors are increasingly recognised to exert significant cardiorenal outcome benefits.

SGLT2 Inhibitor Cardiovascular Outcome Trials

Previously, two SGLT2 inhibitor cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have shown a reduction in the risk of major adverse CV events (MACE) in patients with T2DM and established CVD or at high CV risk: the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial with empagliflozin (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01131676) and the CANVAS program with canagliflozin (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01032629). These studies also showed reductions in the risk of CV death with empagliflozin and the risk of HFH with both empagliflozin and canagliflozin. The results of these CVOTs are mainly relevant for the prevention of recurrent CV events rather than the prevention of new CV events as EMPA-REG OUTCOME enrolled only patients with established CVD, and in CANVAS, the reduction in the risk of CV events was considerably less for patients without prior CV events than in the overall population or those with prior CV events.

In contrast to EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS, the CREDENCE study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02065791) was designed to specifically assess effects on clinically important outcomes in patients with T2DM at high risk of kidney disease progression. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin versus placebo, when used in addition to standard of care. All study patients had an eGFR of 30 to < 90 ml/min/1.73 m² and albuminuria (urinary albumin/creatinine ratio > 300 to 5000 mg/g) and were treated with renin–angiotensin system blockade. Patients receiving canagliflozin had a 30% reduction in the risk of the primary composite endpoint, comprising progression to ESRD, doubling of serum creatinine, and renal or CV death, compared to patients in the placebo group. There was also a reduced risk of the secondary CV endpoints, including the risk of CV death and HFH by 31%, MACE by 20% and the risk of HFH alone by 39%.

### Reduction in albuminuria with dapagliflozin cannot be predicted by baseline clinical characteristics or changes in most other risk markers [^114NRU5b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dapagliflozin, a selective sodium glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, has been shown to improve glycemic control and to have beneficial effects on other cardiovascular risk markers, including body weight and blood pressure. 1, 2 Studies of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes with and without kidney impairment have consistently reported modest reversible reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and reductions of 30% to 40% in urinary albumin excretion. 3, 4, 5, 6 Recent large clinical outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors delay the progression of kidney disease and reduce the risk of end‐stage kidney disease. 3, 7 Altogether, these data indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors hold great promise as renoprotective agents for patients with type 2 diabetes with prevalent kidney disease.

Although SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to be effective in lowering albuminuria and stabilizing eGFR on a population level, individual patients may show large variations in their albuminuria response to these drugs, similar to what has been reported for ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). It has been shown that the inter‐individual variation in albuminuria response to dapagliflozin is consistent in both the initial and subsequent exposure to the drug, 4 suggesting that this variation is based on a specific pharmacodynamic response as opposed to merely random variation.

In order to precisely characterize the inter‐individual variations in albuminuria responses to dapagliflozin, we performed a patient‐level analysis of a large pooled phase 3 clinical trial database. To this end, we classified patients into responders and non‐responders based on their individual change in urinary albumin: creatinine ratio (UACR) with dapagliflozin. We then assessed baseline clinical characteristics and concurrent changes in other cardiovascular risk markers in these two groups.

4 DISCUSSION

This large, retrospective multicenter study of patients with T2D and CKD provides real‐world evidence that initiation of SGLT2i is associated with a significantly slower decline in kidney function compared with other glucose‐lowering medications, including GLP‐1RA. SGLT2i use led to an attenuation in the rate of eGFR decline of about 1 mL/min/1.73 m²/year and a significantly lower incidence of adverse kidney outcomes, including a ≥ 40% or ≥ 57% reduction in eGFR. Albuminuria also improved more in the SGLT2i group, with significant reductions in UACR and greater likelihood of UACR class improvement.

These findings reinforce the kidney‐protective effects of SGLT2i in clinical practice. Better kidney outcomes were observed despite a slightly smaller reduction in HbA1c in the SGLT2i group, suggesting that renoprotection is independent of glycemic control and may be partially driven by haemodynamic effects. Comparisons with GLP‐1RA showed that SGLT2i conferred superior preservation of eGFR, with a mean annual slope difference of 0.62 mL/min/1.73 m 2, supporting the preferential use of SGLT2i in patients with CKD when both classes are being considered, as suggested by the 2025 ADA standards of care.

### State-of-the-art-review: mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical implications [^1139Z5Zy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Inhibitors of the Na+-coupled glucose transporter SGLT2 (SGLT2i) primarily shift the reabsorption of large amounts of glucose from the kidney's early proximal tubule to downstream tubular segments expressing SGLT1, and the non-reabsorbed glucose is spilled into the urine together with some osmotic diuresis. How can this protect the kidneys and heart from failing as observed in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes?

Goal

Mediation analyses identified clinical phenotypes of SGLT2i associated with improved kidney and heart outcome, including a reduction of plasma volume or increase in hematocrit, and lowering of serum urate levels and albuminuria. This review outlines how primary effects of SGLT2i on the early proximal tubule can explain these phenotypes.

Results

The physiology of tubule-glomerular communication provides the basis for acute lowering of GFR and glomerular capillary pressure, which contributes to lowering of albuminuria but also to long term preservation of GFR, at least in part by reducing kidney cortex oxygen demand. Functional co-regulation of SGLT2 with other sodium and metabolite transporters in the early proximal tubule explains why SGLT2i initially excrete more sodium than expected and are uricosuric, thereby reducing plasma volume and serum urate. Inhibition of SGLT2 reduces early proximal tubule gluco-toxicity and by shifting transport downstream may simulate "systemic hypoxia", and the resulting increase in erythropoiesis, together with the osmotic diuresis, enhances hematocrit and improves blood oxygen delivery. Cardio-renal protection by SGLT2i is also provided by a fasting-like and insulin-sparing metabolic phenotype and, potentially, by off-target effects on the heart and microbiotic formation of uremic toxins.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: extending the indication to non-diabetic kidney disease? [^116oZXu3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Six to 10 years ago, Phase 2 and 3 studies already showed that SGLT2 inhibitors not only lowered plasma glucose, but also decreased blood pressure, body weight (BW) and proteinuria. The recent large cardiovascular outcome trials Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) with EMPA, CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) with CANA and Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Cardiovascular Events (DECLARE-TIMI58 with DAPA reproduced these beneficial effects and also showed that SGLT2 inhibitors lowered the risk for renal events by 34–47%, the risk for cardiovascular events by 7–14% and the risk for hospitalization for heart failure by ∼30% (Table 1). Renal events were defined differently in these three trials as a composite of incidence of kidney replacement therapy/end-stage kidney disease or renal- or cardiovascular death, combined in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS trials with progression to macroalbuminuria and/or doubling of serum creatinine and in the DECLARE-TIMI58 trial with a 40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Table 1). The results obtained in these trials were very promising. However, they were not designed to examine changes in renal outcomes, but to test cardiovascular safety in a non-inferiority design compared with placebo. Therefore specific, well-powered renal outcomes trials were launched and small-scale mechanistic studies were initiated to obtain more insight into the underlying renoprotective mechanisms.

Table 1
Summary of outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors

This review will focus on the effects and the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We will elaborate on the mechanisms underlying the renoprotective effects and question whether, based on these mechanisms, SGLT2 inhibitors might also be indicated for non-diabetic patients with a CKD.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: extending the indication to non-diabetic kidney disease? [^114vpMT3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The data from recent trials show a pattern that suggests SGLT2 inhibitors are cardiovascular and renoprotective in patients with lower renal functions, in patients with lower HbA1c levels and in patients with non-diabetic kidney disease. However, the available data are limited, especially in the non-diabetic CKD population. Moreover, the current literature in the non-diabetic population sometimes shows inconsistent results. Based on these data, we can only hypothesize, but not yet conclude, that SGLT2 inhibitors have renoprotective effects in non-diabetic patients with CKD. Ongoing and future trials will have to prove whether SGLT2 inhibitors are indeed effective in non-diabetic patients with kidney diseases.

Mechanisms of renal benefits with SGLT2 inhibitors

The inhibition of SGLT2 leads to tubuloglomerular feedback via enhanced natriuresis and delivery of sodium to the macula densa, thereby decreasing diabetic glomerular hyperfiltration due to hyperglycemia. This is hypothesized to reduce the resulting chronic kidney damage (Fig. 3). In combination with the osmotic diuresis effect, natriuresis has also been postulated to preserve intravascular volume and decrease volume overload, although body fluid changes appear to be transitory. Evidence from animal models suggests that SGLT2 inhibition reduces proinflammatory and profibrotic pathways, as well as tubular cell toxicity. The significant increase in hematocrit concentration reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors appears to be linked to increases in erythropoietin production, which may also result in increased oxygen delivery to the kidney and reduction in renal hypoxia. In addition, increased glucose excretion in the urine can lead to a state of relative glucose deficiency, triggering lipolysis in adipose tissue, fatty acid oxidation, and ketone body formation. Ketone bodies are a more energy-efficient fuel in renal tubular cells than glucose, and as a result, renal oxygen consumption is reduced in the presence of mild ketosis; hence, it has been suggested that the use of ketone bodies as energy substrates in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors may contribute to the renoprotective effects of these agents, with a similar mechanism as in the myocardium. Ketone bodies have also been found to inhibit the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1, a mediator of kidney damage in animal models. In addition to hemodynamic effects, SGLT2 inhibitors also have beneficial metabolic effects that may contribute to renoprotection. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors leads to significant weight loss of up to approximately 5 kg, two-thirds of which are accounted for by reductions in both abdominal and subcutaneous fat. Indeed, after 6 months off treatment, weight loss has been found to be primarily due to loss of adipose tissue mass. This fat mass loss can in turn lead to reductions in insulin resistance, metabolic risk, and renal risk.

SGLT2 inhibition in chronic kidney disease in patients with native kidneys

SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated cardiorenal benefits in patients with CKD. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 27 studies with up to 7363 participants showed that SGLT2i reduce the risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and CKD, without clear evidence of safety concerns. Similarly, a recent meta-analysis of 9 RCTs, comprising 60,914 patients, showed decreased kidney disease and CKD progression in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and CKD. The Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial was the first RCT that examined the impact of SGLT2i on the clinically important kidney outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, and macroalbuminuria.CREDENCE enrolled 4401 individuals with an eGFR of 30–90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and macroalbuminuria (urine albumin to creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g). These individuals were on maximally tolerated doses of ACEi/ARBs. Over 2.62 years of follow-up, compared with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg/day reduced the primary composite outcome of ESKD, serum creatinine doubling, or death from cardiovascular or kidney disease by 30%. More recently, the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial examined the use of dapagliflozin 10 mg/day, in addition to ACEi/ARBs in CKD patients with and without diabetes.DAPA-CKD enrolled 4304 CKD patients with an eGFR from 25–75 ml/min/1.73 m² and urine albumin to creatinine ratio between 200 and 5000 mg/g. Of the total number of patients, 32.5% did not have diabetes. The primary outcome of interest was a 50% decline in eGFR, new onset ESKD, or death from kidney or cardiovascular causes. Over a median follow-up of 2.4 years, dapagliflozin 10 mg/day compared with placebo reduced the primary outcome by 49%. The effects of dapagliflozin were similar in participants with and without type 2 diabetes. Apart from these two-kidney focused RCTs, other major cardiovascular trials showed similar renal outcomes in the secondary analyses. In terms of cardiovascular benefit, SGLT2i have been shown to reduce hospitalization of heart failure, cardiovascular death, and myocardial infarction according to a recent meta-analysis of 6 outcome trials. Unfortunately, none of these RCTs enrolled patients who had received a kidney transplant due to safety concerns, resulting in the current dearth of evidence regarding the utilization of SGLT2i in KTRs. Extrapolating from the cardiovascular and kidney benefits observed in other populations, these agents hold much potential to preserve allograft function and reduce the considerable cardiovascular disease burden in KTRs.

### Cardiometabolic and renal benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors [^113rasBi]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

The therapeutic scope of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors has expanded beyond glycaemic regulation in the management of diabetes mellitus. Studies published in the past few years highlight their substantial effect on cardiovascular outcomes, notably in decreasing mortality and the need for heart failure-related hospitalization. These agents also lead to pronounced improvements in a range of renal outcomes. The primary actions of SGLT2 inhibition, glycosuria and natriuresis, are pivotal in enhancing glucose control, promoting weight loss and lowering blood pressure. These effects initiate a series of beneficial mechanisms: facilitating haemodynamic improvement by reducing interstitial volume, enhancing cardiac function, boosting energy efficiency through altered ketone body metabolism and mitigating inflammation and oxidative stress. Additional effects include heightened erythropoiesis, reduced hyperuricaemia and increased levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin (1–7). SGLT2 inhibitors also attenuate sympathetic overactivity by modulating neurohumoral activation and renal afferent signalling, contributing to their cardioprotective and renoprotective profiles. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the diverse mechanisms underpinning the cardiometabolic and renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, emphasizing their clinical relevance and therapeutic potential.

Conclusions

The renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors do not seem to be influenced by baseline CV risk, including heart failure status. They are generally seen over a wide range of eGFR and albuminuria categories; however, it is difficult to elucidate whether these effects are greater in those with preserved or reduced renal function. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, the impact of empagliflozin treatment on the rates of acute renal failure and AKI was greatest in patients with baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². In the CANVAS program, canagliflozin was shown to reduce renal outcomes consistently across different levels of baseline albuminuria, but with the largest absolute benefits in those with macroalbuminuria. DECLARE-TIMI 58 demonstrated that dapagliflozin attenuated the increase in UACR over time to the greatest extent in patients with the highest degrees of albuminuria. In the CREDENCE trial, there was greater risk reduction in the renal-specific outcome with canagliflozin compared with placebo, in patients with UACR > 1000 mg/g and in patients with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. In a meta-analyses of these CV and renal outcome trials, the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors were seen across all levels of baseline eGFR, although the largest benefits were apparent in patients with preserved renal function at baseline.

Studies such as CREDENCE, DERIVE, and DAPA-CKD offer a greater insight into the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD than the CVOTs that preceded them. In addition, real-world studies such as CVD-REAL 3 report similar results to those observed in CVOTs of SGLT2 inhibitor therapies in patient cohorts with an ample range of baseline renal function. Together, the outcomes of these trials demonstrate how the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors, used in combination with RAS inhibitors, span the renal risk continuum, from patients with mild/moderate CKD (as seen in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS program, and DECLARE-TIMI 58 trials) to those with moderate/severe CKD (as observed in CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD). Results across studies vary, but overall, suggest that different clinically utilized therapeutic doses have similar efficacy in terms of renal outcomes. Further insights into the potential benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients at different stages on the renal and CV risk continuum are likely to come from the EMPA-KIDNEY (NCT03594110) trial in patients with diabetic as well as nondiabetic CKD.

### SGLT2 inhibition – a novel strategy for diabetes treatment [^111djUE1]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2010). Medium credibility.

Inhibiting sodium-glucose co-transporters (SGLTs), which have a key role in the reabsorption of glucose in the kidney, has been proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes. Genetic mutations in the kidney-specific SGLT2 isoform that result in benign renal glycosuria, as well as preclinical and clinical studies with SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes, support the potential of this approach. These investigations indicate that elevating renal glucose excretion by suppressing SGLT2 can reduce plasma glucose levels, as well as decrease weight. Although data from ongoing Phase III trials of these agents are needed to more fully assess safety, results suggest that the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibition might be achieved without exerting significant side effects — an advantage over many current diabetes medications. This article discusses the role of SGLT2 in glucose homeostasis and the evidence available so far on the therapeutic potential of blocking these transporters in the treatment of diabetes.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and the diabetic kidney [^114VUv5n]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Blood glucose and blood pressure control reduce the risk of developing this complication; however, once DN is established, it is only possible to slow progression. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, the most recent glucose-lowering oral agents, may have the potential to exert nephroprotection not only through improving glycemic control but also through glucose-independent effects, such as blood pressure-lowering and direct renal effects. It is important to consider, however, that in patients with impaired renal function, given their mode of action, SGLT2 inhibitors are less effective in lowering blood glucose. In patients with high cardiovascular risk, the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin lowered the rate of cardiovascular events, especially cardiovascular death, and substantially reduced important renal outcomes. Such benefits on DN could derive from effects beyond glycemia. Glomerular hyperfiltration is a potential risk factor for DN. In addition to the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, renal tubular factors, including SGLT2, contribute to glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, causing, through tubuloglomerular feedback, afferent arteriole vasoconstriction and reduction in hyperfiltration. Experimental studies showed that SGLT2 inhibitors reduced hyperfiltration and decreased inflammatory and fibrotic responses of proximal tubular cells. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced glomerular hyperfiltration in patients with type 1 diabetes, and in patients with type 2 diabetes, they caused transient acute reductions in glomerular filtration rate, followed by a progressive recovery and stabilization of renal function. Interestingly, recent studies consistently demonstrated a reduction in albuminuria. Although these data are promising, only dedicated renal outcome trials will clarify whether SGLT2 inhibitors, in addition to their glycemic and blood pressure benefits, may provide nephroprotective effects.

### Kidney-protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors [^1164FbkR]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have become an integral part of clinical practice guidelines to slow the progression of CKD in patients with and without diabetes mellitus. Although initially developed as antihyperglycemic drugs, their effect on the kidney is multifactorial resulting from profuse glycosuria and natriuresis consequent to their primary site of action. Hemodynamic and metabolic changes ensue that mediate kidney-protective effects, including (1) decreased workload of proximal tubular cells and prevention of aberrant increases in glycolysis, contributing to a decreased risk of AKI; (2) lowering of intraglomerular pressure by activating tubular glomerular feedback and reductions in BP and tissue sodium content; (3) initiation of nutrient-sensing pathways reminiscent of starvation activating ketogenesis, increased autophagy, and restoration of carbon flow through the mitochondria without production of reactive oxygen species; (4) body weight loss without a reduction in basal metabolic rate due to increases in nonshivering thermogenesis; and (5) favorable changes in quantity and characteristics of perirenal fat leading to decreased release of adipokines, which adversely affect the glomerular capillary and signal increased sympathetic outflow. Additionally, these drugs stimulate phosphate and magnesium reabsorption and increase uric acid excretion. Familiarity with kidney-specific mechanisms of action, potential changes in kidney function, and/or alterations in electrolytes and volume status, which are induced by these widely prescribed drugs, will facilitate usage in the patients for whom they are indicated.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: cardiovascular benefits beyond HbA1c-translating evidence into practice [^1131uotf]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Although SGLT2i treatments have a reduced glucose-lowering effect in people with reduced renal function, the renal benefits of SGLT2i agents appear to be preserved among people both with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD); these benefits include significant reduction in albuminuria and reduced incidence of worsening albuminuria. The benefits on CVD outcomes with empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been demonstrated in patients with a range of baseline renal function capacities and across a range of urine albumin–creatinine ratios; the effects of dapagliflozin were similarly observed across a range of baseline eGFR values. Currently, SGLT2i treatment is indicated for initiation in people with T2DM and an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and should be discontinued if eGFR persistently falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m². The preserved efficacy of SGLT2 inhibition across a range of degrees of renal impairment may be of importance in treatment selection for people with T2DM, because CKD and T2DM are both associated with increased CV risk.

The efficacy of SGLT2i treatment will be further elucidated in the forthcoming Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial (unpublished at time of paper development), which will prospectively assess the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in clinically important renal and CV outcomes. The primary composite endpoint is time to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), doubling of serum creatinine, and renal or CV death. At a planned interim analysis, the CREDENCE study demonstrated efficacy in achieving this primary endpoint and as a result the trial was stopped early. Secondary endpoints include a CV composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, hospitalisation for chronic HF and hospitalisation for unstable angina.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease affecting an increasing percentage of general population worldwide. Patients with T2DM are frequently characterized by impaired renal function, primarily as a result of diabetic kidney injury, but also by other contributing factors, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and medications. Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors have emerged as a new, promising class of antidiabetic agents with actions that seem to extend beyond their hypoglycemic effect.

Sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors reduce the risk of kidney failure in patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although the precise underlying mechanisms for these nephroprotective effects are incompletely understood, various hypotheses have been proposed including reductions in intraglomerular pressure through restoration of tubuloglomerular feedback, blood pressure reduction and favorable effects on vascular function, reduction in tubular workload and hypoxia, and metabolic effects resulting in increased autophagy. Here, we review these mechanisms, which may also explain the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney function in patients without T2D.

### SGLT2 inhibition for the prevention and treatment of diabetic kidney disease: a review [^117LBhtp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease in the United States and the world alike, and there is a great unmet need for treatments to reduce DKD development and progression. Inhibition of sodium/glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal tubule of the kidney has emerged as an effective antihyperglycemic treatment, leading to regulatory approval of several first-generation SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In follow-on clinical trials for the cardiovascular safety of the SGLT2 inhibitors, secondary effects to prevent or reduce albuminuria and decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate spurred further investigation into their potential application in DKD. This review summarizes the current understanding of mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors block glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule and improve systemic glucose homeostasis, the hypothesized mechanisms for kidney-protective effects of SGLT2 inhibition, and current recommendations for use of this class of antihyperglycemic agents in diabetic patients with low estimated glomerular filtration rates. Results of ongoing clinical trials in patients with DKD are eagerly awaited to expand knowledge of how SGLT2 inhibitors might be used for prevention and treatment.

The safety of combined therapy with SGLT2 inhibitors

Although the combined therapy have potential renoprotection and CV safety, receiving SGLT2 inhibitors may lead to adverse effects like genital mycotic and urinary tract infections even it combined with other drugs. This may be attributed to the increased and prolonged glucosuria induced by SGLT2 inhibitors. And then, adverse effect of SGLT2 inhibitors therapy reported by a study is osmotic diuresis which leads to dehydration, hypotension and renal impairment. Intravascular volume depletion, a dose-dependent increase in serum creatinine and a known marker of renal damage are also discovered in SGLT2 inhibitors treatment in patients with T2DM. In addition, efficacy in lowering glucose levels of SGLT2 inhibitors depends in the filtration rate in the kidneys, so it has shown no efficacy in reducing HbA1c levels in patients with severe renal impairment, ESRD and patients on dialysis, as well as some moderate renal impairment.

Above all, although these side effects are in most cases not of serious nature, patients and the health care providers should be aware of them, in any case. In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors should be prescribed with caution in T2DM patients with significant renal impairment. Maybe health care providers should limit the capacity of this drug class in treating severe DKD patients.

### How do SGLT2 inhibitors protect the kidney? A mediation analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^111jFD2C]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) trial, the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin reduced the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy by 39%, and the composite kidney outcome of doubling of serum creatinine, initiation of renal replacement therapy or death due to kidney disease by 46% versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established cardiovascular disease. Studies have also suggested that empagliflozin reduces the risk of adverse kidney outcomes across a wide range of kidney disease stages in patients with T2D and cardiovascular disease, and also in those with heart failure and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) irrespective of the presence of T2D. More recently, the CREDENCE, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce kidney disease progression in patients with CKD. DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY included a substantial proportion of patients without T2D and reported consistent benefits regardless of presence of diabetes. This finding is supported by a meta-analysis of SGLT2 inhibitor studies. However, the underlying mechanisms of these highly impactful effects remain incompletely understood.

### Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 and the diabetic kidney [^114RbqLZ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule occurs predominantly via the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2). There has been intense interest in this transporter as a number of SGLT2 inhibitors have entered clinical development. SGLT2 inhibitors act to lower plasma glucose by promoting glycosuria and this review aims to outline the effect on the diabetic kidney of this hypoglycaemic agent.

Recent Findings

This review provides an overview of recent findings in this area: the transcriptional control of SGLT2 expression in human proximal tubular cells implicates a number of cytokines in the alteration of SGLT2 expression; experimental data show that SGLT2 inhibition may correct early detrimental effects of diabetes by reducing proximal tubular sodium and glucose transport, suggesting a possible renoprotective effect independent of the glucose lowering effects of these agents; and the nonglycaemic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors may have an impact on renal outcomes.

Summary

The available clinical evidence shows consistent reduction in glycaemic parameters and some evidence suggests additional effects including weight loss and mild blood pressure reduction. There are some side effects that warrant further investigation and establishing whether SGLT2 inhibition provides a renal benefit relies on future long-term studies with specific renal end-points.

Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in T2DM

Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are now established blood glucose-lowering and body weight-lowering agents used in the treatment of T2DM. Their competitive inhibition of SGLT2 in the proximal renal tubules reduces the reabsorption of glucose from the renal filtrate. The resulting glucosuria accounts for the lowering of blood glucose, and the caloric loss enables the lowering of body weight (Figure 1). The reduced glucotoxicity and reduced adiposity then reduce insulin resistance and insulin concentrations.

Beyond their metabolic effects, SGLT2 inhibitors also offer cardioprotective and renoprotective properties. Typically, they reduce blood pressure in hypertensive individuals, attributed at least in part to the osmotic diuresis created by the glucosuria. The anti-hypertensive effect likely contributes to reductions in the onset and severity of heart failure by SGLT2 inhibitors (whether preserved or reduced ejection fraction): these effects are independent of blood glucose and body weight and are evident in people with or without T2DM. However, increased lipolysis in response to caloric deficit and reduced insulin enable SGLT2 inhibitors to improve cardiac energetics by increasing the availability and use of ketones and fatty acids by the myocardium (rather than glucose). Other effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on myocardial energy metabolism have been proposed, – and beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on atherosclerotic vascular disease have been noted in some studies, linked with reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress.
