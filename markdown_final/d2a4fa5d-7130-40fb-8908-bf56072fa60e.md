## Question

Can nasal congestion in children be a sign of an underlying allergy or infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether nasal congestion in children can signal an underlying allergy or infection, and how to differentiate and manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify rhinitis by mechanism. Then, I should compare clinical features that distinguish allergic from infectious etiologies. Next, I will consider comorbidities and the unified airway concept. After that, I need to outline the diagnostic approach, including when to test for allergens. Finally, I will synthesize a management plan and a concise conclusion, ensuring each step is evidence-linked and clinically coherent.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Rhinitis in children is typically categorized as allergic (IgE-mediated), infectious (most often viral, with bacterial rhinosinusitis as a subset), and nonallergic/noninfectious, so nasal congestion is a common final pathway across multiple mechanisms rather than a disease unto itself [^115a6bxm] [^1172H5kQ] [^111jPXAB].

> I will now examine allergic rhinitis features. Children with allergic rhinitis commonly have nasal congestion alongside clear watery rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching of the nose, palate, or eyes. On exam, the nasal mucosa is pale or bluish with clear secretions, and external stigmata such as an allergic crease or allergic shiners may be present, especially with perennial disease. A personal or family history of atopy supports the diagnosis, and the temporal pattern is often seasonal or exposure-linked, with rapid onset after allergen contact and potential for persistent symptoms in moderate to severe disease [^111jPXAB] [^115a6bxm] [^112CBRBR].

> Wait, let me verify infectious rhinitis features to avoid premature anchoring. Acute viral URIs usually bring congestion with watery or mucous discharge and are self-limited, often accompanied by cough, fever, and myalgias; in contrast, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is suspected when symptoms persist beyond 10 days without improvement, worsen after initial improvement, or have a severe onset with high fever and purulent discharge, with pediatric features including irritability, cough, and even vomiting from mucus; the average child has several viral URIs yearly, which helps set expectations for frequency [^111k46fJ] [^1124vQyJ] [^112CBRBR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Duration and associated symptoms matter. Persistent, recurrent, or exposure-patterned congestion with ocular itch, sneezing, and clear secretions favors allergy, whereas brief, febrile, mucopurulent episodes with systemic viral symptoms favor infection. The "unified airway" concept reminds me to assess for lower airway disease, since AR frequently coexists with asthma and may worsen control if undertreated [^113VwC4S] [^115a6bxm] [^112k8ZYU].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. Let me first confirm that a careful history and physical exam often suffice. I need to check symptom chronology, triggers, seasonality, and family atopy, and look for pale edematous turbinates with clear rhinorrhea and ocular signs. If the diagnosis is uncertain or if empiric therapy fails, specific IgE testing (skin or serum) is appropriate to confirm sensitization and guide avoidance or immunotherapy, but I should remember that a positive test reflects sensitization and must be interpreted in clinical context. In complex or refractory cases, nasal allergen challenge can be considered, though feasibility varies by setting [^112CBRBR] [^116sZ8XX] [^1138Kkra].

> Let me consider important comorbidities before I move to treatment. Children with chronic or recurrent congestion should be assessed for asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, and otitis media, as these commonly accompany AR and may be impacted by its control; conversely, children with persistent or recurrent bacterial rhinosinusitis warrant evaluation for AR, immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis, ciliary disorders, and anatomic obstruction to optimize management [^115UjSof] [^112zTZDg] [^113NV4BB].

> Now, I should outline evidence-based management for allergic congestion. Intranasal corticosteroids are first-line for children with clinically significant AR, with favorable benefit–risk and improvement in congestion and quality of life; second-generation oral antihistamines help sneeze and itch but have limited impact on congestion, while intranasal antihistamines offer rapid onset and may be added; allergen avoidance and, for refractory cases, allergen immunotherapy are appropriate; I should confirm that some agents have age restrictions, so product labeling matters in younger children [^111tXiaK] [^112FVUn4] [^116Cmejr].

> For infectious congestion, I need to ensure supportive care and judicious antibiotics. Acute viral URIs require hydration, analgesics, and saline; antibiotics are not indicated; for suspected acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, antibiotics improve short-term outcomes but benefit is modest, and observation with close follow-up is reasonable in selected persistent cases; short-term topical decongestants can be used cautiously in older children with severe mucosal edema to improve airflow, but duration should be limited to avoid rebound; I should double-check age-related precautions for systemic decongestants in young children [^111k46fJ] [^114zRvDH] [^113MV1hA].

> But wait, what if congestion persists despite guideline therapy? I should reconsider the differential: nonallergic rhinitis, adenoid hypertrophy, structural anomalies, or local allergic rhinitis. In carefully selected children with persistent anatomic obstruction from enlarged turbinates despite maximal medical therapy, inferior turbinate procedures can improve sinonasal quality of life and reduce medication burden, though this is reserved for refractory cases and requires ENT evaluation [^115rfotL] [^113r1mtp].

> Let me synthesize the answer to the user's question. Yes, nasal congestion in children commonly signals an underlying cause, most frequently allergic rhinitis or a viral upper respiratory infection, with bacterial rhinosinusitis as a distinct subset when symptoms persist, worsen, or are severe; distinguishing features include chronicity, exposure patterns, ocular itch, and clear secretions for allergy versus acute, febrile, mucopurulent courses for infection; because allergic rhinitis is the most common chronic disease in children and is frequently underrecognized, persistent or recurrent congestion warrants evaluation for AR and its comorbidities, followed by guideline-directed therapy and, when needed, allergy testing to guide long-term management [^112FVUn4] [^115a6bxm] [^112CBRBR].

Nasal congestion in children most often reflects **allergic rhinitis** or **infectious rhinosinusitis** [^notfound], with allergies typically causing persistent, clear rhinorrhea and itching, and infections causing shorter, purulent discharge with fever or cough [^111k46fJ]. Allergic rhinitis is the most common chronic nasal disease in children and can significantly impair sleep, school performance, and quality of life [^112FVUn4]; it also coexists with asthma in 40–50% of cases, so persistent congestion warrants evaluation for allergies and asthma [^114ubMLX] [^112FVUn4]. Infectious causes are common, but persistent or recurrent congestion (> 10 days) should prompt assessment for secondary bacterial sinusitis or underlying allergic disease [^1124vQyJ] [^113LakQP]. Management is cause-specific: intranasal corticosteroids and antihistamines for allergies [^111tXiaK] [^111jPXAB], and antibiotics only for confirmed bacterial infection [^111k46fJ]; avoid routine imaging or prolonged decongestants [^111jPXAB] [^113K7Fcs].

## Allergic rhinitis as a cause of nasal congestion

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the **most common chronic nasal disease in children**, with a prevalence of 15–40% worldwide [^112La5Pc] [^116taeyX]. It is an IgE-mediated inflammatory response to airborne allergens, causing nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal itching [^112k8ZYU] [^111jPXAB].

### Clinical features distinguishing allergic rhinitis from infectious causes

| **Feature** | **Allergic rhinitis** | **Infectious rhinosinusitis** |
|-|-|-|
| Symptom duration | Persistent (> 4 days/week, > 4 weeks) | Acute (< 10 days) or subacute (10–30 days) |
| Nasal discharge | Clear, watery | Thick, purulent, yellow/green |
| Associated symptoms | Sneezing, itching, watery eyes, allergic shiners | Fever, cough, facial pain, irritability |
| Seasonality | Common (seasonal or perennial) | Less common, often follows URI |
| Family history | Common (atopy) | Less common |

---

### Comorbidities and complications

AR is strongly associated with asthma, with 40–50% of children with AR also having asthma; AR can exacerbate asthma and impair control [^113NV4BB] [^112uwAao]. It also causes sleep disturbance, fatigue, and cognitive impairment, which can reduce school performance and quality of life [^1162ypbP] [^112uwAao].

---

## Infectious causes of nasal congestion

Infectious rhinosinusitis is common in children, with viral URIs accounting for most cases; bacterial infection is suggested by persistent symptoms (> 10 days), worsening after initial improvement, or severe onset with fever and purulent discharge [^111k46fJ] [^1124vQyJ]. Recurrent or chronic infections should prompt evaluation for underlying allergies, immunodeficiency, or structural abnormalities [^112zTZDg] [^116xoKv1].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, guided by history and examination [^111jPXAB] [^115RUTeN]. Allergy testing (skin prick or serum IgE) is indicated for persistent symptoms, uncertain diagnosis, or when identifying triggers will guide therapy [^116sZ8XX] [^112FVUn4]. Imaging is not routine and is reserved for complications or refractory cases [^112FVUn4].

---

## Management strategies

### Allergic rhinitis

- **Intranasal corticosteroids**: First-line for moderate-severe symptoms; superior to antihistamines for congestion [^111tXiaK] [^114rNVDH].
- **Second-generation antihistamines**: Effective for sneezing and itching; limited impact on congestion [^112FVUn4] [^1162ypbP].
- **Allergen avoidance**: Environmental controls (HEPA, bedding covers) reduce exposure [^112FVUn4] [^112vNYJw].
- **Immunotherapy**: For refractory cases or when pharmacotherapy is inadequate [^112FVUn4].

---

### Infectious rhinosinusitis

- **Supportive care**: Saline irrigation, analgesics, and hydration are first-line [^notfound].
- **Antibiotics**: Reserved for confirmed bacterial infection or persistent symptoms (> 10 days) without improvement [^114zRvDH].
- **Avoidance of decongestants**: Prolonged use (> 5 days) can cause rebound congestion [^113MV1hA].

---

## Conclusion

Nasal congestion in children most often reflects **allergic rhinitis** or **infectious rhinosinusitis** [^notfound]. Persistent or recurrent congestion should prompt evaluation for allergies and asthma, as AR is common and can significantly impact quality of life and school performance [^1131mTQC] [^115fgKns]. Management is cause-specific: intranasal corticosteroids and antihistamines for allergies, and **antibiotics only for confirmed bacterial infection** [^112FVUn4] [^114zRvDH].

Prasad A, Thompson JL, Thompson LA. What Parents Should Know About Allergic Rhinitis. JAMA Pediatr. 2025; 179:

356. doi:
10. 1001/jamapediatrics.
2024. 5616 Allergic rhinitis causes symptoms like a runny or itchy nose, sneezing, and stuffiness. Allergic rhinitis is a reaction by the body to things such as pollens, animal dander, and dust mites. The symptoms show up most often during specific times of the year, so sometimes it is also called "seasonal allergies. " The most common time to develop allergic rhinitis is in later childhood and adolescence. Your child's physician can usually diagnose this condition based on their history and by examining them. Understanding when the symptoms started, when they worsen, patterns of symptoms, and the effect of certain medications like antihistamines can help differentiate allergic rhinitis from other problems.

Because it takes several years of exposure to allergens for the body to develop this kind of response, it is uncommon for infants and toddlers to have seasonal allergies. These younger children are more likely to have frequent colds from viruses that cause symptoms similar to allergies. Children who have allergic rhinitis often have findings that their physicians can see when they examine them. In addition to having a runny nose, children might have a crease across their nose from frequent wiping. They also may have darker coloring under their eyes, nicknamed "allergic shiners. " Children sometimes cannot breathe through their nose due to it always being stuffy. Finally, their eyes might tear up, be itchy, or appear red or puffy. If there are concerns for allergies as a cause of the symptoms, testing for allergies with an allergist may be needed if medications listed below do not help.

Finding out if common triggers are causing the symptoms can be done by either skin testing or a blood test. Skin testing involves pricking the skin lightly with the allergen and watching for the development of a hive in that area within 15 to 20 minutes. Children who cannot get symptom control with these medications or who have other conditions, such as asthma, that are triggered by allergens should be referred to an allergist to discuss allergy shots as a treatment option. Allergy symptoms can be bothersome to children, but they can also be treated.

### Paediatric rhinitis: position paper of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology [^115TzZet]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Rhinitis is a common problem in childhood and adolescence and impacts negatively on physical, social and psychological well-being. This position paper, prepared by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Taskforce on Rhinitis in Children, aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and therapy of paediatric rhinitis. Rhinitis is characterized by at least two nasal symptoms: rhinorrhoea, blockage, sneezing or itching. It is classified as allergic rhinitis, infectious rhinitis and nonallergic, noninfectious rhinitis. Similar symptoms may occur with other conditions such as adenoidal hypertrophy, septal deviation and nasal polyps. Examination by anterior rhinoscopy and allergy tests may help to substantiate a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. Avoidance of relevant allergens may be helpful for allergic rhinitis (AR). Oral and intranasal antihistamines and nasal corticosteroids are both appropriate for first-line AR treatment although the latter are more effective. Once-daily forms of corticosteroids are preferred given their improved safety profile. Potentially useful add-on therapies for AR include oral leukotriene receptor antagonists, short bursts of a nasal decongestant, saline douches and nasal anticholinergics. Allergen-specific immunotherapy is helpful in IgE-mediated AR and may prevent the progression of allergic disease. There are still a number of areas that need to be clarified in the management of rhinitis in children and adolescents.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^116E4pgp]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) research priorities — identified needs include defining comorbidity links and treatment effects, assessing adherence and trial diversity, evaluating novel immunotherapy approaches, examining asthma immunomodulator impacts on AR, clarifying the value of different allergy testing methods, studying combined allergen formulations, and developing outcome measures using SN-5 to compare therapies across ages, as stated in: "Research is needed to determine the relationship between AR and comorbid conditions such as otitis media and sinusitis. In addition, research is needed to determine the effect of AR treatment on comorbid conditions and the effect of treatment for comorbid conditions on AR", "Research is needed regarding the impact of patient adherence to different treatments, and treatment outcomes… There is a need for increased diversity in trial subjects… as well as the impact of patient education aids on patient adherence and subsequent outcomes", "More research, including basic and/or translational trials, is needed to evaluate novel forms of immunotherapy such as peptide vaccines, DNA conjugated vaccines, intradermal injections, and intralymphatic injections", "Analysis is needed of the impact of immunomodulatory agents for the treatment of asthma on AR", "It should be determined whether different forms of allergy testing can provide clinically meaningful information. It is still unclear whether one form of testing is superior to the other in identifying clinically relevant allergens", "Studies are needed to determine the effect of combined allergen formulations for AR that are standardized, tolerable, and effectively dosed", and "Outcome measures are needed using SN-5 or other tools to measure and compare efficacy of medical and surgical treatments for nasal congestion/AR in both children and adults".

### Allergic rhinitis: broader disease effects and implications for management [^114ubMLX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is a burdensome disease for a significant part of the population in both adults and children. Poorly controlled allergic rhinitis can trigger exacerbations of asthma, sinusitis, and otitis media, diseases with which it shares common pathophysiologic elements. Consequently, early diagnosis and treatment should be a priority for patients and physicians, not only to control the symptoms of allergic rhinitis but also to improve the management of associated diseases. Several pharmacologic therapies can be considered in an armamentarium that includes antihistamines (intranasal and systemic), intranasal cromolyn, intranasal anticholinergic agents, intranasal steroids, systemic steroids, immunotherapy, and, most recently, leukotriene receptor antagonists. Often, combinations of these treatments are used to maximize control of refractory symptoms.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^115a6bxm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Patient-reported symptoms and likely diagnosis — Allergic rhinitis (AR), nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), acute upper respiratory tract infection, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyps, and CRS with nasal polyps — are contrasted by frequency descriptors. Rhinorrhea/sniffing in AR is described as very common with clear watery discharge, whereas NAR is common but less than AR overall; in acute infection it is common and may be clear to purulent and watery to mucoid with crusts; and in CRS (with or without nasal polyps) it is common and clear to mucoid. Ocular pruritus/watery discharge/red eyes is very common in AR but uncommon in NAR and acute infection and very uncommon in CRS. Nasal congestion or blocked nose/mouth breathing is very common and persistent in AR and very common, chronic, almost universal in CRS with nasal polyps. Facial or sinus pain/pressure is very uncommon in AR yet common in acute infection and in CRS without nasal polyps. Postnasal drip is uncommon and persistent in AR but very common in NAR and common in acute infection and CRS without nasal polyps. Nasal/palate/ear itching is common in AR and very uncommon in NAR, acute infection, and CRS with or without nasal polyps. Snoring is uncommon and persistent in AR but common in the other listed conditions, and sleep disturbance/sleep apnea is common across all listed conditions. Frequencies are based on expert evidence and opinion and the table was developed based predominantly on expert opinion.

### Impact of comorbid conditions on asthmatic adults and children [^115o2YiB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Symptoms and diagnosis

Nasal itching, sneezing, increased nasal secretions, nasal obstruction and cough are common symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis. However, rhinitis may also cause less obvious symptoms, such as lassitude and sleepiness, as a consequence of sleep disturbances. If these are the presenting symptoms, the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis may be missed if the patient or caregiver is not actively questioned about nasal symptoms. In a study in the USA, 53% of children with asthma and comorbid allergic rhinitis remained undiagnosed until they were clinically evaluated for the study. Similar rates of underdiagnosis (32–45%) have also been reported in adultsand could be due to under-reporting by patients or caregivers and poor recognition of rhinitis symptoms by physicians.

As rhinitis and asthma tend to coexist, the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma guidelines highlight the importance of routinely investigating the presence of asthma in patients with persistent rhinitis. Similarly, the Global Initiative for Asthma's (GINA's) Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention and the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program's Expert Panel Report for the diagnosis and management of asthma recommend an evaluation for comorbid allergic rhinitis in patients with asthma, especially in severe asthma. Evaluation entails enquiring into patient history and making a physical examination. Patient history should include careful attention to environmental exposures, with a focus on precipitating factors and the impact of symptoms on quality of life. Validated questionnaires such as the Total Nasal Symptom Score and Sinonasal Questionnaire may be used to give an objective assesssment. Physical examination may show rhinorrhoea, enlargement and pallor of the inferior nasal turbinates, conjunctival infection and increased lacrimation (which are usually features of co-existent acute conjunctivitis), Dennie–Morgan lines (a fold in the skin below the lower eyelid), allergic shiners (dark circles under the eyes resembling bruises), a transverse nasal crease, sinus tenderness and nasal polyps. Sensitisation to suspected allergens can be assessed by testing for allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies or allergen skin prick testing. In vitro assays for serum allergen-specific IgE can be performed for patients who cannot have skin testing due to dermatographism or recent oral antihistamine use. However, results of such allergen testing can be difficult to interpret in patients with asthma and may simply reflect exposure rather than causation of the symptoms.

### An algorithm recommendation for the pharmacological management of allergic rhinitis in the UK: a consensus statement from an expert panel [^114S7y7G]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

How AR can affect patients?

AR a common condition that affects > 20% of the UK population, is a frequent presenting problem in primary care, and is increasing in prevalence. It is associated with considerable morbidity; significantly reducing quality of life, interfering with attendance and performance at school and work, – and resulting in considerable health-care and indirect costs. – Around 50–80% of AR patients report that their condition interferes with sleep, resulting in daytime fatigue, decreased alertness, inability to concentrate, depression and irritability. AR is also associated with a number of coexisting conditions, including asthma, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media with effusion and nasal polyposis.

### WITHDRAWN: antibiotics for persistent nasal discharge (rhinosinusitis) in children [^113EjhWp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Nasal discharge (rhinosinusitis) is extremely common in children. It is the result of inflammation of the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and is usually due to either infection or allergy. Infections may be caused by bacteria.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of antibiotics versus placebo or standard therapy in treating children with persistent nasal discharge (rhinosinusitis) for at least 10 days.

Search Strategy

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005) which includes the ARI Group's specialised trials register; MEDLINE (1966 to April Week 3, 2005) EMBASE (1997 to December 2004), and the references of relevant articles were searched. Authors and pharmaceutical companies were contacted.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that compared antibiotics versus placebo or standard therapy. Trials which included the use of other medications were included if all participants were allowed equal access to such medications or if the additional or alternative therapies were regarded as ineffective. Trials that only combined or compared antibiotics with surgery, or sinus puncture and lavage, were not included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by a single author for the following eight outcomes: overall clinical failure (primary outcome), failure to cure, failure to improve, clinical improvement, time to resolution, complications, side-effects and bacteriologic failure. For the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, proportional and absolute risk reductions were calculated using a modified intention-to-treat analysis. The summary weighted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) (fixed effect model) were calculated using the inverse of the variance of each study result for weighting (Cochrane statistical package, RevMan version 4.2).

Main Results

A total of six studies involving 562 children compared antibiotics with placebo or standard therapy. All studies were randomised but most were still susceptible to bias. Five of the studies were conducted in emergency, allergy or ENT clinics. Four of the studies required children to have x-ray changes consistent with sinusitis. Only the primary outcome (overall clinical failure) was reported in all studies. Around 40% of all randomised children did not have a clinical success documented when reviewed two to six weeks after randomisation. The control event rate varied from to 22 to 71% (mean 46%). The risk ratio estimated using a fixed effects model was 0.75 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.92). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity. Side effects (sufficient to cease treatment) occurred in 4 of 189 control group children (four studies). More children treated with antibiotics had side effects (17 of 330), but this difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 4.82).

Authors' Conclusions

For children with persistent nasal discharge or older children with radiographically confirmed sinusitis, the available evidence suggests that antibiotics will reduce the probability of persistence in the short to medium-term. The benefits appear to be modest and around eight children must be treated in order to achieve one additional cure (number needed to treat (NNT) 8, 95% CI 5 to 29). No long term benefits have been documented. These conclusions are based on a small number of small randomised controlled trials and may require revision as additional data become available.

### The role of leukotrienes in nasal allergy [^113PUeDq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This review focuses on the role of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) in nasal allergy. The purpose was to provide knowledge of the role of cysLTs in the pathophysiology of nasal allergy and the role of antileukotrienes in the treatment of nasal allergies. Materials and methods We conducted a literature review.

Results

The proinflammatory effects of cysLTs have been well described in asthma. Antileukotrienes have proved to be an effective anti-inflammatory treatment for asthma patients. Similar to pathogenesis of asthma, cysLTs exert potent inflammatory effects in the upper airways and play a role in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis and other nasal allergies.

Conclusion

Antileukotriene treatment appears to be beneficial in nasal allergies. Allergic rhinitis is a complex, IgE-mediated inflammatory disease of the upper airways. It is the most common allergic disease, occurring in 10% to 30% of adults and up to 30% of children. It may be perennial or seasonal. Sneezing, itching, watery rhinorrhea, and nasal obstruction are classic symptoms. It may impair cognition, school/work performance and productivity, behavior, mood, and quality of life. On physical examination, clear secretions, nasal congestion, pink-bluish nasal mucosa, the allergic salute, and allergic shiners may be detected. Allergic rhinitis is a common comorbid condition with asthma, sinusitis, otitis media, nasal polyposis, and respiratory infections.

### Clinical practice. allergic rhinitis [^114WqBMt]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on allergic rhinitis:

- Definition: Allergic rhinitis is an inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa characterized by symptoms of sneezing, nasal pruritus, airflow obstruction, and clear nasal discharge.
- Pathophysiology: Common allergens that are associated with allergic rhinitis include pollen and mites (67%), animal dander and pollutants (23%), and fungal allergens (21%).
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis is estimated at 14% in the US.
- Disease course: In patients with allergic rhinitis, exposure to allergens triggers an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, leading to mucosal inflammation and associated nasal symptoms. Type 2 helper T cells play a role in maintaining persistent mucosal inflammation beyond the time of allergen exposure.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Allergic rhinitis can impair QoL by interrupting sleep. It is associated with work performance impairment and missed work time.

Indications include "Diagnosis of seasonal and perennial AR", "Diagnose LAR", "Confirm allergen reactivity in polysensitized patients prior to initiating AIT", "Diagnose OR", and investigation of mechanisms and anti-allergic medications. Absolute contraindications are "Acute inflammation in the nose or sinuses (sinusitis)", "Poorly controlled asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (possible bronchospasm)", "Severe comorbidities (cardiopulmonary diseases, impairment of lung capacity) that can be worsened by the test", and "Pregnancy". Relative and temporary contraindications include "Children younger than 5 years (mostly for lack of collaboration)", "Nasal or sinus surgery within the previous 6–8 weeks (false-positive response due to baseline inflammation)", "Recent infection or vaccination (false-positive response due to baseline inflammation)", and "Use of alcohol or tobacco 24–48 hours prior to NAC (false-positive response for airway irritation)".

Respiratory, conjunctival, and nasal challenge testing — Respiratory challenge tests are used when an objective gold standard for establishing clinical sensitivity is indicated. Conjunctival challenge tests are usually conducted for suspected localized eye allergy and in some cases may also be helpful in investigating nasal allergy; they are evaluated by symptoms of itching and objective indices, including tear volume, amount of mucus, and palpebral or bulbar erythema. Nasal challenge provides objective evidence of clinical sensitivity when the diagnosis is in question or when evaluation of therapeutic management is desirable, and responses are evaluated by subjective symptoms and objective measurements of nasal airway resistance, the number of sneezes, and the measurement of inflammatory mediators in nasal secretions.

### Chronic sinusitis in children [^115tJ7HH]. Clinical Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines for the management of acute sinusitis in children have been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Of note is that in this document, a brief discussion of chronic disease concluded that the pathogenesis and management are essentially unknown. Although there are insufficient data in the literature to develop evidence-based clinical guidelines, a careful review of the literature and clinical experience of experts who manage pediatric chronic sinusitis is presented in an effort to develop specific recommendations and to offer practical treatment options. Factors associated with chronic sinusitis should be addressed individually and include recurrent viral upper respiratory infections, allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency, and anatomic abnormalities. Bacteriology includes the 3 pathogens associated with acute disease i.e. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis but with chronic sinusitis also includes Staphylococcus aureus, anaerobic bacteria, and fungi. Medical interventions discussed include endoscopic sinus surgery, saline nasal irrigation, intranasal decongestant therapy, intranasal steroids, and oral antibiotics. Clinical ranking without regard to side effects and cost suggests that endoscopic sinus surgery and antral irrigation have the highest probability of substantial symptom improvement. Other issues discussed include identification and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), allergy, and immune deficiency.

### Optimal management of allergic rhinitis [^112uwAao]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rhinitis, which can be allergic, infectious or neither of these, is defined as at least two nasal symptoms, including rhinorrhoea, blockage, sneezing and itching. It is a common problem in childhood and adolescence which impacts negatively on physical, social and psychological well-being.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an under-recognised inflammatory condition of the nasal mucosa, caused by immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated early-phase and late-phase hypersensitivity responses, usually to inhalant allergens, similar to those in allergic asthma. Typical allergens include house dust mite, grass and tree pollens, dander from animals such as cat, dog, horse and, occasionally, moulds. Different phenotypes exist; those with obvious symptoms of sneezing and running, who are easily recognised, and others with predominant blockage, where the diagnosis may be missed. Children with AR can present with symptoms related to nasal connections, such as lungs, throat, ears, (table 1) or to quality-of-life impairment, often related to poor quality sleep and consequent fatigue, poor concentration and school performance.

Table 1
Recognising rhinitis in childhood

AR is often part of a systemic inflammatory process associated with other inflammatory conditions, including allergic conjunctivitis (AC), rhinosinusitis and asthma. Asthma shows an increased prevalence in children with both allergicand non-allergic rhinitis. A higher prevalence of asthma is found among those suffering from persistent and more severe rhinitis. Over three-quarters of children with asthma also have ARwhich is associated with poor asthma control. Minimal persistent allergic inflammation of the nasal mucosasynergises with infective inflammation; thus, subjects with AR have more problems with viral colds, and the combination in children of allergic sensitisation, relevant allergen exposure and viral cold gives a high risk for hospital admission for asthma in children. Poor asthma control is found in children with moderate to severe rhinitis, which should be identified and treated.

### Manifestations of inhalant allergies beyond the nose [^113kcgtw]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The upper and lower airways are linked epidemiologically and pathophysiologically. The upper and lower airways are considered a single, functional unit characterized by shared immunologic mechanisms, often referred to as the unified airway. Upper and lower airway inflammatory disease frequently coexist in the same patient. Allergic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis are associated with asthma. Treatment of both diseases impacts asthma outcomes. The otolaryngologist may be the first physician to suspect and diagnose asthma in patients with upper airway complaints. A thorough understanding of the relationship between allergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, and asthma will facilitate early identification of asthma and improve patient outcomes.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) comorbidities and asthma linkage — evaluation and treatment guidance emphasize that over half of patients with asthma have AR and 10% to 40% of patients with AR have asthma, and in one study 57.6% of children with early childhood eczema developed AR and 34.1% became asthmatic. Evaluation of a patient with AR should always include an assessment for asthma, be repeated on follow-up visits, and spirometry should be performed whenever asthma is suspected. Treatment of AR in patients with concurrent asthma should be individualized; the use of oral antihistamines and especially intranasal steroids (INS) has been shown to reduce bronchial hyperreactivity and improve asthma control; leukotriene receptor antagonists may be an appropriate choice even though they are not first-line therapy for independent AR; and immunotherapy can benefit both conditions with evidence in children for prevention of asthma and sensitivity to new allergens. Nasal blockage and impaired mucociliary clearance may predispose patients with AR to sinus infection; however, a definite relationship is not well established, adenoid hypertrophy must also be considered in children, and there may be an association between AR and otitis media with effusion with reports of comorbidity varying widely from 16.3 to 89%.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^1124vQyJ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis — history of rhinosinusitis identifies that acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is suspected in patients whose upper respiratory infection (URI) has persisted beyond 7 to 10 days or is worsening after initial improvement, and symptoms lasting 5 to 10 days are the most difficult to assess because they may reflect an ongoing viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or the beginning of a bacterial infection. In adults, prominent symptoms include nasal congestion, obstruction, anterior and/or posterior purulent rhinorrhea, and facial pain or pressure, and a history of persistent purulent rhinorrhea and facial pain appear to have some correlation with increased likelihood of bacterial disease; in children, symptoms often also include increased irritability, even more prolonged cough, and vomiting that occurs in association with gagging on mucus. In contrast to ABRS, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone and can be subdivided into CRSsNP and CRSwNP; patients with CRSwNP generally present with periodic exacerbations with increased facial pain or pressure and increased drainage, and fever is absent or low grade with persistence of some sinonasal symptoms between episodes that distinguishes CRS from recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS), in which the patient is asymptomatic between ABRS episodes.

### Allergy relief for your child… [^116SpnUo]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

When a child's sniffles and sneezing won't go away for weeks, the cause might be allergies. Long-lasting sneezing, with a stuffy or runny nose, could signal the presence of allergic rhinitis — the collection of symptoms that affect the nose when you have an allergic reaction to something you breathe in, and it lands on the lining inside the nose. Allergies can be seasonal or year-round. In most parts of the U. S., plant pollens are often the cause of seasonal allergic rhinitis, more commonly called hay fever. Indoor substances — such as mold, dust mites and pet dander — can cause the perennial kind. Up to 40% of children suffer from allergic rhinitis. And children are more likely to develop allergies if one or both parents have allergies. Allergy: The Body's Reaction to Allergens An allergy is the body's reaction to a usually harmless substance, or allergen.

Our immune system responds to the invading allergen by releasing histamine and other chemicals that typically trigger symptoms in the nose, lungs, throat, sinuses, ears, eyes or skin. In some children, allergies can also trigger symptoms of asthma, a disease that causes wheezing or difficulty breathing. If a child has allergies and asthma, not controlling the allergies can make asthma worse. Avoid Pollen, Mold and Other Allergy Triggers If your child has seasonal allergies, pay attention to pollen counts and try to keep your child inside when the levels are high. Keep in mind:

- In late summer and early fall, during ragweed pollen season, pollen levels are highest in the morning.
- In spring and summer, during the grass pollen season, pollen levels are highest in the evening.
- Some molds, another allergy trigger, may also be seasonal. For example, leaf mold is more common in fall.
- Sunny, windy days can be especially troublesome for pollen allergy sufferers.

After allergy testing, typically by skin testing to detect what allergens your child may react to, a health care professional injects the child with "extracts, " small amounts of the allergens that trigger a reaction. The doses are gradually increased so that the body builds up immunity to these allergens. Allergen extracts are manufactured from natural substances, such as pollens, insect venoms, and animal hair. More than 1, 200 extracts are licensed by the FDA.

### Intranasal corticosteroids for non-allergic rhinitis [^115rfotL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-allergic rhinitis is defined as dysfunction and non-infectious inflammation of the nasal mucosa that is caused by provoking agents other than allergens or microbes. It is common, with an estimated prevalence of around 10% to 20%. Patients experience symptoms of nasal obstruction, anterior rhinorrhoea/post-nasal drip and sneezing. Several subgroups of non-allergic rhinitis can be distinguished, depending on the trigger responsible for symptoms; these include occupation, cigarette smoke, hormones, medication, food and age. On a cellular molecular level different disease mechanisms can also be identified. People with non-allergic rhinitis often lack an effective treatment as a result of poor understanding and lack of recognition of the underlying disease mechanism. Intranasal corticosteroids are one of the most common types of medication prescribed in patients with rhinitis or rhinosinusitis symptoms, including those with non-allergic rhinitis. However, it is unclear whether intranasal corticosteroids are truly effective in these patients.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intranasal corticosteroids in the management of non-allergic rhinitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 7); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 July 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intranasal corticosteroids, delivered by any means and in any volume, with (a) placebo/no intervention or (b) other active treatments in adults and children (aged ≥ 12 years).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were patient-reported disease severity and a significant adverse effect - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes were (disease-specific) health-related quality of life, objective measurements of airflow and other adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 34 studies (4452 participants); however, only 13 studies provided data for our main comparison, intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo. The participants were mainly defined as patients with perennial rhinitis symptoms and negative allergy tests. No distinction between different pheno- and endotypes could be made, although a few studies only included a specific phenotype such as pregnancy rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa or senile rhinitis. Most studies were conducted in a secondary or tertiary healthcare setting. No studies reported outcomes beyond three months follow-up. Intranasal corticosteroid dosage in the review ranged from 50 µg to 2000 µg daily. Intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo Thirteen studies (2045 participants) provided data for this comparison. These studies used different scoring systems for patient-reported disease severity, so we pooled the data in each analysis using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Intranasal corticosteroid treatment may improve patient-reported disease severity as measured by total nasal symptom score compared with placebo at up to four weeks (SMD -0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.15 to -0.33; 4 studies; 131 participants; I² = 22%) (low-certainty evidence). However, between four weeks and three months the evidence is very uncertain (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.20; 3 studies; 85 participants; I² = 0%) (very low-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroid treatment may slightly improve patient-reported disease severity as measured by total nasal symptom score change from baseline when compared with placebo at up to four weeks (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.05; 4 studies; 1465 participants; I² = 35%) (low-certainty evidence). All four studies evaluating the risk of epistaxis showed that there is probably a higher risk in the intranasal corticosteroids group (65 per 1000) compared to placebo (31 per 1000) (risk ratio (RR) 2.10, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.57; 4 studies; 1174 participants; I² = 0%) (moderate-certainty evidence). The absolute risk difference (RD) was 0.04 with a number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) of 25 (95% CI 16.7 to 100). Only one study reported numerical data for quality of life. It did report a higher quality of life score in the intranasal corticosteroids group (152.3 versus 145.6; SF-12v2 range 0 to 800); however, this disappeared at longer-term follow-up (148.4 versus 145.6) (low-certainty evidence). Only two studies provided data for the outcome objective measurements of airflow. These data could not be pooled because they used different methods of outcome measurement. Neither found a significant difference between the intranasal corticosteroids and placebo group (rhinomanometry SMD -0.46, 95% CI -1.06 to 0.14; 44 participants; peak expiratory flow rate SMD 0.78, 95% CI -0.47 to 2.03; 11 participants) (very low-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroids probably resulted in little or no difference in the risk of other adverse events compared to placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; 3 studies; 1130 participants; I² = 0%) (moderate-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroids versus other treatments Only one or a few studies assessed each of the other comparisons (intranasal corticosteroids versus saline irrigation, intranasal antihistamine, capsaicin, cromoglycate sodium, ipratropium bromide, intranasal corticosteroids combined with intranasal antihistamine, intranasal corticosteroids combined with intranasal antihistamine and intranasal corticosteroids with saline compared to saline alone). It is therefore uncertain whether there are differences between intranasal corticosteroids and other active treatments for any of the outcomes reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, the certainty of the evidence for most outcomes in this review was low or very low. It is unclear whether intranasal corticosteroids reduce patient-reported disease severity in non-allergic rhinitis patients compared with placebo when measured at up to three months. However, intranasal corticosteroids probably have a higher risk of the adverse effect epistaxis. There are very few studies comparing intranasal corticosteroids to other treatment modalities making it difficult to draw conclusions.

### Impact of comorbid conditions on asthmatic adults and children [^111JXkGe]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Impact of treatment on asthma outcomes

There is conflicting evidence on the benefits of adequately treating rhinitis in terms of its impact on asthma outcomes. One meta-analysis reported no significant improvement in asthma symptoms or lung function by treating rhinitis with intranasal corticosteroids, even though a trend in improvement was noted. Other studies have shown that treatment does improve disease control and quality of life in asthma patients. For example, in adults, the use of nasal corticosteroids was associated with a significantly reduced risk of asthma-related emergency room treatments and hospitalisations (adjusted odds ratio 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62–0.91] and 0.56 [95% CI 0.42–0.76], respectively). However, no similar studies have been reported in children.

Additional considerations

Consideration should be given to optimal management of sleep disturbances including sleep apnoea (a common comorbid condition in asthma) as a consequence of upper airway obstruction in patients with persistent asthma and comorbid rhinitis. Sleep disturbances can lead to tiredness, irritability, memory deficit, daytime sleepiness and depression, thereby reducing quality of life.

Top tips for identifying rhinitis in primary care

Patients may accept rhinitis as their 'normal', yet it can affect quality of life. Nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and smell restrictions may be common, identifiable symptoms.

Allergic rhinitis is a common disorder that regularly occurs in children and adolescents. The disease is associated with other allergic diseases, such as asthma, and it carries a heavy burden, with effects on sleep, school performance, and quality of life. Classic symptoms include sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, and nasal itching. When the eyes are involved, the term allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is used. Triggers may include airborne pollens, molds, dust mites, and animals. Skin or blood allergy testing can be a useful diagnostic modality that may guide therapy. Immunotherapy can prevent the development of further allergic sensitizations as well as subsequent asthma.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^116xoKv1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP) with symptoms more than 12 weeks is evaluated and managed using an algorithm that begins with evaluation (sinus CT and/or nasal endoscopy, consider culture, consider evaluation for aeroallergens — especially perennial aeroallergens — and other environmental triggers, and consider evaluation for immunodeficiency), followed by initial treatment with topical steroids, nasal saline irrigation, and an oral steroid, with consideration of an oral antibiotic (culture-based, if possible). After the decision point "Treatment successful?", the Yes branch leads to follow up to consider further evaluation of underlying risk factors and to continue individualized medical therapy; the No branch leads to additional treatment and evaluation including sinus CT if not done before (MRI for special cases), consideration of an alternate oral antibiotic, culture if not done before, consideration of immunodeficiency if not done before, consultation by an otolaryngologist for surgery, consideration of aspirin desensitization for aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), consideration of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS), continuation of topical steroid and nasal saline irrigation, and management of comorbid asthma if present. Additional notes state that nasal examination may show mucosal erythema, edema, and purulent secretions in addition to polyps; evaluation should include coronal sinus CT scan, and the CT scan should ideally be performed 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of medical therapy; nasal polyps are relatively uncommon in children, and their presence should prompt evaluation for possible CF; and patients benefit from continued individualized medical therapy, including, when indicated, allergy management.

### Demographics and clinical features of pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis: a single-center study from Western Turkey [^113avbX4]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Allergic rhinitis (AR), defined as an IgE-mediated inflammation of the nasal mucosa triggered by allergen exposure, is among the most common chronic diseases of childhood. Its prevalence varies regionally. Studies in Western countries have reported a prevalence of 30–40% in the pediatric population, whereas it has been reported with a prevalence of 5–35% in Turkey. Although it is not a disease with a poor prognosis, it decreases the quality of life by affecting school success and daily activities in children.

Patients with AR typically present with symptoms including nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching. Additionally, some patients may report eye itching as well as a diminished sense of smell and taste. On physical examination, the nasal mucosa is pale and edematous due to inflammation and increased vascular permeability. Allergic shiner, transverse nasal line, and Dennie Morgan lines are among the findings that can be detected on physical examination in children with AR.

In addition to history and physical examination findings, the diagnosis of AR is supported by SPT and specific IgE (sIgE) tests, which help to identify possible allergens. SPT continues to be the preferred method for identifying atopy due to its greater sensitivity and lower cost compared with serum-specific IgE. Nonetheless, in pediatric populations and particularly in polysensitized cases, serum-specific IgE may be more appropriate due to its higher specificity. However, these tests only indicate allergen sensitization, and nasal allergen stimulation (NAC) is required to show whether the symptoms are directly attributable to the suspected allergen. Most centers follow a diagnostic approach based solely on SPT and serum allergen sIgE, and NAC cannot be performed because it is difficult, time-consuming, and requires equipment.

Classification of rhinitis entities according to phenotypes has facilitated their characterization and helped practicing clinicians to approach rhinitis patients effectively. On the other hand, these phenotypic features may sometimes overlap and sometimes even transform into each other, thus complicating treatment and management. Currently, three different allergic phenotypes of rhinitis are recognized: AR, local allergic rhinitis (LAR), and dual allergic rhinitis (DAR). In this context, a detailed clinical history, comprehensive examination findings, and thorough laboratory evaluations are essential for guiding appropriate management and tailoring treatment strategies to each patient's specific phenotype.

Intranasal steroids (INS) comparative efficacy and additional effects in allergic rhinitis (AR): Placebo-controlled clinical trials demonstrate the effectiveness of INS in the reduction of nasal symptoms including sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and congestion in adults and children with AR, and by reducing nasal symptoms, INS significantly improve the quality of life and sleep of patients with AR; there are no significant differences in efficacy between the available agents, and along with diminished nasal symptoms, INS have beneficial effects on allergic eye symptoms including itching, tearing, redness, and puffiness; comparative studies show that INS are superior to oral H1 antihistamines in controlling nasal symptoms, including nasal congestion, with no significant difference in the relief of ocular symptoms, and INS are more effective than leukotriene receptor antagonists across the range of allergy symptoms, although intranasal antihistamines have a more rapid onset of action than INS in comparison studies; some studies have also suggested that INS improve asthma control in patients suffering from both AR and asthma, and different preparations of INS can be comparable in efficacy, making sensory attributes important for patient preference and adherence.

Nasal congestion is an important symptom in nasal pathology and can be defined as an objective restriction of nasal cavity airflow because of mucosal pathology and/or increased mucus secretion (excluding anatomical variants). Using the new Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, evidence-based recommendations are made that will encompass different clinical questions regarding diagnostic modalities of nasal congestion: (i) their usefulness in assessment of presence and severity of congestion; (ii) their usefulness in assessment of etiological pathology responsible for congestion; and (iii) their usefulness in follow up and treatment effectiveness evaluation of nasal congestion.

Allergic reaction signs and symptoms in infants — organized by target organ — include the following. Skin/subcutaneous tissue manifestations are systemic urticaria, angioedema, flushing. Upper respiratory tract manifestations are rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion. Lower respiratory tract manifestations are cough, wheeze, stridor, shortness of breath, respiratory distress (intercostal retractions, accessory muscle use). Gastrointestinal tract manifestations are persistent profuse vomiting, diarrhea. Cardiovascular manifestations are tachycardia, hypotension. Central nervous system manifestations are behavioral change (irritability, inconsolable crying, clinging to caregiver, lethargy). Skin/subcutaneous tissue is the most common organ system involved in allergic reactions in infants, and the working definition of anaphylaxis applies to children of all ages, including infants.

### Allergic rhinitis: rapid evidence review [^111jPXAB]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis, the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States, is an immunoglobulin E-mediated process. A family history of allergic rhinitis, asthma, or atopic dermatitis increases a patient's risk of being diagnosed with allergic rhinitis. People in the United States are commonly sensitized to grass, dust mites, and ragweed allergens. Dust mite-proof mattress covers do not prevent allergic rhinitis in children two years and younger. Diagnosis is clinical and based on history, physical examination, and at least one symptom of nasal congestion, runny or itchy nose, or sneezing. History should include whether the symptoms are seasonal or perennial, symptom triggers, and severity. Common examination findings are clear rhinorrhea, pale nasal mucosa, swollen nasal turbinates, watery eye discharge, conjunctival swelling, and allergic shiners (i.e., dark circles under the eyes). Serum or skin testing for specific allergens should be performed when there is inadequate response to empiric treatment, if diagnosis is uncertain, or to guide initiation or titration of therapy. Intranasal corticosteroids are first-line treatment for allergic rhinitis. Second-line therapies include antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists and neither shows superiority. If allergy testing is performed, trigger-directed immunotherapy can be effectively delivered subcutaneously or sublingually. High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are not effective at decreasing allergy symptoms. Approximately 1 in 10 patients with allergic rhinitis will develop asthma.

### Treatment of allergic rhinitis [^112vNYJw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis, a common and often debilitating disease marked by rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing, is on the increase worldwide. Treatment involves allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy, and, in selected cases, immunotherapy. This overview describes the characteristics, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. The major contributing allergens of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis are identified. Pharmacotherapy is described within the context of treatment guidelines developed by the major asthma and allergy professional organizations. Oral H1 antihistamines are first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate allergic rhinitis. The newer, nonsedating agents are recommended over first-generation antihistamines. Some of the newer oral antihistamines, such as cetirizine, desloratadine, and fexofenadine, have been shown to relieve the symptom of nasal congestion. Intranasal steroids are first-line therapy for patients with more severe symptoms.

### Recommendations for the allergy management in the primary care [^117Gm3rN]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for allergic rhinitis" for allergic rhinitis.

The Diagnostic Criteria for Allergic Rhinitis is a clinical tool designed to aid in the identification and diagnosis of allergic rhinitis in patients presenting with typical symptoms. This tool is particularly useful in distinguishing allergic rhinitis from other conditions with similar symptomatology, thereby guiding appropriate treatment strategies.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include the presence of one or more typical symptoms, demonstration of sensitization, and specific findings on anterior rhinoscopy. The typical symptoms considered are sneezing, nasal congestion, discharge, or itch. Sensitization is usually demonstrated through skin prick tests or specific IgE tests. The anterior rhinoscopy findings indicative of allergic rhinitis include congestion of the mucosa and bilateral transparent secretions.

The diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is considered likely if all three components are present. Conversely, if any of these components are absent, the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is considered unlikely. This diagnostic criteria thus provides a structured approach to the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, facilitating early and accurate identification of the condition.

The system is designed to evaluate the likelihood of allergic rhinitis based on three diagnostic criteria. The input consists of a selection among three possible criteria, and the output is a conclusion regarding the probability of having allergic rhinitis. Here is a summary of the process:

Inputs:
The user must select among three predefined diagnostic criteria:
1. Presence of ≥ 1 typical symptoms (sneezing, nasal congestion, discharge or itch)
2. Demonstration of sensitization
3. Congestion of the mucosa and bilateral transparent secretions on anterior rhinoscopy

Each of these criteria is independently assessed based on user-provided input.

Computation:
The system checks each of the selected criteria to determine their validity:

- Criterion A is true if there is a presence of at least one typical symptom such as sneezing, nasal congestion, discharge, or itch.
- Criterion B is true if there is a demonstration of sensitization.
- Criterion C is true if there is congestion of the mucosa and bilateral transparent secretions are observed on anterior rhinoscopy.

The logical computation applied is as follows:
1. If Criteria A, B, and C are all true, the system infers that "Allergic rhinitis is likely".
2. If any of the criteria are not met, the system deduces that "Allergic rhinitis is unlikely".

Output:
The system provides a single string output summarizing the likelihood of allergic rhinitis:

- If all three criteria are met, it indicates allergic rhinitis is likely.
- If any one criterion is not satisfied, it indicates allergic rhinitis is unlikely.

### Pediatric rhinosinusitis [^115fsKqf]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is a common diagnosis encountered by providers of all disciplines. Pediatric acute and chronic rhinosinusitis account for up to 2% of the total annual visits to the outpatient clinics and emergency departments. Once correct diagnosis is made, appropriate treatment measures can be initiated. It is important to recognize rhinosinusitis in children due to the potential serious complications and the impact it may have on quality of life of those children. Medical management is the mainstay of treatment, and, fortunately, it is successful in most of those children. When medical management fails, or a complication occurs, surgery may be required.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^111Eyw26]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis terminology and definitions — table-based classifications define allergic rhinitis (AR) as an IgE-mediated inflammatory response with rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing; seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) as response to seasonal aeroallergens; perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) as response to year-round aeroallergens including dust mites, mold, animal allergens, or certain occupational allergens; intermittent allergic rhinitis as symptoms (< 4 days per week or < 4 weeks per year); persistent allergic rhinitis as persistent symptoms (> 4 days per week and > 4 weeks per year); and episodic allergic rhinitis as reactions to exposures not normally in the individual's environment (ie, a cat at a friend's house).

### Laboratory animal allergy [^114byoyB]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Laboratory animal allergy — diagnosis relies on a history of symptoms developing with workplace exposure, with onset that can be variable and sometimes delayed but often shortly after or within 30 minutes of exposure; workers may report nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itching, or red and itchy watery eyes; the differential diagnosis of allergic rhinitis includes nonallergenic, infectious, and medication-induced rhinitis; a diagnosis may be based on history and clinical findings alone, and laboratory testing for IgE or skin prick testing can be helpful; if tests are ordered, it is important to understand which antigens are being tested, as some tests assess specific proteins while others test "epithelium" or "urine"; however, a positive test is not necessary to make a diagnosis and a negative antigen test does not exclude the diagnosis when the history and exam are clear; spirometry and other pulmonary tests may not be necessary to diagnose asthma when the history and physical exam are straightforward but are often helpful to confirm the diagnosis.

### Risk factors for allergic rhinitis in preschool children: a meta-analysis and systematic review [^114tTMBC]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Allergic Rhinitis (AR) is an inflammation of the nasal mucosa caused by allergens and is one of the most common allergic diseases among preschool children. Symptoms of allergic rhinitis include nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing and itchy nose, which in severe cases may affect children's quality of life, ability to learn, and overall health. Allergic rhinitis has become a global public health problem as environmental factors change, and the prevalence of allergic diseases increases every year. Preschool children are particularly susceptible to the onset and development of allergic rhinitis because their immune system is not yet fully developed, and their physiology is still in the developmental stage. The development of allergic rhinitis is usually closely related to a variety of factors such as genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure. Studies have shown that the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis involves a complex immune response, including IgE-mediated allergic reactions and abnormalities in local immune responses. Factors such as types of allergens and degree of exposure, environmental pollutants, climate change, and lifestyle may affect children's sensitivity to allergens to varying degrees.

Despite the increasing number of studies on allergic rhinitis in children in recent years, there is still a lack of uniform conclusions regarding the specific risk factors for allergic rhinitis in preschool children. Some studies have found that a family history of allergic disease is a high-risk factor for allergic rhinitis in preschool children, and that children with allergic parents have a significantly increased risk of developing allergic rhinitis. In addition, air pollution and exposure to indoor and outdoor allergens (dust mites, moulds, pets' dander) have been identified as important environmental factors for allergic rhinitis in preschool children. However, the results of studies on these risk factors are still somewhat controversial and may vary between regions and populations. Some studies suggest that children living in urban areas are more likely to develop allergic rhinitis than those in rural areas, possibly due to higher concentrations of air pollution and allergens in urban environments; however, other studies have found that rural children have a lower prevalence, likely due to less exposure to allergens. In addition, factors such as climate change, indoor air quality, and exposure to smoking may also have different effects in different regions.

Respiratory infection and bronchiolitis

RTIs are defined as acute nasopharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, otitis media, croup, tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia. A child is deemed to have had an RTI when the mother responds positively to a series of questions about typical symptoms during each follow-up period or the family pediatrician who examined the child during the follow-up period has diagnosed RTI. Acute nasopharyngitis is diagnosed when there is an episode of runny/blocked nose or cough in the absence of other respiratory symptoms (i.e. no tachypnea, difficulty breathing, wheezing or rattly chest). Rhinosinusitis is diagnosed when two or more of the following symptoms that last at least 10 days occur during the follow-up period: anterior and/or posterior mucopurulent drainage, nasal congestion or blockage, cough, facial pain, pressure, or dullness, or a reduced or absent sense of smell. Otitis media is diagnosed when there are signs and symptoms of inflammation in the middle ear. Croup is diagnosed when there is an episode of the characteristic "barking" cough, hoarseness, and inspiratory stridor. Tracheobronchitis is diagnosed when its signs and symptoms, including a frequent, dry, hacking cough that lasts about 2–3 weeks, are preceded by upper respiratory infection symptoms such as rhinitis. Bronchiolitis is defined as wheezing that is diagnosed by a physician during the follow-up period or by pediatricians and pediatric allergy and pulmonology specialists at the scheduled visits. Wheeze status is also assessed by asking the following at each visit: "Has he/she had wheezing or whistling in the chest at any time?" Pneumonia is diagnosed when its signs and symptoms are observed, including crackle, tachypnea, increased work of breathing accompanied by intercostal, subcostal, and suprasternal retractions, nasal flaring, the use of accessory muscles, cyanosis, and respiratory fatigue.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^112CBRBR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) — history and physical examination for initial clinical diagnosis emphasizes that Key elements of the history in patients presenting with AR include seasonal, perennial or episodic, exposure-associated itching of the nose, palate, or eyes, sneezing, nasal congestion, sniffing, clear rhinorrhea, and postnasal drip. Children may only complain of malaise or fatigue, often associated with a cough, and the history must include specific questions about rhinorrhea and nasal and ocular itch in order to elicit these complaints. Symptoms of other sinonasal diseases such as sinusitis, vasomotor rhinitis, and granulomatous diseases can overlap with AR symptoms and should be differentiated from AR, and Less typical symptoms such as epistaxis, unilateral rhinorrhea, unilateral nasal blockage, severe headache, or anosmia suggest alternative diagnoses and should be investigated further. Viral upper respiratory infections may produce similar symptoms but tend to be of a shorter duration and often include other symptoms such as fever and myalgia. A family history of AR, asthma, or atopic dermatitis strengthens the diagnosis of AR in patients with compatible symptoms. Findings on physical examination that support the diagnosis of AR include several classic findings, such as clear rhinorrhea and pale pink or bluish swelling of the nasal turbinate mucosa, and Frequent throat clearing is often present as well, reflecting postnasal drip. Although definitive diagnosis depends on the finding of an IgE-mediated response to a specific allergen, detected through cutaneous or blood testing in most patients, it is reasonable to make an initial diagnosis and begin therapy based on the history and physical examination, and A good response to avoidance of suspected allergens or appropriate empiric therapy supports the diagnosis of AR and may preclude the need for further testing.

### Nasal disorders [^116V7vKx]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and epistaxis are common presenting concerns in primary care clinics. Nasal disorders affect the quality of life for many children and families. Rarely, these complaints may represent a life-threatening condition among infant obligate nasal breathers or cases of unusual pathology. The most common causes of rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction vary by age and include physiologic, infectious, allergic, foreign body, irritant, and traumatic causes. Less commonly, children may have congenital malformations, sinonasal masses, or autoimmune disease. The most common causes of epistaxis are inflammatory, environmental, and traumatic causes and medication misuse, but rarely, children may have predisposing anatomic, hematologic, or vascular abnormalities or even sinonasal tumors. In this article, we provide a thorough review of the common nasal disorders treated every day in primary care clinics and mention briefly some of the rare but serious cases that may be overlooked without considering a full differential diagnosis.

### Utility of illness symptoms for predicting COVID-19 infections in children [^116hvBdQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This multi-site study of symptomatic children evaluated in outpatient settings during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates an approach that could be repeated systematically to inform school exclusion and testing policies and practices. Our study population was likely similar to those with symptoms at school or childcare: most with no reported COVID-19 exposure; few with complex medical conditions; and all tested as outpatients, so likely mildly ill. The majority of these symptomatic children tested negative for COVID-19. We found that, of the eleven COVID-19 symptoms that the CDC suggests should trigger COVID-19 testing, nasal congestion, sore throat, and "nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea" were very common (in 30–50% of children) and not significantly associated with a positive COVID-19 test in any age group; they were, however, associated with substantial missed school-days. Loss of taste or smell was strongly associated with increased likelihood of a positive test, as was self-reported COVID-19 exposure. These data suggest that, in an endemic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic with ongoing new variants, more parsimonious lists of symptoms for exclusion might be appropriate.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2019–20 influenza season [^115VsSBh]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV4)

Available products: One live attenuated influenza vaccine, FluMist Quadrivalent (LAIV4), is expected to be available during the 2019–20 influenza season. LAIV4 is licensed for persons aged 2 through 49 years.

Dosage and administration: LAIV4 is administered intranasally using the supplied prefilled, single-use sprayer containing 0.2 mL of vaccine. Approximately 0.1 mL (i.e. half the total sprayer contents) is sprayed into the first nostril while the recipient is in the upright position. An attached dose-divider clip is removed from the sprayer to permit administration of the second half of the dose into the other nostril. If the recipient sneezes immediately after administration, the dose should not be repeated. However, if nasal congestion is present that might impede delivery of the vaccine to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral of administration should be considered until resolution of the illness, or another appropriate vaccine should be administered instead.

Contraindications and precautions for the use of LAIV4: Per the package insert, LAIV4 is contraindicated for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine and for children and adolescents receiving concomitant aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications (Table 2). Although LAIV4 is an egg-based vaccine, ACIP makes specific recommendations for the use of influenza vaccines for persons with egg allergy (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). In addition to the labeled contraindications (other than allergy to egg), ACIP also recommends that LAIV4 not be administered to the following groups:

Children aged 2 through 4 years who have received a diagnosis of asthma or whose parents or caregivers report that a health care provider has told them during the past 12 months that their child had wheezing or asthma or whose medical record indicates that a wheezing episode has occurred within the past 12 months;
Persons who are immunocompromised due to any cause (including but not limited to medications and HIV infection);
Close contacts and caregivers of severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected environment;
Pregnant women; and
Persons who have received influenza antiviral medications within the previous 48 hours.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^115RNr7c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis guideline — action statements for diagnosis and management: The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend intranasal steroids for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR whose symptoms affect their quality of life, and a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend oral second-generation/less sedating antihistamines for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching. The panel further states that clinicians should make the clinical diagnosis of AR when patients present with a history and physical examination consistent with an allergic cause and 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing, with findings that include, but are not limited to, clear rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, pale discoloration of the nasal mucosa, and red and watery eyes. For testing, clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR who do not respond to empiric treatment, or where the diagnosis is uncertain, or when knowledge of the specific causative allergen is needed to target therapy. The panel adds that clinicians should assess associated conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media, and clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with AR who have inadequate response to symptoms with pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls.

### Inhalant allergies in children [^1131mTQC]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Children with chronic or recurrent upper respiratory inflammatory disease (rhinitis) should be considered for inhalant allergies. Risk factors for inhalant allergies in children include a first-degree relative with allergies, food allergy in infancy, and atopic dermatitis. Although inhalant allergies are rare in infancy, inhalant allergies are common in older children and impair quality of life and productivity. Differentiating between viral and allergic rhinitis can be challenging in children, but the child's age, history, and risk factors can provide helpful information. Allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for asthma, and if one is present, medical consideration of the other is warranted.

Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to 5 Years in Short-Term (6–12 weeks) Trials: In two short-term trials conducted in the US, 183 patients were treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg, 100 mcg or 25 mcg daily. The distribution of adverse events was similar to that seen in the 6 to 11 year old children.

Long-Term (52-Week) Safety Trial: In a 52-week double-blind, placebo-controlled safety trial that included 663 adults and adolescent patients (441 treated with ciclesonide: 227 males and 436 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis, the adverse reaction profile over the treatment period was similar to the adverse event profile in trials of shorter duration. Adverse reactions, irrespective of drug relationship, that occurred with an incidence of 3% or greater and more frequently with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg than with placebo were epistaxis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, sinusitis, headache, nasal discomfort, cough, bronchitis, influenza, back pain, and urinary tract infection. No patient experienced a nasal septal perforation or nasal ulcer during this long-term trial of OMNARIS Nasal Spray.

6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been reported in association with post-marketing use of OMNARIS Nasal Spray and are not listed above: nasal congestion, nasal ulcer and dizziness. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^112FVUn4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common diseases affecting adults. It is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States today and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall. AR is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generates $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually. It can impair quality of life and, through loss of work and school attendance, is responsible for as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. Not surprisingly, myriad diagnostic tests and treatments are used in managing this disorder, yet there is considerable variation in their use. This clinical practice guideline was undertaken to optimize the care of patients with AR by addressing quality improvement opportunities through an evaluation of the available evidence and an assessment of the harm-benefit balance of various diagnostic and management options.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to address quality improvement opportunities for all clinicians, in any setting, who are likely to manage patients with AR as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The guideline is intended to be applicable for both pediatric and adult patients with AR. Children under the age of 2 years were excluded from the clinical practice guideline because rhinitis in this population may be different than in older patients and is not informed by the same evidence base. The guideline is intended to focus on a limited number of quality improvement opportunities deemed most important by the working group and is not intended to be a comprehensive reference for diagnosing and managing AR. The recommendations outlined in the guideline are not intended to represent the standard of care for patient management, nor are the recommendations intended to limit treatment or care provided to individual patients.

Action Statements

The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend intranasal steroids for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR whose symptoms affect their quality of life. The development group also made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend oral second-generation/less sedating antihistamines for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should make the clinical diagnosis of AR when patients present with a history and physical examination consistent with an allergic cause and 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing. Findings of AR consistent with an allergic cause include, but are not limited to, clear rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, pale discoloration of the nasal mucosa, and red and watery eyes. (2) Clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR who do not respond to empiric treatment, or when the diagnosis is uncertain, or when knowledge of the specific causative allergen is needed to target therapy. (3) Clinicians should assess patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR for, and document in the medical record, the presence of associated conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media. (4) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with AR who have inadequate response to symptoms with pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls. The panel recommended against (1) clinicians routinely performing sinonasal imaging in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of AR and (2) clinicians offering oral leukotriene receptor antagonists as primary therapy for patients with AR. The panel group made the following options: (1) Clinicians may advise avoidance of known allergens or may advise environmental controls (ie, removal of pets; the use of air filtration systems, bed covers, and acaricides [chemical agents formulated to kill dust mites]) in patients with AR who have identified allergens that correlate with clinical symptoms. (2) Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR. (3) Clinicians may offer combination pharmacologic therapy in patients with AR who have inadequate response to pharmacologic monotherapy. (4) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a surgeon who can offer, inferior turbinate reduction in patients with AR with nasal airway obstruction and enlarged inferior turbinates who have failed medical management. (5) Clinicians may offer acupuncture, or refer to a clinician who can offer acupuncture, for patients with AR who are interested in nonpharmacologic therapy. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the use of herbal therapy for patients with AR.

### Overview of allergic rhinitis [^112La5Pc]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic rhinitis is the most common chronic condition seen in the outpatient practice of medicine. Its incidence is rising in parallel with other IgE-mediated diseases, affecting 10 to 30% of adults and up to 40% of children. Half the patients with allergic rhinitis experience symptoms up to 4 months per year, whereas 20% are symptomatic more than 9 months of the year. This disease is often associated with asthma, sinusitis, and otitis media.

Objective

To review the literature concerning the evaluation and treatment of allergic rhinitis.

Data Sources

Epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and clinical studies published in peer-reviewed journals concerning the topic of allergic rhinitis.

Results

Diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is based on patient history, signs and symptoms, physical examination, and appropriate testing procedures. Management includes aggressive environmental control measures to reduce exposure to implicated allergens, immunotherapy that can change the potential clinical course of allergic rhinitis by preventing the initiation and progression of airway inflammation, and pharmacotherapeutic management, including antihistamines and topical nasal corticosteroids.

Conclusions

Early recognition and management of allergic rhinitis, which include allergen avoidance, immunotherapy, and pharmacologic treatment, can prevent serious complications and significantly improve the patient's quality of life.

### Long-term outcome of once daily nasal irrigation for the treatment of pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis [^114CiMDn]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Chronic rhinosinusitis(CRS) results in significant morbidity and health care expenditure. Safety and efficacy of nasal irrigation use in the treatment of pediatric CRS have been demonstrated, but long-term outcomes are unknown. We reviewed characteristics and treatment outcomes after 6 weeks of once daily nasal irrigation in pediatric CRS based on computed tomography (CT) scans, and summarized parental reports of subsequent use of nasal irrigation for recurring symptoms

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study and cross-sectional survey.

Methods

Review and survey of 144 pediatric CRS patients diagnosed between July 2003 and January 2012.

Results

One hundred four patients were reviewed. Mean age was 8.0 years, and 65.4% were male. Presenting symptoms included congestion (95.2%), cough (79.8%), rhinorrhea (60.6%), headache (48.1%), and fatigue (40.4%). Comorbidities included positive allergy test (50%), asthma (57.3%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (28.2%). After 6 weeks, 57.7% of patients reported complete resolution of symptoms. Reductions in Lund-Mackay CT scores were 4.14 and 4.38 on the left and right sides, respectively (P < .001). Of the 54 parents who completed the prospective surveys, 53.7% reported using irrigation again in the past 12 months (median = 1, interquartile range = 3). Only nine patients underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) after the initial 6 weeks. Patients requiring FESS were, on average, 3.6 years older than those who did not receive FESS (P = 0.0005). Median length of follow-up was 48 months (range = 20–113). There were no significant differences in age, Lund-MacKay score changes, and symptom resolution proportions between those who completed the survey and those who did not.

Conclusions

Nasal irrigation is effective as a first-line treatment for pediatric CRS and subsequent nasal symptoms, and reduces the need for FESS and CT imaging.

### Use of intranasal corticosteroids in the management of congestion and sleep disturbance in pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis [^1162ypbP]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis affects a large number of children and exerts a considerable socioeconomic impact. It is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated, which predisposes children to potentially serious comorbidities. Allergic rhinitis symptoms may create nighttime breathing problems and sleep disturbances and have a negative effect on a child's ability to learn in the classroom. Although antihistamines have shown efficacy in relieving many symptoms, they have little effect on nasal congestion. This article summarizes the advantages of intranasal corticosteroids, including their effectiveness against congestion and excellent safety profile. Intranasal corticosteroids with minimal systemic bioavailability provide topical drug delivery that minimizes the potential for systemic side-effects.

### Clinical practice guideline: management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient. A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, were selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups (including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics) have reviewed and revised the guideline. Three specific issues were considered: 1) evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children; 2) evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens; and 3) the diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration. It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children ≤ 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis in children > 6 years of age. Computed tomography scans of the paranasal sinuses should be reserved for children who present with complications of acute bacterial sinusitis or who have very persistent or recurrent infections and are not responsive to medical management. There were only 5 controlled randomized trials and 8 case series on antimicrobial therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children. However, these data, plus data derived from the study of adults with acute bacterial sinusitis, support the recommendation that acute bacterial sinusitis be treated with antimicrobial therapy to achieve a more rapid clinical cure. Children with complications or suspected complications of acute bacterial sinusitis should be treated promptly and aggressively with antibiotics and, when appropriate, drainage. Based on controversial and limited data, no recommendations are made about the use of prophylactic antimicrobials, ancillary therapies, or complementary/alternative medicine for prevention and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children. It is designed to assist pediatricians by providing an analytic framework for evaluation and treatment. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all patients with this condition.

### Optimal management of allergic rhinitis [^114D1wWo]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Management

Guideline-directed management has been shown to improve disease control. The global Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma guideline (ARIA), which includes quality-of-life measures in evaluation and treatment, and provides an evidence-based approach to treatment of AR, has recently been updated using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology. The UK has its own guidelines, which are currently being updated. More recent, specifically paediatric guidelines, include those from the European Academy for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI)and patient pathways from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. The following is a synopsis of their content.

Diagnosis

AR is diagnosed by detailed history, including questions about possible asthma, and nasal examination, together with inspection of throat, ears and chest where possible, backed up by specific allergy tests, either skin prick or blood tests, for specific IgE to allergens suggested by the history.

Clinical history: symptom type, duration and frequency and exacerbating factors are the cornerstone for diagnosing and classifying paediatric rhinitis which is characterised by two or more nasal symptoms: itching, sneezing, obstruction and rhinorrhoea. The timing of these in relation to exposure to allergen (ie, specific season or animal) is highly relevant. Upon such exposure, symptoms of AR occur in minutes and last for hours. Late-phase symptoms can include nasal obstruction, hyposmia, postnasal mucous discharge and nasal hyper-reactivity. AC occurs in approximately 50%–70% of patients with ARand is the symptom which best differentiates AR from other forms of rhinitis.

The trial was approved by the independent ethics committee of each research center and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and GCP guidelines. The parents or guardians (carers) of all patients provided written, informed consent ahead of study initiation. Additionally, patients who were able to read and understand the study information signed an Informed Acceptance Form.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily FFNS 55 μg and 110 μg versus vehicle placebo nasal spray in pediatric patients with AR. The study had a treatment-free run-in period (4–14 days) before randomization, followed by 4 weeks of double-blind treatment and a 3–7-day treatment-free follow-up period (Fig. 1).

Patients were eligible for inclusion into the study if they met criteria for either IAR or PAR according to Chinese guidelines, and were 2–12 years of age. Exclusion criteria included comorbid disorders that may have affected study results (including nasal polyps, eye, or upper respiratory infection within 2 weeks of the start of the screening period, asthma [except mild intermittent cases], rhinitis medicamentosa, vasomotor AR, or eosinophil rhinitis), recent nasal septal surgery or perforation, and traveling for > 48 h during the study (potentially experiencing a change in allergens). Use of medication that could significantly affect the course of AR or interact with the study drug was not permitted.

In addition, patients had to meet the following randomization criteria: nasal and/or ocular symptoms on the morning of randomization; an average reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) of ≥ 6 for the last 8 assessments (4 assessments in the morning and 4 assessments in the afternoon) before randomization, including the morning assessment at randomization; and average reflective nasal score symptom assessment for congestion of ≥ 2 for the last 8 assessments (4 assessments in the morning and 4 assessments in the afternoon) before randomization, including the morning assessment at randomization.

Intranasal antihistamines for allergic rhinitis (AR) — recommendation and evidence profile: Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR, with a policy level of Option based on randomized controlled trials with minor limitations and observational studies and an overall equilibrium of benefit and harm. The aggregate evidence quality is Grade A and the level of confidence in evidence is high, but most trials were of short duration. Benefits include rapid onset and increased effectiveness over oral antihistamines for nasal congestion, while risks/harms/costs include increased cost relative to oral antihistamines, poor taste, sedation, more frequent dosing, epistaxis, and local side effects. The Guideline Development Group judged this class generally second-line after failure of nasal steroids or oral antihistamines due to poor acceptance, taste, and cost, though specific patients may be appropriate for first-line therapy; intentional vagueness is none and the role of patient preferences is large with shared decision making emphasized. Exclusions include that these agents are not approved for children younger than 5 years, and differences of opinion were minor.

Allergic rhinitis, an IgE-mediated disease, is the most common chronic childhood condition and is characterized by nasal sneezing, rhinorrhea, palate and eye itchiness, and congestion. Allergic rhinitis should be diagnosed as early as possible to avoid detrimental effects on the quality of life and comorbid disorders. Treatment initially involves avoidance measures and, when necessary, pharmacotherapy or immunotherapy. Pharmacotherapy generally involves antihistamines or nasal corticosteroids, but other medications such as leukotriene antagonists have demonstrated effectiveness in treating allergic rhinitis symptoms. Immunotherapy generally is reserved for patients unresponsive to therapy or unable to take medications.

14.4	Nasal Congestion Associated with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis

The efficacy and safety of NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg for nasal congestion associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis were evaluated in three randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical trials of 15 days duration. The three trials included a total of 1008 patients 12 years of age and older with nasal congestion associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, of whom 506 received NASONEX Nasal Spray 200 mcg daily and 502 received placebo. Of the 1008 patients, the majority 784 (78%) were Caucasians. The majority of the patients were between 18 to < 65 years of age with a mean age of 38.8 years and were predominantly women (66%). The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in average morning and evening reflective nasal congestion score over treatment day 1 to day 15. The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in average morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (TNSS = rhinorrhea [nasal discharge/runny nose or postnasal drip], nasal congestion/stuffiness, nasal itching, sneezing) averaged over treatment day 1 to 15. Two out of three studies demonstrated that treatment with Nasonex Nasal Spray significantly reduced the nasal congestion symptom score and the TNSS compared to placebo in patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis (see TABLE 3 and 4 below).

Based on results in other studies with NASONEX Nasal Spray in pediatric patients, effects on nasal congestion associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients below 12 years of age is similar to those seen in adults and adolescents [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

### Minimal persistent inflammation, an emerging concept in the nature and treatment of allergic rhinitis: the possible role of leukotrienes [^115FxGhX]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the emerging concept of minimal persistent inflammation in allergic rhinitis and its implications for therapy.

Data Sources

Relevant clinical studies in the English language were reviewed.

Study Selection

Material was taken from academic/scholarly journals.

Results

Accumulating evidence suggests that allergic rhinitis is a chronic inflammatory disease instead of a disease of acute symptoms. An approach to the therapy for allergic rhinitis should consider that even when symptoms are absent, a minimal level of persistent inflammation may persist. To prevent unexpected exacerbations, the treatment strategy may need to include managing subclinical persistent inflammation. Therapeutic options addressing the major inflammatory elements in allergic rhinitis, including eosinophils, the cysteinyl leukotrienes, and histamine, must be evaluated as management strategies that can achieve effective control. Traditional medications include intranasal corticosteroids, antihistamines, and immunotherapy. Recently, a leukotriene receptor antagonist has been approved for major rhinitis symptoms (congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and pruritus), suggesting a new option for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

Conclusions

Because of the possible presence of a minimal persistent inflammation during rhinitis patients' asymptomatic periods, it is important to consider a prophylactic approach to treating allergic rhinitis to prevent or reduce exacerbations during an acute increase in allergen. In light of the advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis, agents must be considered based on their safety, efficacy, and ability to deal with underlying inflammation as well as symptom relief.

### Environmental risk factors, protective factors, and biomarkers for allergic rhinitis: a systematic umbrella review of the evidence [^1113YdGh]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa, which is caused by the release of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated mediators (mainly histamine) after allergic individuals are exposed to allergens, and a variety of immune active cells and cell factors are involved. In the USA, the prevalence of physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis is about 15%, and patients self-report abnormal nasal symptoms up to 30%. A Danish study spanning three decades reported that the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the Danish adult population in the last three decades increased from 16% in 1990–1991 to 29% in 2012–2015, and the prevalence of allergic rhinitis is likely to continue to increase in this century. It has been estimated that 1 in 6 individuals in the USA may have AR, generating $2 billion to $5 billion in direct medical expenditures annually and up to $2 billion to $4 billion in lost productivity due to lost work and attendance. Nasal symptoms, including nasal congestion, itchy nose, rhinorrhea (runny nose), and sneezing, are the signature symptoms of AR, and symptoms last or accumulate for more than 1 h per day. This long-term chronic nasal symptom may further lead to the decline of brain function, affect the quality of life of patients, reduce the efficiency of work and study in adults and children, and also lead to the patient's irritability, and even cause anxiety, depression, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. It is estimated that about 40% of AR patients will be accompanied by bronchial asthma, and about 30–71% of AR patients will have allergic conjunctivitis or conjunctival symptoms.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^115NEd1J]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) definition, classification, and burden — For the purpose of this guideline, AR is defined as an immunoglobulin E (IgE)–mediated inflammatory response of the nasal mucous membranes after exposure to inhaled allergens, with symptoms including rhinorrhea (anterior or post nasal drip), nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing, and AR can be seasonal or perennial, with symptoms being intermittent or persistent. AR is an inflammatory, IgE-mediated disease characterized by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea (nasal drainage), sneezing, and/or nasal itching, and AR may be classified by the temporal pattern of exposure (seasonal, perennial/year-round, or episodic), frequency of symptoms, and severity of symptoms. In the United States, AR is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generates $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually, and through loss of work and school attendance it is responsible for as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually.

### Nasal decongestants for the common cold [^1124fFfr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is a major and recurrent cause of morbidity, affecting children and adults two or more times each year. Nasal congestion is its commonest symptom and many therapies are marketed for its relief. There is no meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials on the effects of nasal decongestants in the common cold.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of nasal decongestants at reducing the symptom of nasal congestion in adults and children with the common cold and to identify possible adverse effects associated with their use.

Search Strategy

In updating this review in 2004, the following databases were searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's specialised register; MEDLINE (January 1996 to February week 1 2004); EMBASE (1996 to February week 7 2004); and Current Contents (February 2004). We handsearched review citations from other references and contacted known principal investigators and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials with placebo of single-active oral and topical nasal decongestants in adults and children suffering from common cold.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two reviewers (DT and GJL). All outcomes variables were continuous. Subjective outcomes were normalised to a common scale and a weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated. We calculated a standardised mean difference (SMD) for the objective outcomes.

Main Results

Five studies involving 286 adults were included, none in children. There was a significant 13% decrease in subjective symptoms after decongestants were compared with placebo. This was supported by a significant decrease in nasal airways resistance. Repeated doses of nasal decongestant were not significantly better than placebo at relieving symptoms of nasal congestion.

Reviewers' Conclusions

A single dose of nasal decongestant in the common cold is moderately effective for the short term relief of congestion in adults, while there is no evidence available to show benefit after repeated use over several days. There is insufficient data on the use of these medications in children and therefore they are not recommended for use in young children with the common cold.

### Practical integrated healthcare prevention and management of children's health quality of respiratory functions: a systematic review [^115HJcy1]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Structural model of children's health quality of respiratory functions

We obtained a structural knowledge graph from the literature (figure 3). In the structural knowledge graph, we divided children's respiratory functional health into three stages: vulnerable children, inducement and symptoms. Evidence-based medicine emphasises a complete chain or network of possible causes, starting with susceptibility and ending with disease management and prevention. Among susceptibility factors, some were intervenable, such as family member smoking, whereas others were fixed, such as low birth weight. There were also many inducing factors, including allergens, respiratory tract infections and drugs. Having recognised these inducements, we took preventative measures to intervene and keep children from developing diseases. However, if children, unfortunately, developed diseases, we used management methods to prevent disease exacerbation. The main respiratory diseases that children develop include allergies, asthma and pneumonia, which are often characterised by symptoms of wheezing, nasal congestion and fever. In prevention and management, two areas were paid special attention to: policy and education. First, these two measures contributed to both disease prevention and management. Second, these two measures reinforced and supported the other measures. For example, education was related to policy, family intervention (the main intervention in education) and social participation. Therefore, we highlighted the importance of developing appropriate policies and offering effective education.

Figure 3
The knowledge graph from the literature. The entire pathway of the evidence chain is summarised according to the review, illustrating the progression and connections between different stages of evidence evaluation.

We screened the susceptibility factors associated with asthma (online supplemental table 2). Among susceptibility factors, common high-risk children were usually due to the following factors: young age, family member smoking, family history of respiratory diseases, low birth weight and comorbidities. Allergies are one of the main causes of asthma in children. In addition to allergies, we determined from online supplemental tables 3 and 4 that respiratory tract infections (viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms), malnutrition (obesity and inanition) and drugs were the main causes of respiratory diseases in children. The main respiratory diseases in children include allergies, asthma and pneumonia, which are often characterised by wheezing, nasal congestion and fever. Regarding prevention and management, most of the measures were mutually reinforcing and supportive.

### Sinonasal quality of life in children after outfracture of inferior turbinates and submucous inferior turbinoplasty for chronic nasal congestion [^113r1mtp]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Chronic nasal congestion often persists in children despite empirical treatment using intranasal corticosteroids, systemic antihistamines, and/or leukotriene receptor antagonists. Symptoms are often reported even with negative results of skin or blood allergy testing. Inferior turbinoplasty has been effective in adults and children, but outfracture of inferior turbinates in children is rarely reported, as is use of validated quality-of-life measures to quantify improvements after intervention. Effective use of these 2 procedures for treating chronic nasal congestion may reduce the need for medication and improve sinonasal quality of life.

Objective

To quantify changes in sinonasal quality of life for children after outfracture of inferior turbinates and concomitant submucous microdebrider inferior turbinoplasty for chronic nasal congestion.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A case series with planned data collection was conducted in an ambulatory pediatric otolaryngology clinic among 43 patients with chronic nasal congestion who underwent surgical intervention between January 1, 2014, and May 31, 2015.

Exposures

Microdebrider submucous inferior turbinoplasty (without bony resection) and outfracture of inferior turbinates.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Demographics and medication use before and after the procedure were reviewed. Scores on the Sinus and Nasal Quality of Life Survey (SN-5) and quality-of-life scores were collected at baseline, 4 to 6 weeks after the procedure, and more than 6 months after the procedure.

Results

Among the 43 patients (14 girls and 29 boys; mean age, 11.2 years [range, 4.8–17.6 years]), every domain showed significant improvements in scores on the Sinus and Nasal Quality of Life Survey and quality-of-life scores 1 to 2 months after the proecdure: sinus infection (-2.55; 95% CI, 1.85–3.26), nasal obstruction (-3.51; 95% CI, 2.88–4.14), allergy symptoms (-2.14; 95% CI, 1.43–2.86), emotional distress (-2.37; 95% CI, 1.68–3.06), activity limitation (-1.70; 95% CI, 1.14–2.25), and overall quality of life (3.72; 95% CI, 2.95–4.48). At long-term follow-up, improvement was maintained in all categories. Significant improvements in SN-5 and quality-of-life scores correlated with proportional decreased reporting of snoring after the procedure (33 [77%] vs 1 [2%]; absolute reduction, 75%; 95% CI, 62%-88%), as well as nasal congestion (41 [95%] vs 1 [2%]; absolute reduction, 93%; 95% CI, 85%-100%), and rhinorrhea (44 [41%] vs 1 [2%]; absolute reduction, 42%; 95% CI, 27%-57%). The proportion reporting use of intranasal corticosteroids (25 [58%] vs 2 [5%]; absolute reduction, 50%; 95% CI, 39%-71%), antihistamines (27 [63%] vs 1 [2%]; absolute reduction, 61%; 95% CI, 46%-75%), and leukotriene receptor antagonists (13 [30%] vs 0; absolute reduction, 30%; 95% CI, 16%-44%) also decreased.

Conclusions and Relevance

Concomitant outfracture and submucous microdebrider inferior turbinoplasty improves quality of life in children with chronic nasal congestion and can reduce use of daily medication.

### Pediatric allergic rhinitis: factors affecting treatment choice [^116gXLtd]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is the mostprevalent chronic allergic disease in children. Although it is not life-threatening, it can have a significantly detrimental effect on a childs quality of life, and it may exacerbate a number of common comorbidities, including asthma and sinusitis. The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma guidelines, an evidence-based algorithm for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, advocate the use of antihistamines for the treatment of the broad spectrum of the disease. However, first-generation antihistamines are associated with a number of adverse events, including central nervous system impairment and anticholinergic and cardiovascular effects. Moreover, these agents have not been rigorously tested in the pediatric population. Nevertheless, first-generation antihistamines remain the most frequently prescribed agents in this class of drugs. This is despite the fact that the second-generation antihistamines are largely free of the undesirable side effects associated with their predecessors and the fact that they have been shown to be effective in relieving allergic rhinitis symptoms in children in a number of large-scale clinical trials. Therefore, when selecting an antihistamine for a child, it would be prudent to consider the full range of antihistamines and to base the selection of a particular drug on its efficacy, onset and duration of action, and safety profile.

### Allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis: their impact on lower airways [^113VwC4S]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Anatomy, pathophysiology, epidemiology, and disease characteristics link the upper and lower airways. Nonspecific symptoms such as cough, congestion, shortness of breath, and recurrent infection may be related to the upper airway, lower airway, or both. Patients with the most severe disease often exhibit symptoms and findings of inflammation at both sites. Recent literature suggests that medical treatment and, when appropriate, surgical therapy directed at the upper airway can yield improvements in the lower airway. An understanding of the diagnosis and management of diseases at both sites will afford patients the best possible outcomes.

Rhinosinusitis is a common disease in patients of all age groups. Rhinosinusitis arises from a variety of infectious and inflammatory mechanisms. There is ample evidence that rhinosinusitis can directly influence asthma. There is also growing evidence that rhinosinusitis may be associated with asthma as different manifestations of the same disorder. A great deal of future research is required to fully elucidate the different mechanisms whereby rhinosinusitis influences or associates with asthma, but it is clear that rhinosinusitis needs to be considered in patients with severe or refractory asthma.

### Microbial dysbiosis tunes the immune response towards allergic disease outcomes [^117WwGjk]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma and Allergic Rhinitis

Asthma is a common allergic inflammatory disease affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. Broadly, asthma can be defined to be of either an atopic or non-atopic phenotype. In atopic asthma, the incidence of asthma symptoms occurs later in childhood or in early teenage years and may be resultant of an underlying genetic predisposition to allergen-sensitivity leading to development of hyper-responsiveness with symptoms mostly persisting into adulthood. Whereas, non-atopic asthma largely develops within the first 2 to 3 years of age and develops as a neutrophil associated, recurring obstruction of the airways that typically resolves by around 13 years of age. Several studies have reported the positive influence of microbial exposure on protection from the development of asthma, with children who are exposed to a highly diverse microbial environment often exhibiting lower rates of asthma and allergic rhinitis (Table 1). For instance, in rural areas, children raised on farms are more likely to be exposed to livestock, as well as an increased likelihood of having consumed unpasteurized milk from farm animals during their early childhood. Such exposures to a microbial environment at a very young age are associated with a relatively lower risk of developing allergic diseases. This is typically referred to as the "farm-effect" on allergic diseases and has been associated with both atopic and non-atopic phenotypes of asthma. Schuijs et al. reported that the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20 in the lung epithelium renders the protective effect in children living in farm environment, showing that the loss of A20 enzyme eliminated the protective effect; in addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding for A20 enzyme was associated with allergy and asthma risk in children raised in a farm environment. It was further shown that farm dust and bacterial LPS modify the communication between epithelial cells and dendritic cells, achieved through the induction of A20 expression, providing a possible explanation for the incidence of higher rates of asthma in children from urban areas, as compared to those from rural areas. Allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, is an atopic disease characterized by nasal congestion, sneezing, and rhinorrhea and is predominantly caused by allergens such as pollen, dust mites, and animal dander; based on the causative allergen, allergic rhinitis can present as either seasonal or perennial in nature. A recent analysis of the microbial composition in the mucosal airways of children with asthma or allergic rhinitis identified a decrease in certain groups of microbes and linked this microbial dysbiosis with the increased sensitization to allergic disease. Among those microbes found to constitute a healthy lung microbial composition were Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes, whereas the phylum Proteobacteria was found to be abundant in asthmatics and was associated with lower levels of asthma control and increased numbers of asthma exacerbations. Other common microbial populations found in the mucosal airways of asthmatic patients include Prevotella, Selenomonas, Butyrivibrio, and Neisseria. Some of these species, which includes Prevotella and Neisseria species, are also found associated with patients with allergic rhinitis. Interestingly, the airway microbiome composition in patients with eosinophilic and neutrophilic asthma was found to be distinct, with the neutrophilic patients exhibiting a reduced diversity and richness in Proteobacteria and in particular, Haemophilus and Moraxella species. Haemophilus parainfluenzae is capable of activating the toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, which in turn leads to the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 and inhibition of corticosteroid responses. Apart from the airway microbiome, dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and lower gut microbial diversity early in life are also associated with a subsequent increased risk of developing asthma. Data from the CHILD cohort study which examined children who were asthmatic at 4 years of age showed that the gut microbial composition of these children at 3 months of age exhibited a significant decrease in the abundance of the genus Lachnospira and an increased abundance of the species Clostridium neonatalae. A further study which analyzed the gut microbial composition of infants at risk for asthma, during the first 100 days of their life, showed a decreased abundance of Lachnospira, Veillonella, and Faecalibacterium from the phylum Firmicute s and Rothia from the phylum Actinobacteria. Yet another study showed that children with asthma had a significantly lower abundance of Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, whereas Enterococcus and Clostridium from the same phylum were enhanced in these children as compared to healthy controls.

### Optimal management of allergic rhinitis [^114Yp6hV]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Pan airway involvement should be considered, both in the history and on examination.

The ARIA classification of AR as mild intermittent, moderate to severe intermittent, mild persistent or moderate to severe persistent may also be made and used as a guide to therapy (figure 1). This classification has been recently validated in children through an epidemiological survey involving 1275 children between 6 and 12 years of age.

Figure 1
The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma guideline classification in untreated patients. The historical classification of allergic rhinitis (AR) as seasonal or perennial in relation to triggering environmental allergens is useful in some geographical regions and is important for pollen immunotherapy and has, therefore, been additionally maintained in the British Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology UK classification of AR.

Rhinitis has many underlying causes. (table 2). Approximately two-thirds of children and one-third of adult patients with rhinitis will present with AR; the remainder have other forms and some defy classification (idiopathic rhinitis). Recurrent viral colds are more frequent in small children; AR is more common in older ones. Unilateral symptoms, nasal obstruction without other symptoms, mucopurulent discharge, pain or recurrent epistaxis suggest other diagnoses including rarer conditions that can mimic AR. Chronic unremitting rhinitis present from birth should lead to tests for primary ciliary diskinesia. One-sided persistent nasal blockage, especially with purulent discharge, suggests a foreign body or unilateral choanal atresia. Watery discharge from one side of the nose, especially on bending forward, can represent a cerebrospinal fluid leak. Cystic fibrosis should be sought if nasal polyps are found. Oral contraceptives can cause rhinitis in adolescents.

### Disease relapse rate in children with autoimmune rheumatic diseases after COVID-19 infection and vaccination [^117KMvNg]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Infected children usually suffer from systemic and respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, and nasal congestion. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in children is milder and the outcome favourable compared to adults. In children with COVID-19 who required hospitalization, the mortality rate was approximately 0.2%.

Because patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) have a dysregulated immune system there was a concern that they could be more susceptible to COVID-19 and have a more severe clinical presentation. Studies on adult patients with ARD did not prove this, as clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the need for hospitalization, and the mortality rate were similar in patients with and without ARD. In Atlanta, USA, a study was done among paediatric patients with ARD (pARD) infected with SARS-CoV-2. The researchers concluded that a worse clinical presentation and increased odds for hospitalization were associated with African American race, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, active ARD at the time of infection, and severe immunosuppression. Another study was performed in Washington, DC, USA, where underlying medical conditions were reported to play an important role in the severity of COVID-19 in children. The most common underlying diagnosis was asthma, but diabetes, obesity, neurologic, hematologic, and oncologic conditions were also recorded.

### Adult rhinosinusitis: diagnosis and management [^115GykGw]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Rhinosinusitis can be divided among four subtypes: acute, recurrent acute, subacute and chronic, based on patient history and a limited physical examination. In most instances, therapy is initiated based on this classification. Antibiotic therapy, supplemented by hydration and decongestants, is indicated for seven to 14 days in patients with acute, recurrent acute or subacute bacterial rhinosinusitis. For patients with chronic disease, the same treatment regimen is indicated for an additional four weeks or more, and a nasal steroid may also be prescribed if inhalant allergies are known or suspected. Nasal endoscopy and computed tomography of the sinuses are reserved for circumstances that include a failure to respond to therapy as expected, spread of infection outside the sinuses, a question of diagnosis and when surgery is being considered. Laboratory tests are infrequently necessary and are reserved for patients with suspected allergies, cystic fibrosis, immune deficiencies, mucociliary disorders and similar disease states. Findings on endoscopically guided microswab culture obtained from the middle meatus correlate 80 to 85 percent of the time with results from the more painful antral puncture technique and is performed in patients who fail to respond to the initial antibiotic selection. Surgery is indicated for extranasal spread of infection, evidence of mucocele or pyocele, fungal sinusitis or obstructive nasal polyposis, and is often performed in patients with recurrent or persistent infection not resolved by drug therapy.

Other Chronic Respiratory Conditions to Consider

The clinical symptoms associated with PCD often overlap with other common pediatric and adult respiratory diseases (Table 6). Each of these other diseases should be considered in patients with chronic oto‐sino‐pulmonary symptoms; however, investigations should only be pursued when the clinical picture suggests their presence. Thus, PCD is not a diagnosis of exclusion.

Table 6
Other Chronic Respiratory Conditions to Consider When Considering a Diagnosis of PCD

Sweat testing or cystic fibrosis genetic testing are recommended when evaluating patients for PCD, as both diseases can present with similar phenotypes 83 and produce nNO levels below the PCD diagnostic cutoff of 77 nl/min. 58 Immunodeficiency can also present similarly to PCD, 84 and in patients with suspected PCD, laboratory studies investigating immunodeficiency are necessary. Preliminary study of nNO in certain humoral immunodeficiencies has shown normal values well above 77 nl/min, 85 but further study is required to know if all forms of immunodeficiency produce normal nNO levels.

Pulmonary aspiration, with or without gastroesophageal reflux, can cause chronic respiratory symptoms in adults and children, including cough, wheeze, bronchitis, or pneumonia. 86, 87 Thus in patients with possible PCD, a thorough feeding history is essential. A history of chronic cough from asthma can also resemble PCD in young children, especially with frequent viral infections from daycare exposures. Additionally, chronic nasal congestion from allergic rhinitis can seem similar to PCD rhinosinusitis. However, PCD nasal disease is present year‐round and does not resolve with seasonal change, as often occurs with allergic rhinitis. Lastly, protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a disorder of preschool aged children causing > 3 weeks of wet cough with lower airway bacterial infection and airway neutrophilia. 88 In general though, the characteristic, year‐round, daily, often wet or productive cough of children with PCD usually distinguishes them from these other conditions.

### What are the primary clinical symptoms of rhinitis and what causes them? [^115miNgS]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The nose has a limited repertoire of responses regardless of the triggers. These responses primarily serve as a protective mechanism for the lower respiratory tract. Although the nasal reactions to pollens, particles, and pollution may have a beneficial effect for the lower airway, they create symptoms in some individuals that lead to significant morbidity. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis extend far beyond the nose, and the morbidity associated with rhinitis is significant. The nasal symptoms of rhinitis and their causes are the focus of this review.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^115bUP1w]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis guideline — epidemiology and scope: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is characterized as one of the most common diseases affecting adults and as the most common chronic disease in children in the United States and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall, affecting nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generating $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually, with as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. The guideline is applicable to both pediatric and adult patients with AR, but children under the age of 2 years were excluded; there is considerable variation in use of diagnostic tests and treatments, and the recommendations are not intended to represent the standard of care or limit individual care.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) diagnosis and treatment flow chart — patients who present with "Patient presents with the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, sneezing" should undergo history and physical examination (KAS1), "including assessment of chronic conditions and comorbidities (KAS5)", after which the "Physician determines clinical diagnosis of allergic rhinitis". When "Treatment Needed? - YES", options include "Pharmacologic Treatment (KAS 6–10): Refer to Figure 3: Medications Flow Chart for Common Clinical Scenarios", Environmental Factors (KAS4), where "Clinicians may advise avoidance of known or suspected allergens", and, if "Patient prefers Complementary Medicine", "Clinicians may offer acupuncture (KAS13)". For "Inadequate control of AR symptoms with pharmacologic therapy and/or environmental controls", proceed to "Allergy Testing (KAS2); Clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing" as indicated; if positive, "Immunotherapy If Positive Allergy Testing (KAS11): Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with allergic rhinitis who have inadequate response to pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls". For persistent nasal obstruction, "Inferior Turbinate reduction: for Persistent Nasal Airway Obstruction (KAS12) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a surgeon who can offer, inferior turbinate reduction" in patients with enlarged inferior turbinates "who have failed medical management".

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^112ECjzV]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis in recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — Summary Statement 7 states: "Perform an evaluation for specific IgE antibodies to airborne allergens in patients with RARS or CRS. (Rec, B)". Allergic rhinitis prevalence is estimated at 10% to 15% of the population at any given time, and a significant proportion of patients (30%) develop after the third decade of life. In children with CRS, allergic rhinitis has been reported in 36% to 60%; in young adults with acute rhinosinusitis (ARS), the reported incidence of allergic rhinitis ranges from 25% to 33%; and in adults with CRS, association with allergic rhinitis is reported in 40% to 84% of patients, with one study noting an association between extensive sinus disease quantified by computed tomography (CT) and allergic rhinitis in 78% of patients.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^115kVn43]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

INCS with intranasal decongestant for persistent nasal congestion — We suggest that patients with persistent nasal congestion unresponsive to an intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) or to an INCS/intranasal antihistamine (INAH) combination add an intranasal decongestant for up to 4 weeks. Strength of the recommendation: Conditional. Certainty of evidence: Low. Evidence notes that in perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) and seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), concurrent administration of INCS and intranasal decongestants provides greater reduction in nasal congestion and greater improvement in nasal volume than an intranasal decongestant alone, that when given with an intranasal steroid for up to 2 weeks rhinitis medicamentosa did not occur, and that the addition of oxymetazoline afforded significantly greater nasal congestion reduction in the AR subgroup; however, existing evidence is scant and not sufficient to support prolonged use.
