## Question

Oral thrush breastfeeding infant

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing and managing oral thrush in a breastfeeding infant, including how to distinguish mimics, evaluate risk factors, and treat the dyad with follow-up and prevention strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and differentiating thrush from look-alikes. Then, I should verify risk factors, especially maternal antibiotic exposure and the bidirectional mother–infant transmission. Next, I will examine when and how to test. After that, I need to outline treatment for the infant and for the lactating parent, including antifungal choices and duration. Finally, I should consider special situations such as refractory cases, HIV-exposed dyads, and preventive measures with lactation support and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture of oral thrush: white, curd-like plaques on the oral mucosa that are not easily wiped off and may bleed if forcibly removed, with possible associated diaper candidiasis and maternal nipple pain, and sometimes feeding difficulty or fussiness; wait, I initially wrote "irritability" and realized that is vague, so I should correct it to observable signs like crying during feeds, poor latch, or back-arching at the breast when the mouth is sore, and I should remember that symptoms can persist despite partial treatment if the source is not addressed in the dyad [^1164Eoit] [^115f65hg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — white lesions in infants can be mimics, so I need to check for frictional keratosis or "breastfeeding keratosis", which is a well-demarcated, nonsloughing keratotic plaque often on the lower lip mucosa that resolves spontaneously as sucking patterns mature; distinguishing features are that it does not wipe off and lacks the surrounding erythema typical of candidiasis, and importantly, cytopathology shows mature keratinocytes without Candida, which can prevent unnecessary antifungal exposure if recognized [^116e7QPN] [^117M4Uis].

> Next, I should review risk factors that predispose to thrush in the breastfeeding dyad; maternal antibiotic use for more than one week increases the infant's odds of oral Candida colonization and clinical thrush, and antibiotics that alter maternal gastrointestinal flora can secondarily affect the infant via breastfeeding, so I need to ask about recent maternal or infant antibiotic courses; antibiotics of concern include ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, and tobramycin, which are documented to disrupt infant gut flora and increase candidiasis risk, so counseling on this risk is appropriate and supports a concurrent maternal–infant approach if thrush occurs [^1116QKFu] [^116naZJh] [^115YX8gC] [^113p2SRM] [^1134RMLo].

> I should confirm the transmission dynamics in the dyad; thrush often reflects a bidirectional pattern in which maternal breast pain may coexist with infant oral candidiasis, and the condition may recur unless both are treated simultaneously; wait, let me verify that current guidance still emphasizes treating the dyad together — yes, expert surveys and protocols support treating both mother and infant to reduce recurrence and maternal pain burden, and ABM notes the ongoing controversy but acknowledges maternal symptoms often co-occur and recent antibiotics increase risk, reinforcing a dyadic strategy [^115f65hg] [^113u9bD5].

> Now, I will examine whether and when to test; most cases are diagnosed clinically, but if diagnosis is uncertain, the infant is refractory to standard therapy, or immunocompromise is suspected, I should obtain an oral swab for fungal culture or KOH prep; I need to ensure I don't overcall colonization as disease — one study found about a third of colonized infants were asymptomatic, so clinical correlation is key, and I should also remember that laboratory confirmation is standard in research and helps differentiate colonization from true infection when the presentation is atypical [^1116QKFu] [^11595b8g].

> For infant treatment, I should confirm first-line therapy and its limitations; nystatin suspension is traditional but has lower cure rates and recurrence issues, whereas a small randomized trial showed fluconazole suspension 3 mg/kg once daily for 7 days achieved 100% clinical cure compared with 32% for nystatin given four times daily for 10 days, so for moderate disease or nystatin failure, fluconazole is a reasonable choice; if nystatin is used, I need to instruct proper administration after feeds so it coats the mucosa, and if fluconazole is chosen, I should counsel on rare hepatotoxicity and monitor clinically; I should double-check that the trial indeed included otherwise healthy infants — yes, it did, which supports applicability to typical outpatient cases [^114ZLr58] [^112eLRT8] [^1164Eoit].

> But wait, what if topical options are preferred; miconazole oral gel is considered more effective than nystatin in some reviews, though availability varies by region, and gentian violet has been used historically but carries risks of mucosal irritation and even chemical burns with unsupervised use, so I should avoid recommending gentian violet outside supervised care; I should also consider concomitant diaper candidiasis, where adding a topical antifungal to oral therapy can expedite clearance of the cutaneous focus [^1164Eoit] [^112yGv9b].

> Next, I should review maternal treatment because the dyad is the unit of care; topical antifungal creams such as clotrimazole or miconazole applied to nipples after feeds are commonly used, and for persistent maternal symptoms or recurrent dyad infections, a short course of oral fluconazole for the lactating parent may be justified; I need to ensure safety counseling regarding rare hepatotoxicity and drug interactions, and I should confirm that fluconazole is compatible with lactation — current lactation pharmacology references generally support its use with infant monitoring, though shared decision-making is prudent [^115f65hg].

> Hold on, I should verify duration and endpoints; infant fluconazole 3 mg/kg daily for 7 days has evidence for high cure, while nystatin courses are commonly extended to 10–14 days given lower efficacy, and maternal topical therapy should continue until one week after symptoms resolve to prevent rapid reinoculation; I should also reassess latch and milk transfer because maternal nipple trauma from shallow latch can perpetuate pain and delay healing even after fungal eradication [^114ZLr58] [^112eLRT8].

> I will now examine special situations; in HIV-exposed dyads, I should prioritize prompt recognition and treatment of thrush alongside meticulous breast care because thrush and cracked nipples may increase HIV transmission risk during breastfeeding, though the absolute risk is substantially reduced with maternal ART and viral suppression; if maternal HIV viral load becomes detectable during breastfeeding, guidelines recommend temporarily stopping breastfeeding and initiating replacement feeding with additional infant prophylaxis, so I need to coordinate with maternal HIV care teams and lactation consultants to manage timing and milk supply during any interruption [^111oT8zN] [^111JK4kc].

> Let me consider refractory or recurrent disease; if thrush persists despite appropriate therapy, I should double-check adherence and technique, evaluate for unrecognized maternal symptoms, consider swab-based confirmation of Candida and resistance patterns, and assess for underlying immunocompromise or concomitant bacterial infection; a case-based report reminds me that treatment-resistant thrush can be the harbinger of systemic disease in rare cases, so persistent or atypical presentations warrant expanded evaluation and possible specialist referral [^112HZPRE] [^113u9bD5].

> Prevention and lactation support are integral; I should counsel on optimizing latch and positioning, minimizing unnecessary antibiotics for mother or infant, and using test weighing judiciously when milk transfer concerns persist, recognizing that test weighing can help quantify intake in dyads with ongoing growth or latch issues; for preterm or medically fragile infants, I need to coordinate NICU discharge plans with early lactation follow-up to sustain breastfeeding and promptly address complications like thrush or maternal nipple pain that threaten continuation [^113u9bD5] [^113WoQr8] [^111znsRZ].

> In summary, I need to ensure accurate diagnosis by distinguishing thrush from frictional keratosis, identify and address risk factors including maternal antibiotics, treat both mother and infant simultaneously, select antifungal regimens with the best available efficacy while balancing safety and access, and provide lactation support to prevent recurrence; I should double-check that each step aligns with the evidence base and local resources, and if any assumption conflicts with the literature, I will correct course accordingly to deliver safe, effective, and dyad-centered care [^116e7QPN] [^1116QKFu] [^115f65hg] [^114ZLr58].

Oral thrush in breastfeeding infants is best managed with **dyadic therapy** — nystatin suspension for the infant and topical antifungal for the mother's nipples — to prevent reinfection [^115f65hg]. If nystatin fails or symptoms persist, **fluconazole is superior** and may be used in infants and lactating mothers [^114ZLr58] [^112eLRT8]. Continue breastfeeding unless pain is severe; optimize latch, use probiotics, and treat any maternal antibiotics-induced dysbiosis to reduce recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Infants with oral thrush typically present with:

- **White, curd-like plaques**: On the tongue, inner cheeks, gums, or palate, which are difficult to wipe off.

- **Irritability and feeding difficulties**: Due to discomfort or pain.

- **Diaper rash**: Often accompanies oral thrush due to Candida overgrowth [^1164Eoit].

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on characteristic lesions; if uncertain, confirm with a KOH smear or fungal culture [^113u9bD5].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors predispose breastfeeding infants to oral thrush:

- **Maternal antibiotic use**: Disrupts normal flora, promoting Candida overgrowth [^1116QKFu].

- **Immature immune system**: Infants are more susceptible to fungal infections.

- **Poor latch or nipple trauma**: Facilitates Candida transmission between mother and infant [^1119C3KE].

---

## Treatment strategies

Effective management of oral thrush in breastfeeding infants requires **addressing both the infant and the mother** to prevent reinfection:

---

### Infant treatment

- **First-line therapy**: Nystatin suspension (100,000 units/mL) administered as 1 mL four times daily after feeds for 7–14 days.

- **Alternative therapy**: Fluconazole suspension (3 mg/kg once daily for 7 days) if nystatin fails or symptoms persist; fluconazole has been shown to be superior to nystatin in clinical trials [^114ZLr58] [^112eLRT8].

- **Supportive care**: Continue breastfeeding unless maternal pain is severe; ensure proper latch and feeding technique [^113iQG2L].

---

### Maternal treatment

Apply **topical antifungal agents** such as clotrimazole 1% cream or miconazole 2% cream to the nipples after each feed for 7–14 days. If topical therapy fails or symptoms persist, oral fluconazole 150 mg once, repeated after 72 hours if needed, is appropriate; it is compatible with breastfeeding.

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Preventing recurrence involves **addressing underlying risk factors**:

- **Probiotics**: Consider maternal probiotic supplementation to restore normal flora.

- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Limit unnecessary maternal antibiotic use [^1116QKFu].

- **Lactation support**: Ensure proper latch and feeding technique to prevent nipple trauma [^1176PtPB].

---

## Impact on breastfeeding

Oral thrush can **significantly impact breastfeeding**, causing maternal nipple pain, infant feeding difficulties, and potential early weaning if not adequately addressed. Effective management and lactation support are essential to maintain breastfeeding continuity [^113R5nTc].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Parents should **seek medical attention** if:

- Symptoms persist despite treatment.

- The infant develops fever, lethargy, or poor feeding.

- Maternal nipple pain becomes severe or unmanageable.

---

Oral thrush in breastfeeding infants is a common fungal infection requiring **dyadic treatment** and attention to risk factors. With appropriate management and lactation support, most cases resolve without long-term consequences, allowing continued breastfeeding.

### The impact of maternal antibiotic consumption on the development of oral thrush infection in breastfeeding infants: a quasi-experimental study [^1116QKFu]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Oral thrush is a common yeast infection caused by Candida albicans in infants during their first few weeks or months. Infant mothers' antibiotics consumption can contribute to this opportunistic fungal growth due to their weaker immune systems. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between maternal antibiotic consumption and oral thrush infection in breastfeeding infants, this study aims to provide insights for health care professionals regarding antibiotic prescriptions and preventive strategies for managing oral thrush. Methods: A quasi-experimental design with a control group was used. Eighty-two breastfeeding infants were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 40) infants of antibiotic-consuming mothers and Group 2 (n = 42) infants of nonantibiotic-consuming mothers. The oral samples were collected using sterile cotton swabs and cultured on Sabouraud's dextrose agar C. albicans, confirmed by simple staining and a germ tube test. Results: Infants aged 1–11 months with a mean ± standard deviation of 4.8 ± 3.51. Within all 82 oral swabs, 42.7% were positive for C. albicans growth and 57.3% were negative. The highest percentage was in 1-month-old infants (n = 9, 25.71%), and the lowest was in 11 months old (n = 2, 5.71%). Group 2 infants had significantly fewer positive C. albicans growth (n = 12, 28.57%) compared with group 1 (n = 23; 57.5%) (χ 2 = 7.0, p = 0.007; odds ratio = 3.332, 95% confidence interval = 1.35–8.46). Oral thrush clinical signs were identified in 66.6% and 33.4% of group 1 and 2 infants, respectively, while 31.4% of C. albicans- positive colonization showed no clinical manifestations. Conclusion: Maternal antibiotic consumption for more than 1 week is associated with the occurrence of oral thrush in breastfeeding infants. Differences in clinical signs in two groups of infants indicate the importance of laboratory tests for early oral thrush diagnosis. This can help health care professionals understand oral thrush causes, enable early detection, improve treatment, and enhance appropriate antibiotic use in breastfeeding mothers.

### Thrush in the breastfeeding dyad: results of a survey on diagnosis and treatment [^115f65hg]. Clinical Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Infection with Candida albicans in the breastfeeding dyad has been associated with extreme pain in the breastfeeding mother and may lead to premature weaning. There is presently a dearth of information on diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of this condition in the literature. Therefore, before such a trial was conducted, a survey was sent to experts in the field of lactation, the members of The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, on the diagnosis and treatment of thrush in the breastfeeding mother and baby. Results showed that the majority of respondents relied primarily on history and physical examination of the baby, but not the mother, to make the diagnosis. Laboratory tests were ordered only rarely. The most common initial treatment was oral nystatin for the infant and cream for the mother's breasts. This was followed by oral nystatin for the infant and oral fluconazole for the mother. Treatment of recurrence or persistence was again most commonly nystatin for both mother and infant, followed by oral nystatin for the infant and oral fluconazole for the mother or oral fluconazole for both. In the absence of controlled trials of this condition, these results may serve as suggestions for the clinician, until definitive data are available.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^111oT8zN]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — breastfeeding management and infant prophylaxis — Administer appropriate ARV prophylaxis starting at birth. If detectable viral load develops during breastfeeding, the Panels recommend that breastfeeding be temporarily stopped or discontinued and replacement feeding initiated, and additional infant ARV prophylaxis and infant testing are also recommended. Provide guidance on good breast care, promptly identify and treat mastitis, thrush, and cracked or bleeding nipples, and note that these conditions may increase the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding, although the impact of these conditions in the context of ART and viral suppression is unknown. Develop a joint plan for weaning with family and providers; since very rapid weaning was associated with increased risk of HIV shedding into breast milk and risk of transmission in the pre-ART era, weaning over a 2- to 4-week period might be safer with attention to breast care. There is little evidence to guide the infant HIV testing schedule during breastfeeding, and there have been transmissions detected many weeks or even months after reported cessation of breastfeeding.

### Breastfeeding keratosis: this frictional keratosis of newborns may mimic thrush [^116e7QPN]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

We report the first example, to our knowledge, of a frictional keratosis from exuberant sucking in a breastfeeding infant. A 2-month-old girl was referred for evaluation of a well-demarcated, nonsloughing white keratotic plaque of the lower lip mucosa, just inside the vermilion border. The plaque had a slightly irregular surface, had no surrounding erythema, and was the only such plaque in the mouth. It had been present for at least 3 weeks and had been unsuccessfully treated by her pediatrician via oral Mycostatin (nystatin). Her parents sought a second opinion when the infant was prescribed a full course of oral Diflucan (fluconazole). A cytopathology smear (Papanicolaou test) revealed abundant mature keratinocytes with no evidence of Candida. The mother admitted that the infant "worked hard" at sucking during breastfeeding and continued sucking long after feeding. The parents were unaware of any other habit or potential irritation of the lips. After 3 months of age the infant's sucking pattern became more "normal" and the keratosis disappeared; it did not recur during 3 years of follow-up. We propose the term "breastfeeding keratosis" for this entity.

Oral thrush is a familiar presentation in both general practice and paediatrics, and is usually responsive to treatment in the community. Here, we present the diagnostic journey of a previously well boy aged 3 years who presented with treatment-resistant thrush and describe how 'unexpected' results led to eventual diagnosis and management. This intriguing case was managed jointly by district hospital general paediatric team and tertiary hospital specialist teams.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^111JK4kc]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Breastfeeding during maternal HIV — key directives include "Administer appropriate ARV prophylaxis starting at birth". If detectable viral load develops during breastfeeding, "the Panels recommend that breastfeeding be temporarily stopped or discontinued and replacement feeding initiated. Additional infant ARV prophylaxis and infant testing are also recommended". The guidance states to "Provide guidance on good breast care, including strategies to avoid and promptly resolve over production of breast milk, milk stasis, and breast engorgement, which can lead to sore nipples, mastitis, or breast abscess", and to "Promptly identify and treat mastitis, thrush, and cracked or bleeding nipples", noting "These conditions may increase the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding, although the impact of these conditions in the context of ART and viral suppression is unknown". It also advises to "Develop a joint plan for weaning with family and providers", and that "weaning over a 2- to 4-week period might be safer", and further notes "There is little evidence to guide the infant HIV testing schedule during breastfeeding, and there have been transmissions detected many weeks or even months after reported cessation of breastfeeding".

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (Cipro) [^116naZJh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Published literature reports that ciprofloxacin is present in human milk following intravenous and oral administration. There is no information regarding effects of CIPRO on milk production or the breastfed infant. Because of the potential risk of serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, including arthropathy shown in juvenile animal studies [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), (Clinical Considerations)], for most indications a lactating woman may consider pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment with CIPRO and an additional two days (five half-lives) after the last dose. Alternatively, advise a woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with CIPRO and for an additional two days (five half-lives) after the last dose.

However, for inhalation anthrax (post exposure), during an incident resulting in exposure to anthrax, the risk-benefit assessment of continuing breastfeeding while the mother (and potentially the infant) is (are) on CIPRO may be acceptable [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Pediatric Use (8.4), and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for CIPRO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from CIPRO or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Ciprofloxacin may cause intestinal flora alteration of the breastfeeding infant. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash).

### When is the use of pacifiers justifiable in the baby-friendly hospital initiative context? A clinician's guide [^117MYCw3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

However, the risk of losing the sucking reflex has been identified in infants separated from their mothers for extended periods, and the contribution of NNS has been highlighted for preserving the reflex and enhancing physiological stability in infants, especially in situations of mother–infant separation when, for example, the infant is admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or the mother is very ill and admitted to high or intensive care. Healthcare professionals have started to review the prohibited use of pacifiers as stated in the 'Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding' as part of the BFHI. The Nordic and Quebec working group, for example, has proposed expanding the BFHI Ten Steps to include the use of pacifiers in the NICU when justifiable as the current BFHI policy does not include the NICU context at all. Another approach to "Promoting and Protecting Breastfeeding for Vulnerable Infants" is the Spatz Ten Steps Model. This model outlines the following ten steps: providing parents with information to make an informed decision to breastfeed; assisting mothers with the establishment and maintenance of milk supply; correct breast milk management (storage and handling); developing procedures to feed the infant the breast milk; skin-to-skin care creates opportunities for NNS at the breast; managing the transition to breast; measuring milk transfer; preparation of infant and family for discharge; and appropriate follow-up care. Implementation of this model in an 82-bedded NICU over a period of three years (2010–2013) resulted in an increased parent satisfaction with nurses' support of breastfeeding and a 3.1‐fold greater odds of the infant receiving mother's own milk at discharge. None of the available models however include the developing suck-swallow-breathe (SSB) co-ordination as the final step in transition to oral feeds.

### ABM clinical protocol # 23: nonpharmacological management of procedure-related pain in the breastfeeding infant, revised 2016 [^114uiQeU]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Sucrose and sucking (in combination or separately) — Sucrose taste has been shown to be an effective analgesia for newborns and young infants for many minor procedures but not for more lengthy or invasive procedures such as circumcision or bladder catheterizations in infants older than 30 days. When breastfeeding infants are undergoing minor procedures without mother available for direct breastfeeding and when expressed human milk is not available to use as a supplement, use of sucrose and sucking may be considered (IA). Using a pacifier dipped in 24% sucrose (by weight) solution whenever breastfeeding is not possible is an effective option (IB), and, if sucking a pacifier or finger is not an option, 0.5–2 mL of a 24% sucrose solution can be administered orally through syringe 2 minutes before the painful procedure (IB). Sucrose administered by oro- or nasogastric tube is not analgesic. Glucose has also been shown to be an effective and relatively inexpensive analgesic (IB). At least one small study indicates that sucrose is significantly more effective than human milk when both are administered orally through syringe at reducing infants' cry time, recovery time, and change in heart rate (IB). Although pacifiers alone may decrease crying associated with painful procedures, sucking a pacifier has been found to reduce pain only when the suck rate exceeds 30 sucks/minute, and a pacifier (or clean gloved or parental finger) should be used as the sole soothing intervention only if breastfeeding, human milk, sucrose (or glucose), and skin-to-skin contact are unavailable.

### ABM clinical protocol # 22: guidelines for management of jaundice in the breastfeeding infant 35 weeks or more of gestation-revised 2017 [^113iQG2L]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #22 — evidence-based strategies for preventing or ameliorating jaundice in the breastfeeding infant include to initiate breastfeeding as early as possible, preferably in the first hour after birth, with the statement that in the vast majority of births, breastfeeding should be initiated in the first hour; to encourage frequent exclusive breastfeeding, noting that frequent breastfeeding (8–12 times or more in 24 hours) is crucial for establishing milk supply and that there is a positive association between the number of breastfeeds a day and lower TSB; to note that it is unnecessary to give glucose water to test the infant's ability to swallow or avoid aspiration; to use hand expression or pumping of colostrum or breast milk to provide extra milk to support intake in some at-risk infants, while randomized trials have shown that the initiation of pumping may reduce milk transfer and eventual breastfeeding duration for some populations of infants; and to optimize early management by ensuring comfortable positioning, effective latch and adequate milk transfer with a healthcare provider trained in breastfeeding management, supporting skin-to-skin contact starting immediately after birth and throughout the postpartum period as it helps with milk supply and makes mother's milk easily available, and providing education on early feeding cues.

### Characterisation of sucking dynamics of breastfeeding preterm infants: a cross sectional study [^1136xAUV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Few objective studies have been carried out to investigate the mechanisms of breastfeeding in the preterm infant, often presumed to be different or 'immature' compared to term infants. This belief has been based on clinical observation and measurement of intra-oral vacuums, but no studies have imaged the sucking mechanism of breastfed preterm infants yet this is essential, to devise successful strategies focused on facilitating full breastfeeding. Recent ultrasound studies of term breastfeeding infants confirm that term breastfeed infants employ a parallel movement of the anterior and mid tongue to remove milk from the breast and use a more wave like motion of the posterior tongue to clear the milk bolus from the oral cavity during the oral phase of swallowing.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (ciprofloxacin) [^113vroDh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In peri- and post-natal studies, rats received ciprofloxacin doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (oral) or up to 30 mg/kg/day (subcutaneous) from GD 16 to 22 days postpartum. The 200 mg/kg dose is approximately 1.3-times the maximum recommended clinical oral dose based on body surface area. Neither maternal toxicity nor adverse effects on growth and development of the pups were observed, including no sign of arthropathy on the rear leg joints of the pups. Ciprofloxacin and other quinolones have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals of most species tested when administered directly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) and Nonclinical Toxicology 13.2].

### E-IMNCI: a novel clinical diagnostic support system approach to strengthen effectiveness and quality of IMNCI implementation in India [^111mTefB]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Knowledge and case management practices

Knowledge of ANMs on identifying clinical signs and symptoms improved. Seventy-five per cent ANMs correctly identified the order of E-IMNCI clinical case management, and 70% and 90% ANMs could recall assessment steps correctly for the infant and child in IMNCI case management (baseline vs postimplementation). 87.5% of all respondents (ANMs and MOs) agreed to the essentiality of referring to the IMNCI protocol postimplementation against 32% at baseline. At postimplementation, 100% ANMs checked records of the previous visit and counselled patients for a follow-up visit.

The postimplementation assessment showed that the assessment of signs such as feeding difficulty, convulsions, counting respiratory rate, umbilical sepsis, axillary temperature recording, signs of dehydration improved in the age group of 0–59 days. Skills for assessing chest indrawing and thrush needed further strengthening. Assessment steps for checking breastfeeding attachment, correct suckling and oral thrush showed a decline. These results are shown in table 1.

Table 1
Assessment of young infant (children aged less than 2 months) by ANMs

There was marked improvement in assessing general danger signs in the age group of 2–12 months. However, only 26% of ANMs assessed at least three danger signs for the age group 2 months to 5 years. The use of pulse oximeter (83%), assessing signs of dehydration (100%), assessment for the presence of stiff neck (59%) in cases with fever in the age group 2 months to 5 years have also improved. These results are shown in table 2.

Table 2
Assessment of children (aged 2–59 months) by ANMs

The postimplementation assessment showed that using E-IMNCI application logistic management tool by the ANM's led to improvement in availability of the essential medicines and equipment required for delivering good quality care, at all the health facilities (table 3).

However, for inhalation anthrax (post exposure), during an incident resulting in exposure to anthrax, the risk-benefit assessment of continuing breastfeeding while the mother (and potentially the infant) is (are) on ciprofloxacin tablets may be acceptable [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Pediatric Use (8.4), and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ciprofloxacin tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ciprofloxacin tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Ciprofloxacin may cause intestinal flora alteration of the breastfeeding infant. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash).

### ABM clinical protocol # 22: guidelines for management of jaundice in the breastfeeding infant 35 weeks or more of gestation-revised 2017 [^112VxT3H]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding infant jaundice — phototherapy practice points state that phototherapy is the most frequently used treatment and can be used while continuing full breastfeeding or it can be combined with supplementation of expressed breast milk or infant formula if maternal supply is insufficient; only in extenuating circumstances is temporary interruption of breastfeeding with replacement feeding necessary. Phototherapy can be done in the hospital or at home, and home phototherapy is acceptable for low-risk infants provided TSB levels are monitored; in the hospital, it is best done in the mother's room or a hospital room where the mother can also reside to minimize mother–infant separation and so that breastfeeding can be continued. Interruption of phototherapy for durations of up to 30 minutes or longer to permit breastfeeding without eye patches does not alter the effectiveness of the treatment, and although phototherapy increases insensible water loss to some degree, infants under phototherapy do not routinely require extra oral or intravenous fluids; if newborns receiving phototherapy are too sleepy to breastfeed vigorously, or if breastfeeding appears ineffective, mothers should express milk to feed by syringe, bottle, or gavage until newborns are vigorous enough to transfer milk effectively. The routine provision of intravenous fluids is discouraged because they may inhibit thirst and diminish oral intake; however, they may be indicated in cases of infant dehydration, hypernatremia, or inability to ingest adequate milk.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^1119C3KE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Significantly, a history of mastitis with a previous infant also seems to be a strong mastitis predictor and, in our study, this factor was associated with an almost four-fold risk of mastitis in the multivariate analysis. Breast health depends on a balanced interaction between the host and its microbiota. Since the milk bacterial profile is host-specific, there could be a mammary microbiota more prone to mastitis development. In fact, S. epidermidis, an underrated cause of mastitis, lives at the edge between commensalism and pathogenicity and requires a predisposed host to transform itself into a notorious pathogen. On the other hand, several oligosaccharides involved in the mucosal immune system are present in human milk. Therefore, differences in profile and concentration of such compounds may explain a differential host susceptibility to develop mastitis.

Our results indicate that a familial occurrence of mastitis is a significant risk factor for the disease, which suggests the role of a genetic predisposition in the development of mastitis. The existence of a genetic basis for host responses to bacteria involved in mastitis has been widely documented in cattle and sheep mastitis, although the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. The first association between human granulomatous mastitis caused by Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) related to defective neutrophil responses has been recently described, which opens new fields for further investigation in human mastitis.

In our work, antifungal medication during breastfeeding was strongly linked to mastitis. Antifungal ointments are often prescribed to treat "mammary candidiasis" on the basis of visual assessment, without a microbiological analysis. Actually, yeasts are an extremely rare cause of lactational mastitis in any mammalian species and there is lack of evidence to reach such a diagnosis. It is interesting to note, however, that there is an association between staphylococcal/streptococcal mastitis and candidiasis (oral thrush) in the infant since a high concentration of such bacteria can induce Candida albicans overgrowth. C. albicans and streptococci form a synergistic partnership where Streptococcus promotes fungal growth by secreting metabolic products that can be used as a carbon source by the yeast. After C. albicans overgrowth in the infant mouth, some of the yeast cells can be transferred to the mother through breastfeeding, so that C. albicans could be isolated from breast milk and misdiagnosed as the cause of mastitis.

### Comparing barriers to breastfeeding success in the first month for non-overweight and overweight women [^115oCsgy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

No differences in prevalence of a list of specified breastfeeding problems or use of formula to manage these problems was found between weight status groups in the present study, however more overweight than non-overweight women had used infant formula in the first month, and significantly more overweight women than non-overweight women had ceased breastfeeding by the time of the survey (approximately 4 months postpartum). Over half of overweight women who reported an unspecified ('other') breastfeeding problem used formula in response. Further exploration of these problems (in particular thrush and baby being a 'lazy feeder') is needed to better understand this finding. Examination of reasons for formula use in the first month provides some insight into a possible reason for the different outcomes between weight status groups. Almost double the proportion of overweight women than non-overweight women who used infant formula in the first month agreed that an important reason for using formula was that it was as good as breastmilk. This finding is particularly concerning given that children of overweight women have higher obesity risk, which may be compounded by not breastfeeding. Further qualitative research may assist in understanding the reasoning behind these issues and how best to communicate the range of health, social and economic benefits of breastfeeding and risks associated with formula feeding to women who may be entering pregnancy overweight or obese.

An unexpected finding was that there was no difference in the proportion of overweight and non-overweight women who reported having "not enough milk" in the first month and who used infant formula in response. These findings are inconsistent with conclusions of a recent review paper. However longer-term impacts on breastfeeding (such as early cessation) were not assessed here and potentially issues with milk supply (real or perceived) may have differential impacts on breastfeeding outcomes for overweight compared to non-overweight women in the longer-term. Nevertheless, we did show that perceived insufficient milk supply was a common problem affecting over two thirds of breastfeeding mothers during the first month; with almost half of these women using infant formula in response. It is important to note that the data reflect mothers' perceptions rather than actual adequacy of supply to meet infant energy requirements; it has been estimated that only a small minority of women (~ 5%) have physiologic insufficient milk supply. Previous work has indicated that perceptions of insufficient milk are consistently associated with low maternal self-efficacy. Thus, antenatal and postnatal breastfeeding guidance and support needs to consider how concerns about milk may be ameliorated through increasing women's breastfeeding self-efficacy.

### The role of micro-organisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans) in the pathogenesis of breast pain and infection in lactating women: study protocol [^116fcASo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Methods/Design

Aims

Specific aims of the study are:

1. To determine whether S. aureus and/or Candida spp are involved in burning nipple/breast pain in lactating women - the condition known as breast thrush - using a longitudinal study for the first time;

2. To increase understanding of transmission dynamics and infant colonisation of these organisms by describing the timing of oral and nasal colonisation with S. aureus and Candida spp in breastfed infants and determining the role of infant colonisation with these organisms in relation to the timing of maternal mastitis and breast thrush;

3. To investigate comprehensively whether staphylococci other than S. aureus (coagulase-negative staphylococci) play a role in infective mastitis;

4. To ascertain the impact of common maternal physical health symptoms and breastfeeding problems on maternal psychological well-being at four and eight weeks postpartum, adjusting for known determinants of poorer postnatal mood.

Study hypotheses

Pre-specified study hypotheses for the microbiological components of CASTLE are:

1. Women reporting nipple and breast candidiasis are more likely to have Candida spp isolated from their swabs and breast milk samples and/or from swabs taken from their infants;

2. Women reporting nipple and breast candidiasis are more likely to have S. aureus isolated from isolated from their swabs and breast milk samples and/or from swabs taken from their infants;

3. Participants experiencing mastitis are more likely to have S. aureus isolated from their breast milk compared to women not reporting this condition;

4. Infants of women reporting mastitis are more likely to have S. aureus isolated from their oral and/or nasal swabs compared to healthy controls;

5. Women who report an over-supply of breast milk are more likely to develop mastitis compared to women who report an adequate supply or under-supply of breast milk;

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine position statement on ankyloglossia in breastfeeding dyads [^113WoQr8]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Ankyloglossia — assessment and diagnosis requires that no single tool determine treatment; "No specific tool is meant to be used in the clinical setting as the sole means of deciding whether a frenotomy is indicated or not. Such a decision can only be made in conjunction with a skilled clinical breastfeeding assessment". A comprehensive evaluation "should include the maternal history taking and physical examination… and the infant history and physical examination with emphasis on the detailed oral anatomic findings". "Direct observation of breastfeeding is essential", and assessment at the breast should include "maternal comfort and milk transfer as evidenced by audible and/or visible swallowing". Test weighing "can provide an indication of the amount of milk transferred… but cannot be interpreted as applicable to all feeding sessions" for a given dyad.

### Infant factors that impact the ecology of human milk secretion and composition-a report from "Breastmilk ecology: genesis of infant nutrition (BEGIN) " working group 3 [^117S7RkB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Preterm delivery

Compositional differences in the human milk of parents delivering preterm infants have been addressed separately. To date, the mechanisms for these differences have not been definitively delineated. Preterm delivery is associated with a delay in the onset of secretory activation, low milk volume, and altered milk composition including that of both nutrients and nonnutrient bioactive factors. Several factors contribute to these differences. A shortened gestation means less time for prenatal preparation by the mammary gland, although how preterm delivery interrupts mammary gland development and how this affects milk composition are not well studied. After delivery, the preterm infant exhibits immature oral feeding skills, meaning that milk removal is impaired or absent. This prompts the need for dependence on alternative methods of milk removal such as manual and/or mechanical breast pump use, which may independently contribute to both delayed secretory activation and insufficient milk volume.

Preterm infants are often unable to achieve effective and efficient milk removal to meet their nutritional needs and to maintain lactation processes. This is due to not only immaturity in oral motor skills but also an inability to communicate hunger (e.g. waking to feed, rooting, and sucking on hand) or satiety (e.g. pulling off nipple and turning head). The ability to feed orally develops gradually and is typically in place by 36–42 wk of postmenstrual age, with the timing inversely related to the gestational age at birth and with possible further delay due to other clinical conditions. For preterm infants with cardiorespiratory disease, compromised endurance complicates the development of oral feeding abilities. Neurological sequelae of preterm birth can further delay the maturation of oral feeding.

Factors shown to relate positively to the infant's development of the ability to remove milk effectively and efficiently from the breast include an abundance of available milk in the breast; skin-to-skin or "kangaroo" care; feeding directly at the breast before bottle feeding; and shorter duration of neonatal hospital stay. The clearest evidence regarding methods to optimize preterm infant feeding directly from the breast are studies of kangaroo care and the use of test-weighing. In a randomized, controlled trial in a population of infants born at 32–36 wk of gestation, unlimited kangaroo care was associated with a longer duration of breastfeeding (5 vs. 2 mo) and longer exclusive breastfeeding. In a case-control study, mean skin-to-skin time (in min) per day was higher in lactating parent–infant dyads who sustained breastfeeding through 6 mo compared with that of those who did not.

### Tongue-tie and frenotomy in infants with breastfeeding difficulties: achieving a balance [^112hoyXn]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Currently there is debate on how best to manage young infants with tongue-tie who have breastfeeding problems. One of the challenges is the subjectivity of the outcome variables used to assess efficacy of tongue-tie division. This structured review documents how the argument has evolved. It proposes how best to assess, inform and manage mothers and their babies who present with tongue-tie related breastfeeding problems.

Methods

Databases were searched for relevant papers including Pubmed, Medline, and the Cochrane Library. Professionals in the field were personally contacted regarding the provision of additional data. Inclusion criteria were: infants less than 3 months old with tongue-tie and/or feeding problems. The exclusion criteria were infants with oral anomalies and neuromuscular disorders.

Results

There is wide variation in prevalence rates reported in different series, from 0.02 to 10.7%. The most comprehensive clinical assessment is the Hazelbaker Assessment Tool for lingual frenulum function. The most recently published systematic review of the effect of tongue-tie release on breastfeeding concludes that there were a limited number of studies with quality evidence. There have been 316 infants enrolled in frenotomy RCTs across five studies. No major complications from surgical division were reported. The complications of frenotomy may be minimised with a check list before embarking on the procedure.

Conclusions

Good assessment and selection are important because 50% of breastfeeding babies with ankyloglossia will not encounter any problems. We recommend 2 to 3 weeks as reasonable timing for intervention. Frenotomy appears to improve breastfeeding in infants with tongue-tie, but the placebo effect is difficult to quantify. Complications are rare, but it is important that it is carried out by a trained professional.

Impact of hypo‑ and hyperglycemia — management goals — state that the goal of management in infants and very young children with diabetes is to avoid frequent hypoglycemia associated with neurocognitive sequelae while also aiming to reduce sustained hyperglycemia; early childhood is a critical time for growth and brain development, exposure to hypoglycemia is associated with a decline in neurodevelopmental outcomes in children, and young children with diabetes are particularly at risk of severe hypoglycemia due to small insulin requirements, sensitivity to exogenous insulin, variability in oral intake, and inability to express symptoms.

### Clindamycin in percent dextrose (clindamycin in 5 percent dextrose) [^1178jESh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic effects

In clinical trials with pregnant women, the systemic administration of clindamycin during the second and third trimesters, has not been associated with an increased frequency of congenital abnormalities.

Clindamycin should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy only if clearly needed. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (2.1 and 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2, respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mg/kg/day (0.9 and 0.5 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2, respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity.

Nursing Mothers

Limited published data based on breast milk sampling reports that clindamycin appears in human breast milk in the range of less than 0.5 to 3.8 mcg/mL at dosages of 150 mg orally to 600 mg intravenously. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breast-fed infant's gastrointestinal flora. If oral or intravenous clindamycin is required by a nursing mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but an alternate drug may be preferred. Monitor the breast-fed infant for possible adverse effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clindamycin and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from clindamycin or from the underlying maternal condition.

Pediatric Use

When clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection sterile solution is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years) appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Feeding challenges in hypotonic infants — hypotonic infants often have breastfeeding problems from abnormal or underdeveloped control of oropharyngeal structures leading to an uncoordinated and/or weak suck; Trisomy 21 is described as a genetic disorder where more than 90% of infants have hypotonia with oral abnormalities (malocclusion, small mouth, relatively large protruding tongue) that, when coupled with hypotonia, result in significant feeding difficulties; additional barriers include separation of premature infants from mothers after birth and small, underdeveloped oral structures with difficulties in suck–swallow coordination.

### Buprenorphine vs. morphine: impact on neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) outcomes in a single center retrospective study [^111FzA6d]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Severity and treatment of NOWS

The MOTHER NAS tool, a modified Finnegan scoring system, (19 criteria, score range 0 to 40) was used to assess the severity of withdrawal. The institutional policy included a multidisciplinary approach for all infants with NOWS, primarily maximizing the non-pharmacological care, cohorting infants with NOWS, encouraging parental involvement as much as possible, and facilitating breastfeeding when the mother was abstinent or enrolled in a methadone maintenance program. Only those that had symptoms uncontrolled with these measures and meeting the institutional protocol were treated with medications. Pharmacotherapy was initiated with a single score ≥ 12 or three consecutive scores equal to a sum of > 24. Before November 2017, all infants with NOWS requiring pharmacotherapy were treated with morphine as the primary medication (Fig. 1). After November 2017, the institutional protocol shifted towards sublingual buprenorphine as the first line agent, except for neonates < 36 weeks, continuation of therapy begun at outside hospital, maternal request, NPO status, or other contraindications for sublingual buprenorphine (e.g. orofacial anatomical defects like cleft lip/palate, orogastric diseases like diffuse oral thrush or mucositis, severe illness requiring intubation) - in such situations, morphine was used. If the neonate had received both buprenorphine and morphine at any point during the hospital course, they were excluded from the study. A standardized protocol was followed for the escalation and weaning of both medications (see supplement). When symptoms were not well controlled with the opioids, phenobarbital was added as the second-line therapy and clonidine as the third-line therapy. Even though a departmental protocol existed to manage these adjunct medications, treating physicians could modify them according to the patient's needs.

### Utility of clinical parameters to identify HIV infection in infants below ten weeks of age in south Africa: a prospective cohort study [^1179LiQP]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

As expected, increasing the number of positive signs reduces sensitivity but increases specificity. Reflux occurred at low frequency (3.4%) but appeared very specific, albeit difficult to define. Of note, 11 (73%) of the 15 infants with reflux also had oral thrush, which could have aggravated or caused the symptom; swallowing incoordination, an early sign of encephalopathy, could also have contributed. That oral thrush and low weight for age were so highly specific in this population suggests that these findings cannot only be attributed to formula feeding or co-morbidities such as malnutrition and TB.

A limitation of our study is that clinician's knowledge of the infants' HIV status may have influenced the finding and reporting of clinical findings. On the other hand, HIV-infected infants eligible for CHER were selected for lack of severe clinical disease and doctors trained for the study evaluated all infants. Our results require validation in other settings, for example, where malaria and breastfeeding are prevalent, and in VTP programs with larger numbers of HIV-exposed uninfected infants and with lower HIV prevalence. Our study included a large group of HIV-infected infants (77%) and a smaller number of HIV-exposed infants, all below 10 weeks of age, in contrast to all of the other

studies. Also, as mentioned, infants with severe clinical disease, where the diagnosis may be more obvious, were also excluded. In settings where this algorithm would be useful, the prevalence of HIV-infection amongst exposed infants would be lower, and thus affect the positive and negative predictive values of the algorithm. In addition, due to selection methods, most HIV-infected infants included in this analysis were relatively well, with a median CD4 count of 34%. The algorithm may perform better in a general population of HIV-infected infants. Additionally, only 12% of this cohort was breastfeeding. In conclusion, a combination of clinical findings in infants below 10 weeks of age may be useful for predicting HIV infection and prioritising care. There is urgent need to validate these findings in other settings and to determine their relevance in diverse settings.

### The role of micro-organisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans) in the pathogenesis of breast pain and infection in lactating women: study protocol [^1125r8kr]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Sample

Four hundred women and their newborn infants form the study group. Women are recruited in The Royal Women's Hospital (RWH), Melbourne and Frances Perry House (FPH), a private hospital located on the same site; approximately two hundred women from each site. Four hundred women will be recruited to allow for 20% loss as some may not breastfeed or give up prematurely/withdraw from study/lost to follow-up.

Eligibility criteria for the study group are: between 18–50 years of age; nulliparity; ≥ 36 weeks pregnant at recruitment; singleton pregnancy; breastfeeding intention for at least eight weeks postpartum; sufficient proficiency in English to complete written questionnaires and a telephone interview; residing ≤ 10 km from Melbourne Central Business District (CBD). Criteria for exclusion are: medical conditions which do not allow breastfeeding; breast reduction surgery; dermatitis on nipple during pregnancy; under care of the Women's Hospital Alcohol and Drug Service; under care of Mental Health Service or Social Worker.

Sample size

Sample size estimations were conducted using Epi-Info Version 6. Table 1 shows power calculations for the study with alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.20. Sample size calculations assume a ratio of 1:1 (unexposed: exposed) for comparison of infants colonised with S. aureus (assuming that about 50% of young infants are colonised with S. aureus). To detect a clinically significant difference in the outcome of maternal breast thrush from 5% in the unexposed group to 15% in the group exposed to infant S. aureus colonisation, a sample of three hundred and eighteen women are needed. If we based the calculation on infants colonised with Candida spp (four not colonised to one colonised), two hundred and seventy women are required in order to have enough power to identify a clinically significant increase, a twofold relative risk in breast thrush in mothers of infants with oral Candida spp (20% to 40%). Therefore, a sample size of four hundred was considered sufficient to detect clinically important differences in breast thrush and mastitis associated with infant colonisation with S. aureus and Candida spp, (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.20), allowing for 20% loss to follow-up or withdrawal from the study. This will allow us to examine other outcomes of interest, including determinants of maternal mastitis.

### ABM clinical protocol # 27: breastfeeding an infant or young child with insulin-dependent diabetes [^116WbvXV]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #27 — principles of management for infants and young children with diabetes emphasize maintaining blood glucose within a target range with the least variability. Conventionally, caregivers are instructed to perform capillary glucose levels in young children before meals and snacks, occasionally after meals, at bedtime, before exercise in older children, when low blood glucose is suspected, and after treating low blood glucose until normoglycemic, with a frequency of 6–10 times/day. In addition, caregivers are instructed to give insulin for all meals and snacks containing more than 10–15 g of carbohydrates. Monogenic diabetes is caused by a single gene variant and includes neonatal diabetes and Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY); although insulin is often used, occasionally oral sulfonylureas are used after initial diagnosis and stabilization, and expressed breast milk is an excellent alternative to breastfeeding in these rare cases when neonatal diabetes and associated manifestations make breastfeeding difficult to initiate at birth.

### Comparison of fluconazole and nystatin oral suspensions for treatment of oral candidiasis in infants [^114ZLr58]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Oral thrush is a common condition in young infants. Nystatin treatment is associated with frequent recurrences and difficulty in administration. Fluconazole was compared with nystatin for the treatment of oral candidiasis in infants. Thirty-four infants were randomized to either nystatin oral suspension four times a day for 10 days or fluconazole suspension 3 mg/kg in a single daily dose for 7 days. Clinical cures for nystatin were 6 of 19 (32%), and those for fluconazole were 15 of 15 (100%), P < 0.0001. In this small pilot study fluconazole was shown to be superior to nystatin suspension for the treatment of oral thrush in otherwise healthy infants.

### Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride (Cleocin pediatric) [^111EoVhV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Limited published data based on breast milk sampling reports that clindamycin appears in human breast milk in the range of less than 0.5 to 3.8 mcg/mL. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breast-fed infant's gastrointestinal flora. If oral or intravenous clindamycin is required by a nursing mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but an alternate drug may be preferred. Monitor the breast-fed infant for possible adverse effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibacterial drug-associated colitis.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clindamycin and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from clindamycin or from the underlying maternal condition.

Pediatric Use

When CLEOCIN PEDIATRIC is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years), appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of clindamycin did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. However, other reported clinical experience indicates that antibacterial drug-associated colitis and diarrhea (due to Clostridioides difficile) seen in association with most antibacterial drugs occur more frequently in the elderly (> 60 years) and may be more severe. These patients should be carefully monitored for the development of diarrhea.

Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young subjects (18–39 years) and elderly subjects (61–79 years) with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration.

### A brief gestalt intervention changes ultrasound measures of tongue movement during breastfeeding: case series [^112ZoRJi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Although these studies demonstrate modest preventive benefits of biological nurturing when applied from the first days of life, a 2013 Swedish randomised controlled trial of 103 of mothers with babies up to 16 weeks of age with severe latch-on difficulties found that a 'baby-led' or skin-to-skin intervention did not make it more likely that the infant would latch-on.

Infants who show signs of inability to latch, back-arching, fussing, and pulling off the breast are at risk of pharmaceutical interventions for inappropriate diagnoses of gastro-oesophageal reflux or maternal elimination diets for inappropriate diagnoses of allergy. These treatments have been demonstrated to result in unintended outcomes, including increased risk of true allergy. Similarly, breastfed babies demonstrating back-arching, fussing, and pulling off the breast or whose mothers experience nipple pain are currently at risk of unnecessary lingual and/or labial frenotomy and courses of bodywork therapy, which may also result in unintended outcomes. Given these concerns, it is essential that every effort is made to optimise breastfeeding when problems emerge, prior to considering medical or surgical intervention or bodywork treatments. Yet current fit and hold approaches, including 'laid-back breastfeeding', have not been demonstrated to be effective therapeutic interventions for babies who present with breastfeeding problems in the community.

Ultrasound and vacuum studies elucidate the biomechanics of the infant suck cycle in breastfeeding

Ultrasound imaging demonstrates that when the infant's tongue is up during breastfeeding, the mid-tongue rests against the hard palate, the junction of the hard and soft palate, and the soft palate, sealing the oral cavity from the pharynx. An oral cavity seal is also required at the breast-face interface to generate baseline vacuum. When the tongue is up, the intra-oral depth (IOD) is measured between the junction of the hard and soft palate (HSPJ) and the highest part of the tongue. The IOD when the tongue is up is often but not always 0 mm in successfully breastfeeding pairs. That is, the apposition of the tongue and palate which comprises the pharyngeal seal mostly occurs between the mid-tongue and the junction of the hard and soft palate, but in 10% of cases may occur more posteriorly, between the soft palate and the most posterior part of the tongue, also known as the tongue base (which is not visible on oral examination). The base of the tongue has no anatomic connection with the lingual frenulum.

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^111KMDQs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush).

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to assess the relative effectiveness of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. The secondary objectives of the review were to assess the cost-effectiveness, safety and patient preference of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals.

Search Strategy

The following sources were searched: The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1999), MEDLINE (January 1985 to May 2000), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2000) and the Cochrane Collaboration Sexually Transmitted Disease Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials. The reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed manually. The manufacturers of anti-fungals available in the UK were contacted.

~bullet~Randomised controlled trials published in any language. ~bullet~Trials had to compare at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal. ~bullet~Women (aged 16 years or over) with uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. ~bullet~The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis to be made mycologically (i.e. a positive culture and / or microscopy for yeast). ~bullet~Trials were excluded if they solely involved subjects who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breastfeeding or diabetic. ~bullet~The primary outcome measure was clinical cure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Duplicate scrutiny was performed of the titles and abstracts of the electronic search results. Full article formats of all selected abstracts were retrieved and independently assessed by two reviewers. Independent duplicate abstraction was performed by four reviewers. Disagreements regarding trial inclusion or data abstraction were resolved by discussion between the reviewers. Odds ratios were pooled using the random effects model. Chi-squared tests with a p-value of less than 0.1 indicated heterogeneity in the results.

Main Results

Seventeen trials are included in the review, reporting 19 oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungal comparisons. No statistically significant differences were shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short term (OR 1.00 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.40)) and long term (OR 1.03 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.49)) follow-up. No statistically significant differences for mycological cure were observed between oral and intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.20 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.65)) or long term follow-up (OR 1.30 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.71)). Two trials each reported one withdrawal from treatment due to an adverse reaction. Treatment preference data were poorly reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No differences exist in terms of the relative effectiveness (measured as clinical and mycological cure) of anti-fungals administered by the oral and intra-vaginal routes for the treatment of uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. No definitive conclusion can be made regarding the relative safety of oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungals for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. The oral route of administration is the preferred route for anti-fungals for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The decision to prescribe or recommend the purchase of an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration: safety, cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications, women who are purchasing their own treatment should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of oral anti-fungal administration is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

### ABM clinical protocol # 12: transitioning the breastfeeding preterm infant from the neonatal intensive care unit to home, revised 2018 [^116Qu7b2]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding transition and early oral feeding in preterm infants — Sustained sucking with swallowing for 5 minutes is one indicator that the infant may be ready to transition from the nasogastric tube to breastfeeding (IB). Other studies suggest that early introduction of oral feeding hastens the development of oral motor skills (IB), and nursing supplements may provide additional volume. Monitor mothers for nipple soreness; if present, this may be an indication of a shallow latch. Temporary use of silicone nipple shields can be a helpful adjunct for milk transfer and more efficient latch-on for preterm infants with shallow latch, although studies report an association with decreased exclusive breastfeeding (IIB). Ideally, all mothers discharged from the NICU with a breastfeeding or human milk feeding infant should have follow-up examinations with a trained, skilled lactation professional within 2 to 3 days after discharge for ongoing support and troubleshooting.

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^111Nz9tQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush).

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to assess the relative effectiveness of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. The secondary objectives of the review were to assess the cost-effectiveness, safety and patient preference of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals.

Search Strategy

The following sources were searched: The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1999), MEDLINE (January 1985 to May 2000), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2000) and the Cochrane Collaboration Sexually Transmitted Disease Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials.

### Breastfeeding experience of postnatal mothers separated from preterm infants after discharge: a phenomenology qualitative approach [^112dEwAt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Second, mothers of preterm infants should be educated about the benefits of breastfeeding as well as the methods for collecting, storing, and delivering breast milk after delivery. Indeed, breastfeeding education should be given and bolstered through videos and knowledge questionnaires in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, particularly in high risk obstetric clinics because mothers of preterm infants face the possibility of mother-infant separation. Finally, among mothers of preterm infants early postpartum skin-to-skin contact and "latching on" were encouraged, and instructions were given on how to set lactation goals. A thorough examination was performed to determine the condition of the infant. After the infant was stabilized, a comprehensive assessment was performed, which included assessing the physical condition of the mother, lactation, and breastfeeding knowledge. Assessing the oral structure and sucking development of the preterm infant, assessing family member information, emotions, and behavioral support for breastfeeding, and developing an individualized breastfeeding program were completed.

Kangaroo care not only boosts mother lactation and increases parent-infant relationships, but also directly increases the breastfeeding rate. For breastfeeding to succeed among preterm infants, hospital staff should focus on the individual mother and her situation, and the facility should provide family-centered care within a supportive environment, including kangaroo mother care for preterm infants. In fact, kangaroo care should be initiated as early and frequently as possible to promote breastfeeding in preterm infants. Maternal presence and early, frequent, prolonged, if not continuous, skin-to-skin care are essential for the mother of a preterm infant to learn her infant's feeding and distress cues and respond appropriately. Involving the mother in the care of her infant gives the mother confidence in handling her child and reduces worry regarding the baby's condition. The care is initiated in the hospital and continued at home with adequate support and follow-up when discharged from the hospital early. Based on a literature review, the most concerning issue for preterm infants is the ability to organize sucking patterns and the coordination of suck-swallow-breathe. Chen et al. reported that oral feeding of preterm infants resulted in a considerable increase in transoral feeding. As a result, kangaroo care and integrated oral motor therapies for extremely preterm children are considered when developing personalized programs to enhance communication. As a result, in the creation of tailored programs to encourage breastfeeding in preterm infants, kangaroo care and integrated oral motor therapies for the preterm infants are considered.

### Clindamycin phosphate (Cleocin phosphate) [^113p2SRM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Limited published data based on breast milk sampling reports that clindamycin appears in human breast milk in the range of less than 0.5 to 3.8 mcg/mL at dosages of 150 mg orally to 600 mg intravenously. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breast-fed infant's gastrointestinal flora. If oral or intravenous clindamycin is required by a nursing mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but an alternate drug may be preferred. Monitor the breast-fed infant for possible adverse effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibacterial drug-associated colitis.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clindamycin and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from clindamycin or from the underlying maternal condition.

Pediatric Use

When CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE Sterile Solution is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years) appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Usage in Newborns and Infants

This product contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with a fatal "Gasping Syndrome" in premature infants. See WARNINGS.

The potential for the toxic effect in the pediatric population from chemicals that may leach from the single dose premixed IV preparation in plastic has not been evaluated. See WARNINGS.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of clindamycin did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. However, other reported clinical experience indicates that antibacterial drug-associated colitis and diarrhea (due to Clostridioides difficile) seen in association with most antibacterial drugs occur more frequently in the elderly (> 60 years) and may be more severe. These patients should be carefully monitored for the development of diarrhea.

Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young and elderly subjects with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration.

### Protective effect of exclusive breastfeeding against infections during infancy: a prospective study [^115xYRBk]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To prospectively investigate the effects of breastfeeding on the frequency and severity of infections in a well-defined infant population with adequate vaccination coverage and healthcare standards.

Study Design

In a representative sample of 926 infants, successfully followed up for 12 months, feeding mode and all infectious episodes, including acute otitis media (AOM), acute respiratory infection (ARI), gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, conjunctivitis and thrush, were recorded at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of life.

Results

Infants exclusively breastfed for 6 months, as per WHO recommendations, presented with fewer infectious episodes than their partially breastfed or non-breastfed peers and this protective effect persisted after adjustment for potential confounders for ARI (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.92), AOM (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.05) and thrush (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.02). Prolonged exclusive breastfeeding was associated with fewer infectious episodes (r(s) = -0.07, p = 0.019) and fewer admissions to hospital for infection (r(s) = -0.06, p = 0.037) in the first year of life. Partial breastfeeding was not related to protective effect. Several confounding factors, including parental age and education, ethnicity, presence of other siblings, environmental tobacco smoke exposure and season of birth were demonstrated to have an effect on frequency of infections during infancy.

Conclusions

Findings from this large-scale prospective study in a well-defined infant population with adequate healthcare standards suggest that exclusive breastfeeding contributes to protection against common infections during infancy regarding and lessens the frequency and severity of infectious episodes. Partial breastfeeding did not seem to provide this protective effect.

### The role of micro-organisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans) in the pathogenesis of breast pain and infection in lactating women: study protocol [^112oD3db]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Data analysis plan

The study co-ordinator monitors specimen collection and ensures results are complete. Data from the questionnaires is entered into EpiData by an experienced research assistant, and transferred to Stata for analysis. The laboratory presents the microbiological results in an Excel spreadsheet with is also imported into Stata for analysis.

Descriptive analysis includes maternal demographic characteristics, details about the birth, about breastfeeding duration, nipple pain, breastfeeding difficulties, mastitis and maternal physical symptoms. Maternal and infant characteristics and transmission dynamics are described.

The relationship between infant colonisation with S. aureus and infant colonisation with Candida spp and maternal breast thrush will be tested by chi-square (or Fisher's exact if more appropriate). We will model the timing of incidence of maternal mastitis using survival analysis, with maternal and infant S. aureus carriage as time-dependent co-variates, together with appropriate variables (e.g. maternal age, method of birth, nipple damage). We will model the presence of Candida spp in vaginal/infant oral or nipple/milk samples and a diagnosis of nipple/breast candidiasis.

For the psychological components of the study, the primary outcomes are the two standardised assessments of maternal psychological symptoms - the PoMS and the DASS. Multivariate analyses (linear regression) will be used to ascertain how much of the variation in maternal psychological symptoms can be accounted for by the presence of physical problems and breastfeeding difficulties on the primary outcomes of maternal well-being (DASS, PoMS) at four and eight weeks postpartum. Known risk factors for worse maternal mood will be adjusted for including unsettled infant behaviour, insufficient partner support, vulnerable personality traits and previous history of mood disturbance. Pregnancy mood will also be adjusted for. Cross-sectional comparisons of maternal mood will be conducted for women experiencing nipple/breast pain and/or mastitis and those without nipple/breast symptoms.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^113xY8i4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Some factors related to the infant medical history are shown in Table 2. Infant blood type B was significantly more reported by women with mastitis compared to controls (OR: 3.56). No differences were found related to Rh factor. However, there was a marginally significant difference regarding child gender, so that more case-patients declared to give birth to a male child compared to controls (OR: 1.48). APGAR test score > 9 was found to be a barely significant protective factor (OR: 0.28).

No significant differences were observed in relation to jaundice, hypoglycemia, eczema or micrognathia/retrognathia, but significantly more infants from mothers with mastitis suffered oral thrush (OR: 3.49). The presence of tongue-tie in the infant (OR: 3.79) and infant hospitalization after birth (OR: 2.74) were significantly more reported in the mastitis group.

Characteristics of pregnancy, delivery and postpartum are shown in Table 3. There was not a statistically significant difference between cases and controls related to a threatened miscarriage. In contrast, a history of breast/nipple pain during pregnancy was significantly more common among women with mastitis (OR: 1.65).

The use of antibiotics, antifungal treatment and analgesics during pregnancy between cases and controls was not statistically different. However, antibiotherapy (OR: 1.53) and epidural analgesia (OR: 1.90) during delivery were significantly more widely administered to women reporting mastitis. There were no age-related significant differences at delivery, but primiparous women were found significantly more often in the mastitis group (69.13%) than in the control group (57.82%).

Place and type of delivery also showed significant differences between cases and controls. Delivery in a public hospital (OR: 0.42) had a significant protective effect compared to delivery in a private clinic, while Caesarean sections were performed on women in the mastitis group at significantly higher frequency (23.05%) than on those in the control group (14.97%).

### Systems changes to prevent severe hyperbilirubinemia and promote breastfeeding: pilot approaches [^113R5nTc]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Providing safe and effective care requires coordination among the multiple levels of the health care system. These levels comprise the newborn (patient, family and community), nursery or primary care practice (microsystem), hospital or managed care organization (macro-organization) and policy, payment or regulatory issues (environmental context). Contemporary care practices associated with childbirth and early newborn care often reflect disruptions in coordination of these processes and place newborns at risk for poor outcomes. For example, with routine early postpartum discharge, often at less than 48 h after vaginal birth, the peak of serum bilirubin at 3 to 5 days of age typically occurs at home, rather than observed by clinicians in a newborn nursery. In addition, lactation is rarely well established by early discharge and support is often inadequate, increasing the risk of hyperbilirubinemia and discontinuation of breastfeeding. Also, late preterm infants are frequently cared for in the newborn nursery, although they often have difficulty establishing oral feeding and are at substantially higher risk for severe hyperbilirubinemia than infants born at term. Finally, pediatric follow-up is often delayed beyond the first week, after the optimal time for continued assessment of jaundice and lactation. The American Academy of Pediatrics Safe and Healthy Beginnings Initiative, a pilot quality improvement project, will target newborn nurseries, primary care practices and coordination between these sites using a systems-based approach to facilitate implementation of the 2004 guideline for management of hyperbilirubinemia.

### ABM clinical protocol # 17: guidelines for breastfeeding infants with cleft lip, cleft palate, or cleft lip and palate-revised 2019 [^116qfync]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Breastfeeding in infants with cleft lip and/or palate — definitions and feeding mechanics are specified: "In these guidelines, breastfeeding refers to direct placement of the infant to the breast for feeding, and breast milk feeding refers to delivery of breast milk to the infant through bottle, cup, spoon, or any other means except the breast". "Babies use suction to breastfeed successfully". "The ability to generate suction is necessary for attachment to the breast, maintenance of a stable feeding position, and achieving the let-down reflex, milk extraction". Normal oral sealing is described: "their lips flange firmly against the areola, sealing the oral cavity anteriorly. The soft palate rises to contact the pharyngeal walls and seal the oral cavity posteriorly".

### Oral galactagogues (natural therapies or drugs) for increasing breast milk production in mothers of non-hospitalised term infants [^111X4S6H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many women express concern about their ability to produce enough milk, and insufficient milk is frequently cited as the reason for supplementation and early termination of breastfeeding. When addressing this concern, it is important first to consider the influence of maternal and neonatal health, infant suck, proper latch, and feeding frequency on milk production, and that steps be taken to correct or compensate for any contributing issues. Oral galactagogues are substances that stimulate milk production. They may be pharmacological or non-pharmacological (natural). Natural galactagogues are usually botanical or other food agents. The choice between pharmacological or natural galactagogues is often influenced by familiarity and local customs. Evidence for the possible benefits and harms of galactagogues is important for making an informed decision on their use.

Objectives

To assess the effect of oral galactagogues for increasing milk production in non-hospitalised breastfeeding mother-term infant pairs.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), Health Research and Development Network - Phillippines (HERDIN), Natural Products Alert (Napralert), the personal reference collection of author LM, and reference lists of retrieved studies (4 November 2019).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including published abstracts) comparing oral galactagogues with placebo, no treatment, or another oral galactagogue in mothers breastfeeding healthy term infants. We also included cluster-randomised trials but excluded cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth methods for data collection and analysis. Two to four review authors independently selected the studies, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data for analysis and checked accuracy. Where necessary, we contacted the study authors for clarification.

Main Results

Forty-one RCTs involving 3005 mothers and 3006 infants from at least 17 countries met the inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted either in hospitals immediately postpartum or in the community. There was considerable variation in mothers, particularly in parity and whether or not they had lactation insufficiency. Infants' ages at commencement of the studies ranged from newborn to 6 months. The overall certainty of evidence was low to very low because of high risk of biases (mainly due to lack of blinding), substantial clinical and statistical heterogeneity, and imprecision of measurements. Pharmacological galactagogues Nine studies compared a pharmacological galactagogue (domperidone, metoclopramide, sulpiride, thyrotropin-releasing hormone) with placebo or no treatment. The primary outcome of proportion of mothers who continued breastfeeding at 3, 4 and 6 months was not reported. Only one study (metoclopramide) reported on the outcome of infant weight, finding little or no difference (mean difference (MD) 23.0 grams, 95% confidence interval (CI) -47.71 to 93.71; 1 study, 20 participants; low-certainty evidence). Three studies (metoclopramide, domperidone, sulpiride) reported on milk volume, finding pharmacological galactagogues may increase milk volume (MD 63.82 mL, 95% CI 25.91 to 101.72; I² = 34%; 3 studies, 151 participants; low-certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis indicates there may be increased milk volume with each drug, but with varying CIs. There was limited reporting of adverse effects, none of which could be meta-analysed. Where reported, they were limited to minor complaints, such as tiredness, nausea, headache and dry mouth (very low-certainty evidence). No adverse effects were reported for infants. Natural galactagogues Twenty-seven studies compared natural oral galactagogues (banana flower, fennel, fenugreek, ginger, ixbut, levant cotton, moringa, palm dates, pork knuckle, shatavari, silymarin, torbangun leaves or other natural mixtures) with placebo or no treatment. One study (Mother's Milk Tea) reported breastfeeding rates at six months with a concluding statement of "no significant difference" (no data and no measure of significance provided, 60 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Three studies (fennel, fenugreek, moringa, mixed botanical tea) reported infant weight but could not be meta-analysed due to substantial clinical and statistical heterogeneity (I 2 = 60%, 275 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis shows we are very uncertain whether fennel or fenugreek improves infant weight, whereas moringa and mixed botanical tea may increase infant weight compared to placebo. Thirteen studies (Bu Xue Sheng Ru, Chanbao, Cui Ru, banana flower, fenugreek, ginger, moringa, fenugreek, ginger and turmeric mix, ixbut, mixed botanical tea, Sheng Ru He Ji, silymarin, Xian Tong Ru, palm dates; 962 participants) reported on milk volume, but meta-analysis was not possible due to substantial heterogeneity (I 2 = 99%). The subgroup analysis for each intervention suggested either benefit or little or no difference (very low-certainty evidence). There was limited reporting of adverse effects, none of which could be meta-analysed. Where reported, they were limited to minor complaints such as mothers with urine that smelled like maple syrup and urticaria in infants (very low-certainty evidence). Galactagogue versus galactagogue Eight studies (Chanbao; Bue Xue Sheng Ru, domperidone, moringa, fenugreek, palm dates, torbangun, moloco, Mu Er Wu You, Kun Yuan Tong Ru) compared one oral galactagogue with another. We were unable to perform meta-analysis because there was only one small study for each match-up, so we do not know if one galactagogue is better than another for any outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to extremely limited, very low certainty evidence, we do not know whether galactagogues have any effect on proportion of mothers who continued breastfeeding at 3, 4 and 6 months. There is low-certainty evidence that pharmacological galactagogues may increase milk volume. There is some evidence from subgroup analyses that natural galactagogues may benefit infant weight and milk volume in mothers with healthy, term infants, but due to substantial heterogeneity of the studies, imprecision of measurements and incomplete reporting, we are very uncertain about the magnitude of the effect. We are also uncertain if one galactagogue performs better than another. With limited data on adverse effects, we are uncertain if there are any concerning adverse effects with any particular galactagogue; those reported were minor complaints. High-quality RCTs on the efficacy and safety of galactagogues are urgently needed. A set of core outcomes to standardise infant weight and milk volume measurement is also needed, as well as a strong basis for the dose and dosage form used.

### A brief gestalt intervention changes ultrasound measures of tongue movement during breastfeeding: case series [^113DpypW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Lactation consultants frequently advise adjustments to fit and hold (or positioning and attachment) with the aim of optimising intra-oral nipple placement. However, approaches to fit and hold vary widely, with limited evidence of benefits, and effects of fit and hold on infant tongue movement have not been examined. The aim of this preliminary study was to investigate whether a gestalt breastfeeding intervention alters tongue movement, using measurements from ultrasound imaging to determine nipple placement and intra-oral nipple and breast tissue dimensions.

Methods

Ultrasound measurements were conducted in five breastfeeding dyads, infants aged 4–20weeks, while feeding in their usual or 'standard' position and again after brief application of gestalt principles of fit and hold. Four of the mother-baby pairs, who had received comprehensive lactation support, reported persisting nipple pain. Three of these infants had difficulty latching and fussed at the breast; three had been diagnosed with oral ties. A fifth pair was breastfeeding successfully.

Results

Ultrasound demonstrated that the distance from nipple tip to junction of the hard and soft palate decreased, intra-oral nipple and breast tissue dimensions increased, and nipple slide decreased after a brief gestalt intervention.

Conclusion

These preliminary findings suggest that changes in fit and hold impact on infant tongue movement and contour. Further research investigating short- and long-term outcomes of a gestalt breastfeeding intervention in larger cohorts is required.

### The role of micro-organisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans) in the pathogenesis of breast pain and infection in lactating women: study protocol [^112AZvTa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The CASTLE (Candida and Staphylococcus Transmission: Longitudinal Evaluation) study will investigate the micro-organisms involved in the development of mastitis and "breast thrush" among breastfeeding women. To date, the organism(s) associated with the development of breast thrush have not been identified. The CASTLE study will also investigate the impact of physical health problems and breastfeeding problems on maternal psychological health in the early postpartum period.

Methods/Design

The CASTLE study is a longitudinal descriptive study designed to investigate the role of Staphylococcus spp (species) and Candida spp in breast pain and infection among lactating women, and to describe the transmission dynamics of S. aureus and Candida spp between mother and infant. The relationship between breastfeeding and postpartum health problems as well as maternal psychological well-being is also being investigated. A prospective cohort of four hundred nulliparous women who are at least thirty six weeks gestation pregnant are being recruited from two hospitals in Melbourne, Australia (November 2009 to June 2011). At recruitment, nasal, nipple (both breasts) and vaginal swabs are taken and participants complete a questionnaire asking about previous known staphylococcal and candidal infections. Following the birth, participants are followed-up six times: in hospital and then at home weekly until four weeks postpartum. Participants complete a questionnaire at each time points to collect information about breastfeeding problems and postpartum health problems. Nasal and nipple swabs and breast milk samples are collected from the mother. Oral and nasal swabs are collected from the baby. A telephone interview is conducted at eight weeks postpartum to collect information about postpartum health problems and breastfeeding problems, such as mastitis and nipple and breast pain.

Discussion

This study is the first longitudinal study of the role of both staphylococcal and candidal colonisation in breast infections and will help to resolve the current controversy about which is the primary organism in the condition known as breast thrush. This study will also document transmission dynamics of S. aureus and Candida spp between mother and infant. In addition, CASTLE will investigate the impact of common maternal physical health symptoms and the effect of breastfeeding problems on maternal psychological well-being.

### Infant factors that impact the ecology of human milk secretion and composition-a report from "Breastmilk ecology: genesis of infant nutrition (BEGIN) " working group 3 [^1119zrs1]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Pain

Another fascinating aspect of the infant's response to breastfeeding and human milk consumption is the impact that both of these have on an infant's response to pain. An international body of research reports on the "analgesic" properties of sweet-tasting liquids for single events of pain following medical procedures (e.g. heel lance, venipuncture, and intramuscular injection) in neonates, infants, and children that appear to be, in part, mediated by endogenous opioid release. In addition to its endogenous bioactive components, sweetness is a salient chemosensory property of human milk and is an important sensory component of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding during or shortly after a pain-producing procedure has been shown to reduce behavioral pain responses, and the modulating effect of breastfeeding on infant pain was more than that of each individual component (e.g. taste, smell, skin-to-skin contact, sucking, and taste or endogenous components of expressed breastmilk). Tasting expressed human milk was more effective than water and was as effective as a sucrose-sweetened solution. Smelling their own parent's milk was more effective than smelling the milk of an unfamiliar lactating parent, but both were more effective than the no odor condition in attenuating pain responses. Although there is no research to date regarding the use of pasteurized donor human milk during painful procedures, expressed human milk and breastfeeding in general are safe and effective resources for the management of pain and can be used instead of oral sucrose.

### Tobramycin (TOBI podhaler) [^111ENnAf]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of tobramycin following administration of TOBI Podhaler in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for TOBI Podhaler and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from TOBI Podhaler or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash).

8.4 Pediatric Use

Patients 6 years and older were included in the Phase 3 studies with TOBI Podhaler; 206 patients below 20 years of age received TOBI Podhaler. No dosage adjustments are needed based on age. The overall pattern of adverse events in pediatric patients was similar to the adults. Dysgeusia (taste disturbance) was more commonly reported in younger patients six to 19 years of age than in patients 20 years and older, 7.4% versus 2.7%, respectively. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of TOBI Podhaler did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.5)].

### Oral dextrose gel for the treatment of hypoglycaemia in newborn infants [^112CM4nk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Neonatal hypoglycaemia, a common condition, can be associated with brain injury. It is frequently managed by providing infants with an alternative source of glucose, often given enterally with milk-feeding or intravenously with dextrose solution, which may decrease breastfeeding success. Intravenous dextrose also often requires that mother and baby are cared for in separate environments. Oral dextrose gel is simple and inexpensive, and can be administered directly to the buccal mucosa for rapid correction of hypoglycaemia, in association with continued breastfeeding and maternal care. This is an update of a previous review published in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of oral dextrose gel in correcting hypoglycaemia in newborn infants from birth to discharge home and reducing long-term neurodevelopmental impairment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase from database inception to October 2021. We also searched international clinical trials networks, the reference lists of included trials, and relevant systematic reviews identified in the search. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing oral dextrose gel versus placebo, no treatment, or other therapies for the treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia in newborn infants from birth to discharge home.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data; they did not assess publications for which they were study authors. We contacted investigators to obtain additional information. We used fixed-effect models and the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included two studies conducted in high-income countries, involving 312 late preterm and at-risk term infants and comparing oral dextrose gel (40% concentration) to placebo gel. One study was at low risk of bias, and the other (an abstract) was at unclear to high risk of bias. Oral dextrose gel compared with placebo gel probably increases correction of hypoglycaemic events (rate ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.20; rate difference 66 more per 1000, 95% CI 17 fewer to 166 more; 1 study; 237 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), and may result in a slight reduction in the risk of major neurological disability at age two years or older, but the evidence is uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.47; risk difference (RD) 24 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 41 fewer to 66 more; 1 study, 185 children; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of oral dextrose gel compared with placebo gel or no gel on the need for intravenous treatment for hypoglycaemia (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.32; RD 37 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 91 fewer to 54 more; 2 studies, 312 infants; very low-certainty evidence). Investigators in one study of 237 infants reported no adverse events (e.g. choking or vomiting at the time of administration) in the oral dextrose gel or placebo gel group (low-certainty evidence). Oral dextrose gel compared with placebo gel probably reduces the incidence of separation from the mother for treatment of hypoglycaemia (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93; RD 116 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 174 fewer to 18 fewer; 1 study, 237 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), and increases the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding after discharge (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.18; RD 87 more per 1000, 95% CI 9 more to 157 more; 1 study, 237 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Oral dextrose gel (specifically 40% dextrose concentration) used to treat hypoglycaemia in newborn infants (specifically at-risk late preterm and term infants) probably increases correction of hypoglycaemic events, and may result in a slight reduction in the risk of major neurological disability at age two years or older. Oral dextrose gel treatment probably reduces the incidence of separation from the mother for treatment and increases the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding after discharge. No adverse events have been reported. Oral dextrose gel is probably an effective and safe first-line treatment for infants with neonatal hypoglycaemia in high-income settings. More evidence is needed about the effects of oral dextrose gel treatment on later neurological disability and the need for other treatments for hypoglycaemia. Future studies should be conducted in low-and middle-income settings, in extremely and moderately preterm infants, and compare oral dextrose gel with other therapies such as intravenous dextrose. There are two ongoing studies that may alter the conclusions of this review when published.

### Tobramycin (Tobi) [^117NACzA]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of TOBI in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for TOBI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from TOBI or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash).

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of TOBI in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of TOBI is not indicated in children < 6 years of age [see Indications and Usage (1) and Dosage and Administration (2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of TOBI did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Utility of clinical parameters to identify HIV infection in infants below ten weeks of age in south Africa: a prospective cohort study [^112T3s77]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found that certain clinical signs and symptoms are highly specific for HIV infection in relatively healthy infants exposed to ARVs for prevention of vertical transmission below 10 weeks of age. Any one of a complex of findings including oral thrush, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, weight centile, diaper dermatitis, or reflux, give specificities and sensitivities of up to 89% and 80% respectively. A small number of studies prospectively investigated clinical symptoms in acutely infected infants during breastfeeding. In a study by Rouet et al in Cote d'Ivoire, 22 of 342 infants developed postnatal HIV infection. Acute retroviral syndrome, generalised lymphadenopathy and dermatitis were predictive of acute HIV infection. Richardson et al performed a similar study in Kenya where 40 (71%) of acutely infected infants were below 2 months of age in a cohort of 189 infants. Acute infection was associated with lymphadenopathy in ≥ 2 sites and upper respiratory tract infection.

In a larger study from the pre-VTP era of infants born to HIV-infected women, the Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies (ZVITAMBO) group evaluated WHO, South African, and Zimbabwean algorithms for HIV diagnosis in 6-week-old infants. In this study, 52% of HIV-infected infants had a weight for age < 50 th centile (Z score ≤ 0), and by focussing on this group, the author's developed diagnostic algorithms based on clinical signs with relatively high yield. However, by focussing only on HIV-exposed infants with weight-for-age below the median, sensitivity of their clinical algorithm for HIV diagnosis was 65%. When combined with ≥ two other physical signs (e.g. pneumonia, ear discharge, treatment for TB, oral candidiasis), the sensitivity decreased to 20% but the specificity increased to 94%. Our algorithm including weight < 50 th centile (algorithm B; table 3) but with different findings improved sensitivity to 86% in this age group. Additionally, a simplified algorithm that included weight < 50 th maintained high sensitivity of 85%. However, algorithms of this sort exclude the high proportion of HIV-infected infants with weight above 50 th centile.

### ABM clinical protocol # 12: transitioning the breastfeeding preterm infant from the neonatal intensive care unit to home, revised 2018 [^111znsRZ]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #12 — assessment for discharge feeding plans states that "Assessment of the following parameters should be considered when making discharge feeding plans (IV)" including current nutrition (diet, milk intake, and oral feeding method), where "Milk intake (mL/kg/day) should be assessed, if not at or close to ad libitum demand with adequate weight gain". Nutritional status is categorized as Optimal when "Infant can feed orally, minimally 160 mL/kg/day (or growing well on exclusive breastfeeding at the breast)", with in‑hospital growth normal or improving and biochemical measures "are normal or normalizing and not indicative of ongoing protein or mineral insufficiency", whereas Suboptimal includes when "Infant's intake is < 160 mL/kg/day" and biochemical measures "are abnormal, not normalizing, and are indicative of ongoing protein or mineral insufficiency".

### Frenotomy for tongue-tie in newborn infants [^115kSJnw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Tongue-tie, or ankyloglossia, is a condition whereby the lingual frenulum attaches near the tip of the tongue and may be short, tight and thick. Tongue-tie is present in 4% to 11% of newborns. Tongue-tie has been cited as a cause of poor breastfeeding and maternal nipple pain. Frenotomy, which is commonly performed, may correct the restriction to tongue movement and allow more effective breastfeeding with less maternal nipple pain.

Objectives

To determine whether frenotomy is safe and effective in improving ability to feed orally among infants younger than three months of age with tongue-tie (and problems feeding). Also, to perform subgroup analysis to determine the following.• Severity of tongue-tie before frenotomy as measured by a validated tool (e.g. Hazelbaker Assessment Tool for Lingual Frenulum Function (ATLFF) scores < 11; scores ≥ 11) (Hazelbaker 1993).• Gestational age at birth (< 37 weeks' gestation; 37 weeks' gestation and above).• Method of feeding (breast or bottle).• Age at frenotomy (≤ 10 days of age; > 10 days to three months of age).• Severity of feeding difficulty (infants with feeding difficulty affecting weight gain (as assessed by infant's not regaining birth weight by day 14 or falling off centiles); infants with symptomatic feeding difficulty but thriving (greater than birth weight by day 14 and tracking centiles).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL up to January 2017, as well as previous reviews including cross-references, expert informants and journal handsearching. We searched clinical trials databases for ongoing and recently completed trials. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, quasi-randomised controlled trials or cluster-randomised trials that compared frenotomy versus no frenotomy or frenotomy versus sham procedure in newborn infants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors extracted from the reports of clinical trials data regarding clinical outcomes including infant feeding, maternal nipple pain, duration of breastfeeding, cessation of breastfeeding, infant pain, excessive bleeding, infection at the site of frenotomy, ulceration at the site of frenotomy, damage to the tongue and/or submandibular ducts and recurrence of tongue-tie. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

Five randomised trials met our inclusion criteria (n = 302). Three studies objectively measured infant breastfeeding using standardised assessment tools. Pooled analysis of two studies (n = 155) showed no change on a 10-point feeding scale following frenotomy (mean difference (MD) -0.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.6 to 0.5 units on a 10-point feeding scale). A third study (n = 58) showed objective improvement on a 12-point feeding scale (MD 3.5, 95% CI 3.1 to 4.0 units of a 12-point feeding scale). Four studies objectively assessed maternal pain. Pooled analysis of three studies (n = 212) based on a 10-point pain scale showed a reduction in maternal pain scores following frenotomy (MD -0.7, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.1 units on a 10-point pain scale). A fourth study (n = 58) also showed a reduction in pain scores on a 50-point pain scale (MD -8.6, 95% CI -9.4 to -7.8 units on a 50-point pain scale). All studies reported no adverse effects following frenotomy. These studies had serious methodological shortcomings. They included small sample sizes, and only two studies blinded both mothers and assessors; one did not attempt blinding for mothers nor for assessors. All studies offered frenotomy to controls, and most controls underwent the procedure, suggesting lack of equipoise. No study was able to report whether frenotomy led to long-term successful breastfeeding.

Authors' Conclusions

Frenotomy reduced breastfeeding mothers' nipple pain in the short term. Investigators did not find a consistent positive effect on infant breastfeeding. Researchers reported no serious complications, but the total number of infants studied was small. The small number of trials along with methodological shortcomings limits the certainty of these findings. Further randomised controlled trials of high methodological quality are necessary to determine the effects of frenotomy.

### Characterisation of sucking dynamics of breastfeeding preterm infants: a cross sectional study [^112nx5oM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Nipple shields are often used to facilitate breastfeeding in preterm infants by enabling attachment to the breast and facilitating milk removal however, there are conflicting reports as to whether they impact long term breastfeeding outcomes. A recent large cohort study found no relationship between nipple shield use and age at exclusive breastfeeding in one analysis and an increased risk of not achieving exclusive breastfeeding (49% exclusively feeding with nipple shield use and 66% without) in another analysis. It is not clear whether all factors known to influence exclusive breastfeeding were accounted for and frequency of use was not reported. A within infant study has shown that infants receive more milk from the breast when using nipple shields therefore there is a clear need to understand how nipple shields function in the preterm infant. Better attachment to the breast was supported by the observation that baseline vacuum values of infants that fed with a shield were similar to the infants that were capable of feeding without a shield (Fig. 4). However, whilst we found that the preterm infants' pattern of tongue movement during breastfeeding is similar to term infants and is not altered with nipple shield use they generated a much weaker intra-oral vacuum (mean vacuum: −40.6 ± 27.8) than term infants than term infants (−114 ± 50 mmHg). Since intra-oral vacuum is instrumental in milk removal from the breast and weak vacuum is associated with both poor milk intake and bottle-feeding efficiency further research should focus on improving milk transfer rates during breastfeeding both with and without nipple shields. Factors that might influence milk transfer include the size of the nipple shield relative to the size of the nipple and infant's oral cavity and the volume of milk in the breast (or degree of breast fullness) as this influences milk flow rates in that milk flow rates are faster with greater degrees of fullness.

### Newborn care practices among slum dwellers in dhaka, Bangladesh: a quantitative and qualitative exploratory study [^111GVNkC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Breastfeeding

In the baseline survey, 64% of women reported first feeding their baby something other than breastmilk (colostrum). Forty percent of women reported first giving their baby honey, while 16% of women gave sugar water, and 4% gave mustard oil. Half of women reported breastfeeding within one hour of birth, 35% reported breastfeeding within one day of birth, and 14% reported breastfeeding after one day of birth.

These findings were supported by the in-depth interviews. The majority of women first gave their babies either honey or sugar water, followed with breastmilk three to five days after birth. There are two dominant reasons for this practice. First, there is a preference for first giving the baby water or sweet food (honey). It is perceived that these foods will influence the child's personality and protect it from diseases like mukhe gha (oral thrush). Secondly, women perceived having insufficient milk until three to five days post-delivery. To ensure that their baby had sufficient food, they often supplemented with cow's milk, powdered milk, or sweet water. Some women mentioned putting mustard oil in the baby's mouth to clean bizla bizla (mucus) before feeding the baby honey.

I learned this from seniors that the mouth of the baby remains dry after birth. If you give honey it works like moisturizer. The baby can take a gulp easily. If you feed the baby something sweet first then the baby will speak sweetly. (Woman from Korail)

For the first three days after birth there was no milk in my breasts. The baby sucked a lot but got no milk. The baby cried in hunger. Then I gave the baby tal misri water [sugar water] and had it suck my breasts. After three days there was sufficient breast milk and I did not feed anything except breast milk. (Woman from Korail)

Women widely knew about colostrum and its benefits; however few women reported feeding colostrum to their babies. One woman explicitly mentioned that she threw away the colostrum and gave breast milk to her baby one and a half days after birth.

### Tularemia antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis: CDC recommendations for naturally acquired infections and bioterrorism response-United States, 2025 [^111njjpM]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Lactating Mothers and Breastfeeding Infants

Although no studies have directly assessed the presence of F. tularensis in breast milk of mothers infected with tularemia, there are no known reports of F. tularensis transmission from mother to child through breast milk. A 1947 publication described an Austrian woman who "breastfed her 4-month-old child while ill with tularemia without the infant falling ill" (translated from German).

The risk for F. tularensis transmission through ingestion of breast milk is likely little to none. In general, mothers with tularemia and mothers taking antimicrobial prophylaxis after exposure to F. tularensis can continue to breastfeed their infants if able. One notable exception is if a lactating mother has an ulcer on the breast, because direct transmission could occur if an infant's skin or oral mucosa come into contact with the ulcer. A lactating mother with a breast ulcer should be advised to cover the ulcer with gauze and surgical tape for the duration of treatment and until the ulcer has healed or developed a scab. If the ulcer is adjacent to or overlying the nipple, mothers should avoid breastfeeding on that side for the duration of treatment but continue regular expression of breast milk via hand or mechanical pump and discard the milk.

When selecting antimicrobials for lactating mothers who require tularemia treatment or prophylaxis, generally the recommendations align with those for nonlactating mothers. However, clinicians should consider transmission of the drug or metabolites to the infant via breast milk when prescribing an antibiotic. The CDC guidelines for treatment and prophylaxis of plague include a detailed description of penetration of aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones in breast milk. These antimicrobial classes typically produce low concentrations in breast milk and have an acceptable safety profile. Short-term use of tetracycline is acceptable for lactating mothers; however, prolonged or repeat courses should be avoided because of a theoretical risk for dental enamel staining or bone deposition. Furthermore, lactating mothers should be advised that minocycline can cause black discoloration of breast milk.

Breast milk concentrations of azithromycin are typically low; however, infants should be monitored for vomiting, diarrhea, and candidiasis because azithromycin can affect the gastrointestinal flora. Evidence has indicated that maternal use of macrolide antibiotics during the first 2 weeks of breastfeeding might increase the risk for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, although this has not been confirmed. Breastfeeding infants whose mothers are being treated with chloramphenicol might experience vomiting and somnolence and have a theoretical risk for aplastic anemia.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^112DLzR8]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Infant feeding in women with HIV — U.S. recommendations and risks: Breastfeeding by women with HIV, even those taking effective ART, is not recommended in the United States because formula is a safe, affordable, available, and acceptable alternative; breastfeeding increases risk of perinatal HIV transmission by 5%–20%; because expressed breast milk may contain HIV and could expose recipients to HIV, it is not safe for women with HIV, regardless of their viral load or ART treatment status, to donate breast milk to human milk banks; infants may also acquire HIV by eating food that has been prechewed by a person with HIV, which may be due to contamination with blood from HIV-infected persons who have oral bleeding or have had recent dental work.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine position statement on ankyloglossia in breastfeeding dyads [^1176PtPB]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine position statement — ankyloglossia in breastfeeding dyads defines tongue-tie as limitation of tongue movement from a restrictive sublingual frenulum and outlines anatomic, biomechanical, and clinical implications. A tongue-tie exists when tongue range of movement and function are limited by a restrictive sublingual frenulum, and the sublingual frenulum is described as a fold of oral mucosa that arises with tongue elevation, sometimes including floor of mouth fascia or fascia and genioglossus muscle, and is not a histologically discrete band. Ultrasound imagery associates specific tongue movements and nipple position with effective and comfortable breastfeeding, with vacuum increasing as the tongue lowers and decreasing as it elevates, and the tactile presence of breast tissue in the oral cavity triggering lower jaw excursion followed by the tongue to generate a seal-based vacuum. Clinically, a restrictive sublingual frenulum reducing tongue movement may cause a significant functional impediment to latch, suckling, and milk transfer, along with maternal nipple/areolar discomfort and trauma, increasing risk of discontinuing breastfeeding; maternal reports may include latching difficulties, nipple pain, poor breast drainage, prolonged feeding sessions, and inadequate infant satiation. The document also notes a lack of agreement regarding diagnosis and treatment of tongue-tie across regions and professions.

### Characterisation of sucking dynamics of breastfeeding preterm infants: a cross sectional study [^116VKVfs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Breastfeeding preterm infants generated intra-oral vacuum in the same manner as term infants albeit at a lower level. Intra-oral vacuum strengths were not associated with milk intake, rather the duration of the feed and the time spent actively sucking was related to milk volumes. Further research is required to elucidate factors that influence preterm infant milk intake during breastfeeding as well longitudinal studies to track maturation of breastfeeding skills.

### Nutritional status, exclusive breastfeeding and management of acute respiratory illness and diarrhea in the first 6 months of life in infants from two regions of Indonesia [^115xDefs]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In a prospective cohort study of the nutritional status and management of acute respiratory illness and diarrhea in infants enrolled in a vaccine clinical trial in Indonesia, EBF rates at 6 months were below the Indonesian national target. Adherence to recommended WHO guidelines for case management of ARI and diarrhea in the first 6 months of life was poor, with a high use of cough medicines and oral bronchodilators. Our findings highlight the need for ongoing education of community health providers in the support of EBF and optimal case management for childhood ARI and diarrhea in Indonesia.

### Thrush-nightmare of the foundling hospitals [^1134Tsa5]. Neonatology (2012). Low credibility.

Before safe artificial nutrition, refrigeration, and microorganisms became known, thrush was a severe and frequently lethal disease in foundling hospitals. Overcrowded and understaffed, these institutions were the ideal breeding ground for this disease. Malnutrition, especially when breastfeeding was denied, contributed to the fatal course. Nosocomial infections and high mortality led to a prejudice against infant hospitals in the late 19th century. Candida albicans was discovered in 1840 when a cooperation at the Paris Foundling Hospital between the Hungarian emigrant David Gruby and the Swede Frederik Berg led to this organism being the first pathogen to be identified. After World War II, Candida infections increased with the use of antibiotics. The disease became less threatening after the development of nystatin, the result of an interdisciplinary cooperation in New York between the microbiologist Elizabeth Hazen and the biochemist Rachel Brown.

### Oral sensorimotor intervention enhances breastfeeding establishment in preterm infants [^113nVDDR]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of an oral sensorimotor intervention on breastfeeding establishment and maintenance in preterm infants.

Study Design

Thirty-one preterm infants born ≤ 34 weeks gestation were randomized into an experimental or control group. The experimental group received a 15-minute program consisting of stroking the peri-oral structures for the first 5 minutes, tongue exercises for the next 5 minutes, followed by non-nutritive sucking for the final 5 minutes. The control group received a sham intervention for the same duration. The interventions were administered once daily for 10 days. The outcomes included: time to attainment of full oral feeding, breastfeeding acquisition (i.e., ≥ 50% of direct breastfeeding at hospital discharge), breastfeeding skill assessment using the Preterm Infant Breastfeeding Behavior Scale (PIBBS), length of hospitalization, and breastfeeding maintenance at 3 and 6 months posthospitalization.

Results

Full oral feeding was attained earlier in the experimental group compared with the control (10.7 ± 2.1 vs. 19.3 ± 3.6 days, p < 0.01). This was associated with a greater number of infants in the intervention group acquiring breastfeeding at hospital discharge compared with the controls (n = 11 vs. 5, p = 0.049). There was no statistical difference in PIBBS score, length of hospitalization, and breastfeeding rates at 3 and 6 months posthospitalization between the two groups (all tests, p > 0.32).

Conclusions

An oral sensorimotor intervention accelerated the achievement of full oral feeding and enhanced direct breastfeeding rates at hospital discharge only. Provision of an oral sensorimotor intervention is a safe and low-cost intervention that may increase breastfeeding rates in a highly vulnerable population.

### Nutritional status, exclusive breastfeeding and management of acute respiratory illness and diarrhea in the first 6 months of life in infants from two regions of Indonesia [^115WQNeV]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Infant morbidity and mortality rates remain high in Indonesia, with acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) and diarrhea the leading two health problems in children under 5 years. We aimed to describe the nutritional status, feeding practice and case management of ARI and diarrhea of infants from two regions of Indonesia during the first 6 months of life.

Methods

This study was an observational study conducted in parallel to an immunogenicity and efficacy trial of an oral rotavirus vaccineRV3-BB) in the Klaten and Yogyakarta regions, Indonesia. Mothers were interviewed at 3 time points: within the first 6 days of their infant's life, and at 8–10 and 22–24 weeks of age. Questions asked included pregnancy history, infant nutritional status, feeding status and health of infants within up to 2 weeks prior to the assessment.

Results

Between February 2013 and January 2014, 233 mother-infant pairs were recruited. 60% (136/223) of infants were exclusively breastfed (EBF) until 6 months of age with the strongest support for EBF reported by mothers themselves 70% (101/223) and 25% (36/223) from their partners. At 6 months, 6% (14/223) of infants were underweight and severely underweight; 4% (8/ 223) wasted and severely wasted; and 12% (28/223) were stunted and severely stunted. Non-recommended medication use was high, with 54% (21/39) of infants with reported cough within 2 weeks of an assessment receiving cough medication, 70% (27 /39) an antihistamine, 26% (10/39) a mucolytic and 15% (6 /39) an oral bronchodilator. At age 22–24 week, infants with reported diarrhea within 2 weeks of an assessment had low use of oral rehydration solutions (ORS) (3/21;14%) and zinc therapy (2/ 21;10%).

Conclusion

In this unique observational study, breastfeeding rates of 60% at 6 months were below the Indonesian national target of > 75%. Adherence to WHO guidelines for management of ARI and diarrhea was poor, with high use of non-recommended cough medications and oral bronchodilators in the first 6 months of life and low use of ORS and zinc therapy. Ongoing education of primary health care workers and parents regarding management of common illness is needed in Indonesia.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^114xtz2Y]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

AOR, 95% CI, and P values of the multivariate logistic-regression model determined by forward stepwise selection are shown in Table 5. After adjustment for potentially correlated covariates, the factors significantly- and independently-associated with mastitis were history of mastitis in the family (AOR: 2.28), mastitis in previous lactations (AOR: 3.91) and throat infection (AOR: 2.05), in relation to the history of the mother. A mother-infant separation longer than 24 h after birth increased the risk of suffering mastitis about 6 times (AOR: 6.40). Regarding breastfeeding, the variables most significantly- and independently-associated with mastitis were infant age (AOR: 0.92), breast milk coming in later than 24 h postpartum (AOR: 2.26), cracked nipples (AOR: 1.43) and use of creams (AOR: 1.91), breast pumps (AOR: 2.78), oral antibiotics (AOR: 5.38) and topical antifungal medication (AOR: 3.81).

### Clinical assessment of breastfeeding in preterm infants [^115rsJB3]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

History of test weighing

Test weighing, defined as the "measurement of an infant's breastmilk intake by weighing the infant before and after feeding without changing the napkin or otherwise altering the infant's clothing" has been used to assess milk transfer during breastfeeding for over a century. Comparison of test weights with known volume feeds is documented since the 1970s leading to debate in the literature. Variations in scales, weighing protocol, management of clinical equipment and interpretation of results have all contributed to this debate.

In 1979, Culley et al. compared test weights to known volumes of infant formula in 115 infants showing a strong correlation (r = 0.84). At the time, test weights were frequently used in practice, but scale resolution was 5 g. Woolridge et al. refined test weighing methods by using electronic scales allowing for more precise recordings and comparing feed weights to test weights, reporting correlation of 0.99. In these early studies of term infants, only correlation was reported.

Theoretical concerns about test weight accuracy have been raised due to insensible water loss between measurements and variable density of breastmilk. Hendrickson estimated insensible losses at 0.03 ml/kg/min for infants in the first year of life by performing repeated weights between feeds. Dewey et al. used their own experimental measurements of insensible water loss (0.048 g/kg/minute), however this estimation remains unvalidated. Others have suggested that insensible losses within single feeds have negligible influences on test weights that take place over minutes. While preterm infants have increased insensible losses compared to term infants, this is primarily due to immature epithelial skin layer at birth. Transepidermal water loss decreases as skin barriers mature with postnatal age and skin barriers are widely considered comparable to term infants by 34 weeks gestation, when infants are typically considered clinically stable to begin oral feeding.

### Tobramycin solution (tobramycin) [^1134RMLo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence oftobramycin in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need fortobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash).

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin inhalation solution is not indicated in children < 6 years of age [see Indications and Usage (1) and Dosage and Administration (2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Characterisation of sucking dynamics of breastfeeding preterm infants: a cross sectional study [^114UpnQW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Full breastfeeding is the ultimate aim for preterm infants to ensure they receive the full benefits of human milk however, preterm infants face a number of challenges associated with their immaturity and associated morbidities. In order to facilitate oral feeding, it is essential to have a sound knowledge of the sucking dynamics of the breastfed infant. The aim of this study was to measure and describe the sucking dynamics of the preterm breastfeeding infant.

Methods

A prospective cross sectional observational study was carried out at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Perth. 38 mothers and their preterm infants (birth gestation age: 23.6–33.3 weeks; corrected gestation age 32.7 to 39.9 weeks) were recruited. Intra-oral vacuum levels, tongue movement and milk intake for a single breastfeed was measured. Statistical analysis employed linear regression and linear mixed effects models.

Results

Synchronised ultrasound and intra-oral vacuum measurements show that the preterm infant generates vacuum by lowering their tongue in a parallel fashion, without distortion of the nipple/nipple shield. Baseline (B), mean (M) and (P) peak suck burst vacuums weakened over the course of a feed (B: p = 0.015; M: p = 0.018; P: p = 0.044) and mean and peak vacuums were weaker if the mother fed with a nipple shield (M: p = 0.012; P: p = 0.021). Infant milk intakes were higher when infants sucked for longer (p = 0.002), sucked for a greater proportion of the feed (p = 0.002), or had a greater sucking efficiency (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Breastfeeding preterm infants generated intra-oral vacuum in the same manner as term infants. Nipple shields were associated with weaker intra-oral vacuums. However, vacuum strengths were not associated with milk intake rather time spent actively sucking was related to milk volumes. Further research is required to elucidate factors that influence preterm infant milk intake during breastfeeding.

Regarding medical management for thyroid disease in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to management of hypothyroidism (breastfeeding patients), ATA 2017 guidelines recommend to offer daily oral supplements containing 150 mcg of iodine in breastfeeding females, preferably in the form of potassium iodide (such as present in a multivitamin) because kelp and other forms of seaweed do not provide consistent delivery of daily iodine. Avoid exceeding 500–1,100 mcg/day of iodine intake during breastfeeding because of concerns about the potential for inducing hypothyroidism in the infant.

### ABM clinical protocol # 16: breastfeeding the hypotonic infant, revision 2016 [^114Lx4vR]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding recommendations and benefits in hypotonia and Trisomy 21 — international organizations recommend that all infants should be breastfed unless there is a medical contraindication, and it is particularly important that infants and young children with hypotonia, including those with Trisomy 21, be breastfed because of increased risk of morbidities with artificial feeding; evidence cited indicates breastfeeding is protective against ear and respiratory infections and is associated with a lower risk of malocclusion (odds ratio 0.34; 95% confidence interval 0.24–0.48), which suggests that breastfeeding promotes oral motor strength and helps with normal mouth and tongue coordination.

### Interventions with pregnant women, new mothers and other primary caregivers for preventing early childhood caries [^115c2cu8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and is associated with adverse health and economic consequences for infants and their families. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children have a higher risk of early childhood caries (ECC).

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions with pregnant women, new mothers or other primary caregivers of infants in the first year of life, for preventing ECC (from birth to six years of age).

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 14 January 2019), Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (to 22 January 2019), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Register of Studies, to 14 January 2019), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 14 January 2019), Embase Ovid (1980 to 14 January 2019) and CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 14 January 2019). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one or more interventions with pregnant women, mothers, or other caregivers of infants in the first year of life (intervention types included clinical, oral health education/promotion such as hygiene education, breastfeeding and other dietary advice, and policy or health service), versus standard care or placebo or another intervention. For inclusion, trials had to report at least one caries outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 17 RCTs (4 cluster-randomised), involving 23,732 caregivers (mainly mothers) and their children. Eleven RCTs assessed four oral health education/promotion interventions against standard care: child diet advice, child diet and feeding practice advice, breastfeeding promotion and support, and oral hygiene with child diet and feeding practice advice. Six trials assessed clinical interventions in mother's dentition, four trials chlorhexidine (CHX, a commonly prescribed antiseptic agent) or iodine-NaF application and prophylaxis versus placebo, and two trials xylitol against CHX or CHX + xylitol. At most, three trials (maximum of 1148 children and 130 mothers) contributed data to any comparison. For many trials, risk of bias was judged unclear due to lack of methodological details reported, and there was high risk of attrition bias in some trials. None of the included trials indicated receiving funding that is likely to have influenced their results. The trials were performed in high-, middle- and low-income countries. In nine trials, participants were socioeconomically disadvantaged. For child diet and feeding practice advice versus standard care, we observed a probable 15 per cent reduced risk of caries presence in primary teeth with the intervention (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97; 3 trials; 782 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and there may be a lower mean dmfs (decayed, missing, filled primary surfaces) score (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.58 to 0; 2 trials; 757 participants; low-certainty evidence); however, we are uncertain regarding the difference between the groups in mean dmft (decayed, missing, filled teeth) score (MD -0.90, 95% CI -1.85 to 0.05; 1 trial; 340 participants; very low-certainty evidence). For breastfeeding promotion and support versus standard care, we observed that there may be little or no a difference between groups in the risk of caries presence in primary teeth (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03; 2 trials; 1148 participants; low-certainty evidence), or mean dmft score (MD -0.12, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.36; 2 trials; 652 participants; low-certainty evidence). Dmfs was not reported for this comparison. We are uncertain whether child diet advice only compared with standard care reduces risk of caries presence in primary teeth (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.34 to 3.37; 1 trial; 148 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Dmfs and dmft were not reported for this comparison. For oral hygiene, child diet and feeding practice advice versus standard care, we observed little or no reduced risk of caries presence in primary teeth (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10; 2 trials; 365 participants; low-certainty evidence), and are uncertain regarding difference between the groups in mean dmfs score (MD -0.99, 95% CI -2.45 to 0.47; 1 trial; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and dmft score (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.96 to 0.36; 1 trial; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We observed there may be little or no difference in risk of caries presence in primary teeth between antimicrobial and placebo treatment in mother's dentition (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.19; 3 trials; 479 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No trials assessing this comparison reported dmfs or dmft. For xylitol compared with CHX antimicrobial treatment, we observed there may be a lower mean dmft score with xylitol (MD -2.39; 95% CI -4.10 to -0.68; 1 trial, 113 participants; low-certainty evidence); however, we are uncertain regarding the difference between groups in caries presence in primary teeth (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.39; 1 trial, 96 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Neither trial evaluating this comparison reported dmfs. No trials assessed a health policy or service intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that providing advice on diet and feeding to pregnant women, mothers or other caregivers with children up to the age of one year probably leads to a slightly reduced risk of early childhood caries (ECC). The remaining evidence is low to very low certainty and is insufficient for determining which, if any, other interventions types and features may be effective for preventing ECC. Large, high-quality RCTs of oral health education/promotion, clinical, and policy and service access interventions, are warranted to determine effects and relative effects of different interventions and inform practice. We have identified 12 studies currently in progress. Those designing future studies should describe the intervention components, setting and participants, consider if and how effects are modified by intervention features and participant characteristics, and adopt a consistent approach to measuring and reporting ECC.

Table 2
Reasons for calling the helpline service descriptive statistics

The most common category of reason for calling the helpline was 'difficulties with positioning and attachment', reported by 40.1% of callers. Overall 30.2% of callers contacted the helpline due to 'concerns about milk supply', including concerns about inadequate milk supply and/or poor infant weight gain, as well as oversupply and engorgement. Almost 30% of callers phoned the helpline about 'difficulties relating to infant behaviour' such as colic, crying, frequent feeding and reflux, and 20.4% of callers sought advice related to 'medical issues' such as mastitis, thrush, or questions about medication. 'Feeding other than by breastfeeding' (16.2%) included issues relating to expressing and storing breast milk, feeding with infant formula milk, bottle-feeding and complementary feeding. While almost all calls involved an element of emotional support, just under 9% of callers specifically contacted the helpline(s) for help with 'social or emotional issues' such as reassurance, resolution of conflicting advice, or advice about returning to paid work. 'Other' reasons (14.1%) comprises disparate issues such as stopping breastfeeding, re-lactating and the mother's diet; this category also includes callers who either declined to disclose or could not remember their reason for calling the helpline.

### ABM clinical protocol # 28, peripartum analgesia and anesthesia for the breastfeeding mother [^112ZJydf]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding postpartum pain management — nonopioid analgesics: Nonopioid analgesics should be the first choice for pain management in breastfeeding postpartum women as they do not impact maternal or infant alertness or respiratory drive. Acetaminophen/paracetamol may be given orally, rectally, and through the intravenous route; transfer into milk is low and appears to be less than the dosage given to infants. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used for postpartum analgesia, but this class should be avoided in mothers of infants with ductal-dependent cardiac lesions. For specific agents: Aspirin in a dose of 81 mg daily results in undetectable levels in human milk and is considered safe for chronic antiplatelet therapy, though other medications are preferred when chronic higher dosing is required; ibuprofen has a very short half-life with little to no milk transfer; ketorolac is commonly used (especially after cesarean) with quite low milk levels after oral dosing but levels have not been measured after parenteral administration; diclofenac has undetectable milk levels following intramuscular or oral administration; naproxen transfer is low but gastrointestinal disturbances have been reported in some infants after prolonged maternal therapy, and short-term use (1 week) is likely safe; indomethacin demonstrates low transfer and is considered a safe option for postpartum pain.

### ABM clinical protocol # 3: supplementary feedings in the healthy term breastfed neonate, revised 2017 [^116iCAeA]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Supplementary feeding methods in healthy term breastfed neonates — alternative systems can reinforce feeding at the breast but are described as awkward to use, difficult to clean, relatively expensive, requiring moderately complex learning, and requiring effective latch; a simpler version supplementing with a dropper, syringe, or feeding tube attached to the breast while the infant is feeding at breast may be effective. Bottle feeding is the most commonly used method of supplementation in more affluent regions of the world, but concerns include distinct differences in tongue and jaw movements and that faster flow may result in higher (and unnecessary) volumes of feeds. Some experts have recommended a teat/nipple with a wide base and slow flow to mimic breastfeeding and avoid nipple confusion or preference, but to date little research has evaluated outcomes with different teats/nipples.

### Premastication-review of an infant feeding practice and its potential impact on allergy and microbiome development [^111cr1hp]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Microbiome studies have shown that bacterial communities in early life are vital in priming and "guiding" the development of the immune system and that the disruption of the child's microbiota correlates with immune and metabolic conditions. In the context of the "evolved" hygiene hypothesis, which states that the emergence of allergies in the twentieth century could be due to a decrease of microbial inputs, "exposure, not avoidance, is what contributes to a child developing a healthy immune system". This strongly suggests that the microbiome could have a protective effect against some diseases. Another much‐discussed topic in terms of early‐life microbial exposure is the health‐promoting effect of vaginal delivery for the development of the child's immune system as well as the possibility of the procedure of "vaginal seeding" for unavoidable caesarean deliveries. Furthermore, the importance of exposures to microbes and microbial components may primarily be placed during an early lifetime window of opportunity. If missed, "pathological imprinting, altering risk for disease throughout life" might be the consequence.

It is argued that insufficient microbial stimulation during infancy may lead to the hypersensitivity of barrier tissues, which in turn increases allergy development. In this line of thought, a number of early "sanitary" environments (such as an increased use of soaps and detergents, antibiotic usage as well as living in an urban setting) have been shown to increase the risk of atopic diseases. A study found that respiratory allergies (such as allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis) were less frequent in adults heavily exposed to orofecal and foodborne microbes. Again, this supports the hygiene hypothesis, particularly emphasising the importance of the early life exposure, when the microbiome is being developed and primed.

Currently, research on the development and composition of the oral microbiome in early life is still limited. The composition of oral microbes in breast‐fed infants differs from formula‐fed infants. The authors hypothesised that bacteria from breast milk colonise the infant oral cavity and that non‐microbial components influence the infant oral microbiome. The introduction of solid food and primary tooth eruption further contributes to changing the infant microbiome by providing new surfaces for bacterial attachment. In this context, it is likely that the passing on of pre‐chewed food with bacteria from the caregiver's oral microbiome could influence the development of the infant's oral microbiome. Indeed, preliminary studies indicate an inverse association between allergies and the number and diversity of bacteria in the infant saliva or contact with parental saliva.

NNS involving the use of a pacifier or other method versus standard care: Very low-quality evidence showed unknown benefit or harm of NNS in preterm infants compared to standard care in exclusive breastfeeding rates.

Oral stimulation:
Oral stimulation versus standard care or no intervention: Very low-quality evidence showed unknown benefit or harm of oral stimulation in preterm infants compared to standard care in rates of exclusive breastfeeding and any breastfeeding.
Oral stimulation versus non-oral stimulation: Very low-quality evidence showed unknown benefit or harm with oral stimulation in preterm infants compared to another non-oral intervention in exclusive breastfeeding rates.

OPC versus control (water, saline, or no intervention): Very low-quality evidence showed unknown benefit or harm of OPC in preterm infants compared to a control in rates of any breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding Post-Discharge (data shown in Table 2 and GRADE Assessment in online suppl. Table S5) Avoidance of bottles (utilising alternative feeding devices to supplement breastfeeds) versus breastfeeds complemented with bottles during transition to breastfeeds: Avoidance of bottles showed a possible benefit in rates of full breastfeeding at 3 months and 6 months post-discharge and of any breastfeeding 3 months post-discharge and 6 months post-discharge. Subgroup analysis by intervention type was not statistically significant, for full breastfeeding 3 months' post-discharge (χ 2 = 2.35, df = 2 [p = 0.31], I² = 14.7%), full breastfeeding 6 months' post-discharge (χ 2 = 3.45, df = 1 [p = 0.06], I² = 71.0%), any breastfeeding 3 months' post-discharge (χ 2 = 2.16, df = 2 [p = 0.34], I² = 7.3%), and any breastfeeding 6 months' post-discharge (χ 2 = 3.46, df = 1 [p = 0.06], I² = 71.1%). However, the effect on breastfeeding outcomes was evident at all time points for tube feeds and for all except any breastfeeding at 3 months post-discharge for cup feeding.

### The impact of breastfeeding on the preterm infant's microbiome and metabolome: a pilot study [^115uJ5F7]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Infant demographics, birth history, and NICU Course.

All infants received HM or donor HM, bovine-based HM fortifier, and/or preterm formula (Supplementary Table 2) based on the unit's feeding policy, infant's clinical status, and infant's corrected GA (CGA) at the time of sample collection. All infants followed the NICU's standard feeding policy which bases enteral feeding progression on the infant's weight at birth. Infants initially received unfortified HM (with donor HM as supplementation if HM not available or insufficient) and were fortified to 22 kcal/oz at 80 ml/kg/day and 24 kcal/oz at 120 ml/kg/day, with further fortification added per individual need. They were allowed to participate in non-nutritive breastfeeding when > 30 weeks CGA as long as they were considered medically stable independent of the type of non-invasive respiratory support they were receiving. Oral feeding (via breastfeeding and/or bottle) was initiated when the infant was on minimal respiratory support (low flow nasal cannula) and showing oral feeding cues, which was typically around 34 weeks CGA. When starting oral/breastfeeding, each infant followed a standardized protocol with a combination of oral and tube feeds, until they reached full oral feeds. For each subject, 4 longitudinal samples were collected, two prior to the start of oral feeds and two after starting oral feeds. On average, timepoint 1 was collected at 2 weeks of life, timepoint 2 at 5 weeks of life, timepoint 3 at 9 weeks of life, and timepoint 4 at 12 weeks of life (Table 3). A total of 39 stool, 44 saliva, and 43 milk samples were analyzed. Additional information on infant's weight gain on tube versus oral feeds is available in Supplementary Table 3.

Background

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to assess the relative effectiveness (clinical cure) of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the relative effectiveness in terms of mycological cure, in addition to safety, side effects, treatment preference, time to first relief of symptoms, and costs.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers on 29 August 2019 together with reference checking and citation searching.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials published in any language comparing at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal in women (aged 16 years or over) with a mycological diagnosis (positive culture, microscopy for yeast, or both) of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. We excluded trials if they solely involved participants who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breast feeding or diabetic.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

This review includes 26 trials (5007 participants). Eight anti-fungals are represented. All but three trials included participants with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis. Trials were conducted in Europe: UK (3), Croatia (2). Finland (2), the Netherlands (2), Germany (1), Italy (1), Sweden (1) and one trial across multiple European countries, USA (7) Thailand (2), Iran (2), Japan (1) and Africa (Nigeria) (1). The duration of follow-up varied between trials. The overall risk of bias of the included trials was high. There was probably little or no difference shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short-term follow-up (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.43; 13 trials; 1859 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and long-term follow-up (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.50; 9 trials; 1042 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of clinical cure at short-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 77%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 75% and 83%; if the rate of clinical cure at long term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 84%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 80% and 89%. Oral treatment probably improves mycological cure over intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.50: 19 trials; 3057 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and long-term follow-up (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.60; 13 trials; 1661 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of mycological cure at short-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 80%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 80% and 85%; if the rate of mycological cure at long-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 66%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 67% and 76%. In terms of patient safety, there is a low risk of participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse drug effects for either treatment (23 trials; 4637 participants; high-certainty evidence). Due to the low certainty of evidence, it is undetermined whether oral treatments reduced the number of side effects compared with intra-vaginal treatments (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; 16 trials; 3155 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of side effects with intra-vaginal treatment is 12%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 10% and 15%. We noted that the type of side effects differed, with intra-vaginal treatments being more often associated with local reactions, and oral treatments being more often associated with systemic effects including gastro-intestinal symptoms and headaches. Oral treatment appeared to be the favoured treatment preference over intra-vaginal treatment or no preference (12 trials; 2206 participants), however the data were poorly reported and the certainty of the evidence was low. There was little or no difference in time to first relief of symptoms between oral and intra-vaginal treatments: four trials favoured the oral treatment, four favoured intra-vaginal, one study reported no difference and one was unclear. The measurements varied between the 10 trials (1910 participants) and the certainty of the evidence was low. Costs were not reported in any of the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral anti-fungal treatment probably improves short- and long-term mycological cure over intra-vaginal treatment for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. Oral treatment was the favoured treatment preference by participants, though the certainty of this evidence is low. The decision to prescribe or recommend an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration safety in terms of withdrawals and side effects, as well as cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications, women who are purchasing their own treatment should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of some oral anti-fungals is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

### Oropharyngeal candidiasis and candidal diaper dermatitis… [^1164Eoit]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis and candidal diaper dermatitis are annoying problems that resolve spontaneously in most healthy infants. In some cases, however, the symptoms may be persistent, causing pain, anorexia and discomfort. For these reasons, rapid control is often desirable. Hoppe reviews the management of oropharyngeal candidiasis and candidal diaper dermatitis in neonates and infants. Oropharyngeal candidiasis is rare in the first week of life. The peak prevalence of this disorder occurs at four weeks of age. Nonabsorbed agents should be used to treat neonates and infants without major underlying considerations. Gentian violet is moderately effective but may cause irritation and ulceration of the mucosa with prolonged use. Miconazole gel and topical clotrimazole appear to be more effective, but miconazole oral gel is not available in the United States, and oral clotrimazole can raise liver enzyme levels and cause gastrointestinal side effects in infants.

This lack of an efficacious treatment preparation has led to the unconventional oral administration of topical or vaginal antifungal agents. When miconazole is used, it is probably not necessary to administer the medication beyond the day of clinical cure. Candidal diaper rash starts in the perianal area and spreads to adjacent areas. Treatment includes aerating the diaper area and keeping the infant dry. Zinc oxide paste may be soothing and protective when the acute phase of the eruption has subsided. Baby powder application also may be useful. Antifungal therapy is mandatory to achieve resolution. Nystatin, amphotericin, miconazole and clotrimazole are all useful, although cure rates are higher with use of miconazole and clotrimazole. Oral treatment of candidal diaper dermatitis and the possible accompanying intestinal infection is recommended by many experts.

The author concludes that for treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis, miconazole oral gel is clearly superior to nystatin suspension. If nystatin suspension must be used, dosages higher than those conventionally administered might improve the outcome. For topical therapy of candidal diaper dermatitis, several agents appear to be equivalent. The addition of an oral agent to the topical treatment is probably appropriate. Nystatin suspension may be used for this purpose.

### Fluconazole is more effective for treating thrush in infants… [^112eLRT8]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Oral candidiasis commonly occurs in healthy infants. Nystatin oral suspension is the usual treatment, but cure rates as low as 54 percent have been confirmed in clinical studies. Fluconazole, from the imidazole class of antifungals, has been found effective in treating thrush in immunocompromised children, but studies among otherwise healthy children have not been done. Goins and associates compared fluconazole and nystatin suspensions for treatment of thrush in infants using a prospective, unblinded, randomized clinical trial. Infants from 1 to 12 months of age with clinical signs and positive microscopic confirmation of thrush who were otherwise healthy were randomly assigned to receive either nystatin suspension or fluconazole suspension. Patients with a negative initial fungal culture were not included in the study. Six of the 21 infants receiving nystatin were clinically cured after 10 days of treatment compared with all of the 15 infants receiving fluconazole for seven days. Microbiologic cure occurred in one of the 18 infants in the nystatin group who were cultured at the end of therapy compared with 11 of the 15 patients in the fluconazole group. Recurrence rates could not be evaluated in the nystatin group because 15 of the 21 patients who failed nystatin therapy were switched to fluconazole. There were no complications of therapy in either group. The authors conclude that administration of oral fluconazole, resulting in a high drug concentration in the oral mucosa and saliva, is significantly more effective than conventional nystatin suspension in the treatment of oral candidiasis in otherwise healthy infants. There were no adverse events noted with fluconazole use.

Problems with the use of fluconazole include cost and the possibility of developing fluconazole-resistant strains of. Candida albicans. Larger studies are needed to look at the cost efficiency of fluconazole treatment of thrush in infants.

### Herpes simplex virus and breastfeeding… [^11271WuU]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Both virus types can cause herpes disease in newborns and infants and can appear anywhere on the body. In newborns, HSV infections are often severe and result in high rates of sickness and death. Every precaution must be taken to prevent infants from being exposed to the herpes virus. Women with HSV should follow appropriate hand hygiene before holding the infant. Breastfeeding with active lesions Women with herpes lesions may transmit HSV to their infants by direct or indirect contact with the lesions. For mothers with active lesions, breastfeeding is acceptable if:

- No lesions are present on the breasts, and,
- Active lesions elsewhere on the mother are carefully and fully covered. Mothers with active lesions on the breast should. temporarily stop breastfeeding from the affected breast. She should not feed expressed breast milk from the affected breast. She should discard expressed breast milk from the affected side until the lesions have healed.

A mother may breastfeed her infant, or feed expressed breast milk, from the unaffected breast but should ensure that the lesions on the affected breast are completely covered to avoid transmission. Mothers should also follow appropriate hand hygiene to avoid transmission of herpes to her infant. While breast lesions are healing, some mothers may need additional support to maintain their milk production. Some mothers may feed their infant previously expressed milk or expressed milk from the unaffected breast. They could also supplement with infant formula. Mothers should consult with their health care provider to determine if their lesions have healed. A health care provider can help determine if the mother can resume breastfeeding or feeding expressed milk from the affected breast. Feeding hand-expressed or pumped breast milk It is not safe for a mother to give her infant hand-expressed or pumped breast milk from an affected breast if she has active herpes lesions on her breast.

Breast milk can be contaminated if it comes in contact with active herpes lesions by touching the breast during hand expression or via the pump. Expressing breast milk will be important for maintaining milk production while not breastfeeding from the affected breast. Mothers with herpes lesions should discard expressed breast milk from the affected breast until the lesions have healed. Mothers should be vigilant about practicing appropriate hand hygiene and cleaning the pump parts thoroughly. Mothers should talk with their health care provider to determine if their lesions have healed and if they can resume breastfeeding or feeding expressed milk from the affected breast.

### Breastfeeding keratosis: this frictional keratosis of newborns may mimic thrush… [^117M4Uis]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

We report the first example, to our knowledge, of a frictional keratosis from exuberant sucking in a breastfeeding infant. A 2-month-old girl was referred for evaluation of a well-demarcated, nonsloughing white keratotic plaque of the lower lip mucosa, just inside the vermilion border. Candida. The mother admitted that the infant "worked hard" at sucking during breastfeeding and continued sucking long after feeding. The parents were unaware of any other habit or potential irritation of the lips. After 3 months of age the infant's sucking pattern became more "normal" and the keratosis disappeared; it did not recur during 3 years of follow-up. We propose the term "breastfeeding keratosis" for this entity. Skip Nav Destination Sudarat Kiat-amnuay, Jerry Bouquot; Breastfeeding Keratosis: This Frictional Keratosis of Newborns May Mimic Thrush. Article navigation Case Report| September 01 2013. Breastfeeding Keratosis or Sucking Callus.

In the September 2013 issue of Pediatrics, Kiat-Amnuay et al report a case of frictional keratosis in a newborn with increased sucking during breast feeding. The authors found an abundance of mature keratinocytes on cytopathology and, given the location and description, named this entity 'breastfeeding keratosis'. As general pediatricians, we commonly encounter 'sucking calluses', also known as 'sucking pads', in newborns. The authors do not list sucking calluses in their differential diagnosis and we are curious as to the difference between breastfeeding keratosis and sucking calluses. In their discussion, the authors mention that "focal regions of thickened labial mucosa are not uncommon in breast feeding infants, but these appear more like pale pink 'pads' than white keratotic plagues. " This appears to be a description of sucking calluses, except that sucking calluses can be white and are hyperkeratotic in nature.

While sucking calluses have fallen out of the recent literature due its common and pervasive nature in breastfeeding infants, the condition is well described in textbooks and older journal literature. As described in Nelson's textbook, sucking calluses "are found on the lips in first few months and due to combined intracellular edema and hyperkeratosis, " a similar description to that of Kiat-Amnuay.

### Oral moniliasis in newborn infants… [^11595b8g]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Oral moniliasis occurs frequently in newborn infants and probably is exceeded only by impetigo neonatorum in its incidence in nurseries for newborn infants. This study was undertaken to investigate further some of the factors which may be related to the incidence, the source and the spread of oral moniliasis in newborn infants. Oral swabs were obtained from apparently normal newborn infants in order to investigate the frequency with which they contained Monilia and to study oral moniliasis preclinically, if perchance thrush developed later in any of the infants. Vaginal swabs were obtained from the mothers of some of these infants during labor and/or at delivery in order to determine the relationship between maternal vaginal and infantile oral moniliasis. Whenever thrush of the mouth became clinically manifest in infants not in the group being studied, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis was attempted by culturing oral swabs for Monilia albicans.
