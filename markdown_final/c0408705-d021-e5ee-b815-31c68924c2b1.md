## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether surgery would be a possibility for a patient with findings suggestive of prostate cancer, specifically extensive retroperitoneal and necrotic mesenteric lymphadenopathy, small-volume ascites, and prostatomegaly with median lobe hypertrophy, and what the next steps should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether these imaging findings are consistent with prostate cancer metastases. Then, I should verify how these findings change staging and whether they represent oligometastatic versus high-volume metastatic disease. Next, I will review guideline-based indications for radical prostatectomy in node-positive and metastatic settings. After that, I need to consider the role and timing of PET/CT and other next-generation imaging. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and counseling points, including alternatives like systemic therapy and metastasis-directed therapy where appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of the findings. Extensive retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy, especially if bulky or necrotic, is not typical for localized prostate cancer and raises concern for regional or distant nodal spread beyond the pelvis, which would upstage the disease beyond high-risk localized disease and into at least N1/M1 categories depending on the distribution and burden of disease [^f2166099] [^da57c656].

> Wait, let me verify the implication of retroperitoneal nodes specifically. Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is associated with markedly worse oncologic outcomes after radical prostatectomy compared with pelvic-only nodal disease, with substantially higher 8-year clinical recurrence rates in patients with grade group 4–5 disease and retroperitoneal involvement, approaching 60% in some series, which tempers the curative intent of surgery in this subgroup [^f2166099].

> I need to check the role of ascites. Small-volume ascites is not a classic feature of prostate cancer and, while nonspecific, can be seen in advanced malignancy with peritoneal involvement; importantly, it should prompt careful evaluation for alternative or additional pathology and reinforces that the disease may be beyond curative-intent local therapy alone, though isolated case reports describe rare metastatic presentations with ascites, so I should not jump to conclusions without corroboration [^aafba1eb].

> Hold on, let's not conflate prostatomegaly with malignancy. Prostatomegaly with median lobe hypertrophy is common in benign prostatic hyperplasia and is not itself evidence of cancer; however, it can complicate local therapy decisions and technique if surgery is pursued for another indication, and it does not by itself establish metastatic disease or justify surgery in a metastatic context [^50927d38] [^376493cd].

> Next, I should review staging and imaging guidance. Conventional abdominopelvic CT and bone scan are recommended in high-risk localized disease, but when conventional imaging is suspicious or equivocal, next-generation imaging such as PSMA PET/CT can clarify disease burden and potentially alter management; however, PSMA PET is not perfect for pelvic nodal disease and should not replace indicated pelvic lymph node dissection when the pretest probability is high [^2a196fd0] [^7e6b6b61].

> I will now examine surgical candidacy in node-positive disease. Radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection can be considered in highly selected patients with clinical nodal disease, particularly when nodes are confined to the pelvis, the patient has a long life expectancy, and disease is resectable; however, retroperitoneal nodal involvement and high-grade disease substantially worsen outcomes, and NCCN advises limiting surgery to patients with more than 10-year life expectancy and resectable disease within a multimodal plan, often in trial settings [^37fe6f22] [^7e6b6b61] [^f2166099].

> But wait, what if this represents oligometastatic disease? Metastasis-directed therapy, including surgery or radiation to limited metastases, may be considered in carefully selected oligometastatic patients, yet the evidence base is largely retrospective and mixed; in synchronous oligometastatic hormone-sensitive disease, some guidelines allow MDT with systemic therapy, but the benefit is uncertain and patient selection is critical, so I should confirm true oligoburden and exclude high-volume or visceral-predominant disease before proposing local interventions [^b52fb8e8] [^59d935f9] [^12736298].

> Let me consider the immediate next steps. I should confirm the diagnosis with prostate biopsy if not already done, obtain PSA, and complete conventional staging with CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis plus a bone scan; if conventional imaging is negative or equivocal and the clinical risk remains high, PSMA PET/CT can be considered to refine disease extent, recognizing its limitations in pelvic nodes and the need to integrate findings with clinical judgment [^2a196fd0] [^7e6b6b61].

> I should double-check the role of PET/CT here. Given extensive retroperitoneal and mesenteric nodes, PET/CT is reasonable to characterize disease burden and look for additional sites, but it will not convert this into a surgically curable scenario on its own; rather, it will inform whether any local therapy has a role within a multimodal plan or whether systemic therapy should be prioritized [^2a196fd0] [^a787cf32].

> Next, I should review guideline-concordant treatment pathways. If imaging confirms extensive retroperitoneal nodal disease, this is typically categorized as high-volume metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, for which systemic therapy with androgen deprivation plus intensification (e.g., abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, or docetaxel depending on risk and fitness) is recommended; surgery to the prostate alone would not address the systemic disease and is not standard in this setting outside of trials [^3ab2ba81] [^b3aca146].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line. Based on current evidence and guidelines, extensive retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy with small-volume ascites indicates advanced disease in which radical prostatectomy is generally not recommended as standalone curative therapy; surgery may only be considered in exceptional, highly selected scenarios within multimodal protocols or clinical trials, and the immediate priority is to confirm diagnosis, stage comprehensively, and initiate appropriate systemic therapy with consideration of metastasis-directed approaches where oligometastatic criteria are truly met [^f2166099] [^37fe6f22] [^2a196fd0].

---

In this scenario, **surgery is not recommended** because extensive retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy with small-volume ascites indicate advanced, likely metastatic disease [^f2166099] [^37fe6f22]. Radical prostatectomy is generally reserved for **localized or oligometastatic disease** [^37fe6f22] [^b52fb8e8], and in this case, the disease burden is too high for surgical cure. The priority is to **confirm metastatic disease** with PET/CT [^2a196fd0] and proceed with systemic therapy [^3ab2ba81]; surgery may only be considered for palliative relief of severe urinary obstruction from the enlarged prostate, not for oncologic control.

---

## Clinical significance of imaging findings

### Extensive retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy

- **Metastatic spread**: Retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes are outside the typical pelvic drainage of prostate cancer, suggesting advanced disease with spread beyond the pelvis [^f2166099].

- **Prognostic implications**: Retroperitoneal nodal involvement is associated with poor oncologic outcomes and high recurrence rates after radical prostatectomy [^f2166099].

- **Rare manifestation**: Mesenteric lymphadenopathy is uncommon in prostate cancer and often indicates advanced or aggressive disease [^da57c656].

---

### Small volume ascites

Ascites is **not typical** of early prostate cancer and may reflect peritoneal involvement or advanced disease. Its presence further supports a diagnosis of **metastatic disease** and worsens prognosis.

---

### Prostatomegaly with median lobe hypertrophy

Prostatomegaly with median lobe hypertrophy is common in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and may cause urinary obstruction, but it does not indicate malignancy. In this context, it is likely a **benign finding** unrelated to metastatic spread.

---

## Indications for surgical intervention in prostate cancer

Surgical intervention, specifically radical prostatectomy, is generally indicated for patients with **localized or oligometastatic disease** [^37fe6f22] [^b52fb8e8]. The following factors are considered:

- **Localized disease**: Confined to the prostate or with limited regional lymph node involvement (pelvic nodes) [^d9b2c2c7].

- **Oligometastatic disease**: Limited metastatic burden (typically ≤ 5 lesions) [^59d935f9], where metastasis-directed therapy may be considered [^b52fb8e8].

- **Patient factors**: Young age, good performance status, and long life expectancy [^37fe6f22].

---

## Contraindications to surgical intervention

Surgical intervention is generally contraindicated or not recommended in the following scenarios:

- **Extensive lymphadenopathy**: Involvement of retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes indicates advanced disease and poor surgical outcomes [^f2166099].

- **High-volume metastatic disease**: Multiple metastatic lesions or visceral involvement [^10c30813].

- **Poor performance status**: Significant comorbidities or limited life expectancy [^ab7c30d7].

---

## Role of PET/CT in staging and management

PET/CT, particularly PSMA PET/CT, is recommended to **clarify disease burden** and guide management in high-risk or advanced prostate cancer [^2a196fd0] [^fabd92d0]. It can:

- **Detect occult metastases**: Identify additional metastatic sites not visualized on conventional imaging [^2a196fd0].

- **Guide therapy**: Inform decisions regarding systemic therapy, metastasis-directed therapy, or clinical trial enrollment [^2a196fd0].

- **Assess treatment response**: Monitor disease progression or response to therapy [^47dd20c7].

---

## Recommended management approach

Given the extensive retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy with small-volume ascites, the **recommended management approach** is:

- **Confirm metastatic disease**: Obtain PET/CT imaging to assess the full extent of disease burden [^2a196fd0].

- **Systemic therapy**: Initiate androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) [^3ab2ba81] with or without systemic agents (e.g. abiraterone, enzalutamide, docetaxel) based on disease volume and patient factors [^b3aca146].

- **Palliative care**: Provide symptomatic relief for urinary obstruction or other symptoms as needed [^ab7c30d7].

- **Clinical trials**: Consider enrollment in clinical trials evaluating novel therapeutic agents or combinations [^1a905a39].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

In summary, **surgery is not recommended** for this patient because the extensive retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy with small-volume ascites indicate advanced, likely metastatic disease. Radical prostatectomy is reserved for localized or oligometastatic disease, and in this case, the disease burden is too high for surgical cure. The priority is to confirm metastatic disease with PET/CT and proceed with systemic therapy; surgery may only be considered for palliative relief of severe urinary obstruction from the enlarged prostate, not for oncologic control.

Objective

This study was undertaken to determine the frequency and etiology of mesenteric adenopathy revealed at initial-staging CT in patients with prostate cancer.

Conclusion

Mesenteric adenopathy is a rare finding at initial-staging CT in patients with prostate cancer and is more often due to coexistent lymphoma than to metastatic disease, particularly in the absence of associated pelvic adenopathy and a markedly elevated serum prostate-specific antigen level. Appropriate radiologic interpretation of the finding prevents overstaging of prostate cancer.

### Which patients with clinically node-positive prostate cancer should be considered for radical prostatectomy as part of multimodal treatment? The impact of nodal burden on long-term outcomes [^f2166099]. European Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A role for local therapies including radical prostatectomy (RP) in prostate cancer (PCa) patients with clinical lymphadenopathies has been proposed. However, no data are available to identify men who would benefit from RP in this setting.

Objective

To identify predictors of clinical recurrence (CR) in surgically managed PCa patients with clinical lymphadenopathies.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We identified 162 patients with lymphadenopathies treated with RP and lymph node dissection at three referral centers.

Outcome Measures and Statistical Analyses

CR was defined as the onset of metastases detected by conventional imaging. Kaplan-Maier analyses assessed time to CR after stratifying patients according to the site of lymphadenopathies and nodal burden. Regression tree analysis stratified patients into risk groups on the basis of their preoperative characteristics.

Results and Limitations

Overall, 80% of patients had lymphadenopathies in the pelvis alone and 20% in the retroperitoneum ± pelvis. The median size of positive nodes was 13mm. A total of 84 patients (52%) received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and 127 (78%) had pathological lymph node invasion. The median follow-up for survivors was 64 mo. The 8-yr CR-free and CSM-free survival rates were 59% and 80%, respectively. Biopsy grade group and preoperative nodal burden should identify patients more likely to experience CR. While < 10% of men with biopsy grade group 1–3 and two or fewer clinical lymphadenopathies developed CR, up to 60% of patients with biopsy grade group 4–5 and retroperitoneal node involvement ultimately experienced CR at 8 yr after RP. The discrimination of the regression tree was 76% according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Our study is limited by potential unmeasured confounders and the relatively small sample size.

Conclusions

Surgery in a multimodal setting might play a role in PCa patients with biopsy grade group 1–3 and/or enlarged nodes in the pelvis. Conversely, grade group 4–5 PCa and lymphadenopathies in the retroperitoneum are associated with worse oncologic outcomes.

Patient Summary

Approximately half of prostate cancer patients with clinical lymphadenopathies treated with radical prostatectomy are free from metastases at 8-yr follow-up. Radical prostatectomy with or without systemic therapies might play a role in selected patients with biopsy grade group 1–3 disease and/or enlarged nodes in the pelvis. Conversely, a higher grade group and the presence of lymphadenopathies in the retroperitoneum should identify candidates for systemic therapies upfront.

Indications

Prostatic brachytherapy alone using permanent implants is potentially curative in patients with the following characteristics: clinical stage T1 or T2a disease (TNM 1992), a Gleason score of 6 or lower and a PSA concentration of less than 10 μ g l −1 (option). Continued evaluation of this treatment is recommended (morbidity, tumour control) in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (recommendation).

Brachytherapy toxicity

Brachytherapy is contraindicated in patients who have undergone a previous large transurethral resection (standard) and in patients with a previous limited transurethral resection (recommendation). A prostatic volume of more than 50–60 cm 3 and/or the presence of hypertrophy in the median lobe are relative contra-indications for brachytherapy (recommendations). The modified peripheral implantation technique is recommended.

The use of questionnaires to evaluate urinary function prior to implantation is recommended (level of evidence: C). The length of ureter receiving more than 200% of the prescribed dose should be reported. The maximum length of the rectum receiving 100 and 120% of the prescribed dose should be limited to 10 and 5 mm, respectively (expert agreement).

Prostatic biopsy to measure treatment response to brachytherapy

Biopsies should not be performed until 18–24 months after brachytherapy (recommendation).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^defa7670]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer — principles of surgery (stage > IIB) states that in newly diagnosed invasive epithelial ovarian cancer involving the pelvis and upper abdomen, every effort should be made during a primary cytoreduction procedure to achieve maximum cytoreduction of all abdominal, pelvic, and retroperitoneal disease; residual disease < 1 cm defines optimal cytoreduction, although maximal effort should be made to remove all gross disease since this offers superior survival outcomes. Aspiration of ascites (if present) should be performed for peritoneal cytologic examinations, and all involved omentum should be removed. Suspicious and/or enlarged nodes identified on preoperative imaging or during surgical exploration should be resected, if possible, while resection of clinically negative nodes is not required. Procedures that may be considered for optimal surgical cytoreduction (in all stages) include bowel resection and/or appendectomy, stripping of the diaphragm or other peritoneal surfaces, splenectomy, partial cystectomy and/or ureteroneocystostomy, partial hepatectomy, partial gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, and/or distal pancreatectomy. Select patients with low-volume residual disease after surgical cytoreduction for invasive epithelial ovarian or peritoneal cancer are potential candidates for IP therapy, and in these patients, consideration should be given to placement of IP catheter with initial surgery.

TREATMENT OF RECURRENT OVARIAN CANCER

Surgical

Historically, surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer was considered for women with platinum-sensitive disease who had a relatively long tumor‐free interval (at least six, but preferably 12 months) after completion of chemotherapy and who had isolated or small‐volume disease and minimal ascites. Gynecologic Oncology Group 213 was the first prospective study to address the benefits of surgery for recurrent disease. Women with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer deemed amenable to complete tumor resection were randomized to chemotherapy alone (with or without bevacizumab) or secondary surgical cytoreduction and chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab). The results showed that secondary debulking offered no improvement in progression-free or overall survival. Some oncologists have raised concerns that patients for whom surgery was thought to be most beneficial (eg, those with oligometastatic disease to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes or spleen) might not have been enrolled on this trial in the first place owing to physician bias, but a subanalysis of those patients on GOG 213 who had a single site of disease still did not show improvement with surgery.

### Prostate cancer treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^cb300fbb]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Several rare tumors account for the rest of the cases. These include:

- Small-cell tumors.
- Intralobular acinar carcinomas.
- Ductal carcinomas.
- Clear cell carcinomas.
- Mucinous carcinomas. These symptoms are nonspecific and more indicative of benign prostatic hyperplasia than cancer. Although rare in the current era of widespread screening, prostate cancer may also present with symptoms of metastases, including bone pain, pathological fractures, or symptoms caused by bone marrow involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging Although MRI has been used to detect extracapsular extension of prostate cancer, a positive-predictive value of about 70% and considerable interobserver variation are problems that make its routine use in staging uncertain. Ultrasound and MRI, however, can reduce clinical understaging and thereby improve patient selection for local therapy.

MRI with an endorectal coil appears to be more accurate for identification of organ-confined and extracapsular disease, especially when combined with spectroscopy. MRI is a poor tool for evaluating nodal disease. The determining factor in deciding whether any type of PLND is indicated is when definitive therapy may be altered. For example, radical prostatectomy is generally reserved for men without lymph node metastasis. Likewise, preoperative seminal vesicle biopsy may be useful in patients with palpable nodules who are being considered for radical prostatectomy because seminal vesicle involvement could affect the choice of primary therapy and predicts for pelvic lymph node metastasis.

In patients with clinically localized prostate cancer, Gleason pathological grade and enzymatic serum prostatic acid phosphatase values predict the likelihood of capsular penetration, seminal vesicle invasion, or regional lymph node involvement. Analysis of a series of 166 patients with clinical stage I or stage II prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy revealed an association between Gleason biopsy score and the risk of lymph node metastasis found at surgery. Having all patients undergo a PLND is debatable, but in patients undergoing a radical retropubic prostatectomy, nodal status is usually ascertained as a matter of course. Evidence is mounting that PLND is likely unnecessary in patients with a PSA less than 20 ng/mL and a low Gleason score who are undergoing radical perineal prostatectomy. This is especially true for patients whose malignancy was not palpable but detected on ultrasound.

Patients with small bowel NETs may be experiencing the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome and symptoms associated with the tumor burden and mesenteric and retroperitoneal fibrosis, and debate is ongoing regarding the role of palliative-intent surgery in the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes. For patients undergoing primary surgery of small bowel NETs, the 30-day mortality is below 2% and the morbidity is lower than 20%, and resection of primary small bowel NETs in selected patients with metastatic disease may be considered when feasible to relieve existing symptoms and avoid future symptoms and for its potential survival advantage.

### Optimum imaging strategies for advanced prostate cancer: ASCO guideline [^fcd9c089]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

CT capabilities and limitations for advanced prostate cancer include rapid imaging acquisition (a whole-body scan can be performed in only a few seconds) but relatively poor performance for detection of bone metastases and limited assessment of lymph node metastases primarily due to heavy reliance on morphologic features; CT is unable to identify micrometastases in normal-sized nodes and unable to accurately distinguish enlarged hyperplastic (benign) from malignant nodes.

Many Men with Metastatic Prostate Cancer Are Not Getting the Recommended Treatments, Study FindsPosted: Many U. S. doctors aren't using the recommended initial treatments for their patients with hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer, a new study has found. Often, it's because they aren't up to date on the latest treatment recommendations or because of side effect concerns. Trial Results Support SBRT as a Standard Option for Some Prostate CancersPosted: In a trial, men who received stereotactic body radiotherapy didn't have a higher risk of cancer recurrence than men treated with other common radiation therapy regimens that are given over longer periods. Enzalutamide Gets Added Approval for Prostate Cancer That Hasn't SpreadPosted: Is a Genomic Test Better at Finding Aggressive Prostate Cancer. Posted: The Decipher genomic test found high-risk prostate cancer even when conventional tests said the tumors were lower risk.

This discrepancy appeared to happen more frequently for African-American men. Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer Continues to RisePosted: Shorter, More Intensive Radiation Safe after Surgery for Prostate CancerPosted: Many with prostate cancer can safely receive shorter, higher-dose radiation therapy after surgery, a new study has found. The approach, called HYPORT, didn't harm patients' quality of life compared with the standard radiation approach, trial finds. For Advanced Prostate Cancer, Radiopharmaceutical Improves SurvivalPosted: PSMA PET-CT Accurately Detects Prostate Cancer Spread, Trial ShowsPosted: For some men with prostate cancer at high risk of spreading, a large clinical trial shows an imaging method called PSMA PET-CT is more likely to detect metastatic tumors than the standard imaging approach used in many countries. Testing with Combined Biopsy Method Improves Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in NCI StudyPosted:

Testing for prostate cancer with a combined biopsy method led to more accurate diagnosis and prediction of the course of the disease in an NCI study.

### Quantification and significance of extraprostatic findings on prostate MRI: a retrospective analysis and three-tier classification [^bd2c56a7]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

In CT colonography, the C-RADS classification communicates extracolonic findings and their importance by the E category. We believe that this strategy should be adopted by the PI-RADS classification system as well. A category reporting the absence of EPSs is not necessary (< 5% of patients). We suggest that a three-tier system be adopted. A PI-RADS E1 category should encompass all findings that are frequent and bear no clinical significance such as small hydrocele, mild to moderate diverticulosis, degenerative spine disease, preperitoneal lipoma (fat-containing inguinal hernia), and mild to moderate trabecular hypertrophy of the bladder wall. A PI-RADS E2 category raises the possibility of clinical importance, and the E3 category is imperative for further workup and management (Table 2).

In order to simplify the coding, Yee et al. and Sherrer et al. advocated a two-tiered system that would categorize the findings according to their significance to high clinical significance and low to moderate clinical significance. Cutaia et al. preferred a three-tiered system with non-significant, potentially significant, and significant findings which we also advocate. This system has shown a perfect agreement.

A finding with no clinical importance requires no attention. Further management of significant and potentially significant findings must be considered. First, it is necessary to review the clinical history of the patient, whether the finding is known and has already been negotiated. Second, if the finding is not fully characterized, further tests may be required. Third, the clinical relevance of the finding has to be reviewed through the patient's complaints and his general condition. Fourth, the significance or non-significance of the finding has to be communicated to the patient. Fifth, in complex cases, a multidisciplinary team or a specialist may need to be consulted. Although there are white papers on managing common incidental findings available, further work-up must be contemplated with respect to the expected benefit and harm for a particular patient. Specific recommendations can be made for the most common findings, but their description is beyond the scope of this study and spans multiple specialties.

Pelvic lymph node dissection is the only reliable technique to detect low-volume lymph node involvement in prostate cancer. Extended lymph node dissections that include the internal iliac chain in addition to the external iliac and obturator packets have shown a significantly higher proportion of patients to have lymphatic involvement than previously recognized. The improved staging afforded by a more extended dissection raises several questions. Addressing these questions is the focus of this review.

An enlarged median lobe is encountered 8% to 18% of the time during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. A large intravesical lobe can obscure the anatomy of the bladder neck and generate a large bladder neck, necessitating reconstruction. In addition, it may increase the likelihood of ureteral injury, positive surgical margin, and residual prostate tissue. When encountering this anatomic variant, a clear surgical plan is required. We describe our approach to the large median lobe and highlight a specific technique that may be beneficial in managing this anatomic variant.

SURGERY IN THE SETTING OF OLIGOMETASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER

MDT predominantly relies on radiotherapy; however, several studies described surgical interventions performed for visceral or bone lesions, which could be especially valuable in case of symptomatic metastases. As aforementioned, authors have also explored the possibility of comprehensive treatments combining radical prostatectomy with MDT and systemic therapy to potentially achieve cure. These treatments are also sometimes performed in high-volume centers outside of clinical trials. Overall, while radiotherapy is significantly more popular, there are instances in which surgery can play an important role in omPCa care.

### Low dose rate brachytherapy for primary treatment of localized prostate cancer: a systemic review and executive summary of an evidence-based consensus statement [^d4958b09]. Brachytherapy (2021). High credibility.

Candidate selection for prostate brachytherapy — patients should have a prostate anatomy suitable for implant assessed by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), computed tomography (CT), or MRI, with special considerations for large prostate glands, large median lobes, or prior transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Patients with large prostate volumes (> 60 cc) may benefit from a TRUS, CT, or MRI-guided volume study to ensure minimal pubic arch interference, and such patients may be at greater risk of urinary retention and late urinary toxicity; those with prior TURP defects may be candidates if sufficient prostatic margins (e.g., 1 cm) are present with urethral-sparing dosimetry. Patients should have adequate urinary function without significant irritative or obstructive symptoms; medications for improving urinary function may be considered, the IPSS should be utilized, and higher baseline IPSS scores (≥ 15–18) and urodynamic findings such as worse peak flow or significant post-void residual are associated with higher risk of postimplant urinary retention and late urinary morbidity; optimizing urinary function with medications before implant is recommended. Brachytherapy could be considered in those with well controlled inflammatory bowel disease, with counseling on potential increased risks of acute and late toxicity, and absolute contraindications for TRUS-guided prostate brachytherapy include inability to tolerate general, spinal, or local anesthesia in the dorsal lithotomy position, absence of a rectum, active inflammatory bowel disease, or unacceptable operative risks.

Historically, stage IV prostate cancer was considered incurable. Although node-positive and oligometastatic prostate cancers are both classified as stage IV, these likely represent distinct clinical groups, and some patients may be curable with aggressive multimodality treatments. There is a lack of randomized evidence, but retrospective studies suggest that radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy may improve survival in these patients. This is an area of great current research interest and prospective randomized trials are needed to help define the optimal treatments for these patients.

### Oligometastatic prostate cancer: definitions, clinical outcomes, and treatment considerations [^59d935f9]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2017). Medium credibility.

The oligometastatic state has been proposed as an intermediate stage of cancer spread between localized disease and widespread metastases. With improvements in diagnostic modalities such as functional imaging, oligometastatic prostate cancer is being diagnosed with greater frequency than ever before. Furthermore, the paradigm for treatment of advanced prostate cancers is shifting toward a more aggressive approach. Many questions surround the understanding of the process and consequences of oligometastasis, meaning that the contemporary literature offers a wide variety of definitions of oligometastatic prostate cancer. Until genomic data exist to provide a biological component to the definition of oligometastatic disease, a clinical diagnosis made on the basis of up to five extrapelvic lesions is reasonable for use. Retrospective studies suggest that interventions such as radical prostatectomy and local or metastasis-directed radiotherapy can be performed in the metastatic setting with minimal risk of toxic effects. These therapies seem to decrease the need for subsequent palliative interventions, but insufficient data are available to draw reliable conclusions regarding their effect on survival. Thus, a protocol for clinicians to manage the patient presenting with oligometastatic prostate cancer would be a useful clinical tool.

Men classified as having high-risk prostate cancer warrant treatment because durable outcomes can be achieved. Judicious use of imaging and considerations of risk factors are essential when caring for men with high-risk disease. Radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and androgen deprivation therapy all play pivotal roles in the management of men with high-risk disease, and potentially in men with metastatic disease. The optimal combinations of therapeutic regimens are an evolving area of study and future work looking into therapies for men with high-risk disease will remain critical.

### The role of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET / computed tomography in the management of prostate cancer patients: could we ask for more? [^47dd20c7]. Current Opinion in Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

PSMA PET/CT imaging has rapidly become a fundamental tool for staging and restaging prostate cancer. Its unprecedent sensitivity allows to better customize the treatment for each patient at any stage of the disease. The potential to guide therapy and to early identify relapses, as well of the impact on patients' outcome is being explored, although further studies are needed aimed to assess its impact on overall survival. For advanced metastatic prostate cancer, PSMA imaging is critical for selecting patients suitable for RLT and promising data suggest a possible role as predictor of response.

### Modern imaging in prostate cancer: Do we treat patients, or their scans? [^a3459df3]. European Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

New imaging techniques are more sensitive in prostate cancer and reveal sites of disease that may never have been seen with conventional imaging, resulting in stage migration and potentially a change in the clinical management. Until long-term data provide a better understanding of the natural history of the disease defined by more sensitive imaging, patients and clinicians should recognise the considerable uncertainty about whether these improve outcomes. It is hoped that the next iteration of the TNM classification will recognise the problem in some way.

### The role of local therapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: should we expect a cure? [^4f6f510a]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The role of local treatment in oligometastatic prostate cancer remains contentious. Treatment of the prostate in metastatic disease may confer benefit, but prospective data are lacking. With improvements in treatments, aggressive strategies directed at metastases have increasingly become of clinical interest. Current evidence suggests good local control can be achieved; however, further data are required to determine overall cancer outcomes. This article evaluates the evidence available and consider whether local treatment of oligometastatic disease is a feasible, safe, and a positive strategy in this disease cohort. Cure should not be expected, although prolonged disease and treatment-free survival may be observed.

PLND, specifically an extended PLND, does facilitate identification of positive nodes; identifying positive nodes not only contributes to refined risk stratification/patient counseling, but may further be used to guide the selective application of secondary therapies, and patients should be counseled regarding the staging benefit of PLND given the uncertain oncologic benefit and noted – albeit small – increased risk of complications with PLND.

### Optimum imaging strategies for advanced prostate cancer: ASCO guideline [^347520d4]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Morphologic CT and MRI for nodal staging in advanced prostate cancer show limited performance, with a recent meta-analysis reporting CT scan sensitivity of 42% (95% CI, 20% to 56%) and specificity of 82% (95% CI, 80% to 83%), while MRI had a sensitivity of 39% (95% CI, 19% to 56%) and specificity of 82% (95% CI, 79% to 83%); thus, morphologic CT and MRI misrepresent nodal status and can misdirect the therapeutic approach.

### Salvage therapy for prostate cancer: AUA / ASTRO / SUO guideline part I: introduction and treatment decision-making at the time of suspected biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy [^57d4483e]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/ASTRO/SUO salvage therapy — salvage pelvic lymphadenectomy for pelvic lymph node recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) — "Clinicians may offer salvage pelvic lymphadenectomy for patients with evidence of pelvic lymph node recurrence after RP or RT; however, these patients should be counseled regarding the uncertain oncologic benefit from surgery in this setting. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C)". Counseling should address "the unknown oncologic benefit and the potential risks". Evidence includes only one retrospective cohort that compared lymphadenectomy to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT): it included 265 patients with oligometastatic recurrence identified on 11C-choline PET/CT, compared salvage lymphadenectomy to ADT alone, and defined lymphadenectomy as extended bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection with possible excision of PET avid retroperitoneal nodes; performance of lymphadenectomy was associated with improved second-line systemic therapy-free survival and reduced cancer specific mortality, though patients undergoing lymphadenectomy were more likely to have pelvic-only disease (91% versus 51%) and the cancer specific mortality analysis was unadjusted. A small randomized trial of metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) versus no MDT in oligometastatic recurrent prostate cancer enrolled patients with PSA recurrence on 11C-choline PET/CT and reported that MDT was associated with improved ADT-free survival, but the study did not stratify by MDT type so the direct impact of salvage lymphadenectomy remains unknown; a large retrospective cohort likewise found MDT to be associated with improved 5-year cancer-specific survival and reduced 10-year cancer-specific mortality.

### Optimum imaging strategies for advanced prostate cancer: ASCO guideline [^36aee204]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to imaging for staging, clinically localized, ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining next-generation imaging (PET, PET/CT, PET/MRI, whole-body MRI) when conventional imaging (CT, bone scan, and/or prostate MRI) is negative in patients with a high risk of metastatic disease.

Lymph node detection strategies note that improvements in diagnostic performance can be obtained by using nomograms that consider the pretest probability based on the risk status of the primary tumor and local staging information, and one promising technique is ferumoxtran-10–enhanced MRI, which has been shown to be able to detect microscopic nodal disease, although lack of general commercial availability and regulatory approval makes this method of assessment unobtainable for most.

### Advances in prostate cancer research-NCI… [^eb0f0ca5]. NCI (2019). Medium credibility.

Some doctors, concerned that a systematic biopsy showing only low-grade cancer could have missed a high-grade cancer, may suggest surgery or radiation. However, in some cases these treatments will be for a cancer that may have never caused a problem, which is considered overtreatment. The ability to detect very small amounts of metastatic prostate cancer could help doctors and patients make better-informed treatment decisions. For example, if metastatic cancer is found when a man is first diagnosed, he may choose an alternative treatment to surgery because the cancer has already spread. Or doctors may be able to treat cancer recurrence — either in the prostate or metastatic disease — earlier, which may lead to better survival. Studies are being done to determine if such early detection can improve outcomes. NCI researchers are testing whether PSMA-PET imaging can also identify men who are at high risk of their cancer recurring.

Such imaging may eventually be able to help predict who needs more aggressive treatment — such as radiation therapy in addition to surgery — after diagnosis. Research teams are also looking at:

- whether certain patterns seen on PSMA-PET tests taken over time may indicate an increased risk of recurrence after initial treatment
- how small metastases discovered with PSMA change over time, with or without treatment. New Prostate Cancer Treatments Standard treatments for prostate cancer that has not spread elsewhere in the body are surgery or radiation therapy, with or without hormone therapy. Active surveillance is also an option for men who have a low risk of their cancer spreading. This means monitoring the cancer with regular biopsies and other tests, and holding off on treatment unless there is evidence of progression. Rates of active surveillance more than doubled between 2014 and 2021, to almost 60% of US men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer.

These drugs are now also used in some people whose prostate cancer still responds to standard hormone therapies but has spread elsewhere in the body. Scientists are continuing to study novel treatments and drugs, along with new combinations of existing treatments, in men with metastatic and castrate-resistant prostate cancer.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^7e6b6b61]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Prostate cancer — principles of surgery: Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) can be considered in patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer, and PLND is recommended in patients with unfavorable intermediate, high, very-high-risk, and regional prostate cancer; PLND can be excluded when nomograms predict a low probability of nodal metastases, with published thresholds ranging from 2% to 7%. A patient who is above the threshold but has a negative PSMA PET scan should still undergo PLND because the sensitivity of PSMA PET for pelvic lymph node involvement among patients undergoing RP and PLND was low (about 40%), the negative predictive value was about 81%, and basing the decision on a negative scan could result in missing 19% of patients with positive lymph nodes. PLND can be performed using an open, laparoscopic, or robotic technique and provides staging and prognostic information; extended PLND provides more complete staging, may cure some patients with microscopic metastases, and therefore an extended PLND is recommended when PLND is performed; an extended PLND includes removal of all node-bearing tissue bounded by the external iliac vein anteriorly, pelvic sidewall laterally, bladder wall medially, floor of the pelvis posteriorly, Cooper's ligament distally, and internal iliac artery proximally. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

NCCN Prostate Cancer — treatment guidance for oligometastatic CSPC states that, based on these data, the Panel recommends MDT with or without ADT as an option for patients with metachronous oligometastatic CSPC, and these patients may alternatively be treated with ADT plus systemic therapy for low-volume mCSPC with or without concurrent MDT. For the synchronous oligometastatic setting, there is currently no randomized evidence, but the Panel believes that concurrent MDT with recommended systemic therapy can be considered in select patients with synchronous oligometastatic disease.

The 1.5-cm size threshold has been deliberately set to account for the poorer spatial resolution of WB-MRI images compared with whole body CT scans. Pixel sizes using a 256 × 256 mm matrix at a whole body field of view of 400–440 mm, can be 1.5–2 mm for T1 W and T2 W sequences. For DWI pixel sizes are in the order of 3–4 mm. The 5–7-mm thick slice of images further compounds partial volume averaging effects. This resolution is much less than what is achievable by routine CT scans (0.8–1 mm), meaning that lesion size measurement accuracy is lower for MRI. However, when spatial resolution allows (three dimensional, fast spin echo sequences), the 1.5-cm threshold can be relaxed to 1.0 cm. Active medical physics engagement may be necessary to clarify what can reasonably be achieved locally.

Potential target lesion(s) should be chosen for measurement recording. Nontarget lesions should be recorded but not measured. The presence of nonmeasurable disease should be recorded (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST] v1.1 guidance). Thus, lymph nodes that are ≥ 1.0 cm but less than 1.5 cm in short axis are considered pathologic but nonmeasureable (note that nonmeasurable in this context refers to a specific RECIST defined term). Visceral disease ≥ 1.5 cm in long axis is considered as measurable but when unequivocally malignant but less than < 1.5 cm they are considered pathologic but nonmeasurable. Further detailed instructions can be found in baseline assessments methods (Supplementary data).

In rare instances, when there are unequivocal malignant lesions < 1.5 cm and clinical trial entry mandates the presence of measurable disease, a relaxation of the ≥ 1.5-cm threshold may be applied (minimum > 1 cm, ≥ 1.5 cm preferred) in the knowledge of the caveats on image resolution discussed above.
