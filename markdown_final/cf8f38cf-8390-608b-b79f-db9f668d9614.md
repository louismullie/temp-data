## Question

Lanzopeazole not working can switch to famotidone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether switching from lansoprazole to famotidine is appropriate when lansoprazole is not working, and how to manage that situation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic differences between PPIs and H2RAs and the expected efficacy gap. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines recommend for PPI nonresponse. Next, I will review direct and indirect comparative evidence, including head-to-head and network meta-analyses. After that, I need to consider special scenarios where famotidine might still be reasonable. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with dosing, monitoring, and safety checks, including renal dosing and drug–drug interactions.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic hierarchy. Lansoprazole irreversibly inhibits the gastric H+/K+-ATPase pump, producing profound and sustained acid suppression, whereas famotidine competitively blocks H2 receptors with a faster onset but shorter duration and less potent acid control; clinically, PPIs consistently outperform H2RAs for GERD symptom control and mucosal healing, so switching downward in class is generally counterproductive unless there is a specific rationale [^ff1b887e] [^2c9004d5] [^d4700b17].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on PPI nonresponse. The ACG advises that if symptoms persist on a once-daily PPI, the next step is to optimize PPI therapy by confirming administration 30–60 minutes before a meal, then either doubling the dose to twice daily or switching to a different PPI with higher potency or less CYP2C19 metabolism; they explicitly do not recommend switching to an H2RA as a rescue strategy for inadequate PPI response, and they caution against repeated PPI switches beyond one attempt [^d9ff34c1] [^62300bb4] [^8522ee2b]. The AGA similarly supports optimizing PPI therapy or switching within class rather than substituting an H2RA for refractory GERD, reserving H2RAs for adjunctive or on-demand use in select contexts [^notfound].

> I should double-check the comparative efficacy data. Network meta-analyses in endoscopy-negative reflux disease show PPIs, including omeprazole and esomeprazole, significantly reduce treatment failure versus placebo, whereas famotidine 40 mg daily is not clearly superior to placebo and ranks low for symptom relief; this aligns with the broader literature that H2RAs are less effective than PPIs for GERD phenotypes [^f51f9fd2] [^77f08ae0] [^06ebeb02]. Hold on, I should verify whether any head-to-head data contradict this; in fact, even in aspirin-related ulcer prevention, famotidine has been shown inferior to pantoprazole, reinforcing the class hierarchy in acid-related disease management [^b634f2ce].

> But wait, what if the original lansoprazole failure was due to incorrect timing or adherence. I need to ensure we are not missing a simple fix: enteric-coated PPIs should be taken 30–60 minutes before a meal to maximize intragastric pH control; if taken at bedtime or without regard to meals, bioavailability and clinical effect can be suboptimal, leading to apparent nonresponse that is actually pharmacokinetic failure [^62300bb4] [^8522ee2b]. Let me reconsider the potency spectrum as well; switching to a more potent PPI such as esomeprazole or rabeprazole, or using a formulation with rapid onset, can salvage many partial responders without abandoning the class [^62300bb4] [^8522ee2b].

> Next, I should review when famotidine might still be reasonable despite lower efficacy. H2RAs can be used as adjuncts for nocturnal breakthrough symptoms on twice-daily PPI, recognizing tachyphylaxis limits sustained benefit; they are also appropriate when a rapid-onset, short-acting agent is desired on demand, or when PPIs are contraindicated due to allergy or significant drug–drug interactions, though true PPI allergy is uncommon and many patients can tolerate an alternate PPI after evaluation [^2890690f] [^34a0abb1]. I should confirm safety nuances: famotidine requires renal dose adjustment in moderate to severe impairment, and coadministration with lansoprazole may reduce famotidine clearance, which could matter in polypharmacy or renal disease [^10d7202a] [^9a2111ea].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "refractory GERD" without considering non-acid mechanisms. If symptoms persist despite optimized PPI therapy, I need to check for alternative diagnoses or non-acid reflux, consider esophageal testing with pH-impedance, and evaluate for functional disorders; in such cases, simply switching to an H2RA is unlikely to address the pathophysiology and may delay appropriate workup [^8d054b6e] [^e0d71c25]. I should confirm that guidelines endorse stepping up PPI optimization first and then pursuing diagnostic testing rather than serial class downgrades [^d9ff34c1] [^8522ee2b].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. First, confirm correct PPI timing and adherence; if still symptomatic, increase lansoprazole to 30 mg twice daily 30–60 minutes before breakfast and dinner, or switch to a more potent PPI such as esomeprazole 40 mg daily or rabeprazole 20 mg daily; reassess in 4–8 weeks. If response remains suboptimal, proceed to esophageal testing rather than substituting famotidine. Reserve famotidine for on-demand relief, nocturnal adjuncts, or when PPIs are not feasible, and adjust dosing for renal function if needed [^62300bb4] [^8522ee2b] [^10d7202a]. I should double-check that this aligns with deprescribing principles too; in patients who are stable and wish to reduce PPI exposure, a cautious trial of H2RA can be considered, but not as a rescue for active PPI failure [^4c7feff9] [^a3d8cdd5].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is clear: switching from lansoprazole to famotidine because lansoprazole "is not working" is generally not recommended. The evidence-based sequence is to optimize PPI therapy or switch within the PPI class, and reserve famotidine for adjunctive, on-demand, or contraindication-driven scenarios, with attention to renal dosing and limited expectations for efficacy in GERD [^d9ff34c1] [^8522ee2b] [^f51f9fd2].

Switching from lansoprazole to famotidine is **not recommended** when lansoprazole fails, because PPIs are more effective than H2RAs for GERD and erosive esophagitis [^2c9004d5]. If lansoprazole is ineffective, **optimize PPI therapy** by confirming once-daily dosing 30–60 minutes before breakfast, then escalate to twice daily or switch to another PPI (e.g. esomeprazole or rabeprazole) [^62300bb4] [^8522ee2b]. Famotidine may be added at bedtime for nocturnal symptoms, but **tachyphylaxis limits long-term benefit** [^2890690f]. If symptoms persist, evaluate for refractory GERD or non-acid reflux with pH-impedance testing or endoscopy [^8d054b6e].

---

## Pharmacological differences between lansoprazole and famotidine

Lansoprazole is a **proton pump inhibitor (PPI)** that irreversibly inhibits the H+/K+-ATPase pump, providing profound, sustained acid suppression and mucosal healing in GERD and erosive esophagitis [^c0f23a48]. Famotidine is an **H2 receptor antagonist (H2RA)** that competitively blocks histamine H2 receptors, reducing acid secretion with a faster onset but shorter duration and less potent suppression than PPIs [^ff1b887e].

---

## Clinical evidence comparing lansoprazole and famotidine

Multiple studies and guidelines show **PPIs are superior to H2RAs** for GERD and erosive esophagitis:

- **Healing rates**: Lansoprazole achieves significantly higher healing rates in erosive esophagitis than ranitidine (an H2RA), and this superiority is extrapolated to famotidine given class effects [^c870ac1e].
- **Symptom control**: PPIs provide superior symptom relief and maintenance of remission compared to H2RAs [^2c9004d5].
- **Guideline support**: ACG and AGA recommend PPIs as first-line therapy for GERD, with H2RAs reserved for mild symptoms or as adjuncts [^2c9004d5] [^d9ff34c1].

---

## Clinical scenarios where switching to famotidine may be considered

Although switching to famotidine is generally not recommended, it may be considered in specific scenarios:

- **Mild symptoms**: For patients with mild, intermittent symptoms, famotidine may provide sufficient relief [^2c9004d5].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Famotidine may be added at bedtime for nocturnal symptoms, but tachyphylaxis limits long-term benefit [^2890690f].
- **Contraindications**: If PPIs are contraindicated (e.g. severe hypersensitivity), famotidine may be used as an alternative [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where switching to famotidine is not recommended

Switching to famotidine is **not recommended** in the following scenarios:

- **Moderate-to-severe GERD**: PPIs are significantly more effective for symptom control and mucosal healing [^2c9004d5].
- **Erosive esophagitis**: PPIs are superior for healing and maintenance of remission [^c870ac1e].
- **Refractory GERD**: Persistent symptoms despite optimized PPI therapy require further evaluation rather than switching to an H2RA [^8d054b6e].

## Alternative strategies when lansoprazole is ineffective

When lansoprazole is ineffective, **consider the following**:

| **Strategy** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Optimize PPI therapy | Ensure once-daily dosing 30–60 minutes before breakfast; if ineffective, switch to twice-daily dosing or another PPI (e.g. esomeprazole, rabeprazole) [^62300bb4] [^8522ee2b] |
| Evaluate adherence | Confirm adherence and proper administration timing [^62300bb4] |
| Assess for refractory GERD | Consider pH-impedance testing or endoscopy to evaluate for non-acid reflux, functional disorders, or other etiologies [^8d054b6e] |
| Lifestyle modifications | Weight loss, dietary changes, head-of-bed elevation, and avoiding late meals [^05c8e4ac] |
| Surgical options | For refractory cases, consider fundoplication or LINX magnetic sphincter augmentation [^notfound] |

## Potential risks and benefits of switching to famotidine

### Benefits

Potential benefits include a **faster onset** — H2RAs act within 1–3 hours, which may help intermittent symptoms [^ff1b887e] — and a **lower cost**, as famotidine is available over the counter and is generally less expensive than prescription PPIs.

---

### Risks

Key risks include **lower efficacy**, as H2RAs are less effective than PPIs for GERD and erosive esophagitis [^2c9004d5], and **tachyphylaxis**, with diminished antisecretory effect with continued use, limiting long-term benefit [^2890690f].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines consistently recommend **PPIs as first-line therapy** for GERD, with H2RAs reserved for mild symptoms or as adjuncts. Switching to famotidine is not recommended when lansoprazole fails; instead, optimize PPI therapy or evaluate for refractory GERD [^2c9004d5] [^d9ff34c1].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Switching from lansoprazole to famotidine is **not recommended** when lansoprazole is ineffective, as PPIs are superior for GERD and erosive esophagitis. Optimize PPI therapy, consider alternative PPIs, and evaluate for refractory GERD or non-acid reflux if symptoms persist. Famotidine may be used for mild symptoms or as an adjunct, but tachyphylaxis limits long-term benefit.

Although this study demonstrates effectiveness of lansoprazole in healing erosive esophagitis, it does not represent an adequate comparison with ranitidine because the recommended ranitidine dose for esophagitis is 150 mg four times daily, twice the dose used in this study.

In the two trials described and in several smaller studies involving patients with moderate to severe erosive esophagitis, lansoprazole produced healing rates similar to those shown above. In a U.S. multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled study, 30 mg of lansoprazole was compared with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily in 151 patients with erosive reflux esophagitis that was poorly responsive to a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with at least one H2-receptor antagonist given at the dose indicated for symptom relief or greater, namely, cimetidine 800 mg/day, ranitidine 300 mg/day, famotidine 40 mg/day or nizatidine 300 mg/day. Lansoprazole 30 mg was more effective than ranitidine 150 mg twice daily in healing reflux esophagitis, and the percentage of patients with healing were as follows. This study does not constitute a comparison of the effectiveness of histamine H2-receptor antagonists with lansoprazole, as all patients had demonstrated unresponsiveness to the histamine H2-receptor antagonist mode of treatment. It does indicate, however, that lansoprazole may be useful in patients failing on a histamine H2-receptor antagonist (Table 20) [see Indications and Usage (1.7)]

### Double-blind randomized trials of single-tablet ibuprofen / high-dose famotidine vs. ibuprofen alone for reduction of gastric and duodenal ulcers [^c9e5210b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The two different primary end points in the individual studies were chosen to address both the more clinically relevant end point of upper GI ulcers (gastric and/or duodenal) and the traditional US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) end point of gastric ulcers. In clinical practice, physicians and patients are concerned about preventing ulcers, whether they are gastric or duodenal, and many clinical trials use this primary end point. However, the FDA generally has approved antisecretory medications for prevention of gastric ulcers (e.g. lansoprazole and esomeprazole). These two trials were designed to be used for registration, and, in pretrial meetings, the FDA agreed to the use of the different end points in the two trials.

Comparison between treatment arms of the crude proportions of patients with ulcers at 24 weeks with a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test stratified by the two randomization risk factor strata (use of low-dose aspirin and other anticoagulants, prior ulcer history) was specified as the primary statistical analysis at the time of sample size calculation and study initiation. Before study termination and unblinding, the primary analysis was changed to a comparison between treatment arms of the life table estimates of the proportion of patients with ulcers at 24 weeks employing a modified χ 2 using the sum of squares from the life table in the error term, with the comparison of crude proportions using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test maintained as a secondary analysis. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) and absolute risk reductions were calculated using crude proportions.

### Lansoprazole (Prevacid) [^c870ac1e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the two trials described and in several smaller studies involving patients with moderate to severe erosive esophagitis, PREVACID produced healing rates similar to those shown above.

In a US, multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled study, 30 mg of PREVACID was compared with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily in 151 patients with erosive reflux esophagitis that was poorly responsive to a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with at least one H2-receptor antagonist given at the dose indicated for symptom relief or greater, namely, cimetidine 800 mg/day, ranitidine 300 mg/day, famotidine 40 mg/day or nizatidine 300 mg/day. PREVACID 30 mg was more effective than ranitidine 150 mg twice daily in healing reflux esophagitis, and the percentage of patients with healing were as follows. This study does not constitute a comparison of the effectiveness of histamine H2-receptor antagonists with PREVACID, as all patients had demonstrated unresponsiveness to the histamine H2-receptor antagonist mode of treatment. It does indicate, however, that PREVACID may be useful in patients failing on a histamine H2-receptor antagonist (Table 20) [see Indications and Usage (1.7)].

14.9	Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis

Two independent, double-blind, multicenter, controlled trials were conducted in patients with endoscopically confirmed healed esophagitis. Patients remained in remission significantly longer and the number of recurrences of erosive esophagitis was significantly less in patients treated with PREVACID than in patients treated with placebo over a 12 month period (Table 21).

Regardless of initial grade of erosive esophagitis, PREVACID 15 and 30 mg were similar in maintaining remission.

In a US, randomized, double-blind study, PREVACID 15 mg daily (n = 100) was compared with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily (n = 106), at the recommended dosage, in patients with endoscopically-proven healed erosive esophagitis over a 12 month period. Treatment with PREVACID resulted in patients remaining healed (Grade 0 lesions) of erosive esophagitis for significantly longer periods of time than those treated with ranitidine (p < 0.001). In addition, PREVACID was significantly more effective than ranitidine in providing complete relief of both daytime and nighttime heartburn. Patients treated with PREVACID remained asymptomatic for a significantly longer period of time than patients treated with ranitidine [see Indications and Usage (1.9)].

### Prevention of recurrent idiopathic gastroduodenal ulcer bleeding: a double-blind, randomised trial [^35a90f71]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patients with a history of Helicobacter pylori -negative idiopathic bleeding ulcers have a considerable risk of recurrent ulcer complications. We hypothesised that a proton pump inhibitor (lansoprazole) is superior to a histamine 2 receptor antagonist (famotidine) for the prevention of recurrent ulcer bleeding in such patients.

Design

In this industry-independent, double-blind, randomised trial, we recruited patients with a history of idiopathic bleeding ulcers. After ulcer healing, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients to receive oral lansoprazole 30mg or famotidine 40mg daily for 24 months. The primary endpoint was recurrent upper GI bleeding within 24 months, analysed in the intention-to-treat population as determined by an independent adjudication committee.

Results

Between 2010 and 2018, we enrolled 228 patients (114 patients in each study group). Recurrent upper GI bleeding occurred in one patient receiving lansoprazole (duodenal ulcer) and three receiving famotidine (two gastric ulcers and one duodenal ulcer). The cumulative incidence of recurrent upper GI bleeding in 24 months was 0.88% (95% CI 0.08% to 4.37%) in the lansoprazole arm and 2.63% (95% CI 0.71% to 6.91%) in the famotidine arm (p = 0.313; crude HR 0.33, 95%CI 0.03 to 3.16, p = 0.336). None of the patients who rebled used aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or other antithrombotic drugs.

Conclusion

This 2-year, double-blind randomised trial showed that among patients with a history of H. pylori -negative idiopathic ulcer bleeding, recurrent bleeding rates were comparable between users of lansoprazole and famotidine, although a small difference in efficacy cannot be excluded.

In the two trials described and in several smaller studies involving patients with moderate to severe erosive esophagitis, PREVACID produced healing rates similar to those shown above.

In a U.S. multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled study, 30 mg of PREVACID was compared with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily in 151 patients with erosive reflux esophagitis that was poorly responsive to a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with at least one H2-receptor antagonist given at the dose indicated for symptom relief or greater, namely, cimetidine 800 mg/day, ranitidine 300 mg/day, famotidine 40 mg/day or nizatidine 300 mg/day.

### A cost-effectiveness analysis of stress ulcer prophylaxis [^6a953ba3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost of using cimetidine, famotidine, and lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) at our institution and determine which agent was most cost-effective.

Methods

An observational study of adults admitted to the medical, surgical, or cardiovascular intensive care unit was conducted to compare the cost and effectiveness of cimetidine, famotidine, and lansoprazole for SUP. Patients were identified for inclusion during three 2-week periods in 2000. Medical record reviews were conducted to gather data regarding the costs associated with the administration of SUP drugs and the treatment of any adverse events or therapeutic failures. Decision analysis was used to determine the average cost per patient for each treatment arm. A cost-effectiveness analysis was then conducted to determine which of the SUP agents was associated with the least cost without adversely affecting patient outcomes. A sensitivity analysis was applied to determine the robustness of the data.

Results

Eighty-eight patients were included in the analysis. Five of the patients started on cimetidine experienced therapeutic failure, whereas no patients receiving lansoprazole experienced therapeutic failure. For these reasons, and because lansoprazole is an oral agent, the average costs associated with lansoprazole use were lower than with the use of cimetidine. Lansoprazole was found to be the most cost-effective therapy.

Conclusions

This study showed that lansoprazole is a cost-effective agent for the use of SUP at our institution. However, due to the higher cost of intravenous pantoprazole, the model demonstrates that, assuming equal effectiveness, intravenous pantoprazole would not be cost-effective when compared with cimetidine.

### Prospective, randomized comparison of lansoprazole suspension, and intermittent intravenous famotidine on gastric pH and acid production in critically ill neurosurgical patients [^aae84229]. Neurocritical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Background

There is a paucity of studies comparing stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) agents in high-risk neurosurgical patients.

Methods

In this prospective, randomized study, critically ill neurosurgical patients received lansoprazole 30 mg suspension via NG/NJ tube daily or famotidine 20 mg IV q12 h for SUP. Gastric pH and residual volumes were recorded for 3 days and adverse events for 7 days after admission.

Results

There were 51 patients randomized to lansoprazole (n = 28) or famotidine (n = 23) who received SUP for ≥ 3 days. All patients had at least two risk factors for SRMD, and 75% had a baseline GCS < 9. On day 1 of therapy, more famotidine patients had a gastric pH ≥ 4 at least 80% of the time as compared to lansoprazole patients (74 vs. 36%, P = 0.01, respectively); however, there was no difference on days 2 and 3. Enteral feedings on day 1 predicted a pH ≥ 4 (P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in the percentages of time gastric residual volumes < 28 mL (P = NS). Heme-positive aspirates were present in 18–39% of patients (P = NS); one patient receiving famotidine met the criteria for overt bleeding. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 17% in the famotidine group and 4% in the lansoprazole group (P = NS).

Conclusions

Neurosurgery ICU patients receiving famotidine for SUP achieved a gastric pH ≥ 4 more often than lansoprazole-treated patients, but only on day 1 of the 3-day study period. Both agents were equally effective in reducing gastric acid production. There was no difference in the incidence of mucosal damage and thrombocytopenia.

### Helicobacter pylori infection influences symptomatic response to anti-secretory therapy in patients with GORD – crossover comparative study with famotidine and low-dose lansoprazole [^2ba60216]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Helicobacter pylori infection was reported to affect gastric acid secretion. We investigated the heartburn symptoms of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease during sequential treatment with 40 mg of famotidine or 15 mg of lansoprazole to clarify whether H. pylori infection influences symptomatic response to anti-secretory therapy.

Subjects and Methods

The subjects were 33 gastro-oesophageal reflux disease patients, who had already been treated with a full dose of H2 receptor antagonist. First, famotidine at 20 mg b.i.d. was administered to the patients for 8 weeks. Second, famotidine was replaced with 15 mg of lansoprazole once in the morning for 8 weeks. Finally, 20 mg of famotidine was administered b.i.d. for 8 weeks instead of lansoprazole. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms were assessed using an original visual analogue scale.

Results

The sequential symptomatic responses to famotidine and lansoprazole administration indicated that gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms of patients during low-dose lansoprazole treatment were significantly less than those during famotidine treatment. Remission of symptoms was obtained significantly more often by famotidine therapy in patients with H. pylori infection than in patients without H. pylori infection.

Conclusion

Low-dose lansoprazole is more effective than full-dose famotidine for the control of symptoms in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and H. pylori infection influences the symptomatic response to H2 receptor antagonists.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate? [^b679b22e]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, Scarpignato et al. should be commended for this remarkable effort. In addition to the major points detailed above, there are numerous pearls pertinent to comparative PPI pharmacology and metabolism contained within the text. However, the overwhelming message is that the problem with PPIs is that they are good, very good. Consequently, there are a lot of valid indications for their use. However, clinicians cannot be complacent, thinking that the overwhelming efficacy of the drugs in the treatment of peptic esophagitis and ulcer disease will be matched in all other putative applications. Decisions to start, properly dose, continue, or discontinue PPI therapy should be personalized based on indication, effectiveness, patient preferences, and risk assessment. Guidelines are important, but they should not be inflexible. Clinicians need flexibility to tailor therapy to specific patient circumstances and experience. Only then does one achieve the optimal balance between risk and benefit.

### Comparison of acid-lowering drugs for endoscopy negative reflux disease: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^17d4fb6a]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Eligibility criteria

Studies were identified with the terms non‐erosive reflux disease or NERD or endoscopy‐negative reflux disease or symptomatic reflux disease (all as medical subject headings and as free text terms). These were combined using the set operator AND with studies identified with the terms: proton‐pump inhibitor, PPI, pantoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole, potassium‐competitive acid blocker, PCAB, K‐CAB, vonoprazan, tegoprazan, fexuprazan, revaprazan, histamine‐receptor antagonist, H2‐RA, H2RA, ranitidine, cimetidine, roxatidine, famotidine, nizatidine, alginate, or sodium alginate. There were no language restrictions. We screened the titles and abstracts of all citations identified by our search for potential suitability and retrieved those that appeared relevant to examine them in more detail. We performed a recursive search, using the bibliographies of all eligible articles. We translated foreign language articles, where required. If a study appeared potentially eligible, but did not report the data required, we planned to contact authors to obtain Data S1. We performed eligibility assessment independently. This was done by two investigators (BB and PV), using pre‐designed eligibility forms. We resolved any disagreements by consensus and measured the degree of agreement with a kappa statistic.

3.2 Outcome assessment

The primary outcome assessed was the efficacy of PPIs, H 2 RAs, PCABs, and alginates versus each other, or placebo, in terms of failure to achieve complete relief of gastro‐esophageal reflux symptoms in patients with endoscopy‐negative reflux disease. Secondary outcomes included failure to achieve adequate relief of gastro‐esophageal reflux symptoms and treatment‐related adverse events.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^65c6e9f0]. Gastroenterology (2008). Medium credibility.

GERD — antisecretory drug selection and on-demand therapy highlights that circumstances in which one antisecretory drug might be preferable to another primarily relate to side effects or when the onset of effect is a prime consideration. The most common side effects of PPIs are headache, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain, and switching among alternative PPI drugs or to a lower dose can usually circumvent these side effects. For on-demand use, if a patient intends to take a drug only in response to symptoms, then it should be a rapidly acting drug, and the most rapidly acting agents are antacids, the efficacy of which can be sustained by combining them with an H2RA or a PPI.

### Management of infantile spasms during the COVID-19 pandemic [^8a665a19]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Infantile spasms due to tuberous sclerosis complex respond particularly well to vigabatrin. - However, access to medications from specialty pharmacies may be delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and early treatment of infantile spasms is essential. Prednisolone is widely available and can be easily started while waiting to obtain vigabatrin. ACTH has been reported to increase the size of cardiac rhabdomyomas; thus, use of hormonal therapy in tuberous sclerosis complex should include echocardiography evaluation.
Avoid non-standard therapy as the first treatment choice for infantile spasms (ie, avoid topiramate, ketogenic diet, etc.). [Enduring]

Other anti-seizure medications and dietary therapies are not as efficacious as hormonal therapy or vigabatrin and should not be administered as initial therapy. In particular, though topiramate showed early promise, follow-up analyses have failed to show efficacy against infantile spasms. - Zonisamide, and levetiracetamalso lack compelling evidence of efficacy. Ketogenic diet, and valproic acidmay have efficacy, but the evidence does not support their use as initial treatment for infantile spasms.
For infants treated with prednisolone or ACTH, consider GI prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor or H2 blocker. [Enduring]

Medications for prophylactic gastric acid suppression during the treatment of infantile spasms is common practice, and their overall efficacy in children is well established. Three commonly used and readily available regimens i include:

Famotidine 0.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily
Omeprazole 1 mg/kg daily
Lansoprazole 15 mg once daily (if < 30 kg)

For treatment with prednisolone or ACTH, write a single prescription that includes both 2 weeks at a high dose and a 2-week taper. [Enduring]

The authors have cared for children for whom high-dose hormonal therapy was initiated, but there was no follow-up at 2 weeks to initiate the taper. Therefore, the taper should be specified from the onset of treatment to prevent medication over-exposure or abrupt cessation.

### Efficacy of omeprazole, famotidine, mosapride and teprenone in patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms: an omeprazole-controlled randomized study (J-FOCUS) [^f398a52e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Based on prior studies, we estimated the proportion of patients with symptom relief after 4 weeks of treatment at 68% for omeprazole and 50% for famotidine. From these values, we calculated that 127 patients in each of the omeprazole and famotidine treatment groups would provide 80% power to detect a significant difference between the two groups. We aimed for a similar number of patients for the mosapride group. The effect of teprenone on dyspeptic or GERD symptoms was assumed to be lower than that of the other agents. Considering the symptom severity of included patients, it was planned for ethical reasons to keep the group allocated to teprenone as small as possible. It was estimated that the effect of teprenone could be confirmed with half the number of individuals allocated to the other agents.

Safety variables were analyzed using all randomized patients (i.e. intention-to-treat population). Efficacy variables were analyzed using the full analysis set, which comprised all patients who attended the baseline visit and at least one follow-up visit. Patients who did not return after the initial visit were excluded from efficacy analyses. The primary variable, the proportion of patients with sufficient overall symptom relief after 4 weeks of treatment, was compared between the omeprazole group and the other treatment groups using χ 2 tests. A value of p < 0.0167 in a two-sided test with Bonferroni correction was considered statistically significant. For secondary variables, no corrections were made for multiple comparisons. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was also conducted to examine potential determinants of treatment efficacy.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^73c266cc]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite PPIs carrying – like any other classes of drugs – some risks, they should not be denied to patients who are likely to benefit from them merely because of concerns about putative adverse effects. There is generally some equivalence between the acceptable burden of adverse effects and the severity of the illness being treated. However, patients with acid-related diseases are often otherwise "healthy" subjects, who take drugs for a given condition. What level of undesirable effects would be acceptable for them and who will bear the cost of treating any ensuing iatrogenic disease? A number of simple and potentially effective preventive measures should be recommended for some (if not all) safety concerns in order to minimize them.

First of all, PPI therapy should be evidence based. Decisions on whether or not to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be sound and PPIs should only be prescribed when there is an appropriate clinical indication. Clinical guidelines can certainly help. In this Position Paper, we have reviewed the current available guidelines, together with the systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to generate them, and synthesized the knowledge in a number of statements (i.e. Summaries of the current evidence) and in Table 3.

Table 3
Current indications of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy

Guidelines rely on both evidence and expert opinion; they are neither infallible nor a substitute for clinical judgment. They do, however, go beyond systematic reviews to recommend what should and should not be done in specific clinical circumstances. Despite guidelines being developed to improve quality of care received by patients, they have been criticized for recommending too little or too much, and even for providing reasons for national health systems or insurance payers to deny coverage. Guidelines are often inflexible and can actually harm by leaving insufficient room for clinicians to tailor care to individual patient circumstances and medical history. What is best for patients overall, as recommended by guidelines, may be inappropriate for individuals. Only evidence-based recommendations, which consider the balance between benefits and harms, and weigh these considerations using patient (rather than expert and societal) value, should be followed in everyday clinical practice. Taking these considerations into account, we have tried to distill the current evidence and provide physicians with clear patient-oriented recommendations, beyond cost and reimbursement issues. Medicine is a rapidly evolving field, however, and the validity of guidelines will not necessarily stand the test of time: indeed, today's assumptions may no longer be valid tomorrow. Healthcare providers should therefore stay tuned and constantly update their knowledge.

### Efficacy of omeprazole, famotidine, mosapride and teprenone in patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms: an omeprazole-controlled randomized study (J-FOCUS) [^8dfa81f9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

J-FOCUS was the first study to compare the efficacy of omeprazole, famotidine, mosapride and teprenone in Japanese patients with uninvestigated upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Its randomized, multicenter, parallel-group design further adds to the strength of this study. The present study has the following limitations: it was open label; information on over-the-counter drug use before study entry was not collected; the long-term effects of each drug beyond the 8-week trial period were not investigated; and some centers were unable to register the target number of patients meaning the allocation ratio (i.e. 2:2:2:1) was not fully met. In addition, the study did not have a placebo arm, but because we only enrolled patients with moderate to severe symptoms at inclusion made this difficult to justify from an ethical standpoint. Thus, whereas the study provided a comparison of symptom relief among active drugs with different modes of action, the therapeutic gain of each drug compared with placebo could not be determined. However, the CADET-HN study, which included a placebo arm, showed that symptom response after 4 weeks of treatment was 51% (95% CI: 43–60%) with omeprazole, 36% (95% CI: 28–39%) with ranitidine and 31% (95% CI: 22–39%) with cisapride, compared with 23% (95% CI: 16–31%) with placebo. No treatment-related adverse events were reported at either follow-up visit. This may be related to the 4-week treatment duration, which was possibly too short for adverse events to occur. However, we must acknowledge the possibility that some patients who did not attend the follow-up visits may have discontinued treatment because of adverse events. It is also possible that discontinuing prior therapies 1 week before the study might have aggravated symptoms or led to the onset of new symptoms. However, we were unable to assess this possibility in the present study.

### Effect of famotidine on hepatic hemodynamics and peptic ulcer [^60e18e20]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (1987). Low credibility.

Regarding the use of famotidine PO (also known as Pepcid) in patients with chronic liver disease, any severity:

- Use acceptable.
- No dose adjustment required.
- Prefer famotidine in patients with hepatic impairment, as it undergoes minimal first-pass metabolism.

### Famotidine [^10d7202a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Dosage in Renal Impairment

Dosage adjustments of Famotidine are recommended for patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Table 2 shows the recommended maximum dosage of Famotidine 20 mg or 40 mg tablets for patients with renal impairment, by indication. Use the lowest effective dose. Some dosage adjustments may require switching to other formulations of famotidine (e.g., oral suspension, lower dose tablet).

Table 2: Recommended Maximum Dosage of Famotidine Tablets in Adults and Pediatric Patients 40 kg and Greater with Moderate and Severe Renal Impairment

aAn alternate dosage regimen is 10 mg once daily. Since 20 mg or 40 mg tablet strength cannot be used for this dosage regimen, use an alternate famotidine formulation.

bDosage adjustments for renal impairment are provided for both dosing regimens (20 mg twice daily and 40 mg twice daily) which showed effectiveness for the treatment of erosive esophagitis in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

cIn pediatric patients, the safety and effectiveness of Famotidine have not been established for the reduction of the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence or for treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

dDoses required to treat pathological hypersecretory conditions may exceed the maximum doses evaluated in patients with impaired renal function. The risk for increased adverse reactions in renally-impaired patients treated with Famotidine for pathological hypersecretory conditions is unknown.

eRecommended dosage regimen is 10 mg every other day. Since 20 mg or 40 mg tablet strength cannot be used for this dosage regimen, use an alternative famotidine formulation.

2.3 Administration Instructions

Take Famotidine once daily before bedtime or twice daily in the morning and before bedtime, as recommended.
Famotidine tablets may be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Famotidine tablets may be given with antacids.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate? [^ec1be079]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is commonly used outside of Food and Drug Administration indication for a broad range of conditions such as extra-esophageal reflux and PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia. While this may be appropriate in some scenarios, it has also resulted in widespread inappropriate PPI use. At the same time, data suggesting adverse effects of long-term PPI therapy are multiplying, albeit mainly from low quality studies. The systematic review by Scarpignato et al. (BMC Med 14:179, 2016) addresses this dilemma with a comprehensive analysis of the risks and benefits of PPI use. The authors concluded that, while PPIs are highly efficacious in erosive acid-peptic disorders, efficacy is not equaled in other conditions. In some instances, they found no supportive evidence of benefit. With respect to side effects, they indicated that the questionable harms associated with PPI therapy do not outweigh the benefits afforded by appropriate PPI use. However, inappropriate PPI use results in increased healthcare costs and unnecessary exposure to potential adverse effects. Ideally, PPI therapy should be personalized, based on indication, effectiveness, patient preference, and risk assessment.

### Prevention of peptic ulcers with esomeprazole in patients at risk of ulcer development treated with low-dose acetylsalicylic acid: a randomised, controlled trial (OBERON) [^03ed0619]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

Reduction of ulcer development in low-dose ASA users was recently demonstrated with use of an H2-receptor antagonist (H2-RA), famotidine, 20 mg twice daily for 3 months. Many methodological differences between this and our study make comparisons difficult; of particular note, over 20% of patients in the famotidine study did not have final endoscopic confirmation of ulcer status. Furthermore, 42% of placebo recipients who developed ulcers had H pylori infection, versus no instances of infection in the active treatment group, raising the possibility that many of the ulcers prevented were attributable to H pylori infection and not to low-dose ASA. Further, in a longer-term (48 weeks) trial, famotidine 40 mg/day was shown to be inferior to a PPI (pantoprazole) in the prevention of dyspeptic or bleeding ulcers/erosions in patients with ASA-related peptic ulcers/erosions. Concerns about the long-term use of H2-RAs for the reduction of low-dose ASA-related ulcers include tachyphylaxis, as well as lack of convincing observational data that bleeding ulcers can be reduced, leading to recommendations favouring PPI over H2-RA treatment. While the efficacy of H2-RA treatment in reduction of gastric bleeding has been observed, the effect was less than has been shown with PPI treatment. The efficacy of esomeprazole 40 mg and 20 mg was shown in an OBERON analysis for both the H pylori -negative population and patients proved to be H pylori positive after randomisation. The same observation was made in the ASTERIX study, which used esomeprazole 20 mg daily.

In conclusion, the results of this trial demonstrate that esomeprazole 40 mg and 20 mg once daily reduces the risk of endoscopically proved peptic ulcer in patients who take low-dose ASA, and who are at risk for ulcer development. In the population studied, the esomeprazole 40 mg and 20 mg regimens appear to be equally effective.

### Lansoprazole [^aedf1325]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Duodenal Ulcer

In a U.S. multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response (15, 30, and 60 mg of lansoprazole once daily) study of 284 patients with endoscopically documented duodenal ulcer, the percentage of patients healed after two and four weeks was significantly higher with all doses of lansoprazole than with placebo. There was no evidence of a greater or earlier response with the two higher doses compared with lansoprazole 15 mg. Based on this study and the second study described below, the recommended dose of lansoprazole in duodenal ulcer is 15 mg per day (Table 9).

* (p ≤ 0.001) versus placebo.

Lansoprazole 15 mg was significantly more effective than placebo in relieving day and nighttime abdominal pain and in decreasing the amount of antacid taken per day.

In a second U.S. multicenter study, also double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-comparison (15 and 30 mg of lansoprazole once daily), and including a comparison with ranitidine, in 280 patients with endoscopically documented duodenal ulcer, the percentage of patients healed after four weeks was significantly higher with both doses of lansoprazole than with placebo. There was no evidence of a greater or earlier response with the higher dose of lansoprazole. Although the 15 mg dose of lansoprazole was superior to ranitidine at four weeks, the lack of significant difference at two weeks and the absence of a difference between 30 mg of lansoprazole and ranitidine leaves the comparative effectiveness of the two agents undetermined (Table 10) [see Indications and Usage (1.1)]

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^94b9eeaf]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, PPIs are irreplaceable drugs in the management of acid-related diseases. However, PPI treatment – as any kind of drug therapy – is not without risk of adverse effects. The overall benefits of therapy and improvement in quality of life significantly outweigh potential risks in most patients, but those without clear clinical indication are only exposed to the risks of PPI prescription. Adhering to evidence-based guidelines represents the only rational approach to an effective and safe PPI therapy.

### Famotidine is inferior to pantoprazole in preventing recurrence of aspirin-related peptic ulcers or erosions [^b634f2ce]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Little is known about the efficacy of H(2)-receptor antagonists in preventing recurrence of aspirin-related peptic ulcers. We compared the efficacy of high-dose famotidine with that of pantoprazole in preventing recurrent symptomatic ulcers/erosions.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of 160 patients with aspirin-related peptic ulcers/erosions, with or without a history of bleeding. Patients were given either famotidine (40 mg, morning and evening) or pantoprazole (20 mg in the morning and placebo in the evening). All patients continued to receive aspirin (80 mg daily). The primary end point was recurrent dyspeptic or bleeding ulcers/erosions within 48 weeks.

Results

A total of 130 patients (81.1%) completed the study; 13 of 65 patients in the famotidine group reached the primary end point (20.0%; 95% one-sided confidence interval [CI] for the risk difference, 0.1184–1.0) compared with 0 of 65 patients in the pantoprazole group (P < .0001, 95% one-sided CI for the risk difference, 0.1184–1.0). Gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly more common in the famotidine group than the pantoprazole group (7.7% [5/65] vs 0% [0/65]; 95% one-sided CI for the risk difference, 0.0226–1.0; P = 0.0289), as was recurrent dyspepsia caused by ulcers/erosions (12.3% [8/65] vs 0% [0/65]; 95% one-sided CI for the risk difference, 0.0560–1.0; P = 0.0031). No patients had ulcer perforation or obstruction.

Conclusions

In patients with aspirin-related peptic ulcers/erosions, high-dose famotidine therapy is inferior to pantoprazole in preventing recurrent dyspeptic or bleeding ulcers/erosions.

### Effect of esomeprazole versus famotidine on platelet inhibition by clopidogrel: a double-blind, randomized trial [^e45c701f]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies showed that esomeprazole does not interfere significantly with the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. It is unknown whether famotidine, a histamine 2 receptor antagonist, interacts with clopidogrel. This double-blind, randomized study aimed to compare the influence of esomeprazole and famotidine on the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel.

Methods

Patients with acute coronary syndrome or elective percutaneous coronary interventions treated with aspirin and clopidogrel cotherapy were randomized to receive esomeprazole 20 mg daily or famotidine 40 mg daily. Platelet reactivity units (PRUs) were measured at baseline and on day 28. The primary analysis involved the PRU values on day 28.

Results

There were 44 patients in the esomeprazole group and 44 in the famotidine group. The baseline PRUs of the 2 groups were comparable (esomeprazole vs famotidine, 229.1 ± 85.6 vs 220.4 ± 83.0, P = 0.63). The PRUs on day 28 were 242.6 ± 89.7 and 237.5 ± 79.2 in the groups receiving esomeprazole and famotidine, respectively (mean difference 5.1, 95% CI -30.8 to 41.0, P = 0.78).

Conclusions

The platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel was not significantly different between patients receiving esomeprazole and those receiving famotidine. Neither esomeprazole nor famotidine reduced the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. (Clinicaltrial.gov Identifier NCT01062516).

### Proton pump inhibitor failure – what are the therapeutic options? [^1912d73a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) failure is very common and may affect up to one-third of the PPI consumers. Identifying the underlying mechanisms for PPI failure in each individual patient is essential for treatment success. For residual acid reflux, increasing the PPI dose to twice daily; switching to another PPI, or adding an histamine 2 receptor antagonist could be a successful therapeutic strategy. In patients with duodenogastroesophageal reflux, weak acidic/alkaline reflux and hypersensitivity to acid reflux, therapeutic modalities that reduce transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation or visceral pain could be entertained. Treatment of PPI failure due to delayed gastric emptying should be focused on improving gastric motor activity. Psychological management may supplement any medical or surgical approach toward PPI failure.

### PPI use in the OTC era: who to treat, with what, and for how long? [^5cc5313f]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been shown to be the most effective class of medication to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The availability of over-the-counter (OTC) and generic PPIs provides consumers with options other than antacids and histamine 2 -receptor antagonists (H2RAs) for self-medication of heartburn and acid regurgitation. Medical concerns arising from these developments include management of patients in whom symptoms persist despite OTC PPI, proper administration of PPIs, and potential masking of more serious pathology, such as malignancy. Current studies indicate that it is likely that different forms of PPI administration will become more acceptable, such as on-demand and intermittent therapy. Prospective clinical trials show the efficacy of these strategies of noncontinuous PPI administration, and the potential for cost reduction in GERD management. Newer agents such as reversible acid pump antagonists will compete for selected markets in the future, further expanding the role of alternative dosing regimens. Ultimately, therapy should be tailored to individual patients because no single strategy will be optimal for the entire population with GERD symptoms.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) continue to be the medication of choice for treatment of acid-related disease, with few if any overt side effects seen with daily use. They are often prescribed empirically, often in high doses and with many patients being treated with multiple PPIs without an objective diagnosis.

4.3 Failure to achieve complete relief of gastro‐esophageal reflux symptoms at ≥ 4 weeks of treatment

Twenty RCTs reported data concerning efficacy of PPIs, PCABs, alginates, or H 2 RAs in terms of failure to achieve complete relief of gastro‐esophageal reflux symptoms at ≥ 4 weeks of treatment., In total, 9287 patients were recruited of whom 7640 were randomized to active treatment. The network plot is provided in Figure S3A. Pooled analysis revealed high levels of statistical heterogeneity (I 2 = 74.3%), with evidence of funnel plot asymmetry, suggesting publication bias, or other small study effects (Figure S3B). Dexlansoprazole 30 mg o.d. ranked first (RR of failure to achieve complete relief of gastro‐esophageal reflux symptoms = 0.48, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.65, P ‐score 0.95), with 30 mL of alginate q.i.d. in combination with omeprazole 20 mg o.d. performing similarly and ranked second (RR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.73, P ‐score 0.94), and 30 mL of alginate t.i.d. ranked third (RR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.94, P ‐score 0.72) (Figure 4A). However, for the latter two, these results were based on one trial recruiting 76 patients, and one trial in 195 patients. Tegoprazan 100 mg o.d. and 50 mg o.d. rabeprazole 5 mg o.d. ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. famotidine 40 mg o.d. and cimetidine 400 mg q.i.d. were all no more efficacious than placebo. After indirect comparison of active treatments, dexlansoprazole 30 mg o.d. was superior to omeprazole 20 mg and 10 mg o.d. dexlansoprazole 60 mg o.d. rabeprazole 20 mg, 10 mg, or 5 mg o.d. esomeprazole 40 mg or 20 mg o.d. ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. famotidine 40 mg o.d. cimetidine 400 mg q.i.d. and placebo (Figure 4B).

### Similar efficacy of proton-pump inhibitors vs H2-receptor antagonists in reducing risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers in high-risk users of low-dose aspirin [^fb644397]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

It is not clear whether H 2 -receptor antagonists (H2RAs) reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in aspirin users at high risk. We performed a double-blind randomized trial to compare the effects of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) vs a H2RA antagonist in preventing recurrent upper GI bleeding and ulcers in high-risk aspirin users.

Methods

We studied 270 users of low-dose aspirin (≤ 325 mg/day) with a history of endoscopically confirmed ulcer bleeding at 8 sites in Hong Kong and Japan. After healing of ulcers, subjects with negative results from tests for Helicobacter pylori resumed aspirin (80 mg) daily and were assigned randomly to groups given a once-daily PPI (rabeprazole, 20 mg; n = 138) or H2RA (famotidine, 40 mg; n = 132) for up to 12 months. Subjects were evaluated every 2 months; endoscopy was repeated if they developed symptoms of upper GI bleeding or had a reduction in hemoglobin level greater than 2 g/dL and after 12 months of follow-up evaluation. The adequacy of upper GI protection was assessed by end points of recurrent upper GI bleeding and a composite of recurrent upper GI bleeding or recurrent endoscopic ulcers at month 12.

Results

During the 12-month study period, upper GI bleeding recurred in 1 patient receiving rabeprazole (0.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1%-5.1%) and in 4 patients receiving famotidine (3.1%; 95% CI, 1.2%-8.1%) (P = 0.16). The composite end point of recurrent bleeding or endoscopic ulcers at month 12 was reached by 9 patients receiving rabeprazole (7.9%; 95% CI, 4.2%-14.7%) and 13 patients receiving famotidine (12.4%; 95% CI, 7.4%-20.4%) (P = 0.26).

Conclusions

In a randomized controlled trial of users of low-dose aspirin at risk for recurrent GI bleeding, a slightly lower proportion of patients receiving a PPI along with aspirin developed recurrent bleeding or ulcer than of patients receiving an H2RA with the aspirin, although this difference was not statistically significant.

### Platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel in patients treated with omeprazole, pantoprazole, and famotidine: a prospective, randomized, crossover study [^87204bc3]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Concerns about an inhibitory effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on clopidogrel metabolism have been raised. Because the pharmacological effect of clopidogrel is dependent on genetically determined activity of the hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes system, it is important to examine the interaction between different PPIs and high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) after controlling for genetic variability. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of 2 PPIs and a histamine-2 (H2) receptor-blocker on platelet reactivity in a crossover trial where each patient was alternately treated with each drug.

Hypothesis

Omeprazole reduces HPR more than other PPI or H2 blockers.

Methods

Patients treated with aspirin and clopidogrel for at least 1 month were assigned to 3 consecutive 1-month treatment periods during which they were treated with each of the 3 study medications twice daily: omeprazole 20 mg, famotidine 40 mg, and pantoprazole 20 mg. At the end of each treatment phase, platelet function was evaluated with the Verify Now system using 2 cutoff values (> 208 P2Y12 reaction units [PRUs] and > 230 PRUs) for the definition of HPR.

Results

Patients with HPR were older than those without HPR (62 ± 10 vs 55 ± 8 years, respectively, P = 0.03). HPR was more prevalent during omeprazole therapy compared to famotidine or pantoprazole (48%, 33%, and 31%, respectively, for the 208 PRU cutoff, P = 0.04; and 37%, 17%, and 23%, respectively, for the 230 PRU cutoff, P = 0.003).

Conclusions

After eliminating the effects of interindividual variability in clopidogrel metabolism, omeprazole therapy was associated with substantially more HPR than famotidine or pantoprazole.

Recommendations from Canada College of Family Physicians guidelines on deprescribing PPIs

When should PPIs be deprescribed?

Not all patients are suitable candidates for PPI deprescription. Patients with risk factors for GI bleeding or ulcers will have a high risk of relapse, and thus will not be suitable candidates. Nonetheless, even though PPIs are widely used as they are seen to be generally safe and effective, they should not be continued if they are not indicated. Recent studies have suggested that PPIs alter intestinal microbiota and are involved in the pathogenesis of NSAID enteropathy. Adults who have completed a minimum of 4 weeks of PPI treatment for heartburn or mild–moderate gastroesophageal reflux disease or esophagitis whose symptoms are resolved are ideal examples where PPI deprescription should be considered. This should exclude patients with Barrett esophagus, severe esophagitis grade C or D, or documented history of bleeding GI ulcers.PPIs, however, should not be deprescribed in chronic NSAID users with bleeding risk.

How to deprescribe PPIs?

Reducing the dose or switching to on-demand use

The Canadian guidelines strongly recommend lowering the dose or switching to on-demand use. Lowering the dose will lead to a lower risk of symptom relapse compared to switching to on-demand use. However, on-demand use will help to lower pill burden and cost.

Abrupt discontinuation or tapering

Alternatively, the PPI can just be discontinued abruptly or tapered slowly. There is evidence that an abrupt discontinuation increases the risk of symptom relapse, and thus patients should be tapered to the lowest effective dose before discontinuation. Patients can also be provided symptomatic relief with on-demand PPI.

Monitoring and nonpharmacological management

The patient should be monitored at 4 and 12 weeks for such symptoms as heartburn, dyspepsia, regurgitation, or epigastric pain. The patient may exhibit nonverbal symptoms, such as loss of appetite, weight loss, and agitation. If symptoms return, nondrug strategies can be used: avoid meals 2–3 hours before bedtime, elevate head of bed, address need for weight loss, and avoid dietary triggers. Over-the-counter drugs, such as H 2 RAs, PPIs, antacids, and alginates, can also be used, although the use of daily H 2 RAs is only weakly recommended, due to a higher risk of symptom relapse.

### Proton pump inhibitors: an update [^14f6a582]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Since their introduction in the late 1980s, proton pump inhibitors have demonstrated gastric acid suppression superior to that of histamine H2-receptor blockers. Proton pump inhibitors have enabled improved treatment of various acid-peptic disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced gastropathy. Proton pump inhibitors have minimal side effects and few significant drug interactions, and they are generally considered safe for long-term treatment. The proton pump inhibitors omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and the recently approved esomeprazole appear to have similar efficacy.

### Is empiric proton pump inhibition in patients with symptoms of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux justified? [^05b1b756]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of suspected EE manifestations of GERD including LPR is hampered by uncertainties regarding diagnosis, causality, and treatment efficacy. The benefits of a PPI trial lasting three to six months before 24-hour pH and impedance monitoring seem very low. Although this practice is suggested by society guidelines and considered cost effective in many countries it will lead to long-term PPI use in a high number of patients without any benefit and increased risk of side effects. Diagnostic testing with pH and impedance monitoring rather than empiric PPI treatment should be chosen in a higher proportion of patients presenting with symptoms possibly attributable to EE reflux.

### On-demand treatment of acute heartburn with the antacid hydrotalcite compared with famotidine and placebo: randomized double-blind cross-over study [^7e7c945b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Antacids are widely used in the self-treatment of gastroesophageal reflux-induced complaints, but respective studies are lacking.

Goals

To compare the efficacy and safety of hydrotalcite with the H2 receptor antagonist famotidine and placebo in the on-demand treatment of acute heartburn under daily practice conditions.

Study

Five hundred sixty-two individuals in 4 centers were randomized in a double-blind, double-dummy, 3-fold cross-over study to single-dose treatments of 1000 mg hydrotalcite, 10 mg famotidine, or placebo. Heartburn severity and relief was measured with numerical and visual rating scales.

Results

A significantly better heartburn relief score was achieved 60 minutes after administration of hydrotalcite compared with placebo (primary end point, P < 0.0001). Better efficacy was also observed 30 minutes and 3 hours after the intake of hydrotalcite in comparison with famotidine or placebo. A significant decrease in heartburn severity compared with placebo occurred within 10 minutes for hydrotalcite and was faster compared with both controls.

Conclusions

For subjects self-administering antacids for episodic heartburn, antacid hydrotalcite provides symptom relief significantly faster and, within the first 3 hours postdosing, more effective than famotidine or placebo. These results suggest that on-demand treatment of hydrotalcite is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for heartburn.

4.1.1 Failure to achieve complete relief of gastro‐esophageal reflux symptoms between ≥ 2 and < 4 weeks of treatment

Seven RCTs reported data concerning efficacy of PPIs, H 2 RAs, PCABs, or alginates in terms of failure to achieve complete relief of gastro‐esophageal reflux symptoms between ≥ 2 and < 4 weeks of treatment., In total, 4325 patients were recruited of whom 3925 received active treatment. The network plot is provided in Figure S1. Pooled analysis revealed no statistical heterogeneity (I 2 = 0.0%). Omeprazole 20 mg o.d. esomeprazole 20 mg o.d. and 40 mg o.d. 20 mL of alginate t.i.d. famotidine 20 mg o.d. omeprazole 10 mg o.d. cimetidine 200 mg q.i.d. rabeprazole 10 mg o.d. and tegoprazan 100 mg o.d. were all significantly more efficacious than placebo, but omeprazole 20 mg o.d. (RR of failure to achieve complete relief of gastro‐esophageal reflux symptoms = 0.43; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.56, P ‐score 0.94) ranked first. This means the probability of omeprazole 20 mg o.d. being the most efficacious when all treatments, including placebo, were compared with each other was 94%. However, esomeprazole 20 mg o.d. (RR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.58, P ‐score 0.91), and 40 mg o.d. (RR = 0.45; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.60, P ‐score 0.81) performed similarly and were ranked second and third, respectively (Figure 2A). Famotidine 40 mg o.d. rabeprazole 5 mg o.d. and tegoprazan 50 mg o.d. were all no more efficacious than placebo. After indirect comparison of active treatments, omeprazole 20 mg o.d. esomeprazole 20 mg or 40 mg o.d. and 20 mL of alginate t.i.d. were superior to all other active treatments except famotidine 20 mg o.d. which was superior to tegoprazan 100 mg o.d. famotidine 40 mg o.d. rabeprazole 5 mg o.d. and tegoprazan 50 mg o.d.

GERD management — there is conceptual rationale for a trial of switching proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for patients who have not responded to one PPI, but more than one switch cannot be supported. Use of the lowest effective dose is recommended and logical but must be individualized. Abrupt PPI discontinuation may lead to potential rebound acid hypersecretion and increased reflux symptoms, yet strong evidence for an increase in symptoms after abrupt PPI withdrawal is lacking.

### Famotidine [^ff1b887e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Famotidine is a competitive inhibitor of histamine-2 (H2) receptors. The primary clinically important pharmacologic activity of famotidine is inhibition of gastric secretion. Both the acid concentration and volume of gastric secretion are suppressed by famotidine, while changes in pepsin secretion are proportional to volume output.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Adults

Famotidine inhibited both basal and nocturnal gastric secretion, as well as secretion stimulated by food and pentagastrin. After oral administration of Famotidine, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurred within one hour; the maximum effect was dose-dependent, occurring within one to three hours. Duration of inhibition of secretion by doses of 20 mg and 40 mg was 10 to 12 hours.

Single evening oral doses of 20 mg and 40 mg inhibited basal and nocturnal acid secretion in all subjects; mean nocturnal gastric acid secretion was inhibited by 86% and 94%, respectively, for a period of at least 10 hours. The same doses given in the morning suppressed food-stimulated acid secretion in all subjects. The mean suppression was 76% and 84%, respectively, 3 to 5 hours after administration, and 25% and 30%, respectively, 8 to 10 hours after administration. In some subjects who received the 20 mg dose, however, the antisecretory effect was dissipated within 6 to 8 hours. There was no cumulative effect with repeated doses. The nocturnal intragastric pH was raised by evening doses of 20 mg and 40 mg of Famotidine tablets to mean values of 5.0 and 6.4, respectively. When Famotidine was given after breakfast, the basal daytime interdigestive pH at 3 and 8 hours after 20 mg or 40 mg of Famotidine tablets was raised to about 5.

4.4 Failure to achieve adequate relief of gastro‐esophageal reflux symptoms at ≥ 4 weeks of treatment

Twelve RCTs reported data concerning efficacy of all the interventions of interest in terms of failure to achieve adequate relief of gastro‐esophageal reflux symptoms at ≥ 4 weeks of treatment., In total, 5793 patients were recruited of whom 4898 received active treatment. The network plot is provided in Figure S4A. Pooled analysis revealed moderate levels of statistical heterogeneity (I 2 = 67.2%). There was no evidence of funnel plot asymmetry, suggesting publication bias, or other small study effects (Figure S4B). Dexlansoprazole 60 mg o.d. ranked first (RR of failure to achieve adequate relief of gastro‐esophageal reflux symptoms = 0.45; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.70, P ‐score 0.90), dexlansoprazole 30 mg o.d. second (RR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.81, P ‐score 0.77), and rabeprazole 20 mg o.d. third (RR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.87, P ‐score 0.62) (Figure 5A). Rabeprazole 10 mg o.d. and omeprazole 20 mg o.d. were also significantly more efficacious than placebo. 30 mL of alginate q.i.d. in combination with omeprazole 20 mg o.d. famotidine 20 mg o.d. 20 mL of alginate t.i.d. esomeprazole 40 mg or 20 mg o.d. rabeprazole 5 mg o.d. and omeprazole 10 mg o.d. were all no more efficacious than placebo. After indirect comparison of active treatments, dexlansoprazole 60 mg o.d. was superior to omeprazole 10 mg o.d. and esomeprazole 20 mg o.d. but there were no other significant differences (Figure 5B).

### AGA clinical practice update on the personalized approach to the evaluation and management of GERD: expert review [^8522ee2b]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trial — best practice advice, clinicians should provide patients presenting with troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain without alarm symptoms a 4- to 8-week trial of single-dose PPI therapy (BPA 4). Patients should be counseled to take the PPI 30 to 60 minutes prior to a meal. Education on literature emphasizing safety of PPIs for the treatment of GERD should be provided (BPA 3). Patient symptoms should be reassessed after a 4- to 8-week trial. With inadequate response, dosing can be increased to twice a day or switched to a more effective acid suppressive agent once a day (BPA 4). These can include PPIs that are more potent, less metabolized through the CYP2C19 pathway (eg, rabeprazole, esomeprazole), or available in an extended release formulation (eg, dexlansoprazole), as well as potassium competitive acid blockers when available. Routine re-evaluation of the treatment should be performed, and the PPI should be tapered to the lowest effective dose when there is adequate response (BPA 4) (Figure 1).

### Editorial: just how "difficult" is it to withdraw PPI treatment? [^d366aa57]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Two recent studies-one of which is published in this edition of the American Journal of Gastroenterology-have reported that new dyspeptic or reflux symptoms may develop among previously asymptomatic individuals after withdrawal of a short course of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It has been suggested that this is attributable to rebound gastric acid hypersecretion, and that the same phenomenon explains why some patients become chronic PPI users and physicians experience "difficulty" in withdrawing PPI treatment from patients. Although we congratulate the authors of both studies for their controlled observations, we question the generalizability of these observations and hypotheses to the clinical domain. PPI treatment continues to be the optimal management strategy for most patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and is indicated for chronic use as ulcer prophylaxis in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug takers at high risk for bleeding. However, as with all drugs, PPIs should be dosed appropriately, and should be reserved for patients with conditions for which there is clear evidence of benefit from therapy.

### Comparative effectiveness of famotidine in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [^c28a4cdb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Famotidine has been posited as a potential treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We compared the incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death and death or intensive services use) among hospitalized famotidine users vs proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users, hydroxychloroquine users, or famotidine nonusers separately.

Methods

We constructed a retrospective cohort study using data from COVID-19 Premier Hospital electronic health records. The study population was COVID-19 hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older. Famotidine, PPI, and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any medication containing 1 of the 3 drugs on the day of admission. The famotidine nonuser group was derived from the same source population with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine as an active ingredient before or on the day of admission. Time at risk was defined based on the intention-to-treat principle starting 1 day after admission to 30 days after admission. For each study comparison group, we fit a propensity score model through large-scale regularized logistic regression. The outcome was modeled using a survival model.

Results

We identified 2,193 users of PPI, 5,950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1,816 users of famotidine, and 26,820 nonfamotidine users. After propensity score stratification, the hazard ratios (HRs) for death were as follows: famotidine vs no famotidine HR 1.03 (0.89–1.18), vs PPIs: HR 1.14 (0.94–1.39), and vs hydroxychloroquine: 1.03 (0.85–1.24). Similar results were observed for the risk of death or intensive services use.

Discussion

We found no evidence of a reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who used famotidine compared with those who did not or compared with PPI or hydroxychloroquine users.

### Pharmacodynamics between a dual delayed-release formulation of low-dose esomeprazole and famotidine in healthy Korean subjects [^eb2f1db3]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Gastritis, one of the most common clinically diagnosed conditions, is defined as the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the gastric mucosa. Drugs for gastritis include histamine-2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which reduce acidity in the stomach, and antacids, which neutralize acid. Esomeprazole is a PPI for gastroesophageal reflux disease and gastric and duodenal ulcers that has been shown to be safe and effective at a 10 mg dose. Dual-release drugs have not yet been approved for the treatment of gastritis domestically or internationally. In this study, a dual delayed-release (DR) esomeprazole (10 mg), was compared to famotidine (20 mg) to determine its effectiveness in the treatment of gastritis.

Methods

This study was a randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover study with a 7-day washout between periods. In each period, the subjects were administered one dose of esomeprazole (10 mg) or famotidine (20 mg) for 7 days at each period. The 24-hour gastric pH was recorded after single and multiple doses. The percentage of time (duration%) that the pH was maintained above 4 in the 24 hours after 7 days of repeated dosing was evaluated.

Findings

The mean percentages of time that the gastric pH was above 4 after multiple doses over 7 days of a dual DR esomeprazole (10 mg) and famotidine (20 mg) was 47.31% ± 14.85% and 23.88% ± 10.73%.

Implications

Multiple doses of a dual DR esomeprazole (10 mg) showed effective gastric acid secretion suppression compared to famotidine with comparable safety and tolerability. These results provide evidence supporting the clinical use of a dual DR esomeprazole (10 mg) to treat gastritis.

### Symptomatic reflux disease: the present, the past and the future [^2890690f]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Reduction of gastric acidity

Although the pathogenesis of GORD is multifactorial, with the exception of extremely rare diseases associated with acid hypersecretion (eg, Zollinger–Ellison syndrome) the level of acid secretion in GORD patients is similar to that in asymptomatic controls. Nevertheless, the most widely practised management strategy for symptomatic GORD is reducing gastric acidity. Within that spectrum, antacids are mostly used for mild symptoms; their onset of action is rapid, but their effect short lived. Alternatively, histamine-2 receptor antagonists can be used for on-demand symptomatic treatment. However, in patients with moderate to severe symptoms, PPIs have become first-line therapy. In general, the differences between available PPIs (esomeprazole, dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole) are small. However, patients with an insufficient therapeutic response to the standard dose of one PPI may benefit from one of the other PPIs, an increased dose of the same PPI, or a twice-a-day PPI regimen. The addition of a H2 blocker at bedtime to twice-daily PPI therapy also provides enhanced inhibition of nocturnal acid secretion, but this effect has not been shown clinically relevant and is subject to tachyphylaxis within a few weeks.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^dd947030]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Since some drug classes (e.g. NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers, corticosteroids, ACE inhibitors, and methylxanthines) can induce dyspeptic symptoms, a careful evaluation of the current drug therapy is of paramount importance: dyspeptogenic medications should be withdrawn whenever possible. In patients with NSAID-associated dyspepsia, PPIs are effective and should be given also with the aim of preventing adverse GI events (see below).

The role of H. pylori in FD is supported by data from meta-analyses showing that H. pylori eradication resulted in a statistically significant benefit compared with placebo (relative risk of remaining dyspeptic 0.90; NNT = 13). However, short-term benefit is often not evident since symptom relief becomes significant only some (up to 6) months after successful cure of the infection. Furthermore, PPIs represent a key component of all the commonly used eradication regimens (triple, quadruple, sequential, concomitant or hybrid therapies).

It has been estimated that the H. pylori "test and treat" strategy is cost-effective in those regions where prevalence of the infection is > 20%, as in Italy, and that the advantage persists at long-term follow-up. Unfortunately, no predictive factors for clinical benefit have been identified, so that eradication treatments should be attempted in all dyspeptic patients. H. pylori should be investigated with either non-invasive tests or upper endoscopy, according to the age of the patient and the presence of alarm symptoms.

In patients with dyspeptic symptoms persisting despite successful eradication or naïve uninfected patients with EPS, PPI therapy can be attempted, an approach achieving a success rate of 34% (NNT = 10, 95% confidence interval, 7–33). PPIs are particularly effective when overlapping reflux symptoms are present, while no significant benefit occurs in dyspeptic patients with PDS. It is worth emphasizing that the effect of PPIs in FD occurs at standard doses and, since meta-analyses found no dose-response effect, escalating the dose in non-responders to standard doses should not be considered. If breakthrough symptoms occur, antacids or alginate-containing formulations may be used. Differentely from GERD, a long-term therapy with PPIs in FD is not indicated. After successful treatment, a tapering strategy rather than abrupt discontinuation is preferred. Although symptoms may recur in nearly 70% of patients within 1-year follow-up, re-starting treatment only in these patients is more advantageous than a continuous and expensive treatment, prescribed in all cases.

### Are proton pump inhibitors the first choice for acute treatment of gastric ulcers? A meta analysis of randomized clinical trials [^13c7d5d9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Gastric ulcers are a frequent problem in the United States. Proton pump inhibitors have been shown to increase healing rates and improve clinical symptoms. The objective of this study is to compare gastric ulcer healing rates for patients treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, or lansoprazole), an histamine 2- receptor antagonist (ranitidine) or placebo.

Methods

A literature search was conducted to identify randomized, controlled clinical trials that included a PPI in at least one treatment arm and assessed the gastric ulcer healing rates endoscopically. The healing rates were estimated for each treatment at specific time points, and Rate Ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for each trial.

Results

Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria: four compared a PPI versus placebo, nine compared a PPI versus ranitidine (no trials of rabeprazole versus ranitidine met the inclusion criteria), and three compared a newer PPI (lansoprazole, pantoprazole or rabeprazole) versus omeprazole. In relation to ranitidine, the pooled RR of PPIs (lansoprazole, omeprazole and pantoprazole) was 1.33 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.42) at four weeks. In each trial, greater improvement in the studied clinical symptoms was found with the newer PPIs (rabeprazole, pantoprazole and lansoprazole) when compared to omeprazole.

Conclusion

In this study treatment with PPIs resulted in higher healing rates than ranitidine or placebo. This evidence suggests that the first choice for gastric ulcer treatment for the greater relief of symptoms is one of the newer PPIs.

Proton pump inhibitor dosing and potency — enteric-coated proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) control intragastric pH best when given before meals, specifically "30–60 minutes before breakfast for once-daily dosing and 30–60 minutes before breakfast and dinner for twice-daily dosing," and "Bedtime dosing is discouraged." Relative antisecretory potency differs across agents, with "pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole" estimated at "0.23, 0.9, 1.00, 1.60, and 1.82 OEs, respectively." For persistent symptoms, switching PPIs is reasonable, and in a randomized study of patients on lansoprazole 30 mg once daily, "double the dose of lansoprazole" vs "switch to esomeprazole 40 mg once daily" were "equally effective," with "approximately 55%" in each arm improving; an omeprazole–sodium bicarbonate bedtime formulation "provides good control of intragastric pH in the first 4 hours of sleep."

### What you need to know when you prescribe a proton pump inhibitor [^48d4c38a]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Ever since they were launched, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been regarded as profligate prescription interventions and have become a favourite target for pharmacy advisers. Now that they are cheap, with generic omeprazole 20 mg daily costing £1.88 per month (£24.51 per annum) in the UK, it is time to ask whether this status should be reviewed, whether there are areas where the message should be reversed and whether there are any circumstances in which the extra cost of branded PPIs or combined preparations is justified. Equally, with the recognition of an extended toxicity profile, is prescribing profligacy not an economic but a safety issue?

### WITHDRAWN: pharmacological interventions for non-ulcer dyspepsia [^855bc161]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The commonest cause of upper gastrointestinal symptoms is non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) and yet the pathophysiology of this condition has been poorly characterised and the optimum treatment is uncertain. It is estimated that £450 million is spent on dyspepsia drugs in the UK each year.

Objectives

This review aims to determine the effectiveness of six classes of drugs (antacids, histamine H2 antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, prokinetics, mucosal protecting agents and antimuscarinics) in the improvement of either the individual or global dyspepsia symptom scores and also quality of life scores patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006), EMBASE (1988 to January 2006), CINAHL (1982 to January 2006), SIGLE, and reference lists of articles. We also contacted experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies. Trials were located through electronic searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and SIGLE, using appropriate subject headings and text words, searching bibliographies of retrieved articles, and through contacts with experts in the fields of dyspepsia and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing drugs of any of the six groups with each other or with placebo for non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 73 trials: prokinetics (19 trials with dichotomous outcomes evaluating 3178 participants; relative risk reduction (RRR) 33%; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 18% to 45%), H(2)RAs (12 trials evaluating 2,183 participants; RRR 23%; 95% CI 8% to 35%) and PPIs (10 trials evaluating 3,347 participants; RRR 13%; 95% CI 4% to 20%) were significantly more effective than placebo. Bismuth salts (six trials evaluating 311 participants; RRR 40%; 95% CI -3 to 65%) were superior to placebo but this was of marginal statistical significance. Antacids (one trial evaluating 109 participants; RRR -2%; 95% CI -36% to 24%) and sucralfate (two trials evaluating 246 participants; RRR 29%; 95% CI -40% to 64%) were not statistically significantly superior to placebo. A funnel plot suggested that the prokinetic results could be due to publication bias or other small study effects.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that anti-secretory therapy may be effective in NUD. The trials evaluating prokinetic therapy are difficult to interpret as the meta-analysis result could have been due to publication bias. The effect of these drugs is likely to be small and many patients will need to take them on a long-term basis so economic analyses would be helpful and ideally the therapies assessed need to be inexpensive and well tolerated.

GERD — empirical therapy and dosing notes that the current consensus is that empirical therapy is appropriate initial management for patients with uncomplicated heartburn. There is ample evidence that, as a drug class, PPIs are more effective than placebo; however, the data supporting the use of PPIs (or H2RAs) in doses higher than the standard are weak, and there is no evidence of improved efficacy by adding a nocturnal dose of an H2RA to twice-daily PPI therapy. Almost all efficacy data on these medications are from once-daily dosing studies, yet expert opinion is essentially unanimous in recommending twice-daily dosing of PPIs to improve symptom relief in patients with an esophageal GERD syndrome with an unsatisfactory response to once-daily dosing. Patients whose heartburn has not adequately responded to twice-daily PPI therapy should be considered treatment failures, making that a reasonable upper limit for empirical therapy.

Fig. 2
Some drugs used to modulate gastric acid secretion and their times of introduction (earliest papers listed in PubMed); some are no longer in use; the color coding corresponds to that in Fig. 1

The H + /K + -adenosine triphosphatase (the proton pump) in the apical surfaces of gastric parietal cells is the final common pathway for medicines with different mechanisms of action that alter gastric acid secretion. This observation led to the development of a range of substituted benzimidazoles that inhibit the pump, which have come to be known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), of which omeprazole was the first to be developed for clinical use. Recently, newer reversible PPI inhibitors, potassium-competitive acid blockers such as vonoprazan, have also become available.

### "Refractory GERD": acid, nonacid, or not GERD? [^e0d71c25]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition with 44% of Americans surveyed reporting heartburn at least once a month and 20% once a week (1, 2). However, despite major advances in our understanding of this disease, management of GERD is still a challenge. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are more effective than H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA) in the initial healing of erosive esophagitis, which provide symptom relief and maintenance (3). Due to its established efficacy and safety, PPI treatment is used as the initial "test" in diagnosing GERD in the absence of bleeding, anemia, weight loss, or dysphagia. A single dose of PPI provides adequate symptom relief in most patients; however, dose escalation to twice a day may be needed in some. Patients unresponsive to PPI therapy are often labeled as having "refractory GERD". However, this term is poorly defined and has a different meaning in different countries. More importantly, the cause of "refractory GERD" is poorly understood.

PPIs for GERD

Summary of the current evidence

PPIs represent the mainstay of medical treatment of esophageal manifestations of GERD; however, their benefits (if any) in extra-digestive GERD are still uncertain. Eight-week therapy with standard (once daily) dose PPIs can achieve healing of reflux esophagitis and symptom relief in more than 80% of patients with typical symptoms. When a functional investigation is added to a negative endoscopy in making the diagnosis, PPI efficacy in GERD and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) appears comparable. Being a chronic, relapsing disease, GERD (as well as NERD) requires long-term PPI treatment, which can be continuous, intermittent or on-demand. Profound and individually tailored maximal acid suppression is needed in patients with Barrett's esophagus not only to control gastroesophageal reflux (GER) but also in the hope to achieve a chemopreventive effect against neoplastic transformation.

GERD conclusion — For patients presenting with GERD symptoms, a stepwise diagnostic approach will identify mechanisms driving symptoms for a precision management approach. Patients should receive education on GERD pathophysiology and lifestyle modifications, and be involved in a shared decision-making model. A 4- to 8-week trial of single-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is considered safe and appropriate for patients with typical reflux symptoms and no alarm symptoms, with escalation to twice-a-day dosing or switching to a more potent acid suppressive agent if symptoms persist.

### Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of replacing lansoprazole with vonoprazan for treating erosive oesophagitis [^aeda426d]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

In the human digestive system, the oesophagus and the stomach are separated by the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS). This muscular structure serves a dual role: relaxation enables the passage of swallowed food into the stomach, while contraction prevents the backflow of acidic stomach contents into the oesophagus. When there is LOS dysfunction, abnormal backflow of stomach contents may occur, which is known as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). This can result in inflammation of the oesophageal mucosal lining, termed oesophagitis. This typically presents with symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgitation, causing discomfort.

When GORD is persistent, atypical or relapsing, a diagnostic procedure known as oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed. This examination helps in classifying GORD into (endoscopy-negative) non-erosive or (endoscopically determined) erosive oesophagitis. In non-erosive oesophagitis, the oesophageal mucosa appears normal, while erosive oesophagitis characteristically features breaks within an inflamed oesophageal mucosa. The Los Angeles (LA) Classification of oesophagitis further delineates erosive oesophagitis into grades A/B (mild) or grades C/D (severe).

Management of GORD can be separated into two phases: healing and maintenance. During healing, the aim is to repair the damaged oesophageal lining, while maintenance prevents relapse.

According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the gold-standard medical management for oesophagitis is the prescription of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). By blocking the H + /K + -ATPase pumps lining the cells in the stomach, PPIs prevent the production of hydrochloric acid, consequently relieving discomfort. To heal non-erosive and mild erosive oesophagitis, PPIs are taken for 4 or 8 weeks. To heal severe erosive oesophagitis, PPIs are taken for 8 weeks.

If a patient continues to experience symptoms after the initial healing phase, they will proceed to the maintenance phase, for which NICE recommends a PPI course at the lowest dose. If unsuccessful, the patient will be re-reviewed and switched to a higher dose or another PPI regime. Without further improvement, the patient will be advised to seek specialist advice. Treatment is deemed successful when a patient is asymptomatic; OGDs are not routinely performed to assess a patient's remission.

### Use of proton pump inhibitors to treat persistent throat symptoms: multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial [^c905f65c]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Unanswered questions and future research

Exploring alternative strategies to manage persistent throat symptoms requires well designed clinical trials, but these will only be possible when the practice of prescribing PPIs for these symptoms is discouraged. In our trial we found symptoms improved equally over time between PPIs and placebo, but patients' symptoms did not reduce to those of the general population. Hence a clear need exists to investigate more effective treatment strategies. Our results might support the renewed focus of research into the well established psychological concomitant throat symptoms in some patients — namely, anxiety, distress, depression, and coexisting persistent physical symptoms. Strategies that employ the techniques of reattribution (offering alternative explanations for causes of the symptoms), adjustments to lifestyle, and behaviour modification of speech or cognitive behavioural therapyseem to be relevant and a reasonable focus of further research. For such a common condition as persistent throat symptoms, it would seem appropriate to investigate whether elements of specialist proven treatments such as cough suppression techniques, voice therapy, management of globus, and cognitive behavioural therapy could be adapted into a clinically and cost effective self-directed care package for patients.

Great clinical interest has been shown in attributing throat and upper airway symptoms to manifestations of GORD. Interest is growing in weakly acidic, or non-acidic, reflux, which would intuitively seem less likely to respond to PPIs yet contains the other important elements of gastric contents. Little evidence exists for the role of other factors that might reduce reflux related persistent throat symptoms, such as diet, lifestyle, and alginates. Our trial does not refute reflux as a cause or contributing factor for some patients' symptoms, and although reflux of gastric contents containing pepsin might be implicated in some patients, defining such individuals and appropriate management needs further research. This requires clarification on the use and interpretation of specialist investigations to identify reflux episodes and response to treatments.

Policy implications

No evidence supports the empirical use of PPIs to treat persistent throat and voice symptoms. The lack of any trend towards benefit with lansoprazole in our trial should discourage subgroup analysis hypotheses. The trial's conclusions are particularly apt for the non-specialist to whom the message has filtered through from otolaryngology case series evidence that PPIs are appropriate for this patient population. Our results also might be explained by an underestimation of the placebo effect in this group of patients and the failure of PPIs to affect non-acidic, or weakly acidic, reflux episodes.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^7263376f]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

It is worth mentioning that currently available PPI regimens do not provide the same control of intragastric pH, evaluated both in terms of mean pH over the 24 hours and percentage of time spent at pH > 4. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in patients with GERD or taking NSAIDs. A large meta-analysis, including 57 studies measuring intragastric pH after different PPI regimens, found that the relative potencies of the five compounds, compared to omeprazole, were 0.23, 0.90, 1.60, and 1.82 for pantoprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole, respectively. This lack of pharmacodynamic equivalence should be taken into account when switching from a given PPI to another.

PPIs are effective in obtaining symptom relief in both erosive and non-erosive disease. Their efficacy for the relief of regurgitation is, however, modest and considerably lower than that achieved for heartburn. The myth that PPIs are less effective in NERD has recently been dispelled by a meta-analysis showing that, when a functional investigation (pH-metry or pH-impedance recording) is added to a negative endoscopy to objectively confirm this condition, the estimated complete symptom response rate after PPI therapy is comparable to that observed in patients with erosive disease.

### Alternative therapeutic approaches to chronic proton pump inhibitor treatment [^9b3cdc1c]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic consumption of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) by patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease is very common, primarily because of their potent and profound effect on acid secretion that results in an unsurpassed rate of symptom resolution and esophageal healing. However, there have been a growing number of reports over the past few years about various side effects caused by chronic PPI treatment. Concerns have been raised by patients and physicians alike about the common practice of prescribing PPIs, often more than once daily, on a long-term basis. As a result, there has been a resurgence of interest in alternative therapeutic modalities for chronic PPI treatment. These include novel endoscopic and surgical techniques, as well as other available therapeutic strategies that are likely to be revisited, such as histamine-2-receptor antagonists, intermittent and on-demand PPI treatment, and antireflux surgery, among others.

Recruited subjects were categorized into DAPT with clopidogrel or DAPT with prasugrel or ticagrelor group. The primary efficacy outcome of the study was major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), which was defined as composite of cardiovascular death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction (MI, including non‐ST‐elevation MI (NSTEMI) and ST‐elevation MI (STEMI)), and non‐fatal ischemic stroke. The secondary efficacy outcome was occurrence of each primary efficacy outcome and all‐cause mortality. The primary safety outcome was defined as occurrence of any bleeding leading to hospitalization, including gastrointestinal bleeding, cerebral bleeding, bleeding of joint, pericardial bleeding, hematuria, abnormal bleeding of female genital tract, hemoptysis, epistaxis and rupture of blood vessels.

Descriptive statistics were presented as counts (percentage) for qualitative variable and mean (SD) for quantitative variable unless otherwise specified. Comparison on qualitative variables was made between groups with Pearson's chi square test or Fisher's exact test if appropriate. Difference on quantitative variables between groups was compared with Student's t‐test. To address baseline difference of two groups, propensity score matching was used. Propensity score was calculated by logistic regression model with variables including sex, age, comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, arrhythmia, dyslipidemia, history of stroke, ischemic heart disease, history of ACS episode, anemia, history of bleeding event, status of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) during index hospitalization, use of fibrinolytics or glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors during index hospitalization, dispensing of oral anticoagulant (OAC, including warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban), histamine‐2 receptor antagonist (H2RA, including famotidine and ranitidine) or proton pump inhibitor (PPI, including pantoprazole, rabeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole and omeprazole) during index hospitalization discharge. Matching algorithm of 1‐to‐1 nearest neighbor method was adopted. Kaplan–Meier estimator was used to calculated time to event. Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate hazard ratio of outcome using prasugrel or ticagrelor over clopidogrel, with adjustment of duration of DAPT and duration of concurrent use of OAC, H2RA or PPI. To check the proportional hazard assumption of models, Schoenfeld residuals were inspected to ensure insignificance between residuals and time. All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.5.3).

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^c3f21980]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

PPI-related adverse events involve the GI tract as well as other organs and systems. The majority of these events have been summarized in comprehensive reviews, to which the reader is referred. The potential risks of long-term PPI therapy, along with the respective evidence summary, are outlined in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 1
Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Digestive System

Table 2
Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Extra-digestive effects

Gastric pH is relevant for the absorption of several drugs and its modification by antisecretory therapy may significantly modify their pharmacokinetics. PPIs also influence drug absorption and metabolism by interacting with adenosine triphosphate-dependent P-glycoprotein (e.g. inhibiting digoxin efflux) or with the CYP P450 enzyme system (e.g. decreasing simvastatin metabolism), thereby affecting both intestinal first-pass metabolism and hepatic clearance. A number of studies have shown that omeprazole (and, to a lesser extent, lansoprazole) carries a considerable potential for DDIs, since it has a high affinity for CYP2C19 and a somewhat lower affinity for CYP3A4. In contrast, pantoprazole and rabeprazole display a lower potential for DDIs. DDIs therefore represent a molecule-related effect rather than a class-effect.

These interactions are clinically relevant mostly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. diazepam, warfarin, antipsychotics, etc.). In addition, PPI metabolism is very rapid in most Caucasian subjects (extensive metabolizers), so that their half-life ranges from only 0.5 to 2.1 hours. Indeed, the prevalence of poor metabolizers, potentially at increased risk of drug interactions, is as low as 1.2–3.8% in Europe as compared to 23% in Asia. This could explain why only few of the reported DDIs involving PPIs have been shown to be of clinical significance.

Recent studies have raised concerns about a possible adverse interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs (currently prescribed to patients who are receiving dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent upper GI bleeding) that could reduce the antithrombotic effect of the former and, therefore, lessen protection against CV events in high-risk patients. However, current evidence shows that, while concomitant use of some PPIs with clopidogrel does attenuate the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel, this effect is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Conversely, denying PPIs to patients at GI risk would result in increased life-threatening GI bleeding.
