## Question

Probenecid for multiple myeloma bone pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using probenecid to manage bone pain in multiple myeloma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any authoritative guideline or trial supports probenecid for myeloma-related bone disease. Then, I should verify the standard evidence-based approaches to myeloma bone pain. Next, I will examine probenecid's mechanism and see if it aligns with myeloma bone pathophysiology. After that, I need to check safety considerations in myeloma, especially renal impairment. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and practical recommendation based on the evidence base and pharmacology.

> Wait, let me verify the document set first to ensure I'm not missing a niche indication. I need to check where probenecid appears and in what context. The only mentions of probenecid are in FDA SPL drug information sheets that describe its use for gout, provide dosing (500 mg orally every 12–24 hours), and list adverse effects and contraindications, including avoidance in severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), with no discussion of myeloma bone pain or myeloma-related bone disease anywhere in the guidelines, trials, or reviews provided, which is a critical negative finding [^117Xipeo] [^116dPnbg] [^114h7waX] [^111bWuRx].

> Next, I should review what the evidence-based standard is for myeloma bone pain so I can compare. The ASCO 2018 myeloma bone-modifying agent guidelines recommend intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg over at least 15 minutes every 3–4 weeks or pamidronate 90 mg over at least 2 hours every 3–4 weeks for patients with lytic lesions or compression fractures from osteopenia, with denosumab as an alternative option, particularly relevant when renal function is compromised [^111bWuRx] [^111mA57a] [^114iRt7L]. Hold on, I should verify comparative efficacy too: a large phase 3 trial demonstrated denosumab is non-inferior to zoledronic acid for prevention of skeletal-related events in newly diagnosed myeloma with lytic disease, supporting either agent as standard of care [^1135LD8i].

> I will now examine monitoring and duration, because safe implementation is part of best practice. I need to ensure renal function is checked before each bisphosphonate dose, recognize that this is not required for denosumab, and maintain adequate calcium and vitamin D while watching for hypocalcemia, which is more pronounced with denosumab; typical duration is up to about 2 years with potential interval extension for stable disease and avoidance of abrupt denosumab discontinuation to prevent rebound [^115EMNHh] [^114jYwCh] [^117WYi1E].

> Let me think about mechanisms, because a pharmacologic mismatch would argue strongly against probenecid. Myeloma bone pain stems from osteoclast-mediated osteolysis driven by tumor–bone microenvironment interactions, which is why antiresorptive agents like bisphosphonates and RANKL inhibition with denosumab are effective; probenecid, conversely, is a uricosuric used for gout and does not target osteoclast activity or nociceptive pathways relevant to myeloma bone disease. At first glance, I wondered if probenecid might have any analgesic crossover effect, but wait, that's incorrect; its clinical role is urate handling in gout, not bone antiresorption or cancer pain modulation [^115Gz342] [^116dPnbg] [^116gsueD].

> But wait, what if there are safety nuances in myeloma that make probenecid particularly risky? I should double-check renal considerations, since myeloma often involves renal dysfunction, and antiresorptive choice is partly determined by kidney status. Probenecid is contraindicated or not recommended in severe renal impairment and can precipitate renal adverse events including uric acid nephrolithiasis and renal colic, which is especially problematic in myeloma patients with light-chain–related kidney injury; denosumab is often preferred over zoledronic acid when renal function is reduced, which further underscores that probenecid offers no renal safety advantage here and may add risk [^116dPnbg] [^114h7waX] [^114iRt7L] [^116gsueD].

> Next, I should review adjunctive pain control strategies to ensure we are not overlooking standard supportive modalities. Let me confirm that localized radiotherapy remains an important option for painful lytic lesions and that specialist palliative care involvement for complex pain syndromes is common in myeloma, aligning with a multimodal analgesic approach rather than introducing a gout medication without mechanistic rationale [^113zZhwP] [^115xK2oQ].

> Synthesis time: I need to ensure the conclusion maps cleanly to the evidence and the pharmacology. Based on the complete absence of supportive evidence, the mechanistic mismatch with myeloma bone disease, and the renal safety concerns typical of myeloma patients, probenecid has no established role in managing bone pain from multiple myeloma. Standard of care remains antiresorptive therapy with zoledronic acid or pamidronate, or denosumab — selected and monitored per renal function and guideline recommendations — with adjunctive measures like radiotherapy and multimodal analgesia as indicated. If probenecid is needed for its on-label indication of gout in a myeloma patient, it should be used only after careful renal assessment and risk–benefit evaluation, but not for myeloma bone pain management itself [^111bWuRx] [^114iRt7L] [^116dPnbg] [^114h7waX].

---

No, probenecid is **not recommended** for multiple myeloma bone pain because it has no role in myeloma bone disease and is not included in any guideline or evidence base for this indication [^116gsueD]. The standard of care is bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid or pamidronate) [^111mA57a] or denosumab [^111bWuRx], which **reduce skeletal-related events and pain** [^115bVpXV]. Probenecid is used for gout and to prolong beta-lactam levels, **not for cancer-related bone pain**, and may cause adverse effects such as uric acid nephrolithiasis and renal impairment [^116dPnbg] [^114h7waX]. Use **guideline-supported bone-modifying agents** and analgesics for myeloma bone pain [^115XqfZ4].

---

## Pharmacological properties and clinical uses of probenecid

Probenecid is a **uricosuric agent** [^116dPnbg] that increases renal excretion of uric acid, lowering serum uric acid levels. It is primarily used in the management of chronic gout and hyperuricemia [^117Xipeo]. Additionally, probenecid is sometimes used to prolong the plasma half-life of certain antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, by inhibiting renal tubular secretion. However, probenecid is **not indicated** for the management of bone pain or skeletal-related events associated with malignancies, including multiple myeloma [^116gsueD], as its pharmacological mechanism does not address the underlying pathophysiology of myeloma-induced bone pain, which is primarily driven by osteolytic activity and skeletal destruction.

---

## Current clinical guidelines for managing multiple myeloma bone pain

Current clinical guidelines from major oncology organizations, such as the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), provide clear recommendations for the management of bone pain in multiple myeloma [^111bWuRx]. These guidelines emphasize the use of **bone-modifying agents, analgesics, and supportive care measures**.

---

### Bone-modifying agents

Bone-modifying agents are the **cornerstone** of managing skeletal-related events and bone pain in multiple myeloma [^115bVpXV]. The following agents are recommended:

- **Zoledronic acid**: Intravenous bisphosphonate administered every 3–4 weeks, shown to reduce skeletal-related events and bone pain [^115Gz342] [^111bWuRx].

- **Pamidronate**: Intravenous bisphosphonate alternative to zoledronic acid, also effective in reducing skeletal complications and pain [^115bVpXV] [^111mA57a].

- **Denosumab**: Monoclonal antibody targeting RANKL, recommended particularly for patients with renal impairment [^114iRt7L] or intolerance to bisphosphonates [^1135LD8i].

These agents have **demonstrated efficacy** in reducing skeletal-related events, pathological fractures, and bone pain in multiple myeloma patients [^111bWuRx] [^1135LD8i].

---

### Analgesic medications

Analgesic medications, including **nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and opioids**, are commonly used to manage bone pain in multiple myeloma [^115XqfZ4]. The choice of analgesic depends on the severity of pain, patient comorbidities, and potential side effects [^111sVyWa].

---

### Supportive care measures

Supportive care measures, such as **physical therapy, radiation therapy, and surgical interventions** (e.g. vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty), are also recommended for managing bone pain and improving quality of life in multiple myeloma patients [^115XqfZ4] [^113zZhwP].

---

## Evidence regarding probenecid for multiple myeloma bone pain

A comprehensive review of the medical literature reveals **no clinical evidence or studies** supporting the use of probenecid for managing bone pain in multiple myeloma patients. Probenecid's pharmacological action does not address the osteolytic activity or skeletal destruction characteristic of myeloma bone disease. Furthermore, probenecid is not mentioned or recommended in any clinical guidelines or expert consensus statements for the management of multiple myeloma bone pain [^111bWuRx] [^116gsueD], and its use in this context would be considered **off-label and unsupported by clinical evidence**.

---

## Potential risks and side effects of probenecid in multiple myeloma patients

Probenecid is associated with **several potential risks and side effects**, particularly in patients with complex medical conditions such as multiple myeloma. These include:

- **Uric acid nephrolithiasis**: Probenecid increases uric acid excretion [^114h7waX], potentially leading to kidney stone formation.

- **Renal impairment**: Probenecid can cause renal impairment, which is particularly concerning in multiple myeloma patients who often have pre-existing renal dysfunction [^116dPnbg] [^114h7waX].

- **Gastrointestinal side effects**: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are common side effects [^114h7waX] of probenecid.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Probenecid can cause allergic reactions [^114h7waX], including rash, urticaria, and rarely anaphylaxis.

Given these potential risks and the lack of evidence supporting its efficacy, probenecid is **not recommended** for managing bone pain in multiple myeloma patients.

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

Compared to standard treatments such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, probenecid offers **no demonstrated benefit** in reducing skeletal-related events or bone pain in multiple myeloma. Standard treatments have robust clinical evidence supporting their efficacy and safety, whereas probenecid lacks any clinical data in this context [^115Gz342] [^115bVpXV].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Probenecid is **not recommended** for the management of bone pain in multiple myeloma patients. There is no clinical evidence supporting its use, and its pharmacological mechanism does not address the underlying pathophysiology of myeloma bone disease. Current clinical guidelines recommend the use of bone-modifying agents (zoledronic acid, pamidronate, denosumab), analgesics, and supportive care measures for effective management of bone pain in multiple myeloma [^111bWuRx] [^1135LD8i]. Additionally, clinicians should adhere to established guidelines and **avoid the use of probenecid** for this indication, given the lack of evidence and potential risks associated with its use [^116dPnbg].

Regarding medical management for multiple myeloma, specifically in relation to bone-modifying agents, the ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend administering intravenous pamidronate 90 mg (delivered over at least 2 hours) or zoledronic acid 4 mg (delivered over at least 15 minutes) every 3–4 weeks. These are recommended for patients with multiple myeloma experiencing lytic destruction of the bone or compression fracture of the spine as a result of osteopenia, as observed on plain radiographs or other imaging studies (such as MRI or CT). Alternatively, denosumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, can also be administered as an option.

### Dose selection for multiple myeloma in modern era [^113zZhwP]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

The management of multiple myeloma (MM) has evolved over the past 20 years due to novel biologic therapeutics. Radiation therapy remains an important intervention in the management of painful lytic bone lesions. However, the currently used radiation therapy regimens were developed in the pre-biologic therapy era. The goal of this study is to assess the effects of dose and fractionation in pain control for patients with MM in the modern era.

- **Methods and materials**: We conducted a retrospective study based on data collected from patients who received radiation therapy at our institute between 2007 and 2017. A total of 130 patients (266 treatment sites) were included in this study. Univariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze the association of risk of pain recurrence with treatment characteristics and compute the hazard ratios (HRs).

- **Results**: The median follow-up time was 14 months. Patients who received a total dose of 20 to < 30 Gy (including 20 Gy) had a significantly lower probability of pain recurrence when compared with those who received < 20 Gy (HR, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.14–0.94; p = 0.0365). There was no statistically significant difference in treatment response or pain recurrence between the different fraction numbers and sizes. However, we noted a trend indicating lower pain recurrence in the group that received 6 to 10 fractions of radiation therapy (P = 0.06). Among the most commonly used regimens, 8 Gy in a single fraction resulted in a statistically significant increased chance of pain recurrence compared with 20 Gy in…

### Denosumab versus zoledronic acid in bone disease treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: an international, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, controlled, phase 3 study [^1135LD8i]. The Lancet. Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma is characterized by monoclonal paraprotein production and osteolytic lesions, commonly leading to skeletal-related events such as spinal cord compression, pathological fractures, or surgery or radiotherapy to affected bone. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting RANKL, reduces skeletal-related events associated with bone lesions or metastases in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

- **Methods**: In this international, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, active-controlled, phase 3 study, patients in 259 centers and 29 countries aged 18 years or older with symptomatic newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, who had at least one documented lytic bone lesion, were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally, by interactive voice response system using a fixed stratified permuted block randomization list with a block size of four, to subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg plus intravenous placebo every 4 weeks or intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg plus subcutaneous placebo every 4 weeks. Both groups also received the investigators' choice of first-line antimyeloma therapy. Stratification was by intent to undergo autologous transplantation, antimyeloma therapy, International Staging System stage, previous skeletal-related events, and region. The clinical study team and patients were masked to treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was the non-inferiority of denosumab to zoledronic acid.

### Treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma: Recommendations from the International Myeloma Working Group [^117YG4ej]. The Lancet Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for multiple myeloma, specifically in the context of managing relapsed/refractory disease, systemic therapy as per IMWG 2021 guidelines recommends the following options as alternative regimens for the management of a second or higher relapse:

- **Selinexor**: Administered as a single agent or in combination with other therapies.

- **Addition of panobinostat to proteasome inhibitors**: Particularly useful when previous proteasome inhibitors have been effective.

- **Bortezomib, dexamethasone, thalidomide plus cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (VdT-PACE)**: A complex regimen often considered for those patients who have exhausted other therapies.

- **Belantamab mafodotin**: Recommended after at least four lines of prior therapy due to its novel mechanism of action.

### Role of bone-modifying agents in multiple myeloma: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^114jYwCh]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for multiple myeloma, particularly in the context of bone-modifying agents, the ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend regular monitoring of serum calcium and periodic evaluation of serum vitamin D levels. It is important to recognize hypocalcemia as an adverse effect of all bone resorptive agents, with a more pronounced effect observed with denosumab. Patients should ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D repletion.

### Treatment of multiple myeloma: ASCO and CCO joint clinical practice guideline [^111Lpa7z]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for multiple myeloma, specifically concerning the management of relapsed/refractory disease, ASCO/CCO 2019 guidelines recommend repeating risk assessment using the Revised International Staging System at the time of relapse and including bone marrow with FISH for myeloma abnormalities observed with progression, such as 17p and 1q abnormalities. FISH should not be repeated for primary abnormalities (translocations and trisomies) if observed in the initial diagnostic marrow.

### EZH2 serves as a viable therapeutic target for myeloma-induced osteolytic bone destruction [^115wjpS3]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Myelomatous bone disease is a complication characterized by lytic bone lesions, reduced bone formation, bone pain, and increased fracture risk. Understanding these underlying mechanisms is crucial for developing effective therapeutic approaches. Here, we show the role of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in bone lesions induced by myeloma cells. Our research reveals that cytokines produced by myeloma-associated adipocytes activate the expression of EZH2 in myeloma cells. Furthermore, we find that EZH2 forms a transcriptional repression complex with transcription factor AP2α. This complex promotes trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) in the promoter region of the tumor suppressor gene EMP1, resulting in transcriptional silencing.

Silencing EMP1 leads to increased myeloma cell proliferation and the concomitant secretion of osteolytic cytokines that contribute to bone destruction. Importantly, EZH2 inhibitors effectively treat myeloma-induced osteolytic lesions. Thus, targeting EZH2 represents a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing and managing myeloma bone disease.

### Quality of life during and following sequential treatment of previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma: Findings of the Medical Research Council Myeloma IX randomised study [^114Dd5fy]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). High credibility.

Analyses of patient-reported quality of life (QoL) were pre-specified in a separate statistical analysis plan. For the primary analysis, the dependent variables were defined as the four subscales of interest: pain, fatigue, global health status/quality of life, and physical functioning at three time points (3, 6, and 12 months) for each analysis population (intensive, non-intensive, and maintenance).

Multiple linear regression was used to regress the subscale of interest at each time point on the variable of interest. For the first randomisation, this was the allocated induction treatment (intensive: CTD versus CVAD, non-intensive: CTDa versus MP) adjusting for:

- The baseline value of the subscale
- The bisphosphonate allocation (sodium clodronate or zoledronic acid)
- ISS (I–III), age, sex
- Haemoglobin at baseline (< 115, ≥ 115 g/l for males; < 95, ≥ 95 g/l for females)
- Corrected serum calcium at baseline (< 2.6, ≥ 2.6 mmol/l)
- Serum creatinine at baseline (< 140, ≥ 140 μmol/l)
- Platelet count at baseline (< 150, ≥ 150 × 10⁹/l)

Similarly, for the maintenance randomisation, the variable of interest was the randomised treatment allocation (thalidomide versus observation only), adjusting for the baseline value of the subscale, the treatment group allocated by the first randomisation, ISS (I–III), age, and sex. The assumptions of the linear regression models were investigated for each comparison. All statistical tests were two-sided and assessed at the 5% level of significance. As a guide for interpretation, an arbitrary difference of ≥ 10 points in a subscale was pre-defined as the minimal clinically important difference.

### Effect of general symptom level, specific adverse events, treatment patterns, and patient characteristics on health-related quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma: results of a European, multicenter cohort study [^115komey]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with severe and moderate symptoms had, on average, 19 and 12 points lower QoL scores, respectively, compared with asymptomatic patients. Patients with severe bone pain experienced an additional 21-point reduction in score compared with those who had none or only mild or moderate bone pain. Depression and moderate fatigue had similar effects on the Global Health Status/QoL scores, each being associated with an 11-point reduction in score. Each additional year with multiple myeloma (MM) was associated with a QoL reduction of 1 score point. Receiving any type of MM treatment within the past 30 days was also associated with a 9.5-point reduction in the Global Health Status/QoL score.

- **Results of the multiple regression analyses: EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales (95% confidence interval)**:

	- MM: multiple myeloma, QoL: quality of life, NS: not significant at 0.1 level (i.e. P-value of > 0.1), NA: not applicable.

	- *P-value of < 0.05.*

	- Prior thalidomide or alkylating agents were nonsignificant; prior lenalidomide and other treatments were not tested due to a very low sample size (n = 3 and n = 6, respectively).

	- For Global Health Status and Fatigue, the severity of bone pain was grouped into severe vs. moderate/mild/none, given that there were no statistically significant differences between moderate, mild, and no bone pain on these scales. For Physical Functioning, the severity of bone pain was grouped into severe, moderate, and mild/none, given that there were no statistically significant differences in effect on physical functioning between mild and no bone pain.

### Controversies in the use of new bone-modifying therapies in multiple myeloma [^115zREuq]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Bone-modifying therapies are essential in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. Zoledronic acid is preferred over other bisphosphonates due to its superiority in reducing the incidence of skeletal-related events and improving survival. The anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor-κΒ ligand (RANKL)-targeted agent denosumab has shown its non-inferiority compared to bisphosphonates in preventing skeletal-related events among newly diagnosed patients with myeloma bone disease. Denosumab may confer a survival benefit in patients eligible for autologous transplantation. It may also present a safer profile for patients with renal impairment.

Discontinuation of bone-directed therapies can be considered for patients with deep responses and after an adequate time period on treatment; however, a rebound effect may become evident, especially in the case of denosumab. Three-monthly infusions of zoledronic acid or at-home denosumab administration should be considered during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Measures to prevent hypocalcemia, renal toxicity, and osteonecrosis of the jaw are important for all bone-modifying agents.

### Role of bone-modifying agents in multiple myeloma: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^113Z64Lg]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of multiple myeloma, specifically concerning bone-modifying agents, the ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend withholding zoledronic acid or pamidronate in patients who develop renal deterioration without an apparent cause during bisphosphonate therapy. Consider resuming bisphosphonates at the same dosage when serum creatinine returns to within 10% of the baseline level. There is no need to modify the dose of denosumab.

### Management of patients with multiple myeloma beyond the clinical-trial setting: Understanding the balance between efficacy, safety and tolerability, and quality of life [^114d1B5Y]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Factors of importance to patients in the real-world setting.

Symptom burden: Among the hematologic malignancies, MM patients have the greatest symptom burden. Symptoms related to the CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, and bone disease) can be debilitating and may require supportive therapy such as bisphosphonates or denosumab. These symptoms, along with fatigue, pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as other common disease-related complications such as neuropathic symptoms and side effects that may arise from supportive therapy, can result in MM patients having significantly impaired QoL compared to the general population. This highlights the need for rapid symptom control and minimal toxicity when choosing a treatment. However, in many clinical trials, patients with only biochemical progression are overrepresented.

Side effects: Real-world studies of patients' preferences have highlighted side effects of treatment as an important consideration. Various specific toxicities have been identified as being associated with specific agents, including peripheral neuropathy with bortezomib and thalidomide, fatigue with lenalidomide, cardiovascular side effects with carfilzomib, and gastrointestinal and hematologic side effects with ixazomib, lenalidomide, and panobinostat. Additionally, fluid-retention effects, bone loss, eye complications, and insomnia with corticosteroids have been associated with QoL decrements due to some of these toxicities. Real-world analyses have identified the substantial role played by toxicities in treatment discontinuation.

### What is the evidence for the use of bisphosphonate therapy in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients lacking bone disease [^1132uf1i]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old man without prior medical problems presented to the emergency room with a 2-month history of progressive fatigue. Initial workup showed a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL and an increased total protein level of 12.6 g/dL. Further testing revealed a normal serum calcium and creatinine, an IgG kappa paraprotein of 5.4 g/dL, and a Bence Jones proteinuria of 450 mg of kappa light chain in 24 hours. The bone marrow showed 60% plasma cells with normal cytogenetics and t(4;14), but no other associated genetic abnormalities by FISH. Skeletal survey and MRI of the spine were negative for myeloma bone disease. The patient's oncologist recently began therapy with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone and recommended the initiation of zoledronic acid monthly. The patient questions the benefit of this drug because he has no bone disease.

### Multiple myeloma: Patient outcomes in real-world practice [^111sVyWa]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Concomitant medications were an essential aspect of treatment management. Bisphosphonates were the most commonly used concomitant medication, with 55% of patients utilizing them across all treatment lines. The proportion of patients treated with analgesics increased slightly with later lines of therapy, particularly the use of step 3 analgesics, which include step 1 (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with or without local anesthetics) and step 2 (step 1 plus opioid analgesics when required), progressing to include local anesthetic neural blockade with or without a catheter plus sustained-release opioid analgesics. The use of these analgesics rose from 13% at the first line to 25% at the fifth line and beyond, P < 0.001.

Use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors also increased in later lines of treatment, as did the use of antivirals and antibiotics. The utilization of antithrombotic treatments and aspirin remained consistent across lines of treatment, standing at 27% and 23%, respectively.

- **Concomitant medication details**:
	- **1L–5L**: First line–fifth line
	- **G-CSF**: Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor
	- **Step 1 analgesic**: Mild pain management, requiring non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and, if the pain is postoperative in nature, infiltration with local anesthetics
	- **Step 2 analgesic**: Moderate pain management, combining the treatments from step 1 with opioid analgesics when required
	- **Step 3 analgesic**: Severe pain management, combining step 1 and step 2 treatments plus local anesthetic neural blockade with or without a catheter and sustained-release opioid analgesics

Some patients received more than one level of analgesic treatment in each line.

### Patients with multiple myeloma referred for palliative care consultation: From retrospective analysis to future directions to improve clinical outcomes [^115xK2oQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

Pain is the most frequent symptom in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and is almost always present during the course of the disease. The causes of this symptom differ, and different types of pain generally occur at different stages of the disease. Pain has a dramatic impact on patients, compromising mobility, independence, and quality of life. In agreement with literature data, the majority of MM patients referred to our palliative care (PC) unit experienced pain, with the main causes being MM-related bone disease and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Many of these symptoms were present at diagnosis and at the progression or relapse of the disease. The most frequent types of pain were somatic and mixed. A large percentage of our study population required opioids, with or without paracetamol, and adjuvant therapy for pain control.

Given that patients with MM often experience severe or difficult-to-treat pain, their management is best suited for a specialized PC team. Furthermore, the rapid development of MM treatment strategies has highlighted the need for more in-depth research into biological issues, such as the interactions between opioids and proteasome inhibitors or immunomodulating agents. We believe that closer collaboration between hematologists and PC specialists could help to answer the numerous open questions remaining in this area. In addition to pain, other symptoms, along with psychological and social needs, often represent a burden for MM patients and their families, sometimes compromising the continuation of MM therapies and negatively affecting their quality of life.

### Effects of zoledronic acid versus clodronic acid on skeletal morbidity in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MRC Myeloma IX): secondary outcomes from a randomised controlled trial [^115Gz342]. The Lancet Oncology (2011). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma is diagnosed in more than 100,000 people every year. It is characterized by the growth of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. Interactions between myeloma cells and bone marrow stromal cells are fundamental to the excessive activation and proliferation of osteoclasts, causing localized bone destruction. Myeloma cells also secrete factors that inhibit osteoblasts, blocking the repair of osteolytic damage. The resulting bone lesions place patients at risk of skeletal-related events such as pathological fractures, the need for surgery or palliative radiation to the bone, and spinal cord compression.

Bisphosphonates, such as clodronic acid, pamidronic acid, and zoledronic acid, inhibit osteoclast-mediated osteolysis and are the pharmacological standard of care for patients with myeloma bone disease. Clodronic acid reduced skeletal morbidity in an earlier Medical Research Council (MRC) study in patients with multiple myeloma and, as a result, has become a widely adopted, standard treatment in the UK.

In the MRC Myeloma IX trial, we investigated whether the addition of an oral bisphosphonate (clodronic acid) or an intravenous bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid) to antimyeloma treatment could improve clinical outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Results from this trial showed that patients given zoledronic acid had significantly improved progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.80–0.98; p = 0.0179) and a reduced risk of death (0.84, 0.74–0.96; p = 0.0118) versus clodronic acid, with overall survival prolonged by 5.5 months.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for multiple myeloma, particularly in the management of treatment-related adverse events such as infections, the CMRG-CGC 2023 guidelines recommend initiating prophylactic low-dose antivirals in all patients receiving proteasome-inhibitor-based therapy or monoclonal antibodies. This should be continued until at least one month after completing therapy.

### Smoldering multiple myeloma current treatment algorithms [^1113b8Zs]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The role of bisphosphonates to delay bone events in smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is not fully settled. In a randomized trial, a reduction in skeletal-related events (SRE) has been seen with pamidronate (once a month for 12 months) compared with observation. However, no improvement in time to progression or survival was seen. In another randomized trial, a reduction in SREs was noted with zoledronic acid (once a month for 12 months), 56% versus 78%, respectively, P = 0.04. We recommend once-yearly bisphosphonate similar to that used for the treatment of osteoporosis for patients with SMM who have osteopenia or osteoporosis.

### Multiple myeloma and malignant lesions: A potential risk factor for local anesthetic systemic toxicity [^111Z8Tfs]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells that often leads to complications, including osteolytic bone lesions, nephropathy, and neuropathy. It is one of many etiologies of cancer pain conditions that may require interventional pain treatment when refractory to multimodal medications. Notably, local anesthetic systemic toxicity is a rare but life-threatening complication of local anesthetic administered for these interventions.

- **Case presentation**: A 50–60-year-old woman presented with multiple myeloma complicated by chronic bone pain and an acute pain crisis. A fluoroscopic-guided L4–5 epidural catheter was placed with clinical doses of bupivacaine for comfort to undergo MRI of the spine. Soon after, she became tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypoxic, requiring non-invasive positive pressure airway support. As respiratory distress was attributed to a large pleural effusion, a pigtail catheter was inserted in the intensive care unit with submaximally dosed lidocaine infiltration. She then developed a left bundle branch block followed by cardiovascular collapse, minimally responsive to high-dose inotrope and vasopressor support. Lipid emulsion was started with a dramatic therapeutic response and recovery to baseline. A CT of the thoracolumbar spine showed worsening extensive lytic lesions throughout all vertebral bodies and ribs from diffuse myeloma.

Patients with oncologic lesions focal to the thoracolumbar spine may be at higher risk for local anesthetic systemic toxicity from palliative epidurals due to increased cancer-related risks.

### Guidelines for supportive care in multiple myeloma 2011 [^115XqfZ4]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Supportive care plays an increasingly important role in the modern management of multiple myeloma. While modern treatments have significantly prolonged overall and progression-free survival through improved disease control, the vast majority of patients remain incurable and live with the burden of the disease itself and the cumulative side effects of treatments. Maintenance of quality of life presents challenges at all stages of the disease, from diagnosis through the multiple phases of active treatment to the end of life. Written on behalf of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) and the UK Myeloma Forum (UKMF), these evidence-based guidelines summarize the national consensus for supportive and symptomatic care in multiple myeloma in the following areas:

- **Symptom management**: pain management, peripheral neuropathy, sedation, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia
- **Gastrointestinal care**: constipation, diarrhea, mucositis
- **Skeletal health**: skeletal complications, bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw
- **Infection and blood health**: infection, anaemia, haemostasis and thrombosis
- **Holistic care**: complementary therapies, holistic needs assessment, end-of-life care

Most aspects of supportive care can be supervised by haematology teams primarily responsible for patients with multiple myeloma. However, multidisciplinary collaboration involving specialists in palliative medicine, pain management, radiotherapy, and surgical specialties is essential, and guidance is provided for appropriate interdisciplinary referral. These guidelines should be read in conjunction with the BCSH/UKMF Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Multiple Myeloma 2011.

### Effects of zoledronic acid versus clodronic acid on skeletal morbidity in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MRC Myeloma IX): secondary outcomes from a randomised controlled trial [^112EjhsX]. The Lancet Oncology (2011). High credibility.

Skeletal-related events are serious, potentially debilitating complications affecting most patients with multiple myeloma, especially those who do not receive bone-targeted therapy. Bisphosphonates can effectively reduce the risk of skeletal-related events in this population. Consequently, clinical practice guidelines and recommendations include bisphosphonates as a key component of disease treatment for patients with myeloma bone disease. In the previous MRC Myeloma studies, clodronic acid was of particular benefit (i.e. slowing the progression of skeletal disease and reducing skeletal morbidity) to patients without bone lesions at treatment initiation. Moreover, subgroup analysis suggested that clodronic acid might confer survival benefits in patients without overt bone disease at diagnosis.

Three bisphosphonates have been approved for patients with osteolytic bone lesions from multiple myeloma — zoledronic acid and pamidronic acid in the United States and Europe, and clodronic acid in Europe. Previous comparisons of zoledronic acid with pamidronic acid in patients with multiple myeloma showed no significant difference in the incidence of skeletal-related events (86 [47%] of 183 vs. 82 [49%] of 167, respectively), or the time to first skeletal-related event (380 days vs. 286 days, respectively; p = 0.538) among patients with multiple myeloma and established osteolytic lesions. The more recently introduced nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, pamidronic acid and zoledronic acid, are more potent inhibitors of osteoclastic activity than are the earlier, non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (e.g. clodronic acid).

### Effects of zoledronic acid versus clodronic acid on skeletal morbidity in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MRC Myeloma IX): secondary outcomes from a randomised controlled trial [^113YaaAX]. The Lancet Oncology (2011). High credibility.

Induction chemotherapy regimens used to treat patients with multiple myeloma are continually evolving as new drugs and new combinations are assessed in clinical trials. For example, the antimyeloma regimens used in the Myeloma IX trial included drugs that are now being combined with newer agents such as bortezomib. In recent years, there has been interest in the potential for immunomodulatory drugs (e.g. lenalidomide) and bortezomib to slow osteolytic bone destruction in multiple myeloma through inhibition of osteoclast activity and increased osteoblast activity (e.g. bortezomib). So far, these data are derived from preclinical studies and clinical assessments of biochemical markers of bone resorption and bone mineral density and have not yet been correlated with a reduction in the risk of skeletal-related events.

There is no evidence to suggest that antimyeloma treatment alone can replace bisphosphonates for the treatment of multiple myeloma bone disease; however, the potential for synergistic effects between these drugs and bisphosphonates is intriguing. On the basis of the data for skeletal-related events obtained in this study, zoledronic acid is very likely to provide clinically significant benefits in combination with newer antimyeloma regimens because it has proved beneficial in the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with solid tumors who were given a broad range of primary anticancer treatments. However, clinical studies are needed to confirm this theory.

### Role of bone-modifying agents in multiple myeloma: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^1174QLad]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of multiple myeloma, specifically concerning bone-modifying agents, the ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining intermittent evaluations every 3 to 6 months for the presence of albuminuria using a spot urine sample in all patients receiving pamidronate or zoledronic acid. A 24-hour urine collection should be obtained to assess for albumin levels greater than 500 mg/24 hours in patients experiencing unexplained albuminuria. Discontinue the drug until renal problems are resolved.

Reassess patients every 3 to 4 weeks with a 24-hour urine collection for total protein and urine protein electrophoresis. Reinstitute pamidronate over a longer infusion time of at least 4 hours, and at doses not exceeding 90 mg every 4 weeks, when the renal function returns to baseline.

### Effects of zoledronic acid versus clodronic acid on skeletal morbidity in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MRC myeloma IX): secondary outcomes from a randomised controlled trial [^116vH1q2]. The Lancet Oncology (2011). High credibility.

Bisphosphonates are the standard of care for reducing the risk of skeletal-related events in patients with bone lesions from multiple myeloma. The MRC Myeloma IX study was designed to compare the effects of zoledronic acid versus clodronic acid in newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma. Here, we report the secondary outcomes relating to skeletal events.

- **Methods**: Patients (≥ 18 years) with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were enrolled from 120 centres in the UK and received intensive or non-intensive antimyeloma treatment. A computer-generated randomisation sequence was used to allocate patients in a 1:1 ratio, through an automated telephone service, to intravenous zoledronic acid (4 mg every 21–28 days) or oral clodronic acid (1600 mg/day), and the drugs were continued at least until disease progression. No investigators, staff, or patients were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoints — overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate — and adverse events have been reported previously. We assessed between-group differences with Cox proportional hazards models for time to first skeletal-related event and incidence of skeletal-related events. These were defined as fractures, spinal cord compression, radiation or surgery to bone, and new osteolytic lesions. Data were analysed until disease progression. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN68454111.

- **Findings**: 1960 patients were randomly assigned and analysed — 981 in the zoledronic acid group and 979 in the clodronic acid group.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for multiple myeloma, specifically with respect to the management of treatment-related adverse events such as cytopenias, the CMRG-CGC 2023 guidelines recommend considering the administration of EPO-stimulating agents to decrease transfusion dependence only when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. This is due to the increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis associated with these agents.

### In multiple myeloma, monthly treatment with zoledronic acid beyond two years offers sustained protection against progressive bone disease [^113Rngt9]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Lytic bone destruction is one of the most devastating complications in multiple myeloma (MM). At diagnosis, more than half of patients have bone pain, and 90% of all patients with MM will experience bone destruction, which may cause pain, pathological fractures, nerve root compression, hypercalcemia, and potentially spinal cord compression.

Newly diagnosed symptomatic patients with MM are recommended to receive treatment with zoledronic acid (ZOL) as part of standard anti-MM treatment. ZOL has proven to reduce the progression of bone disease, diminish pain, and increase survival. However, potential side effects of bisphosphonate treatment include kidney failure, atypical femur fractures, and importantly, medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). The risk of MRONJ increases with the duration of bisphosphonate treatment.

Early randomized studies have shown the effect of aminobisphosphonates administered as pamidronate or ZOL monthly for up to 24 months. Considering the balance between the benefits and risks of prolonged treatment, most guidelines recommend bisphosphonate treatment for 1–2 years as standard.

With the introduction of several novel anti-MM drugs, the life expectancy for patients has increased. Longer survival spurs the need to consider longer bone-protective regimens. Milestone analysis after two years in the British MRC IX study showed the superiority of continued ZOL treatment after 24 months. However, the comparator — clodronate given orally — was an inferior treatment, and the benefits observed after 24 months for ZOL could be caused by the long-term efficacy of the treatment.

For the medical management of multiple myeloma, particularly in the context of managing relapsed/refractory disease with systemic therapy, the ASCO/CCO 2019 guidelines recommend offering a triplet combination of a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and a corticosteroid as initial therapy. This should be followed by one or two autologous stem cell transplants (ASCTs) and then a proteasome inhibitor-based maintenance therapy until progression in patients with genetic high-risk disease.

### Persistent opioid use is associated with a shorter myeloma survival [^116dGyfP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Low credibility.

Osteolytic bone lesions are a frequent complication of multiple myeloma (MM), increasing morbidity and mortality. Patients may also develop peripheral neuropathy from thalidomide or bortezomib, which decreases quality of life and can persist after completion of treatment. Thus, opioids are often considered a cornerstone of myeloma treatment.

In recent years, driven by the opioid epidemic, increased attention has been given to opioid risks in the treatment of noncancer pain. There has been an increase in guidelines and consensus recommendations aimed at addressing opioid overuse and/or misuse. However, the CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain excludes patients undergoing active cancer treatment, even though similar levels of pain have been reported in patients during and after completion of cancer treatment.

Emerging data suggest that patients with cancer are at equal risk of using a prescription opioid in a way not directed by the prescriber when compared with patients without cancer. Even though cancer patients are ten times less likely to die from opioid overdose versus the general population, the majority of cancer survivors receive opioids during cancer treatment, and at least a third will continue to experience chronic pain even after completing cancer treatment.

While opioids are an important aspect of pain management during cancer treatment, their role for those who have completed curative treatment is less clear. Recent studies have demonstrated that cancer survivors are more likely to receive long-term and high-dose opioid prescriptions.

### Effects of long-term intravenous ibandronate therapy on skeletal-related events, survival, and bone resorption markers in patients with advanced multiple myeloma [^117C4SKz]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates have been found to reduce the incidence of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with multiple myeloma. This study is significant as it is the first double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of ibandronate, a third-generation amino-bisphosphonate, in preventing SREs in advanced-stage multiple myeloma patients.

Patients with stage II or III multiple myeloma were randomly assigned to receive either 2 mg of ibandronate or a placebo as a monthly intravenous (IV) bolus injection for 12 to 24 months, alongside conventional chemotherapy. The study analyzed SREs, including peripheral pathologic or vertebral fractures, hypercalcemia, severe bone pain, and bone radiotherapy or surgery. Additionally, bone-turnover markers were studied, and post hoc analyses of bone morbidity and survival were conducted.

Ninety-nine patients per treatment group were assessable for efficacy analysis. The occurrence of SREs per patient year and the time to the first SRE were not significantly different between the two groups. Overall, no differences were found between the treatment groups regarding bone pain, analgesic drug use, quality of life, or median survival (33.1 vs. 28.2 months, respectively). Explorative post hoc analyses revealed that ibandronate patients with strongly suppressed bone-turnover markers (≥ 30% and ≥ 50% mean reduction of serum osteocalcin and urinary C-terminal telopeptides) developed significantly less bone morbidity. Ibandronate was well-tolerated during up to 25 therapy cycles.

### Side effects of analgesia may significantly reduce quality of life in symptomatic multiple myeloma: A cross-sectional prevalence study [^116Vde3m]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a chronic malignant disease which is ultimately fatal, but with recent improvements in disease management, including biological therapies and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), patients can now expect to live for many years. However, the pain of bone lesions and additional treatment-emergent complications such as peripheral neuropathy can impose a significant burden on survivors. We have recently shown that even five years after diagnosis, and after three lines of treatments, patients reported pain and fatigue as their most pressing symptoms; pain was neuropathic in half the subjects. It is now acknowledged in evidence-based guidelines for MM that supportive care has a significant role in its management.

One of the most important aspects of supportive care in MM is to provide effective and safe pain relief. The results of this study suggest that the side effects of analgesics may significantly reduce the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with symptomatic MM. Thus, despite the intention of supportive care to optimize disease management and minimize side effects, HRQoL may be inadvertently compromised by the prescription of analgesic medications. These findings concur with previous cross-sectional studies in patients that estimated side effects of opioids in mixed groups of cancer patients. Villars et al. (2007) studied oncology outpatients with bone metastases and found a correlation between the total dose of opioid and several reported side effects. The majority of their subjects had solid tumors, were receiving various forms of anti-cancer treatment, and less than 60% had cancer.

Regarding the medical management of multiple myeloma, specifically concerning bone-modifying agents, the ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend administering pamidronate 90 mg over 4–6 hours to patients with extensive bone disease and existing severe renal impairment (serum creatinine level > 3.0 mg/dL or an estimated CrCl of < 30 mL/min). It is advised to consider reducing the initial pamidronate dose in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Infusion times should not be less than 2 hours for pamidronate or less than 15 minutes for zoledronic acid.

### Bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma [^116KRHbY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a disease characterized by the neoplastic proliferation of a clone of plasma cells that can lead to bone destruction. Bisphosphonates are specific inhibitors of osteoclastic activity; therefore, there is a pharmacological basis for their use in multiple myeloma. However, the exact clinical role of bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective is to determine whether adding bisphosphonates to standard therapy in multiple myeloma decreases skeletal-related morbidity (pathological fractures), skeletal-related mortality, and overall mortality. The secondary objective is to determine the effects of bisphosphonates on pain, quality of life, and incidence of hypercalcemia.

- **Search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE (1966 - June 2001), LILACS (1982 - June 2001), EMBASE (1974 - December 2000), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (all years, latest Issue 03/2001) to identify all randomized trials in multiple myeloma. All of these references were accessed to identify trials related to the use of bisphosphonates in myeloma. Relevant references in each article were also scanned. Additionally, we performed a hand search of relevant meeting proceedings from 1993 to 2000 and contacted manufacturers of bisphosphonates and researchers in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials with a parallel design on the use of bisphosphonate in myeloma compared with a placebo or no treatment as a control group.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility, methodological quality, and abstracted data.

### Advances in imaging and the management of myeloma bone disease [^1112ztiv]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Osteolytic disease is a major complication of multiple myeloma that may lead to devastating skeletal-related events (SREs). Conventional radiography remains the gold standard for the evaluation of bone disease in patients with myeloma. However, whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended in patients with normal conventional radiography and should be performed as part of staging in all patients with a solitary plasmacytoma of bone. Urgent MRI is also the diagnostic procedure of choice for assessing suspected cord compression, whereas computed tomography can guide tissue biopsy.

Positron emission tomography with computed tomography can provide complementary information to MRI, but its use in multiple myeloma must be better defined by further studies. The incorporation of abnormal MRI findings into the definition of symptomatic myeloma also needs to be clarified.

Bisphosphonates remain the cornerstone for the management of myeloma bone disease. Intravenous pamidronate and zoledronic acid are equally effective in reducing SREs, whereas zoledronic acid seems to offer survival benefits in symptomatic patients. Caution is needed to avoid adverse events, such as renal impairment and osteonecrosis of the jaw.

Novel antiresorptive agents, such as denosumab, have shown encouraging results, but further studies are needed before their approval for managing myeloma bone disease. Combination approaches with novel antimyeloma agents, such as bortezomib (which has anabolic effects on bone) with bisphosphonates or with drugs that enhance osteoblast function, such as antidickkopf-1, are being explored.

### Effects of zoledronic acid versus clodronic acid on skeletal morbidity in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MRC Myeloma IX): secondary outcomes from a randomised controlled trial [^1142b2cF]. The Lancet Oncology (2011). High credibility.

Patients were allocated to two main treatment pathways (intensive and non-intensive), as previously described in detail. In each pathway, patients were randomly assigned to oral clodronic acid (1600 mg/day) or intravenous zoledronic acid (4 mg, 15 min infusion every 3–4 weeks with induction chemotherapy and every 4 weeks thereafter). Dose adjustment for patients with impaired renal function at baseline and delays in administration of the dose in patients with increases in serum creatinine concentration during the study were implemented for zoledronic acid, per the prescribing information. After first-line treatment, eligible patients were randomly assigned to maintenance therapy with thalidomide (50 mg/day initially, increasing to 100 mg/day if tolerated) or no thalidomide maintenance. Bisphosphonates and maintenance therapy were administered continuously at least until disease progression.

Oral health recommendations were provided to investigators from June 2006, based on the recommendations of Weitzman and colleagues to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw and to identify and manage suspected cases of this adverse event.

- **Assessments**: The incidence and type of adverse events and serious adverse events were assessed with continuous monitoring. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were those judged by the treating physician to be related to study drugs. Serum creatinine concentration was monitored every month during induction chemotherapy. After induction chemotherapy, the concentration was monitored every month for patients in the zoledronic acid group.

### Role of bone-modifying agents in multiple myeloma: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^112eU1By]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of multiple myeloma, specifically in relation to bone-modifying agents at the initiation stage, the ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend considering the administration of intravenous bisphosphonates in patients with multiple myeloma who have osteopenia (osteoporosis) but lack radiographic evidence of lytic bone disease.

### Bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma [^115iE8SU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a disease characterized by the neoplastic proliferation of a clone of plasma cells that can lead to bone destruction. Bisphosphonates are specific inhibitors of osteoclastic activity; thus, there is a pharmacological basis for their use in multiple myeloma. However, the exact clinical role of bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma remains unclear.

- **Objectives**
- **Primary**: To determine whether adding bisphosphonates to standard therapy in multiple myeloma decreases skeletal-related morbidity (pathological fractures), skeletal-related mortality, and overall mortality.
- **Secondary**: To determine the effects of bisphosphonates on pain, quality of life, and the incidence of hypercalcemia.

- **Search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE (1966 - June 2001), LILACS (1982 - June 2001), EMBASE (1974 - December 2000), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (all years, latest Issue 03/2001) to identify all randomized trials in multiple myeloma. All of these references were accessed in order to identify trials related to the use of bisphosphonates in myeloma. All relevant references in each article were also scanned. We also performed a hand search of relevant meeting proceedings from 1993 to 2000. Additionally, manufacturers of bisphosphonates and researchers in the field were contacted.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials with a parallel design on the use of bisphosphonate in myeloma compared with placebo or no treatment as a control group.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility, methodological quality, and abstracted data.

### Managing metastatic bone pain: The role of bisphosphonates [^112j8szT]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2007). Low credibility.

Approximately two-thirds of patients with bone metastases experience severe and debilitating pain. Despite a range of treatments, about 25% of these patients suffer from uncontrolled pain. Bisphosphonates are the standard care for reducing skeletal events associated with bone metastases. We review the efficacy of currently available bisphosphonates in cancer-related bone pain. Oral clodronate, intravenous (i.v.) pamidronate, and i.v. zoledronic acid have shown an analgesic effect in some studies. Both i.v. and oral ibandronate reduced bone pain in breast cancer patients with bone metastases and maintained bone pain scores below baseline levels for up to two years in clinical trials. Pilot studies of intensive i.v. ibandronate dosing show rapid and effective relief from moderate-to-severe bone pain in patients with breast cancer and other tumors. Phase III trials are warranted to compare the efficacy of bisphosphonates in treating bone pain and to confirm the effects of intensive dosing regimens.

### Patients with multiple myeloma referred for palliative care consultation: From retrospective analysis to future directions to improve clinical outcomes [^112z5ydy]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the 14th most common type of cancer worldwide and represents 1.8% of all cancers in the United States. It is estimated that in 2020, there were 32,270 new cases and 12,830 deaths from this disease. It is more frequent in males, and the median age at diagnosis for both sexes is 69 years.

MM is characterized by an increase in plasma cells, resulting in an excessive production of immunoglobulin proteins with different signs and symptoms due to ensuing multiple organ damage, for example, anemia from abnormal bone marrow involvement, osteolytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, and other skeletal-related events (SREs) from bone damage, and renal failure from kidney problems.

More than two-thirds of patients at diagnosis and nearly all during the course of the disease experience myeloma bone damage and pain from osteolytic bone lesions. However, different types of pain occur at different stages of the disease. For instance, bone pain is more frequent at diagnosis and relapse, whereas pain from chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy develops during MM treatment, especially with drugs like bortezomib, thalidomide, lenalidomide, and vinca alkaloids, and can worsen over time with prolonged use. Oropharyngeal mucositis and somatic pain caused by the use of growth factors are frequent during stem cell transplantation, after which post-herpetic neuralgia is often diagnosed. Furthermore, long-term survivors may experience late effects of treatments such as chronic pain, neuropathy, or asthenia, and may also develop psychological symptoms such as depression and anxiety.

### Bone health in cancer: ESMO clinical practice guidelines [^116gsueD]. Annals of Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bone metastasis, specifically concerning bone-modifying agents, the ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend initiating zoledronate, pamidronate, or denosumab at the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Denosumab is to be initiated as the agent of choice in patients with multiple myeloma who have a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of less than 60 mL/min.

### Transcriptomic profiling of the myeloma bone-lining niche reveals BMP signalling inhibition to improve bone disease [^1154TQkG]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma is an incurable, bone marrow-dwelling malignancy that disrupts bone homeostasis, causing skeletal damage and pain. The mechanisms underlying myeloma-induced bone destruction are poorly understood, and current therapies do not restore lost bone mass. Using transcriptomic profiling of isolated bone lining cell subtypes from a murine myeloma model, we find that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling is upregulated in stromal progenitor cells. BMP signalling has not previously been reported to be dysregulated in myeloma bone disease. Inhibition of BMP signalling in vivo, using either a small molecule BMP receptor antagonist or a solubilized BMPR1a-FC receptor ligand trap, prevents trabecular and cortical bone volume loss caused by myeloma, without increasing tumor burden. BMP inhibition directly reduces osteoclastogenesis, increases osteoblasts and bone formation, and suppresses bone marrow sclerostin levels. In summary, we describe a novel role for the BMP pathway in myeloma-induced bone disease that can be therapeutically targeted.

### Patterns of bisphosphonate treatment among patients with multiple myeloma treated at oncology clinics across the United States: Observations from real-world data [^116rYawg]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with multiple myeloma are at risk for impaired renal function, primarily due to excess monoclonal light chain production and hypercalcemia. Impaired renal function has been associated with reduced survival. Improvement in renal function may increase survival; however, survival remains inferior to patients with normal renal function at diagnosis. In addition to intravenous bisphosphonates, anti-multiple myeloma drugs, such as lenalidomide, require dose adjustments in patients with impaired renal function. In this study, we found that renal function significantly affected the likelihood of receiving treatment with an intravenous bisphosphonate. These results suggest that therapies that do not adversely affect kidney function are needed to prevent skeletal-related events in this patient group.

- **Study population and data collection**: A notable strength of this study was the large population of patients with multiple myeloma. This population represents health-related encounters from oncology practices across the United States and reflects geographic diversity as well as multiple EHR systems, payer types, and clinical pathways. These patient-level data are captured systematically and electronically from the same EHR used by practitioners to track patient care at each of the participating centers, which results in improved consistency.

- **Limitations**: Our analysis was limited by unknown or missing information in some fields such as stage and ECOG at diagnosis (data not shown), which limited our model estimation for those covariates. We did not collect information on reasons for discontinuation or changes in dosing of bisphosphonates.

### International myeloma working group recommendations for the treatment of multiple myeloma-related bone disease [^116nTVpT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of the International Myeloma Working Group was to develop practice recommendations for the management of multiple myeloma (MM)-related bone disease.

- **Methodology**: An interdisciplinary panel of clinical experts on MM and myeloma bone disease developed recommendations based on published data through August 2012. Expert consensus was used to propose additional recommendations in situations where there were insufficient published data. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendations were assigned and approved by panel members.

- **Recommendations**: Bisphosphonates (BPs) should be considered in all patients with MM receiving first-line antimyeloma therapy, regardless of the presence of osteolytic bone lesions on conventional radiography. However, it is unknown if BPs offer any advantage in patients with no bone disease assessed by magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Intravenous (IV) zoledronic acid (ZOL) or pamidronate (PAM) is recommended for preventing skeletal-related events in patients with MM. ZOL is preferred over oral clodronate in newly diagnosed patients with MM because of its potential antimyeloma effects and survival benefits. BPs should be administered every 3 to 4 weeks IV during initial therapy. ZOL or PAM should be continued in patients with active disease and should be resumed after disease relapse if discontinued in patients achieving complete or very good partial response. BPs are well tolerated, but preventive strategies must be instituted to avoid renal toxicity or osteonecrosis of the jaw.

### Bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma [^112dCENv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are specific inhibitors of osteoclastic activity and are currently used as supportive therapy for multiple myeloma (MM); however, the exact clinical role of bisphosphonates in MM remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: This update is based on the first review published in 2002. We have also analyzed observational studies targeting osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ).

- **Search strategy**: We searched the literature using the methods outlined in the previous review. We also searched observational studies or case reports examining ONJ.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected RCTs with a parallel design related to the use of bisphosphonate in myeloma. We also selected observational studies or case reports examining bisphosphonates related to ONJ.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We have reported pooled data using either hazard ratio or risk ratio and, when appropriate, as absolute risk reduction and the number needed to treat to prevent or to cause a pathological event. We assessed statistical heterogeneity and reported the I(2) statistic.

- **Main results**: This review includes 17 trials with 1,520 patients analyzed in bisphosphonates groups and 1,490 analyzed in control groups. In comparison with placebo/no treatment, the pooled analysis demonstrated the beneficial effect of bisphosphonates on the prevention of pathological vertebral fractures (RR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.89, P = 0.001), total skeletal-related events (SREs) (RR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.89, P < 0.0001), and on amelioration of pain (RR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.95, P = 0.01). We found no significant effect of bisphosphonates on…

### Multiple myeloma: Diagnosis and treatment [^112huLv9]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma, the most common bone malignancy, is occurring with increasing frequency in older persons. Typical symptoms include bone pain, malaise, anemia, renal insufficiency, and hypercalcemia. Incidental discovery on comprehensive laboratory panels is common. The disease is diagnosed through serum or urine protein electrophoresis or immunofixation and bone marrow aspirate analysis. Skeletal radiographs are important in staging multiple myeloma and revealing lytic lesions, vertebral compression fractures, and osteoporosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) or computed tomography (CT) are emerging as useful tools in the evaluation of patients with myeloma; MRI is preferred for evaluating acute spinal compression. Nuclear bone scans and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) have no role in the diagnosis and staging of myeloma.

The differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies includes monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS), smoldering (asymptomatic) and symptomatic multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, and rare plasma cell leukemia and heavy chain diseases. Patients with MGUS or smoldering multiple myeloma should be followed closely, but not treated. Symptomatic multiple myeloma is treated with chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, if possible. Medications such as melphalan, prednisolone, dexamethasone, vincristine, doxorubicin, bortezomib, and thalidomide and its analogue lenalidomide have been used successfully.

### First line treatment of newly diagnosed transplant ineligible multiple myeloma: Recommendations from the Canadian Myeloma Research Group Consensus Guideline Consortium [^112DBKmg]. Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma & Leukemia (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for multiple myeloma, particularly in managing treatment-related adverse events such as cytopenias, the CMRG-CGC 2023 guidelines recommend interrupting therapy in patients with grade 3–4 hematologic toxicity due to lenalidomide or bortezomib until resolution to grade ≤ 2 toxicity. Therapy should then be reinitiated at a 25% dose reduction for bortezomib or at the next lowest dose level for lenalidomide, with the following exceptions:

- **Transfusion support**: Consider administering transfusion support as needed to maintain an adequate platelet count due to the cyclical and non-cumulative nature of thrombocytopenia secondary to bortezomib.

- **G-CSF for neutropenia**: Consider administering G-CSF for neutropenia to avoid dose reduction of bortezomib and/or lenalidomide.

### The safety profile of concurrent therapy for multiple myeloma in the modern era [^111xhCkV]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is caused by the proliferation of a single clone of plasma cells that produce a monoclonal immunoglobulin. These plasma cell clones can lead to extensive skeletal destruction, osteolytic lesions, osteopenia, or pathologic fractures. Additional disease-related complications include hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and infections. Some of the most common symptoms include fatigue, bone pain, and recurrent infections.

The mechanism through which MM causes bone damage is thought to be due to various changes in the bone marrow microenvironment, including the induction of angiogenesis, the suppression of cell-mediated immunity, and the development of paracrine signaling loops involving cytokines such as interleukin 6 and vascular endothelial growth factor. Discoveries such as these have led to the development of multiple targeted agents, including new applications of thalidomide and the usage of bortezomib.

There have been several new biologic agents introduced over the past decade that have improved the outcomes of this disease. Notably, daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody to CD38, which myeloma cells overexpress, has shown efficacy as a monotherapy and in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, exhibiting overall survival rates of 18 months and progression-free survival rates of 12 months, while maintaining a tolerable side effect profile.

As patients live longer, the development of painful metastatic lesions from MM becomes more prevalent.

### Bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma: A network meta-analysis [^115bVpXV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Bisphosphonates are specific inhibitors of osteoclastic activity and are used in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). While bisphosphonates have been shown to be effective in reducing vertebral fractures and pain, their role in improving overall survival (OS) remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002 and previously updated in 2010.

- **Objectives**: To assess the evidence related to the benefits and harms associated with the use of various types of bisphosphonates (aminobisphosphonates versus nonamino bisphosphonates) in the management of patients with MM. The primary objective was to determine whether adding bisphosphonates to standard therapy in MM improves OS and progression-free survival (PFS), and decreases skeletal-related morbidity. Secondary objectives were to determine the effects of bisphosphonates on pain, quality of life, incidence of hypercalcemia, and incidence of bisphosphonate-related gastrointestinal toxicities, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and hypocalcemia.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, LILACS, and EMBASE (December 2009 to October 2011) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (all years, latest Issue September 2011) to identify all randomized trials in MM up to October 2011 using a combination of text and MeSH terms. Relevant meeting proceedings were also handsearched (December 2009 to October 2011).

- **Selection criteria**: Any randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the role of bisphosphonates and observational studies or case reports examining bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with MM were included.

### Role of bone-modifying agents in multiple myeloma: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^117WYi1E]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for multiple myeloma, specifically with respect to bone-modifying agents, the ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend considering bone-targeting treatment for up to 2 years. Patients with responsive or stable disease should consider switching to less-frequent dosing. For patients without active myeloma who are on maintenance therapy, switching to 3-month intervals of bisphosphonates is advised. There is insufficient evidence to make a precise recommendation regarding the duration of bisphosphonate use in these patients. If bisphosphonates were withdrawn after 2 years, resume the drug upon relapse with new-onset skeletal-related events. Do not stop denosumab abruptly, given its reversible mechanism of action.
