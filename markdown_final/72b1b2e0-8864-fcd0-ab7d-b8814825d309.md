## Question

What does a 6 month old who has gone from 5% weight to 100% weight indicate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what it means when a 6-month-old infant's weight percentile has risen from the 5th percentile to the 100th percentile. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what percentiles represent and how to interpret a large upward centile crossing. Then, I should verify whether this change meets accepted definitions of rapid weight gain and quantify it. Next, I will review the evidence linking rapid infant weight gain to later obesity and metabolic risk. After that, I need to consider the timing of this gain and its physiologic implications. Finally, I will outline immediate clinical actions, including plotting on WHO charts, assessing feeding and body composition, and planning follow-up and counseling, while double-checking for any confounders that could explain the trajectory.

> Let me first confirm the basics: percentiles rank a child's size relative to peers of the same age and sex, and a change from the 5th to the 100th percentile represents a massive upward shift across nearly the entire distribution, which is clinically notable and warrants evaluation rather than reassurance [^2e6a214b].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude in z-score terms. A difference of about 0.67 SD corresponds to moving one major centile line on WHO/CDC charts, so a move from the 5th to the 100th percentile is roughly a +2.0 to +2.5 SD change in weight-for-age, which far exceeds the conventional threshold for rapid weight gain of about +0.67 SD and is therefore a red flag for accelerated growth trajectory [^a4e81910] [^d4b5709b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the definition. Rapid weight gain in infancy is commonly defined as a rise in weight-for-age z-score greater than 0.67 between two time points, and this infant's change is several-fold larger than that, meeting and exceeding that definition and signaling growth acceleration rather than catch-up growth from prior undernutrition [^33fe5fef] [^a4e81910].

> Next, I should review the evidence on long-term outcomes. Multiple cohorts and meta-analyses show that rapid infant weight gain is consistently associated with increased risk of later overweight and obesity, with relative risks commonly in the 1.2–5.7 range depending on timing and population, and the risk appears stronger when the acceleration occurs in the first 3–6 months of life [^33fe5fef] [^d6341880] [^48d81f60].

> I need to check the timing specifically. Rapid weight gain in the first 3–6 months is more predictive of later adiposity and cardiometabolic risk than later periods, and this infant's trajectory spans 0–6 months, which places them in the highest-risk window for programming of obesity and metabolic disease [^48d81f60] [^33fe5fef].

> Let me consider the physiologic basis. Infants gaining weight rapidly accrue a higher proportion of fat mass per kilogram of weight gained compared with infants gaining normally, and early BMI peaks around 6–9 months coincide with increased adiposity, so a 0–6 month acceleration likely reflects disproportionate fat deposition that tracks into childhood [^11b38483] [^cb09cfd7] [^82146030].

> But wait, what if this is just catch-up growth from prior undernutrition? I should double-check the distinction. Catch-up growth follows a period of growth faltering and is generally beneficial, whereas growth acceleration without prior faltering is not compensatory and carries adverse long-term risk; the history of starting at the 5th percentile does not by itself prove prior faltering, so I need to confirm prenatal and early postnatal trajectories before labeling this as catch-up [^33fe5fef] [^6b88fc1a].

> Next, I should review immediate clinical steps. I need to ensure measurements are accurate, plot weight, length, and weight-for-length on WHO growth charts for 0–24 months, and calculate the exact z-score change to quantify the acceleration, while also checking for plotting errors or misclassification that could artifactually produce extreme centile shifts [^2e6a214b] [^0e67960d].

> I will now examine feeding and environmental contributors. I should confirm feeding method and exclusivity, timing of formula introduction, solids before 6 months, bottle-feeding practices, and formula preparation accuracy, because overdispensing formula and early formula exposure are linked to rapid weight gain and higher adiposity, and breastfeeding is associated with slower, more physiologic growth trajectories [^98e298f5] [^4580ee2e] [^0e67960d].

> Hold on, I should verify body composition risk. Given the magnitude of centile crossing, I should assess weight-for-length percentile and consider whether the infant is at or above the 85th percentile, which in infants signals overweight risk, and I should remember that BMI-for-age, while imperfect in infancy, correlates with adiposity and can help flag early risk when interpreted alongside length and weight-for-age [^notfound] [^31fe4ecc].

> Let me think about the differential. I need to screen for rare endocrine or genetic causes of excessive growth if length is disproportionately advanced, but in the absence of red flags, the most likely driver here is energy intake exceeding needs in early infancy, particularly with formula feeding or early solids, rather than pathologic growth disorders [^33fe5fef].

> I should confirm the follow-up plan. Close monitoring every 4–8 weeks with serial weight, length, and weight-for-length is prudent, with a low threshold to intervene on feeding practices, and I should counsel on responsive feeding, avoidance of early solids, and correct formula preparation; if weight-for-length is ≥ 95th percentile, I should initiate obesity prevention counseling and consider referral to a pediatric registered dietitian [^ca344aa1] [^847197d0].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "this is definitely pathologic", but I should correct that overstatement. While the magnitude of centile crossing is extreme and the timing confers high risk, some infants with early rapid gain do not go on to obesity, and individual prediction is imperfect; nonetheless, the population-level risk is substantial enough to justify proactive surveillance and feeding intervention now rather than waiting to see if the trajectory normalizes [^33fe5fef] [^7a347e77].

> In summary, I should conclude that this 0–6 month rise from the 5th to the 100th percentile represents marked growth acceleration consistent with rapid infant weight gain, carries a high likelihood of increased adiposity, and is associated with a 2–6 fold increased risk of later obesity and adverse cardiometabolic outcomes; therefore, it warrants prompt evaluation of feeding and growth parameters, early obesity-prevention counseling, and close follow-up to redirect the trajectory while avoiding overly restrictive feeding that could compromise growth and development [^33fe5fef] [^d6341880] [^7a347e77].

---

A 6-month-old who has moved from the 5th to the 100th percentile for weight has experienced **excessive weight gain** and is at **increased risk of obesity** and metabolic complications [^33fe5fef]. This trajectory is concerning because rapid infant weight gain is strongly linked to later obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular risk [^d6341880] [^48d81f60]. Immediate evaluation should include plotting weight-for-length on WHO growth charts [^2e6a214b], reviewing feeding practices (especially formula use and early solids) [^4580ee2e], and assessing for underlying medical causes. Management focuses on adjusting feeding to support normal growth velocity, avoiding overfeeding, and close follow-up to prevent long-term metabolic harm [^ca344aa1].

## Clinical significance of rapid weight gain

Rapid weight gain in infancy is defined as a **change in weight-for-age z-score > 0.67 SD** (about one centile band) between two measurements [^a4e81910]. A rise from the 5th to the 100th percentile represents a **change of about 2.3 SD**, far exceeding this threshold and indicating severe acceleration [^a4e81910].

---

## Risks associated with rapid weight gain

Excessive weight gain in infancy is associated with **significant short- and long-term risks**:

- **Obesity**: Higher risk of childhood and adult obesity [^d6341880] [^33fe5fef].
- **Metabolic complications**: Increased risk of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [^f849e81c] [^48d81f60].
- **Hypertension**: Greater likelihood of elevated blood pressure later in life [^48d81f60].
- **Asthma**: Higher asthma risk in children with rapid early weight gain [^e9341e06].

---

## Factors contributing to rapid weight gain

Several factors can drive **rapid weight gain** in infants:

- **Feeding practices**: Formula feeding, early introduction of solids, and overfeeding are key contributors [^4580ee2e] [^98e298f5].
- **Parental perceptions**: Parents may misinterpret growth charts or prefer heavier infants, leading to overfeeding [^63a26c82] [^88b6aaef].
- **Socioeconomic factors**: Lower maternal education and food insecurity are linked to rapid infant weight gain [^notfound].
- **Medical conditions**: Rare endocrine or genetic disorders can cause excessive growth and should be excluded [^notfound].

## Recommended clinical evaluation

A structured evaluation is essential to identify causes and guide management:

| **Step** | **Evaluation** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Plot weight-for-length on WHO growth charts [^2e6a214b] | Assess current weight status and trajectory |
| 2 | Detailed feeding history (breastfeeding, formula, solids) [^4580ee2e] | Identify modifiable feeding practices |
| 3 | Review family history (obesity, diabetes, hypertension) [^ca344aa1] | Assess genetic risk |
| 4 | Physical exam (anthropometrics, signs of endocrine disease) | Exclude medical causes |
| 5 | Laboratory tests (CBC, CMP, TSH, insulin, glucose) if indicated | Rule out metabolic or endocrine disorders |

---

## Management strategies

Management centers on **normalizing growth velocity** while ensuring adequate nutrition:

- **Feeding adjustments**: Promote exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months when possible; if formula-fed, ensure correct preparation and avoid overfeeding [^4580ee2e] [^98e298f5].
- **Delay solids**: Avoid introducing solids before 6 months [^4580ee2e].
- **Parent education**: Teach responsive feeding and recognition of satiety cues [^notfound].
- **Regular monitoring**: Track growth every 2–4 weeks until the trajectory stabilizes [^notfound].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Involve a pediatrician, dietitian, and lactation consultant as needed [^80951838].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Without intervention, infants with rapid early weight gain have a **high likelihood of persistent obesity** and metabolic complications into adolescence and adulthood [^33fe5fef] [^48d81f60]. Early identification and management can significantly reduce these risks [^notfound].

---

A 6-month-old who has moved from the 5th to the 100th percentile for weight has experienced **excessive weight gain** and is at **increased risk of obesity** and metabolic complications. Immediate evaluation and targeted management are essential to normalize growth and prevent long-term health problems.

S. The distribution shows how infants and young children grow under these conditions, rather than how they grow in environments that may not support optimal growth.

### Comparison of the World Health Organization growth velocity standards with existing US reference data [^397b421f]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this study was to compare World Health Organization (WHO) growth velocity standards with reference data based on US children.

Methods

Comparisons were made between reference values for weight and length gains based on serial data from US children and the WHO child growth standards. We compared weight velocities for boys and girls for selected percentiles (5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th) for 1-month intervals from birth to 6 months, 2-month intervals up to 12 months, and 3-month intervals up to 24 months. For length, we compared 2-month intervals from birth to 6 months and 3-month intervals up to 24 months.

Results

WHO and US monthly weight increments were similar at the 5th percentile up to 3 months of age; values for other US percentiles were below the WHO percentiles ∼150 g on average. From 3 months onward, the US values converged to a narrow range of < 100 g between estimated percentiles. Two- and 3-month weight gains showed similar variations. Differences between the WHO and US values were more pronounced at the lower end of the distribution. For length, medians were in closer agreement, but as occurred with weight, values at the outer US percentiles converged to a narrower range with increasing age compared with those of the WHO standards.

Conclusions

There are important differences between the WHO standards and the reference values for growth velocity based on US data. The WHO values are a better tool for assessing growth velocity and making clinical decisions.

### Parent perception of healthy infant and toddler growth [^63a26c82]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that parents of infants prefer growth at higher percentiles and are averse to growth at lower percentiles. Of 279 participating parents, only 10% desired their child's weight to be in the lowest quartile. For children weighing in the lowest quartile, 57% of parents thought their child's weight was "too low". In contrast, 66% of parents whose child's weight was in the top quartile preferred their child weigh that much. When viewing hypothetical infant growth trajectories, 47% ranked a growth chart demonstrating growth along the 10th percentile for weight as "least healthy" of 6 growth patterns, and 29% chose charts showing an infant at the 90th percentile for weight at age 1 as "healthiest". In conclusion, parents are averse to growth at the bottom of the weight growth chart but are much less likely to feel negatively about growth at higher percentiles. This is troubling given the childhood obesity epidemic.

### High body mass index in infancy may predict severe obesity in early childhood [^7a347e77]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize growth trajectories of children who develop severe obesity by age 6 years and identify clinical thresholds for detection of high-risk children before the onset of obesity.

Study Design

Two lean (body mass index [BMI] 5th to ≤ 75th percentile) and 2 severely obese (BMI ≥ 99th percentile) groups were selected from populations treated at pediatric referral and primary care clinics. A population-based cohort was used to validate the utility of identified risk thresholds. Repeated-measures mixed modeling and logistic regression were used for analysis.

Results

A total of 783 participants of normal weight and 480 participants with severe obesity were included in the initial study. BMI differed significantly between the severely obese and normal-weight cohorts by age 4 months (P < .001), at 1 year before the median age at onset of obesity. A cutoff of the World Health Organization (WHO) 85th percentile for BMI at 6, 12, and 18 months was a strong predictor of severe obesity by age 6 years (sensitivity, 51%-95%; specificity, 95%). This BMI threshold was validated in a second independent cohort (n = 2649), with a sensitivity of 33%-77% and a specificity of 74%-87%. A BMI ≥ 85th percentile in infancy increases the risk of severe obesity by age 6 years by 2.5-fold and the risk of clinical obesity by age 6 years by 3-fold.

Conclusions

BMI trajectories in children who develop severe obesity by age 6 years differ from those in children who remain at normal weight by age 4–6 months, before the onset of obesity. Infants with a WHO BMI ≥ 85th percentile are at increased risk for developing severe obesity by age 6 years.

### Examination of the cut-off scores determined by the ages and stages questionnaire in a population-based sample of 6 month-old Norwegian infants [^11964ae2]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

To our knowledge this is the first large and representative study of ASQ performance in 6-months-old infants. It demonstrates, in this low risk population, values of lower infant performance compared to the Norwegian, and also the US, reference samples. Using the recommended Norwegian or US cut-off levels, approximately every third infant with birth weight above 2.5 kg received scores indicating a need for further assessment. Using the 2.5 percentile of the study, equivalent to the US cut-off (Mean - 2SD), 13.8% of the infants received a positive score. This increased to 20.5% if missing items were scored according to the Norwegian, and not the US, manual. Adequate cut-off levels are important in screening instruments recommended for use in well child visits for all children.

There are indications that the ASQ 6 month questionnaire may function well without the pictograms in populations with mostly adequate reading abilities. This would be beneficial for epidemiological studies and should be explored further.

7 Overweight (includes obesity): a condition where a child's BMI falls within the range of 25–30. To further classify a child as overweight, their BMI-Z must be equal to or above the 85th percentile, 95th percentile, or +2 standard deviations from the median. Additionally, their weight-for-height z-score should exceed the 97th percentile for their age and sex.
8 RWG: A WAZ change of > 0.67 between birth and 6 months or birth and 24 months of age.

### Use of World Health Organization and CDC growth charts for children aged 0–59 months in the United States [^2e6a214b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Low credibility.

In April 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) released new international growth charts for children aged 0–59 months. Similar to the 2000 CDC growth charts, these charts describe weight for age, length (or stature) for age, weight for length (or stature), and body mass index for age. Whereas the WHO charts are growth standards, describing the growth of healthy children in optimal conditions, the CDC charts are a growth reference, describing how certain children grew in a particular place and time. However, in practice, clinicians use growth charts as standards rather than references. In 2006, CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the American Academy of Pediatrics convened an expert panel to review scientific evidence and discuss the potential use of the new WHO growth charts in clinical settings in the United States. On the basis of input from this expert panel, CDC recommends that clinicians in the United States use the 2006 WHO international growth charts, rather than the CDC growth charts, for children aged < 24 months (available at https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts). The CDC growth charts should continue to be used for the assessment of growth in persons aged 2–19 years. The recommendation to use the 2006 WHO international growth charts for children aged < 24 months is based on several considerations, including the recognition that breastfeeding is the recommended standard for infant feeding. In the WHO charts, the healthy breastfed infant is intended to be the standard against which all other infants are compared; 100% of the reference population of infants were breastfed for 12 months and were predominantly breastfed for at least 4 months. When using the WHO growth charts to screen for possible abnormal or unhealthy growth, use of the 2.3rd and 97.7th percentiles (or ± 2 standard deviations) are recommended, rather than the 5th and 95th percentiles. Clinicians should be aware that fewer U.S. children will be identified as underweight using the WHO charts, slower growth among breastfed infants during ages 3–18 months is normal, and gaining weight more rapidly than is indicated on the WHO charts might signal early signs of overweight.

### Infant weight gain and childhood overweight status in a multicenter, cohort study [^d6341880]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a rapid rate of weight gain in early infancy is associated with overweight status in childhood.

Design

Prospective, cohort study from birth to age 7 years.

Setting

Twelve sites across the United States.

Participants

Twenty-seven thousand, eight hundred ninety-nine (27 899) eligible participants born at full term between 1959 and 1965.

Main Outcome Measure

Overweight status at age 7 years, defined by a body mass index above the 95th percentile of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reference data.

Results

In the 19 397 participants with complete data (69.6%), the prevalence of overweight status at age 7 years was 5.4%. The rate of weight gain during the first 4 months of life (as 100 g/month) was associated with being overweight at age 7 years, after adjustment for several confounding factors: odds ratio: 1.38; 95% confidence interval: 1.32–1.44. This association was present in each birth weight quintile, and remained significant after adjustment for the weight attained at age 1 year (odds ratio: 1.17; 95% confidence interval: 1.11–1.24).

Conclusions

A pattern of rapid weight gain during the first 4 months of life was associated with an increased risk of overweight status at age 7 years, independent of birth weight and weight attained at age 1 year. These findings may lead to new hypotheses regarding the cause of childhood obesity, which may contribute to our understanding of this increasing public health problem in the United States.

### Growth-curve standards and the assessment of early excess weight gain in infancy [^26be97a6]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Increasing overweight and obesity are growing problems among children worldwide. Prevention requires an understanding of when excess weight gain begins and the determinants that place children at risk. The aim of our study was to illustrate how the growth curve used to assess growth influences the interpretation of weight gain and the age of onset of higher weight gains in infancy.

Methods

This was a longitudinal study of Canadian infants from birth to 18 months of age. Infant feeding pattern was recorded monthly, and weight and length of 73 infants were measured at 8 different ages. Weight, length, weight for length, and BMI z scores were compared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000 growth curves and World Health Organization growth standard.

Results

Comparison with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth curves showed that Canadian infants grew similarly or slightly slower than their US counterparts. Using the World Health Organization growth standard, an increase in body weight occurred between 6 and 9 months of age, associated with a change from breastfeeding to formula feeding and introduction of solid foods. When compared with the World Health Organization standards, breastfed infants followed the standards, but formula-fed infants deviated with higher weight for age. When compared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention charts, breastfed infants showed an apparent decline in weight for age beginning at approximately 6 months.

Conclusions

The choice of growth curve is important to interpreting infant growth and identifying the onset of excess weight gain. Identification of the prevalence and age of onset of early excess weight gains among Canadian infants will be best achieved by using the World Health Organization growth standards.

### Infant BMI or weight-for-length and obesity risk in early childhood [^31fe4ecc]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Weight-for-length (WFL) is currently used to assess adiposity under 2 years. We assessed WFL- versus BMI-based estimates of adiposity in healthy infants in determining risk for early obesity.

Methods

Anthropometrics were extracted from electronic medical records for well-child visits for 73949 full-term infants from a large pediatric network. World Health Organization WFL and BMI z scores (WFL-z and BMI-z, respectively) were calculated up to age 24 months. Correlation analyses assessed the agreement between WFL-z and BMI-z and within-subject tracking over time. Logistic regression determined odds of obesity at 2 years on the basis of adiposity classification at 2 months.

Results

Agreement between WFL-z and BMI-z increased from birth to 6 months and remained high thereafter. BMI-z at 2 months was more consistent with measurements at older ages than WFL-z at 2 months. Infants with high BMI (≥ 85th percentile) and reference WFL (5th-85th percentiles) at 2 months had greater odds of obesity at 2 years than those with high WFL (≥ 85th percentile) and reference BMI (5th-85th percentiles; odds ratio, 5.49 vs 1.40; P < .001). At 2 months, BMI had a higher positive predictive value than WFL for obesity at 2 years using cut-points of either the 85th percentile (31% vs 23%) or 97.7th percentile (47% vs 29%).

Conclusions

High BMI in early infancy is more strongly associated with early childhood obesity than high WFL. Forty-seven percent of infants with BMI ≥ 97.7th percentile at 2 months (versus 29% of infants with WFL ≥ 97.7th percentile at 2 months) were obese at 2 years. Epidemiologic studies focused on assessing childhood obesity risk should consider using BMI in early infancy.

Additional challenges in low- and middle-income countries

In low- and middle-income countries, only 50% to 60% of infants born SGA show catch-up growth in either height, weight, or both, due to multiple factors, such as poor maternal and postnatal nutrition, poor hygiene, many infections, and factors associated with low socioeconomic status. Catch-up growth in countries with poor nutrition and relatively low protein dietary content may be delayed up to 4 to 5 years of age. Children of upper socioeconomic status show better catch-up growth. Appropriate local reference charts can be used to monitor growth of children born SGA. Using WHO charts in low-income countries has its problems, as many healthy children fall below the third percentile of WHO charts for both height and weight with relative sparing of weight-for-height. In SGA, this effect is more pronounced, and hence one should give more attention to the growth trajectory than to a single reading of a growth parameter for stunting and wasting.

Given the high prevalence of malnutrition and infections, recommendations may be different beyond the sensitive window of metabolic programming, specifically, the first 3 to 6 months of life. This may only be achieved by changing the feeding policy based on very close monitoring of the growth trajectory — allowing neither failure to thrive nor excessive catch-up in weight. Exclusive breastfeeding has been associated with less rapid catch-up and lower fasting insulin and glucose concentrations, at least in the short term, and is associated with a consistent protective effect against later obesity in numerous observational studies and meta-analyses. Therefore, current WHO policy recommends exclusive breastfeeding or using standard formulas rather than nutrient-enriched formulas up to the age of 6 months. For low-birth-weight infants in extremely impoverished environments, clearly the priority is to prevent malnutrition and growth faltering.

### A picture is worth a thousand words [^a58b1358]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2008). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of weight faltering can be challenging and often controversial. The determination should be made based on careful evaluation of growth parameters, including longitudinal patterns plotted on age- and gender-appropriate growth charts. For children with suspected or diagnosed weight faltering, the initial work-up should be limited, with laboratory tests and studies directed by findings on history and physical examination. Treatment should include nutritional counselling, familial support, and close outpatient follow-up. Hospitalisation may be useful in some cases but should not be used routinely to assist in the diagnostic work-up. Patients with limited response to these interventions may require further evaluation.

### The proportion of weight gain due to change in fat mass in infants with vs without rapid growth [^bf7a42b3]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Many countries recommend using the WHO Growth Standards to identify infants with suboptimal growth. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend using the 2.3rd and 97.7th percentiles. Less guidance, however, is normally provided to identify infants based on change in their percentile position. One of the AAP guidelines for primary care pediatricians is "monitoring for infants who gain excessive weight". They do not provide guidance on what constitutes "excessive", but extensive evidence suggests infant weight (WT) gain greater than +0.67 Z-scores is associated with increased risk for obesity.

Given this association, one might assume that infants with rapid WT gain are gaining greater fat mass per kg increase in WT, but evidence on this point is lacking. In part, this is because most studies have only considered obesity based on body mass index (BMI), which fails to distinguish between fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM). Knowing the proportion of WT gain due to concurrent changes in FM (and FFM) in infants with versus without rapid WT gain is important. Such knowledge may affect whether or not, or the way in which, primary care pediatricians interpret rapid WT gain during infancy as a screening tool for obesity risk.

The US CDC advise that supine length is also monitored against the WHO Standards in the first 2 years of life, but the role of infant linear growth in obesity etiology is often overlooked. There is limited literature on the association of rapid length growth (which can also be defined as a gain greater than +0.67 Z-scores) with obesity risk and underlying changes in body composition, despite 1) the strong correlation between WT and length during infancy, and 2) the fact that BMI varies as a result of both WT and length or height.

Utilizing serial body composition data from air-displacement plethysmography (ADP) between 0 and 6 months and deuterium dilution (DD) between 3 and 24 months, the aim of our study was to investigate how the proportion of WT gain due to concurrent changes in FM differs between (1) infants with rapid versus normal WT gain and (2) infants with rapid versus normal length growth. We also consider "slow" versus normal comparisons and differences in the proportion of BMI change due to fat mass index (FMI) change.

### The proportion of weight gain due to change in fat mass in infants with vs without rapid growth [^cb09cfd7]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to the proportion of ΔWT due to ΔFM being higher in infants with rapid versus normal WT gain, it was lower in infants with slow versus normal WT gain. The relationship between infant WT gain and the amount of fat gained per kg increase in body WT might not, however, be linear. Between 0 and 6 months, the ΔWT due to ΔFM effect size for slow versus normal (−2.9) was weaker than that for rapid versus normal (+ 4.3). This is in agreement with previous research reporting a non-linear relationship between infant WT gain and adolescent BMI, such that the association was weaker at the lower end of the exposure distribution.

While the limitations of using BMI during infancy and early childhood are well known, we did find that mean BMI change between 0 and 6 months largely reflected an increase in mean adiposity. This makes sense given knowledge (1) that the peaks in infant BMI and FM coincide at about 6–9 months of age and (2) that infant BMI is correlated with FM, even more so than are WT-for-length Z-scores. Building on this cross-sectional evidence, serial measurement of BMI at 0 and 6 months may be a justified approach for studying differences between groups of infants in early-life fat accumulation. This does not, however, necessarily mean that BMI change can be used to accurately assess the fat accumulation of an individual infant. Our data show, for example, that the changes in FMI as a proportion of BMI change varied greatly between individual infants, ranging from less than 20% to over 100%. Further, between 3 and 24 months, BMI change is likely to be a very poor indicator of changes in fat mass, with highly variable (e.g. between sexes) predictive ability.

### WHO child growth standards in context: the baby-bod project-observational study in tasmania [^82146030]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

One hundred and fifty-one male and 164 female infants were included in the analysis at birth (table 1). Average gestational age was 39.5 weeks (range 37–42 weeks) for both sexes. Male infants were larger compared with female infants as indicated by the significantly higher birth weight, length and head circumference (p < 0.05 for all, table 1). In terms of body composition, male infants had higher FFM (3.0 vs 2.9 kg) and lower FM (0.3 vs 0.4 kg) compared with female infants (table 1). Neither WFL nor BMI was different between sexes.

Table 1
Descriptive characteristics (means ± SD) of male and female infants at birth

It is noteworthy that a higher proportion of male infants were in the extremes (ie, < 3rd and > 97th percentile) of the growth spectrum. A 2×3 factorial ANOVA revealed no statistical differences (p = 0.292 for sex×growth category) for %FM or %FFM between male and female infants in the different ranges of the WFL spectrum at birth (table 2). However, significant within-group differences (p < 0.001 for growth category) were evident for both parameters at this time point. In both sexes, infants above the 97th percentile had the highest body fat levels and lowest lean muscle mass. Longitudinal evaluation of all infants revealed divergent body composition trajectories (figure 1A–C and online supplemental figure 1) over the first 6 months. Quantile regression analysis for %FM (figure 1A–C) revealed that compared with birth, the conditional median for %FM adjusted for WFL increased by 3.9% (95% CI 2.2% to 5.6%) at 3 months and by 1.9% (95% CI 0.3% to 4.5%) at 6 months — indicating a possible convergence of %FM levels by 6 months of age.

### Continuous growth reference from 24th week of gestation to 24 months by gender [^cf689156]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Growth charts and child growth assessment have become prime global instruments in child health practice over the 30 years. An updated, continuous growth standard that bridges size at birth values with postnatal growth values can improve child growth screening and monitoring.

Methods

This novel growth chart was constructed from two sources of information. Size at birth (weight, length and head circumference) reference values were updated based on information of normal deliveries (i.e. singleton live births without severe congenital malformation, with healthy mothers and born vaginally) from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry, 1990–1999 (n = 810393). Weight was evaluated using logarithmic transformation as for postnatal weight. Standard deviations were estimated from data within the empirical mean ± 1.0 SD for each gestational week and gender. These values were smoothed by empirical curve-fitting together with values from our recently published postnatal growth reference including 3650 longitudinally followed children from birth to final height 9. Timescale and weight axes were made logarithmic in order to magnify the early time part of the graph.

Results

This study presents the first continuous gender specific growth chart from birth irrespective of gestational age at birth until 2 years of age for weight, length and head circumference. Birth weight at 40 weeks of gestation increased approximately 100 gram and length increased only 1 mm compared with earlier Swedish reference from 1977–81. The curve is now less S-shaped as compared with earlier curves and compared with 4 curves from other countries and with more constant variation over the whole range.

Conclusion

Our values picture the unrestricted pattern of growth improving the detection of a deviating growth pattern, when the growth of an individual infant is plotted on the charts. Especially for very preterm infants age corrected growth can be more easily evaluated although it must be recognized that the early comparison is with what is estimated as normal growth in uterus. The reference values are useful in child health care systems for population screening, but also in research or in the clinic for evaluating various growth promoting interventions - either nutritional, surgical or therapeutic - that might affect a child in early life.

### Assessing the optimal time interval between growth measurements using a combined data set of weights and heights from 5948 infants [^a3247b75]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidance on the optimum interval between measurements in infancy is not evidence based. We used routine data to explore how measurement error and short-term variation ('noise') might affect interpretation of infant weight and length gain ('signal') over different time intervals.

Method

Using a database of weights and lengths from 5948 infants aged 0–12 months, all pairs of measurements per child 2, 4 and 8 weeks apart were extracted. Separately, 20 babies aged 2–10 months were weighed on six occasions over 3 days to estimate the SD of the weight difference between adjacent measurements (= 116 g). Values of 116 g and 0.5 cm for 'noise' were then used to model its impact on (a) the estimated velocity centile and (b) the chance of seeing no growth during the interval, in individuals.

Results

The average gain in weight and length was much larger than the corresponding SD over 8-week and 4-week time intervals, but not over 2 weeks. Noise tended to make apparent velocity less extreme; after age 6 months, a 2-week velocity that appeared to be on to the ninth centile, would truly be on the second-third centile if measured with no noise. For 2-week intervals, there was a 16% risk of no apparent growth by age 10 months.

Conclusions

Growth in infancy is so rapid that the change in measurements 4–8 weeks apart is unlikely ever to be obscured by noise, but after age 6 months, measurements 2 weeks or less apart should be treated with caution when assessing growth faltering.

### Urban parents' perceptions of healthy infant growth [^88b6aaef]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

To examine how urban parents' perceptions of healthy infant size and growth relate to objective weight-for-length percentiles of their children, parents of 222 (69% minority) 6- to 27-month-old infants were surveyed. In all, 41% of parents said growth charts had never been explained to them, and 31% were not confident they understood the meaning of chart percentiles. A total of 20% of parents preferred their child weigh ≥ 75th percentile, and these children had higher mean weight-for-length percentiles than their peers (P = 0.05). Similarly, 37% of parents agreed that "a chubby baby is a healthy baby", and these children had higher mean weight-for-length percentiles than others in the cohort (P = 0.02). Additionally, 58% of parents ranked a growth curve with consistent growth at the 10th percentile as the "least healthy" of 6 infant growth curves. Growth charts are not consistently explained to or understood by urban parents, and many prefer early life growth patterns associated with later obesity.

### Comparison of changes in growth percentiles of US children on CDC 2000 growth charts with corresponding changes on WHO 2006 growth charts [^e29a086d]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Longitudinal data with 37 964 length and weight measurements from 10 844 children who participated in the California Child Health and Development Study was used to compare the proportion of children aged ≤ 24 months who crossed major percentile lines on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2000 growth charts with the percentage who crossed corresponding lines on the World Health Organization (WHO) 2006 growth charts. Percentage of children aged ≤ 24 months who crossed at least 2 major percentile lines for length-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length according to CDC 2000 charts were compared with the percentage who did so according to WHO 2006 charts. The results from this analysis suggest that pediatricians who monitor children's growth on the basis of WHO 2006 growth charts may be more likely to refer children aged < 6 months and less likely to refer those aged 6 to 12 months for further evaluation for failure to thrive.

Background

Early rapid weight gain in infancy contributes to childhood obesity

Early childhood obesity is a serious health problem. In 2019, 38.2 million U.S. children less than 5 years old were overweight or obese, with greater prevalence among low- and middle-income families. Of those under 2 years, 8.1% had high weight-for-recumbent length (i.e. at or above the 95th percentile). Further, obese children are more likely to become obese adults. Rapid weight gain (RWG) in the first 6 months of infancy, defined as a greater than 0.67 positive change in weight-for-age Z-score (difference between centile lines on standard growth charts), is associated with greater total weight gain from 0 to 12 months and greater weight-for-length and weight-for-age percentiles at 36 months. It also increases the odds of obesity across the life course and relates to adverse health outcomes later in life, including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Further, RWG in the first 3 months is more predictive of poor cardiometabolic outcomes than any other 3-month period in the first year of life. Despite robust, globally diverse cohort data accounting for numerous confounding factors present from conception to birth on childhood obesity, few studies have focused on RWG determinants and timing in the birth-to-6-month period.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^fa31a775]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

GROWTH AND FALTERING GROWTH (FG)

Growth

Growth reflects a complex interaction between nutritional, genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. It is "programmed" to occur within a "critical time frame" or "epoch" which if missed may not be recoverable. This means that even "short-term" deprivation during a "critical epoch", for example, infancy, may be paralleled by long-term effects on organ growth and function.

As a "mirror of health", the measurement of growth is an important and noninvasive tool during infancy and childhood, reflecting not only the health and nutritional status of an infant but also the quality of life of a population. Yet, what is or is not normal growth is not always clear. Normal is what happens frequently but does not imply healthiness; values outside the confidence range do not necessarily imply poor health. Nevertheless, growth generally "tracks" within 1 centile space.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for intrauterine growth restriction, more specifically with respect to postnatal infant surveillance (nutrition), ICG-SGA 2023 guidelines recommend to monitor weight, length, head circumference, and weight for length or BMI every 3 months during the first year of life, 6-monthly in the second year of life, and yearly thereafter until the child reaches their genetic height potential or height is in the normal range. Plot the parameters on an appropriate growth chart and assess for adequacy.

### Anthropometric and clinical correlates of fat mass in healthy term infants at 6 months of age [^35885251]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is one of the few studies measuring FM at 6 months of age using ADP in a group of healthy term infants. Our results showed that anthropometric measurements are highly correlated with FM in infants. SFS and WC were strongly associated to FM.

In our study, the model that best correlated anthropometry to FM at 6 months of age included SFS + WC. We observed that when more anthropometric variables were included in the model, the strength of the association with FM improved, as other authors have reported.

The increase in the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity worldwide has encouraged the study of body composition during early stages of life. In Mexico, the prevalence of overweight/obesity in children has been increasing over the years, where one out of every three children (5–11 years old) has this problem. Weight is still the most frequently used indicator in clinical practice to evaluate growth and morbidity in this age group. FM measurement should be the basis for obesity diagnosis and to identify metabolic risk. Early detection of alterations in FM appears critical; therefore, FM should be considered an outcome of nutrition and lifestyle interventions in infancy. Predictions equations using different anthropometric measurements for estimating FM in infants are needed and will facilitate this task in clinical settings.

On the other hand, BMI has been proposed to assess growth and nutritional status because it is known to correlate with body fatness and increases the risk of obesity-related diseases in adults. However, some inherent limitations of BMI are that it does not distinguish between FM and FFM, it does not reflect FM distribution and the relative contributions of FM and FFM to body weight vary by ethnicity. So, there are still concerns about its use in pediatric population. In older children (≥ 7 years old), authors have found some misclassifications of obesity diagnosis using BMI in comparison to body fatness. They stated that the screening ability of BMI varied across race-ethnic groups, and also across the extremes of FM. In infants (1, 4, and 7 months old), Bell et al. found that BMI is limited as a surrogate for adiposity and (especially) adiposity changes. However, there is still controversy.

### Can extrauterine growth approximate intrauterine growth? Should it? [^c3901b4d]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Most studies evaluating the growth of preterm infants use the so-called intrauterine growth curve and reference fetus as standards. These curves might not be the optimal standards, however, for several reasons. The curves were constructed from small numbers of infants with uncertainty about gestational age, reasons for preterm birth, and, for body-composition data, the reasons for the death of the infant. Second, preterm infants after birth are not comparable with fetuses, being in a completely different environment and receiving a completely different nutrition. For instance, a higher percentage of body fat in preterm infants might well be an adequate adaptation to their environment. To get preterm infants to adhere to their supposed growth curve percentile, catch-up growth is needed. Recent studies indicate that catch-up growth might be advantageous for brain development. It might at the same time increase the incidence of cardiovascular disease in later life. The use of intrauterine growth curves to evaluate postnatal growth needs a critical reevaluation.

### Growth charts: what to know… [^0e67960d]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Growth Charts: What to know General Percentiles are the most commonly used clinical indicator to assess the size and growth patterns of individual children in the United States. Percentiles rank the position of an individual by indicating what percent of the reference population the individual would equal or exceed. For example, on the weight-for-age growth charts, a 5-year-old girl whose weight is at the 25th percentile, weighs the same or more than 25 percent of the reference population of 5-year-old girls, and weighs less than 75 percent of the 5-year-old girls in the reference population. The WHO growth charts establish the growth of the breastfed infant as the norm for growth. Healthy breastfed infants typically put on weight more slowly than formula fed infants in the first year of life. Formula fed infants gain weight more rapidly after about 3 months of age. Differences in weight patterns continue even after complementary foods are introduced.

Specifically, the 95th percentile, the cut point for obesity, would shift upward. Using a new 95th percentile to define obesity would lead to some children being below the 95th percentile who were above using the 2000 charts. As an example, during 2017-March 2020, 19. 7% of US children and adolescents were above the 95th percentile of the 2000 CDC BMI-for-age growth charts and had obesity. This means that you should use the first line's values for ages 0–8 months, the second line for ages 9–23 months, and the third line for ages 24–36 months to find the 5th percentile value for length for age of males 0–36 months. Each of the four other values refers to the constants for the polynomial equation. Above the 95th percentile, the percentile version of the growth chart provides reference curves up to the 99. 99 th percentile, while the z score version provides reference curves up to a z score of
5.

Note that percentile and z score values are interchangeable and are just expressed on different scales. Both the percentile and z score values give an indication of how far away a child's BMI is from the median age- and sex-specific BMI value.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^6b88fc1a]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Faltering growth in infants and children < 2 years of age is a common problem regularly seen by health care professionals. It has multiple causes and occurs due to disease-related and non-disease related factors, and in low-, middle-, and high- income settings. However, in all settings it is essential to detect FG, address underlying causes and support catch-up growth where this is indicated.

Nutritional recommendations for children of normal weight — general recommendations for children and adolescents fall into age categories related to overall growth and development stages. For infants from 0 to 12 months of age, guidelines are further divided into birth to 4 months, 4–6 months, 6–8 months, 8–10 months, and 10–12 months due to the rapid physiologic and metabolic changes during the child's first year of life. Recommendations from 0 to 12 months emphasize breastfeeding whenever possible, and fortified formula may be used when breastmilk is not available.

### The role of the pediatrician in primary prevention of obesity [^ca344aa1]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Identification of children at risk of obesity — pediatricians should identify children at risk of developing obesity. From birth through 23 months of age, weight-for-age and weight-for-length should be monitored by using the new World Health Organization normative growth charts based on healthy breastfed infants. For children aged 2 years and older, BMI should be calculated and plotted on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts at every health care visit so that interventions can be implemented when a child starts to cross BMI percentiles upward, even before they approach the 85th or the 95th percentile. A study found that only 46% of pediatricians surveyed routinely calculated and plotted BMI, though more recent evidence shows substantial improvement. Prenatal risk factors include parental obesity, maternal gestational diabetes, and maternal smoking during pregnancy, and child risk factors include never being breastfed, rapid infant weight gain, short sleep duration, depression, and having a disability. Additional behavioral risks can be identified through the nutrition, sedentary behaviors, and physical activities questions that are part of the Bright Futures templates.

### Assessment of growth: variations according to references and growth parameters used [^1884c7ef]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have investigated associations between early growth and future risk of obesity, but the methods used varied considerably. Different growth references or parameters can be considered. Growth references from France, the United States (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United Kingdom were compared with World Health Organization (WHO) standards. For the first 3 mo of life, all references showed markedly lower values for weight, length, and body mass index (BMI) compared with WHO standards, but after the age of 6 mo references were generally higher than WHO standards. Compared with nonbreastfed infants, the growth of breastfed infants was generally closer to that of WHO standards. Because data in the WHO standards were collected on infants who were breastfed, the difference between references and WHO standards might be mainly attributable to feeding practices. Epidemiologic and clinical studies evaluated the consequences of using either WHO standards or national references and showed differences according to the reference used. Analyses of children's weight curves by physicians showed significant differences in the interpretation of child growth and therefore in the advice given to parents. Finally, the effect of using different growth parameters to predict future risk of obesity was examined and showed that weight and length gains may be good candidates to study future risks. In conclusion, because the reference or parameters used to assess growth have an important effect on the interpretation of growth, it is crucial to be aware of the consequences of the methods used in clinical or epidemiologic contexts.

### Prevalence of low and high BMI during the first 3 years of life: using New Zealand national electronic health data [^91f6908f]. Pediatric Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Data on body mass index (BMI) in infants and toddlers worldwide are lacking, relative to older age groups.

Objectives

To describe the growth (weight, length/height, head circumference, and BMI z-score) of New Zealand children under the age of 3years, and examine differences by sociodemographic characteristics (sex, ethnicity, and deprivation).

Methods

Electronic health data were collected by Whānau Āwhina Plunket, who provide free 'Well Child' services for approximately 85% of newborn babies in New Zealand. Data from children under the age of 3, who had their weight and length/height measured between 2017 and 2019, were included. The prevalence of BMI (WHO child growth standards) ≤ 2nd, ≥ 85th, and ≥ 95th percentiles were determined.

Results

Between 12weeks and 27months of age, the percentage of infants ≥ 85th BMI percentile increased from 10.8% (95% CI, 10.4%-11.2%) to 35.0% (34.2%-35.9%). The percentage of infants with high BMI (≥ 95th percentile) also increased, particularly between 6 months (6.4%; 95% CI, 6.0%-6.7%) and 27months (16.4%; 15.8%-17.1%). By contrast, the percentage of infants with low BMI (≤ 2nd percentile) appeared steady between 6weeks and 6 months, and declined at older ages. The prevalence of infants with a high BMI appears to increase substantially from 6 months across sociodemographic characteristics, with a widening prevalence gap by ethnicity occurring from 6 months, mirroring that of infants with a low BMI.

Conclusions

The number of children with high BMI increases rapidly between 6 months and 27months of age, suggesting this is an important timeframe for monitoring and preventive action. Future work should investigate the longitudinal growth trajectories of these children to determine if any particular patterns predict later obesity and what strategies could effectively change them.

### The proportion of weight gain due to change in fat mass in infants with vs without rapid growth [^3b370577]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pediatricians should monitor growth with the understanding that on average, infants crossing upward through the WT centiles are not just getting heavier, they are putting on more FM per kg increase in WT. This does not mean that all infants with rapid WT gain are putting on too much fat. Indeed, in some infants, rapid WT gain and accompanying increases in adiposity may actually be a good thing (and not lead to obesity). Conversely, on average, infants with versus without rapid length growth gain proportionally the same amount of FM and FFM.

Enriched formula use and complementary feeding after NICU discharge in preterm infants — Randomized trials showing benefits of fortification discontinued supplementation at 3 months (IB). At a minimum, enriched formula supplementation should be continued until nutritional monitoring on the fortified diet has been adequate for several months. In addition, it is important to prevent overnutrition; if the infant's growth is rapidly increasing such that the weight/length percentile is > 85%, revise dietary supplementation. Most experts recommend starting complementary feedings at ~ 6 months' corrected age.

### Unintentional error in formula preparation and its simulated impact on infant weight and adiposity [^98e298f5]. Pediatric Obesity (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Accelerated weight gain in infancy is a public health issue and is likely due to feeding behaviours.

Objectives

To test the accuracy of individuals to dispense infant formula as compared with recommended serving sizes and to estimate the effect of dispensing inaccuracy on infant growth.

Methods

Fifty-three adults dispensed infant formula powder for three servings of 2, 4, 6, and 8 fl oz bottles, in random order. The weight of dispensed infant formula powder was compared with the recommended serving size weight on the nutrition label. A novel mathematical model was used to estimate the impact of formula dispensing on infant weight and adiposity.

Results

Nineteen percent of bottles (20 of 636) prepared contained the recommended amount of infant formula powder. Three percent were underdispensed, and 78% of bottles were overdispensed, resulting in 11% additional infant formula powder. Mathematical modelling feeding 11% above energy requirements exclusively for 6 months for male and female infants suggested infants at the 50th percentile for weight at birth would reach the 75th percentile with increased adiposity by 6 months.

Conclusions

Inaccurate measurement of infant formula powder and overdispensing, which is highly prevalent, specifically, may contribute to rapid weight gain and increased adiposity in formula-fed infants.

### Designing the new UK-WHO growth charts to enhance assessment of growth around birth [^65245464]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2012). Low credibility.

The decision to adopt the new WHO standard in the UK necessitated substantial changes to the neonatal section of the chart, including separation of the preterm UK birth weight reference from the WHO standard. The evidence-based design process has led to several novel features that could be generally applied in other chart designs, and revealed uncertainties leading to inconsistencies in charting. Failing to plot the birth weight of term infants at age 0 can lead to spurious centile crossing in the early weeks of life, particularly among infants at the extreme of gestation. Users will need training to use the charts, but this should improve overall understanding and the use of charts.

### Postnatal weight increase and growth velocity of very low birthweight infants [^f49f8b05]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Only a few studies have dealt with postnatal growth velocity of very low birthweight (VLBW) infants.

Objective

To analyse weight growth kinetics of VLBW infants from birth to over 2 years of age.

Patients

A total of 262 VLBW infants were selected; inaccurate estimate of gestational age, major congenital anomalies, necrotising enterocolitis, death, and loss to follow up within the first year were the exclusion criteria.

Methods

Body weight was recorded daily up to 28 days or up to discontinuation of parenteral nutrition, weekly up to discharge, then at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months of corrected age. Individual growth profiles were fitted with a seven constant, exponential-logistic function suitable for modelling weight loss and weight recovery, two peaks, and the subsequent slow decrease in growth velocity.

Results

After a postnatal weight loss, all infants showed a late neonatal peak of growth velocity between the 7th and 21st weeks; most also experienced an early neonatal peak between the 2nd and 6th week. VLBW infants who were small for gestational age and those with major morbidities grew less than reference VLBW infants who were the appropriate size for gestational age without major morbidities: at 2 years of age, the difference in weight was about 860 g. The more severe growth impairment seen in VLBW infants with major morbidities is almost entirely due to the reduced height of the late neonatal peak of velocity.

Conclusions

The growth model presented here should be a useful tool for evaluating to what extent different pathological conditions or nutritional and medical care protocols affect growth kinetics.

### The proportion of weight gain due to change in fat mass in infants with vs without rapid growth [^11b38483]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Compared to other periods of development, infancy is a period characterized by particularly rapid WT gain; however, proper interpretation of WT gain or WT loss depend on assumptions regarding tissue-specific dynamics, including the relative gain or loss of lean mass and adipose tissue mass. For example, it is widely assumed that infants who grow quickly are accruing relatively greater adipose tissue than those who are growing more slowly, which then leads to the increased risk of obesity in childhood. However, sufficiently large datasets having longitudinal infant body composition information to objectively test this assumption have been lacking, with most studies having recruited a small number of participants from a single study site and in higher income settings. The studies that do exist have typically been used to produce growth charts and/or investigate the correlates of infant body composition. The present study has a different focus and provides novel data on the proportion of ΔWT due to ΔFM. The key finding is that, between 0–6 and 3–24 months, the proportion of ΔWT due to ΔFM was higher (and consequently the proportion of ΔWT due to ΔFFM was lower) in infants with rapid versus normal WT gain, but not in infants with rapid versus normal linear growth.

A dose of nirsevimab should be administered during or preceding the second RSV season to infants aged 8 months through 19 months with the following risk factors: children with severe immunocompromise (including that caused by HIV); children with chronic lung disease of prematurity who required medical support (chronic corticosteroid therapy, diuretic therapy, or supplemental oxygen) any time during the 6-month period before the start of the second RSV season; and children with cystic fibrosis who have either manifestations of severe lung disease (previous hospitalization for pulmonary exacerbation in the first year of life or abnormalities on chest imaging that persist when stable) or weight-for-length less than 10th percentile.

### Shifts in percentiles of growth during early childhood: analysis of longitudinal data from the California child health and development study [^c47eb748]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To document growth-velocity changes across major percentiles during the preschool years.

Design

Analyses of longitudinal data using height-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-height, and body mass index (BMI)-for-age percentiles were performed to examine crossing of major percentiles of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000 growth charts. The 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles were defined as the major percentiles.

Setting

Data from the California Child Health and Development Study were used.

Subjects

A total of 10,844 children up to 60 months of age, with 44,296 height and weight measurements, were included in our final analysis.

Results

For height-for-age, 32% of children between birth and 6 months of age, 13% to 15% of children between 6 and 24 months of age, and 2% to 10% of children between 24 and 60 months of age crossed 2 major percentiles. For weight-for-age, 39% of children between birth and 6 months of age, 6% to 15% of children between 6 and 24 months of age, and 1% to 5% of children between 24 and 60 months of age crossed 2 major percentiles. In contrast, for weight-for-height, 62% of children between birth and 6 months of age, 20% to 27% of children between 6 and 24 months of age, and 6% to 15% of children between 24 to 60 months of age crossed 2 major percentiles. Similar to the pattern observed for weight-for-height, 8% to 15% of children between 24 and 60 months of age crossed 2 major BMI-for-age percentiles. During the preschool years, weight-for-height had the highest percentages of children who crossed 2 major percentiles, and weight-for-age had the lowest percentages of children who crossed 2 major percentiles among these 3 indices.

Conclusions

Shifts in growth rates were very common for children from birth to 6 months of age, somewhat less common for children 6 to 24 months of age, and least common for children 24 to 60 months of age. Shifts in weight-for-height occurred more frequently than did other growth changes. Pediatricians must consider the prevalence of growth rate shifts during infancy and early childhood before they counsel parents regarding growth or refer children for additional evaluations of growth.

### Clinician diagnoses of failure to thrive before and after switch to World Health Organization growth curves [^d8f74c24]. Academic Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate change in the incidence of failure to thrive (FTT) based on selected growth percentile criteria and diagnostic codes before and after a switch in growth curves.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of children 2 to 24 months of age in a large primary care network that switched its default growth curve from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reference to the World Health Organization (WHO) standards in 2012. We compared the incidence of FTT defined by growth percentile criteria (using the default growth curve at the time of each measurement) and by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes in the 3 years before and after the CDC-WHO switch using an interrupted time series analysis. We performed these analyses stratified by age group (≤ 6 months and > 6–24 months).

Results

We evaluated 83,299 children. Among those ≤ 6 months, increases in FTT incidence were found in both growth-percentile and clinician-diagnosis criteria at the CDC-WHO switch (P < .05). Among those > 6 to 24 months, decreases in FTT incidence were found by growth-percentile criteria at the CDC-WHO switch (P < .05), but no significant changes were found in FTT incidence by diagnostic codes.

Conclusions

When switching from the CDC to the WHO growth curves, changes in the incidence of FTT by growth-percentile and clinician-diagnosis criteria differed for younger versus older infants. Factors beyond growth likely influence the decision to diagnose a child as having FTT and may differ in younger compared to older infants.

### Extending World Health Organization weight-for-age reference curves to older children [^e3eff27a]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

WHO charts routinely display curves at 1, 2 and 3 SD (z-scores) above and below the median, (i.e. centiles 0.1, 3, 15, 50, 85, 97 and 99.9), which results in fewer lines between the 3 rd and 97 th centiles. The bootstrap results suggest that the 99.9 th centiles for weight and BMI should be interpreted with caution. With a non-normal distribution, these outlying centiles — each representing ~1/1000 children — are simply difficult to estimate precisely with only 673 ± 204 (mean ± SD) boys/yearly interval and 646 ± 185 girls/yearly interval between 5–19y (NCHS-R). To address these concerns, our new charts remove the 0.1 and 99.9 centile lines. Instead, we implement the more familiar CDC choice of centiles (3, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90 and 97 for height and weight and 3, 10, 25, 50, 85, and 97 for BMI), to provide a more granular description within the normal range and to more easily detect aberrations in growth at an earlier stage. This is particularly important for weight-for-age, where failure-to-thrive is often defined by crossing 2 centile lines.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^33fe5fef]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

The Difference Between Catch-Up Growth and Growth Acceleration

Growth acceleration is defined as upward-centile crossing for WFA and, in contrast to catch-up growth, is not in response to FG. It occurs spontaneously [eg, in small for gestational age (SGA) babies] and can be promoted, for example, by overfeeding or formula-feeding compared to breast-feeding. One proposed definition is an increase in WFA z score of ≥ 1.0. Both catch-up growth and growth acceleration involve upward centile crossing in weight, but only catch-up growth follows recovery from illness or a period of under-nutrition (Figure 1).

This distinction between faster growth as a result of recovery catch-up growth or growth acceleration has different consequences for health outcomes. In contrast to the generally accepted short-term and long-term health benefits of promoting catch-up growth following growth faltering, growth acceleration for weight is associated with adverse effects on long-term health. For example, upward centile crossing for weight in infancy has been associated with later obesity in 45 of 46 studies (summarized in 6 systematic reviews including an individual-level meta-analysis in 47,661 participants from 10 cohorts). These associations are seen in both high-income and low-income countries (including South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, China, Sri Lanka, and India), for both weight gain and linear growth, in infants born preterm or at term, in infants with normal or low birthweight for gestation, and in both breast-fed and formula-fed infants. The effect size is large, with relative risk of obesity associated with faster infant weight gain ranging from 1.2 to as high as 5.7 (as reviewed in).

### How does maternal and child feeding behavior relate to weight gain and failure to thrive? Data from a prospective birth cohort [^11b9b0b8]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to study the influences of child and maternal feeding behavior on weight gain and failure to thrive in the first year of life.

Methods

The Millennium Infant Study recruited a population birth cohort in Northeast England shortly after birth and studied them prospectively to the age of 13 months. Parents completed questionnaires at 6 weeks and 4, 8, and 12 months. Appetite was rated on a 5-point scale at each age, and a core group of questions was used to generate scores of oromotor dysfunction, avoidant eating behavior, maternal feeding anxiety, and response to food refusal. Routinely collected weights were used to assess weight gain using the thrive index (TI); weight faltering was defined as TI below the 5th percentile from birth to age 6 weeks or 4, 8, or 12 months.

Results

Of 923 eligible infants, 75% of the mothers returned at least 1 questionnaire and ≥ 2 weights. Weight gain to 6 weeks was independently related to appetite and oromotor dysfunction rated at 6 weeks. Appetite rated at 6 weeks and 12 months both independently predicted weight gain to 12 months. Some avoidant eating behavior was seen in most children by 12 months old, but there was no relationship with weight gain or faltering after adjustment for appetite. However, the extent to which caregivers responded to food refusal was a significant inverse predictor of weight gain, even after adjustment for appetite.

Conclusions

Inherent child appetite characteristics seem to be an important risk factor for weight faltering and failure to thrive, but high maternal promotion of feeding may also have an adverse influence.

### Field testing of the 2006 World Health Organization growth charts from birth to 2 years: assessment of hospital undernutrition and overnutrition rates and the usefulness of BMI [^7a54b5c4]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently released a growth standard, a first attempt at describing how children should grow in an ideal environment. These charts introduce body mass index (BMI)-for-age percentiles for children younger than 2 years. Adopting the WHO standard may affect the number of children screened to require follow-up; hence, field testing needs to be completed in a tertiary care center where the incidence of suboptimal nutrition is high. The objectives of this study were to quantify differences between the new WHO and 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts for children younger than 2 years. The interchangeability of the WHO weight-for-length and WHO BMI percentiles was also assessed.

Methods

Percentile scores were computed for children younger than 2 years (n = 547) admitted to a pediatric tertiary health care center in Toronto, Canada.

Results

The WHO standard identified more children younger than 2 years as at risk of overweight/obesity compared with the CDC reference (21.0% vs 16.6%, ≥ 85th weight-for-length percentile) and fewer children as wasted (18.6% vs 23.0%, < 5th weight-for-length percentile). The WHO BMI-for-age and WHO weight-for-length percentiles were highly correlated (r2 = 0.83) but not interchangeable. For approximately 9% of all children, and approximately 16% of those aged ≤ 6 months, BMI-for-age and weight-for-length percentiles differed by > 25 percentile points.

Conclusions

These data describe for the first time the magnitude of differences in the number of children screened as undernourished (4.4% decrease) or overnourished (4.4% increase) with adoption of the WHO standard in a tertiary care setting. Furthermore, the WHO's BMI-for-age and weight-for-length percentiles for children younger than 2 years are correlated but are not interchangeable.

### Extending World Health Organization weight-for-age reference curves to older children [^726df2d3]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The 2006 WHO growth standard (0–5y) is based on the MGRS, which examined 8,440 breastfed infants and children from 6 countries. The MGRS combined a longitudinal follow-up and a cross-sectional survey of children; families were carefully selected to ensure conditions favoring achievement of their full genetic growth potential. In contrast, the core data for the 2007 WHO growth reference derive from a historical North American cohort previously used to develop the 1977 NCHS Growth Charts and their 2000 CDC revision. To smooth the transition between the WHO standard and reference charts at age 5, these core NCHS data were merged with cross-sectional observations from the MGRS (ages 18–71 months). The data were further selected through exclusion of ~3% of the population for 'unhealthy' weight-for-height indices less than the 0.135 th (−3 SD) or greater than the 97.7 th (+2 SD) centiles, in order to achieve a "non-obese sample with equal height". Importantly, the resulting reference charts align much better at age 19y with the usual adult definitions of overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m²) and obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²), which correspond to WHO BMI centiles 85 (+1 SD) and 97 (+2 SD).

CPEG acknowledges the rigorous standards for data collection and analysis used by the WHO and promotes these new growth charts with emphasis on the use of BMI. Nevertheless, in a recent survey by the Canadian Paediatric Society, almost half (49.7%) of chart users cited the lack of weight-for-age reference for older children as a hindrance. This is particularly true for health-care workers following children with systemic illnesses, where weight loss may reflect disease activity even before it impacts on statural growth. In both infants and older children, correct interpretation of BMI changes also requires concurrent inspection of height and weight-for-age. In addition, weight-for-age z-scores are important for both individual and population screening, especially in the assessment of underweight, where weight-for-age z-scores are an independent predictor of mortality and an important clinical research tool.

### Centers for disease control and prevention 2000 growth charts for the United States: improvements to the 1977 national center for health statistics version [^acf550eb]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a clinical version of the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts and to compare them with the previous version, the 1977 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) growth charts.

Methods

The 2000 CDC percentile curves were developed in 2 stages. In the first stage, the empirical percentiles were smoothed by a variety of parametric and nonparametric procedures. To obtain corresponding percentiles and z scores, we approximated the smoothed percentiles using a modified LMS estimation procedure in the second stage. The charts include of a set of curves for infants, birth to 36 months of age, and a set for children and adolescents, 2 to 20 years of age.

Results

The charts represent a cross-section of children who live in the United States; breastfed infants are represented on the basis of their distribution in the US population. The 2000 CDC growth charts more closely match the national distribution of birth weights than did the 1977 NCHS growth charts, and the disjunction between weight-for-length and weight-for-stature or length-for-age and stature-for-age found in the 1977 charts has been corrected. Moreover, the 2000 CDC growth charts can be used to obtain both percentiles and z scores. Finally, body mass index-for-age charts are available for children and adolescents 2 to 20 years of age.

Conclusion

The 2000 CDC growth charts are recommended for use in the United States. Pediatric clinics should make the transition from the 1977 NCHS to the 2000 CDC charts for routine monitoring of growth in infants, children, and adolescents.

### The risk of obesity by assessing infant growth against the UK-WHO charts compared to the UK90 reference: findings from the born in bradford birth cohort study [^1d2b07a4]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The new growth charts in the UK, the UK-WHO charts, comprise prescriptive data from the WHO standard between two weeks and four years of age. Little is known about the development of obesity risk in normal UK infants, who are necessarily not fed according to the WHO recommendations and do not live in constraint-free environments (the selection criteria of the WHO standard source sample), using the new charts. Here, we investigated infant growth trajectories and traits indicative of childhood obesity using the UK-WHO charts, with the aim to clearly document the implications of adopting the new charts on UK growth monitoring practice.

Methods

Mixed effects models were applied to serial weight and length data from 2181 infants (1187 White; 994 Pakistani) in the Born in Bradford birth cohort study to produce curves from 10 days to 15 months of age. Individual monthly estimates were converted to Z-scores and were plotted by sex and ethnic group. The relative risks (RR) of traits indicative of childhood obesity, including high BMI and rapid weight gain, using the UK-WHO charts compared to the previously used UK90 reference were calculated for all infants together and for White and Pakistani infants separately.

Results

Both ethnic groups demonstrated patterns of growth similar to the UK-WHO charts in length but not in weight. The resulting pattern for BMI was remarkable, with an average gain of 1.0 Z-score between two and 12 months of age. The UK-WHO charts were significantly (p < 0.05) more likely than the UK90 reference to classify BMI above the 91st centile after age six months (RR 1.427–2.151) and weight and BMI gain between birth (one month for BMI) and 12 months of age greater than two centile bands (RR 1.214 and 1.470, respectively).

Conclusions

The change to the UK-WHO charts means that normal UK infants risk being diagnosed as being on a trajectory toward childhood obesity. National estimates of obesity will have to be recalculated for previous years to allow longitudinal comparison. The new charts do not allow a focused prevention effort for targeting programmes at infants most at risk of becoming obese, because the use of the 91st or 98th centile on the UK-WHO charts will identify many more infants as being at risk than the same centiles on the UK90 reference. Now more than ever, research is needed to develop a large scale childhood obesity prevention programme which could ideally be integrated with routine infant growth monitoring practice.

### Pathways into and out of overweight and obesity from infancy to mid-childhood [^d9d305c5]. Pediatric Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Results

At 12 months, 5% of infants had high weight (≥ 2 SD) and 26% raised or high weight (≥ 1 SD). At 5 years, 4% of children had BMI ≥ 2 SD and 21% had BMI ≥ 1 SD, while by 8 years, 6% had BMI ≥ 2 SD and 23% had BMI ≥ 1 SD. Rates of high weight at 12 months varied from 2% to 8% by cohort and gender, while 16–31% had raised or high weight. The rates of obesity at 5 and 8 years varied from 2% to 9%, while combined overweight and obesity varied from 14% to 35% at 5 years and 17–28% at 8 years (Table). There were around 2400 children with data at each age.

Infants with raised or high weight at birth showed a strong tendency to regress towards normal weight by 3 months (Table 1). For example, in girls, 74% of those with raised weight and 54% of those with high weight at birth had reverted to normal weight by 3 months. After 3 months, weight status was much more stable, so for example, only 13% and 1% of girls with raised and high weight respectively at 3 months had reverted to normal by 6 months.

Table 1
Transition matrices for girls and boys across weight categories in each status over 3‐month interval intervals by sex

Weights showed moderate correlations from age to age within infancy and BMI at age 5 and 8 years were strongly correlated, but there was only weak correlation between infancy weight and childhood BMI (Table S2).

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^e0d3f011]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) pharmacokinetics (PK) in pediatric HIV indicates that children have lower LPV/r exposure than adults when doses are directly scaled by body surface area, using a typical adult body surface area of 1.73 m²; for the adult dose LPV/r 400 mg/100 mg, the scaled pediatric dose is approximately 230 mg/57.5 mg per m². Younger children have higher LPV clearance and need higher doses, and to achieve a trough concentration (Ctrough) similar to adults, the pediatric dose needs to be increased 30% greater than directly scaled. Table PK data by age show AUC0–12h (mcg•hr/mL) values of adults 92.6, children at 230 mg/m2 72.6, children at 300 mg/m2 116.0, infants at 12 months 101.0, infants at 6 weeks to 6 months 74.5, and infants at 14 days to < 6 weeks 43.4; Ctrough (mcg/mL) values are adults 7.1, children at 230 mg/m2 4.7, children at 300 mg/m2 7.9, infants at 12 months 4.9, infants at 6 weeks to 6 months 2.7, and infants at 14 days to < 6 weeks 2.5. Models suggest diet, body weight, and postnatal age affect LPV PK with clearance slowing by age 2.3 years, and a United Kingdom and Ireland study comparing LPV/r 230 mg per m2 per dose versus 300 mg per m2 per dose in children aged 5.6 to 12.8 years found the higher dose was associated with improved long-term viral load suppression.

### Failure to thrive: an update [^80951838]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive in childhood is a state of undernutrition due to inadequate caloric intake, inadequate caloric absorption, or excessive caloric expenditure. In the United States, it is seen in 5 to 10 percent of children in primary care settings. Although failure to thrive is often defined as a weight for age that falls below the 5th percentile on multiple occasions or weight deceleration that crosses two major percentile lines on a growth chart, use of any single indicator has a low positive predictive value. Most cases of failure to thrive involve inadequate caloric intake caused by behavioral or psychosocial issues. The most important part of the outpatient evaluation is obtaining an accurate account of a child's eating habits and caloric intake. Routine laboratory testing rarely identifies a cause and is not generally recommended. Reasons to hospitalize a child for further evaluation include failure of outpatient management, suspicion of abuse or neglect, or severe psychosocial impairment of the caregiver. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment, including home nursing visits and nutritional counseling, has been shown to improve weight gain, parent-child relationships, and cognitive development. The long-term effects of failure to thrive on cognitive development and future academic performance are unclear.

Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Growth parameters — measurement and monitoring describe that "Growth is the primary outcome measure of nutritional status in children" and "Growth should be monitored at regular intervals throughout childhood and adolescence and should also be measured every time a child presents, in any healthcare setting, for preventive, acute, or chronic care". In children "less than 36 months of age, measures of growth include length-for-age, weight-for-age, head circumference-for-age, and weight-for-length", while in children ages "2–20 years" measures include "standing height-for-age, weight-for-age, and body mass index (BMI)-for-age". Anthropometric measures are "typically expressed and reported in comparison with population data", traditionally "expressed as percentiles", but "a percentile does not reveal the actual degree of deviation from population norms" and "will always be positive because the bell-shaped curve, statistically, has an infinite tail on both sides".

### The risk of obesity by assessing infant growth against the UK-WHO charts compared to the UK90 reference: findings from the born in bradford birth cohort study [^b08d3df1]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The present paper helps inform the practitioner, who ultimately faces the interpretive dilemma of wondering whether a specific growth pattern should give cause for concern, about average growth patterns and risks of childhood obesity according to the UK-WHO charts. The correct interpretation of apparent accelerated growth, however, presupposes that the practitioner knows that the UK-WHO chart is essentially a growth standard, knows the differences between a standard and a reference, and knows the difference in how to interpret growth when using a standard compared to when using a reference. Because the number of UK infants who are diagnosed as being on a trajectory toward childhood obesity must have increased since the introduction of the UK-WHO charts, an increased effort to integrate the dissemination of useful information to parents with growth monitoring practice is necessary.

Not being able to test the relative contribution of factors responsible for accelerated growth of UK infants against the UK-WHO charts is perhaps the greatest limitation of the present study, because it would have allowed us to definitively answer the question "why do UK infants demonstrate obesogenic growth trajectories (against the UK-WHO charts)"?. Other limitations include a sample composed exclusively of infants from one city in the UK, which may limit generalisability of the results, and weight and BMI gain variables that did not account for regression to the mean. Gain variables would normally be calculated as the residuals from the general linear regression of size at age "T" on size at age "T-1". However, the relative risk analysis in the present study needed to include data from the same individuals against the UK-WHO charts and against the UK90 reference charts, so any initial regression would need to account for this non-independence; no formula has yet been proposed.

### Preterm birth, infant weight gain, and childhood asthma risk: a meta-analysis of 147, 000 European children [^e9341e06]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Birth characteristics and infant growth

Information about birth weight, gestational age at birth, and weight in the first year of life per cohort was obtained by using measurements, medical registries, or parental questionnaires (cohort-specific information is shown in Table E1 in this article's Online Repository at) and used as continuous and categorical variables. Infant weight gain in the first year was defined as the difference between weight at 1 year (range, 6–18 months) and weight at birth divided by the exact number of months between those 2 measurements. We created gestational age–adjusted birth weight standard deviation scores (SDS) based on a North-European reference chart. No general European or World Health Organization reference curves of birth weight for gestational age are available. To test nonlinear and dose-response associations, we categorized gestational age (< 28.0, 28.0–29.9, 30.0–31.9, 32.0–33.9, 34.0–35.9, 36.0–37.9, 38.0–39.9, 40–41.9, and ≥ 42 weeks), birth weight SDS (< −4, −4 to −3.01, −3 to −2.01, −2 to −1.01, −1 to −0.01, 0 to 0.99, 1 to 1.99, 2 to 2.99, 3 to 3.99, and ≥ 4 SDS), and infant weight gain (< 300, 300–399, 400–499, 500–599, 600–699, 700–799, 800–899, 900–999, and ≥ 1000 g/mo). To test the combined associations of gestational age, birth weight SDS, and infant weight gain with childhood asthma outcomes, we used a smaller number of groups to have sufficient children per group (for gestational age: < 32, 32–35.9, 36–39.9, and ≥ 40 weeks; for birth weight SDS: < −2; −2 to −1.01, −1 to 0.99, 1 to 1.99, and ≥ 2 SDs; and for infant weight gain: < 500, 500–599, 600–699, and ≥ 700 g/mo). Finally, we dichotomized gestational age at birth into term birth (≥ 37 weeks) and preterm birth (gestational age, < 37 weeks) and birth weight into normal birth weight (≥ 2500 g) and low birth weight (< 2500 g) to test the effects of clinical birth complications on childhood asthma outcomes. Cohort-specific characteristics of determinants are shown in Table E2 in this article's Online Repository at.

### Six-month gain in weight, height, and CD4 predict subsequent antiretroviral treatment responses in HIV-infected South African children [^d650b0e3]. AIDS (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Construct percentile curves for 6-month gain in weight, height, CD4 cell count, and CD4 percentage (CD4%) in children initiating ART, and to assess the association between lower percentiles and subsequent ART responses.

Design

Cohort of 1394 HIV-infected children initiating ART between April 2004 and March 2008, Johannesburg, South Africa

Methods

The generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape was used to construct percentile curves for 6-month gain in weight, height, CD4 cell count, and CD4%. Cox proportional models were used to assess the association between lower percentiles of each distribution and death, virological suppression, and treatment failure between 6 to 36 months post-ART initiation.

Results

Lower percentiles for gain in weight, CD4, and CD4% count after 6 months of ART, but not height, were associated with poor subsequent treatment outcomes independent of baseline characteristics, with increasing strength of association as percentiles decreased. Age-specific 6-month post-ART weight gain in our cohort was substantially higher compared with 6-month weight gain in non-HIV-infected American children of the Fels Institute cohort and the attained weight-for-age at 6 months post-ART plotted on WHO weight-for-age growth charts were not associated with subsequent treatment outcomes.

Conclusion

Gain in CD4% in the first 6 months of ART was the best predictor of poor subsequent ART outcomes. In areas with limited access to CD4%, weight gain post-ART using our newly developed reference distributions for HIV-infected children on ART is a good alternative to CD4%, and clearly superior to the commonly used 'Road-to-Health' weight-for-age charts.

### Worldwide timing of growth faltering: implications for nutritional interventions [^5dead32a]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

It is widely assumed that growth faltering starts at around 3 months of age, but there has been no systematic assessment of its timing using representative national datasets from a variety of countries.

Methodology

The World Health Organization Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition includes the results of 39 nationally representative datasets from recent surveys in developing countries. Based on these data, mean z scores of weight for age, length/height for age, and weight for length/height were compared with the National Center for Health Statistics and Cambridge growth references, for children younger than 60 months.

Results

Mean weights start to falter at about 3 months of age and decline rapidly until about 12 months, with a markedly slower decline until about 18 to 19 months and a catch-up pattern after that. Growth faltering in weight for length/height is restricted to the first 15 months of life, followed by rapid improvement. For length/height for age, the global mean is surprisingly close to National Center for Health Statistics and Cambridge references at birth, but faltering starts immediately afterward, lasting well into the third year.

Conclusions

These findings highlight the need for prenatal and early life interventions to prevent growth failure.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^7916285b]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Faltering growth (FG) is a problem regularly seen by clinicians in infants and young children (< 2 years of age). It can occur due to non-disease-related and disease-related causes and is associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes, including shorter-term effects such as impaired immune responses and increased length of hospital stay, and longer-term consequences, including an impact on schooling and cognitive achievements, short stature, and socioeconomic outcomes. It is essential to detect FG, address underlying causes and support catch-up growth where this is indicated. However, anecdotal reports suggest misplaced fear of promoting accelerated (too rapid) growth may deter some clinicians from adequately addressing FG. An invited international group of experts in pediatric nutrition and growth reviewed the available evidence and guidelines on FG resulting from disease-related and non-disease-related effects on nutritional status in healthy term and small for gestational age infants and children up to the age of 2 years in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Using a modified Delphi process, we developed practical consensus recommendations to provide clarity and practical recommendations for general clinicians on how FG should be defined in different young child populations at risk, how FG should be assessed and managed, and the role of catch-up growth after a period of FG. We also suggested areas where further research is needed to answer remaining questions on this important issue.

### Growth of a cohort of very low birth weight infants in johannesburg, South Africa [^1d0fb523]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

VLBW infants in the current study had a pattern of excess weight relative to length between term and 4 months postmenstrual age. This has been reported previously and may be due to the VLBW infant's propensity for excess abdominal fat deposition in the neonatal period.

The process of catch up growth is most rapid in the first 6 months of life and usually continues up to 2 years postmenstrual age but in some cases continues into childhood and even adulthood. Catch up growth is associated with improved neurodevelopmental outcomes, fewer psychosocial problems in later childhood, and lower risk of persistent short stature especially if complete by 12 months of age. It does however increase the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease, including overweight and obesity, in later childhood and adulthood, most especially with rapid gain in weight in the first few months of life. Possible strategies to prevent excessively rapid catch up growth include limiting the extent of early growth failure, the promotion of breastfeeding and the use of a VLBW reference for growth monitoring in infancy. There are currently, however, no evidence-based guidelines for limiting or controlling the rate of catch up growth in VLBW infants and this area requires further research.

### Head-circumference distribution in a large primary care network differs from CDC and WHO curves [^a000f76f]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare currently available head-circumference growth curves to curves constructed from clinical measurements from patients in a large US primary care network (PCN).

Patients and Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of 75 412 patients in an urban-suburban PCN. Patients with a birth weight of < 1500 g or gestational age of < 33 weeks at birth were excluded. We compared percentile values and the proportion of head-circumference observations above the 95th percentile and below the 5th percentile for the existing and PCN curves.

Results

The PCN curves were most similar to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) curves and were substantially different from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) curves. The overall proportion of observations above the 95th percentile was 4.9% (PCN), 6.2% (NCHS), 8.6% (CDC), and 14.0% (WHO). The proportion below the 5th percentile was 4.4% (PCN), 5.1% (NCHS), 2.9% (CDC), and 2.3% (WHO). When using the CDC curves, the proportion above the 95th percentile increased from 0.2% for children younger than 2 weeks to 11.8% for children 12 months old. When using the WHO curves, the proportion above the 95th percentile was > 5% at all ages, with a maximum of 18.0% for children older than 24 months.

Conclusions

The CDC and WHO head-circumference curves describe different distributions than the clinical measurements in our PCN population, especially for children with larger heads. The resulting percentile misclassification may delay diagnosis in children with intracranial pathology in very young infants and spur unnecessary evaluation of healthy children older than 6 months.

### Growth of preterm infants at the time of global obesity [^648455c1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Second, size at birth reference charts are mostly based on routinely collected data, with limited or no standardisation or quality control of anthropometric measures or reliable gestational age estimation, and describe how fetuses have grown at a particular place and time (even decades ago). Conversely, preterm postnatal standard charts, with prospective measures standardised, gestational age estimated by early ultrasound and childhood follow-up, define how preterm infants should grow under optimal conditions considering their degree of maturation. The terms 'reference' and 'standard' should not be used interchangeably because they are based on different data and have different objectives.

Third, 'distance growth', which represents the value attained at specific postnatal ages, is the most robust and commonly used tool in clinical practice. Velocity growth expresses the change in value of an anthropometric measure taken on the same infant between two time periods, that is, it requires individual, repeated data. Hence, the need for more than one measure across time on the same individual is germane to the growth velocity concept. Cross-sectional size at birth data, by definition, cannot estimate velocity growth.

In some clinical settings for practical reasons, velocity fixed rates of 15 g/kg/day, 10–30 g/day for weight or 1 cm/week for length are used. This is problematic because the 15 g/kg/day constant weight gain value is neither biologically plausible nor supported by longitudinal data. An alternative is to evaluate weight gain as g/kg/dayat different postnatal ages. However, this format provides a misleading picture of newborn growth kinetics by describing an earlier peak of weight gain that has limited contribution to the total weight increase. The weight velocity of these tiny babies, if it is going to be used, is better described as weight changes in g/day according to postnatal age, which follows a non-linear pattern. Considering the methodological issues, difficulties with calculation, interpretation at the bedside and that most units routinely just plot anthropometric measures according to age, distance charts are preferable to velocity growth measures.

### A grid to assess the nutritional status of low-birth-weight infants in the neonatal period [^ee007a25]. American Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Growth curves of low-birth-weight infants updated over the past 50 years accept many exclusions and do not provide a standard way to assess the nutritional status of these infants regardless of their diseases in the neonatal period. A new way for assessment is proposed. It is based on the excess time expressed in percent beyond the allocated time for an infant to gain his birth weight and the excess drop in weight expressed in percent beyond the allowed drop of weight. This method delineates one zone of adequate nutrition and three zones of malnutrition: mild, moderate, and severe.

### Nutrition-and feeding practice-related risk factors for rapid weight gain during the first year of life: a population-based birth cohort study [^9d0bb89c]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Study population

Of the 1780 infants, 47% had RWG during 0–3–4 months, 46% during 0–6 months, and 8% during 6–12 months (Table 1). The percent of infants experiencing RWG during all three time periods was 2%. The infants with RWG during the first 3–4 months had a mean weight gain of 3.0 ± 0.6 kg compared to 2.2 ± 0.5 kg for infants with nRWG (p < 0.001). In the RWG-group 58% were boys and 42% were girls. The corresponding mean increase in weight during the 0–6 months period was 4.8 ± 0.7 kg for infants with RWG and 3.7 ± 0.5 kg for infants with nRWG (p < 0.001). Among the children experiencing RWG during this period, 53% were boys and 47% were girls. During the 6–12-month period, the corresponding mean increases in weight were 3.3 ± 0.5 kg and 2.0 ± 0.5 kg for infants with RWG and nRWG respectively (p < 0.001), and the RWG-group consisted of 50% boys and 50% girls. Of the infants with RWG during 0–3–4 months, 4.4% were born SGA, and 2.1% LGA. The corresponding values in the 0–6 months group were 4.4 and 1.8% and in the 6–12-month group 3.7 and 3% for SGA and LGA respectively. Among the infants born SGA, 69% had RWG during 0–3–4 months, 67% during 0–6 months and 9% during 6–12 months. In the infants born LGA, 22% had RWG during 0–3–4 months, 18% during 0–6 months and 5% during 6–12 months. At birth, 87% of the infants were predominantly breastfed. The corresponding values for the other time points were as follows, 67% at 3–4 months, 29% at 6 months, and 4.5% at 12 months. During the different time points, the following numbers of infants were bottle-fed: at birth, 24%, at 3–4 months, 46% at 6 months, 76% and at 12 months, 89%. At birth, 6% of the infants were exclusively formula-fed and at 3–4 months the corresponding number was 20%. At 6 months of age, MCD was given to 44% of the infants and at 12 months the corresponding number was 59%.

### Use of World Health Organization and CDC growth charts… [^d903480c]. CDC (2010). Low credibility.

When using the WHO growth charts to screen for possible abnormal or unhealthy growth, use of the 2. 3rd and
97. 7th percentiles are recommended, rather than the 5th and 95th percentiles. Clinicians should be aware that fewer U. S. children will be identified as underweight using the WHO charts, slower growth among breastfed infants during ages 3–18 months is normal, and gaining weight more rapidly than is indicated on the WHO charts might signal early signs of overweight. Because the growth of infants with very low birth weight is distinctly different from that of infants with higher birth weights, data for VLBW infants were excluded from the charts for children aged < 36 months. No other exclusion or inclusion criteria were used. Approximately 50% of the infants in the data set had ever been breastfed, and 33% were still breastfeeding when they reached age 3 months.

No overweight measurements were excluded. Meeting participants agreed that in practice, clinicians often use growth references, such as the CDC growth charts, as a standard to evaluate healthy growth rather than a reference as intended. Children Aged < 24 Months. The WHO and CDC charts show different growth patterns that might lead clinicians to different conclusions about variations in growth. Healthy breastfed infants typically gain weight faster than formula-fed infants in the first few months of life but then gain weight more slowly for the remainder of infancy. Therefore, in the first few months of life, WHO curves show a faster rate of weight gain than the CDC charts for boys and girls. Use of the WHO charts in the United States might lead to an increase in the misperception of poor growth at this age.

Beginning at approximately age 3 months, WHO curves show a slower rate of weight gain than the CDC charts, both in weight for age and weight for length. Because WHO curves are derived from infants who breastfeed through 12 months, infants who are still breastfeeding at approximately age 3 months are more likely to maintain their percentages on the WHO growth charts but to decrease in percentages on the CDC charts. In contrast, if WHO charts are used to assess the growth of formula-fed infants, these infants might be identified as growing too slowly during the first few months of life but then be identified as gaining weight too quickly after approximately 3 months.

### Measuring BMI change among children and adolescents [^9790f3f8]. Pediatric Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Weight control programs for children monitor BMI changes using BMI z-scores that adjust BMI for the sex and age of the child. It is, however, uncertain if BMIz is the best metric for assessing BMI change.

Objective

To identify which of 6 BMI metrics is optimal for assessing change. We considered a metric to be optimal if its short-term variability was consistent across the entire BMI distribution.

Subjects

285643 2- to 17-year-olds with BMI measured 3 times over a 10- to 14-month period.

Methods

We summarized each metric's variability using the within-child standard deviation.

Results

Most metrics' initial or mean value correlated with short-term variability (|r|~0.3 to 0.5). The metric for which the within-child variability was largely independent (r = 0.13) of the metric's initial or mean value was the percentage of the 50th expressed on a log scale. However, changes in this metric between the first and last visits were highly (r ≥ 0.97) correlated with changes in %95th and %50th.

Conclusions

Log %50 was the metric for which the short-term variability was largely independent of a child's BMI. Changes in log %50th, %95th, and %50th are strongly correlated.

### Infants and children 6–59 months of age with severe wasting and / or nutritional oedema: evidence gaps identified during WHO guideline development [^37f13ee5]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Evidence gaps

Limitations in the evidence to inform risk-based care for improving important outcomes

The recommendations on admission, referral, transfer and exit criteria were updated based on prognostic factor evidence, clinical reasoning and experience of the GDG members (B2, B3 and B5). However, the dearth of direct evidence regarding the threshold for hospital admission and investigation for children with severe wasting and/or nutritional oedema in the absence of a clinical syndrome warranting admission constitutes an important focus for future research. Inpatient care carries inherent risks and costs (eg, hospital acquired infections and the financial burden on families and the health system associated with longer hospital stay) the impacts of which must be evaluated and balanced against potential benefits. Additionally, studies that document clinical improvement during treatment (including weight and possibly some height recovery) would allow for earlier identification of treatment failure and enable testing of interventions based on individuals' anthropometric progress and risk of mortality. More primary studies are needed to identify and evaluate prognostic factors for adverse health outcomes in order to determine whether outcomes can be improved by enhanced outpatient care and/or psychosocial support effectively targeted to higher risk infants and children. Rigorous trials should examine not only individual child factors such as comorbidities and other biological factors, but also social factors including maternal physical and mental health, education and decision-making power, and contextual factors such as socioeconomic status, food security and access to care.

The recommendation regarding safe exit from care (B5) was based on very low certainty evidence. Thus, randomised controlled trials and studies using methods designed to evaluate dynamic, multicomponent health systems are needed to evaluate whether prognostic factor-based exit from care results in better outcomes. There is also a need for more studies investigating the pathways underlying mortality (and interventions to address these) after transition to outpatient care, especially in light of reports of high mortality rates (up to 38%) among children hospitalised with severe wasting and pneumoniaand mortality rates ranging between 0.6% and 10.4% 6 months to 2 years after treatment for uncomplicated severe wasting or nutritional oedema. It is possible that anthropometric recovery is not uniform across all criteria (ie, WHZ/WLZ and MUAC) potentially requiring longer-term follow-up, including for relapse after recovery.

### The role of the pediatrician in primary prevention of obesity [^bad5dac2]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Early childhood growth monitoring and risk assessment — pediatricians and primary care physicians should measure weight and length or height in a standardized way and should plot them on World Health Organization growth charts (ages 0–23 months) or on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts (ages 24–59 months) as part of every well-child visit. It is recommended to use weight-for-length for children younger than 24 months; in this age range, overweight is defined as weight-for-length > 95th percentile, and pediatricians should consider children's rate of weight gain, especially as their body mass index (BMI) reaches the 85th and 95th percentiles, and parental weight status as risk factors.

### Postnatal weight loss and exclusive breastfeeding in newborn [^7b32ca4c]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Surprisingly, the study revealed that infants who lost significant weight after birth and failed to regain their birth weight by ten days weighed less by the age of two years compared to others. These findings align with Wright's study, which similarly observed that infants with severe postnatal weight loss exhibited weights below the 5th percentile by six months, even if no issues were diagnosed at that stage. However, in the current study, the weight trajectories of both groups remained within the normal range according to the WHO's child growth standards. The only notable difference at six months was a plateau in growth rates in both groups, likely linked to the introduction of complementary feeding and the emergence of infant teeth. This pattern raises concerns in developing countries, where infants often thrive during exclusive breastfeeding but subsequently experience slower growth trajectories due to suboptimal feeding practices. During the complementary feeding period, children face a heightened risk of nutritional deficiencies. Complementary foods are frequently nutritionally inadequate, introduced too early or too late, provided in insufficient quantities, or offered infrequently. Additionally, premature weaning or infrequent breastfeeding further exacerbates insufficient energy and nutrient intake in infants over 6 months of age.

Salivary cortisol levels rise in full-term newborns following rapid body weight loss during the first 24 to 48 h of life. This initial cortisol surge represents a normal physiological response to the stress of birth and adaptation to extrauterine life. However, the potential long-term consequences of this early cortisol elevation — or subsequent increases due to persistent stress — merit further investigation. While prolonged or repeated stress in these infants could contribute to their lower long-term weight, this relationship remains complex and context-dependent. Notably, while elevated cortisol levels in adults are often associated with increased appetite and fat storage, its effects in newborns may differ significantly. Additionally, factors beyond initial weight loss may influence cortisol levels.

The study findings revealed that exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rates among infants losing > 5% of their birth weight declined sharply from 79% at 3–5 days postpartum to 59.3% by six months. In contrast, infants with < 5% weight loss showed a less pronounced decline (57.8% at 3–5 days vs. 49.2% at six months). This discrepancy suggests that significant neonatal weight loss — and maternal concerns about insufficient breast milk supply — may prompt parents to adopt temporary or suboptimal solutions, such as formula supplementation, thereby reducing exclusive breastfeeding rates.

### Prevalence of high body mass index in US children and adolescents, 2007–2008 [^37c875df]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

The prevalence of high body mass index (BMI) among children and adolescents in the United States appeared to plateau between 1999 and 2006.

Objectives

To provide the most recent estimates of high BMI among children and adolescents and high weight for recumbent length among infants and toddlers and to analyze trends in prevalence between 1999 and 2008.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007–2008, a representative sample of the US population with measured heights and weights on 3281 children and adolescents (2 through 19 years of age) and 719 infants and toddlers (birth to 2 years of age).

Main Outcome Measures

Prevalence of high weight for recumbent length (≥ 95th percentile of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts) among infants and toddlers. Prevalence of high BMI among children and adolescents defined at 3 levels: BMI for age at or above the 97th percentile, at or above the 95th percentile, and at or above the 85th percentile of the BMI-for-age growth charts. Analyses of trends by age, sex, and race/ethnicity from 1999–2000 to 2007–2008.

Results

In 2007–2008, 9.5% of infants and toddlers (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.3%-11.7%) were at or above the 95th percentile of the weight-for-recumbent-length growth charts. Among children and adolescents aged 2 through 19 years, 11.9% (95% CI, 9.8%-13.9%) were at or above the 97th percentile of the BMI-for-age growth charts; 16.9% (95% CI, 14.1%-19.6%) were at or above the 95th percentile; and 31.7% (95% CI, 29.2%-34.1%) were at or above the 85th percentile of BMI for age. Prevalence estimates differed by age and by race/ethnic group. Trend analyses indicate no significant trend between 1999–2000 and 2007–2008 except at the highest BMI cut point (BMI for age ≥ 97th percentile) among all 6- through 19-year-old boys (odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95% CI, 1.17–2.01) and among non-Hispanic white boys of the same age (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.22–2.94).

Conclusion

No statistically significant linear trends in high weight for recumbent length or high BMI were found over the time periods 1999–2000, 2001–2002, 2003–2004, 2005–2006, and 2007–2008 among girls and boys except among the very heaviest 6- through 19-year-old boys.

Breastfeeding-friendly pediatric office practice — newborn visit timing and anticipatory guidance: "Schedule the first newborn visit by the third to fifth day of life, or approximately 24 to 48 hours from the time the newborn infant is discharged depending on the length of the hospital stay", and at visits "incorporate anticipatory guidance that supports exclusive breastfeeding until infants are approximately 6 months old, followed by continued breastfeeding for 1 year or longer, as mutually desired by the infant and mother"; include "weight-gain expectations with the use of appropriate growth charts, such as the WHO growth standards for ages 0 to 2 years recommended by the CDC".

### Customized growth charts: rationale, validation and clinical benefits [^6e761b42]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Appropriate standards for the assessment of fetal growth and birthweight are central to good clinical care, and have become even more important with increasing evidence that growth-related adverse outcomes are potentially avoidable. Standards need to be evidence based and validated against pregnancy outcome and able to demonstrate utility and effectiveness. A review of proposals by the Intergrowth consortium to adopt their single international standard finds little support for the claim that the cases that it identifies as small are due to malnutrition or stunting, and substantial evidence that there is normal physiologic variation between different countries and ethnic groups. It is possible that the one-size-fits-all standard ends up fitting no one and could be harmful if implemented. An alternative is the concept of country-specific charts that can improve the association between abnormal growth and adverse outcome. However, such standards ignore individual physiologic variation that affects fetal growth, which exists in any heterogeneous population and exceeds intercountry differences. It is therefore more logical to adjust for the characteristics of each mother, taking her ethnic origin and her height, weight, and parity into account, and to set a growth and birthweight standard for each pregnancy against which actual growth can be assessed. A customized standard better reflects adverse pregnancy outcome at both ends of the fetal size spectrum and has increased clinicians' confidence in growth assessment, while providing reassurance when abnormal size merely represents physiologic variation. Rollout in the United Kingdom has proceeded as part of the comprehensive Growth Assessment Protocol (GAP), and has resulted in a steady increase in antenatal detection of babies who are at risk because of fetal growth restriction. This in turn has been accompanied by a year-on-year drop in stillbirth rates to their lowest ever levels in England. A global version of customized growth charts with over 100 ethnic origin categories is being launched in 2018, and will provide an individualized, yet universally applicable, standard for fetal growth.

### Assessment, differential diagnosis, and initial clinical evaluation of the pediatric patient with obesity: an obesity medical association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^bf841691]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Body mass index categories in children and adolescents ages 2–20 — classification thresholds are: less than 5th percentile is underweight, 5–84th percentile healthy weight, 85–94th percentile overweight, 95th percentile to 119% of the 95th percentile class 1 obesity, 120–139% of the 95th percentile or a BMI greater than 35 kg/m² and less than 39 kg/m² class 2 obesity, and greater than 140% of the 95th percentile or BMI greater than 40 Class 3 obesity. Any BMI greater than or equal to 120% of the 95th percentile is severe obesity. Different charts are used to track BMI for up to the 95th percentile and above the 95th percentile. The CDC recommends using the WHO growth charts to monitor growth for infants and children ages 0–2 years of age in the U.S. and using the CDC growth charts for children ages 2 years and older.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^d4b5709b]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Faltering Growth

There are many definitions of FG (also referred to by other terms including growth faltering, "failure to thrive", stunting, and growth failure). For example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which advises the National Health Service in the UK, suggested the following thresholds for concern about FG in infants: a fall across 1 or more weight centile spaces (1 centile space = 0.67 z scores) if birthweight was below the 9th centile; a fall across 2 or more weight centile spaces if birthweight was between the 9th and 91st centiles; a fall across 3 or more weight centile spaces if birthweight was above the 91st centile; when current weight is below the 2nd centile for age, whatever the birthweight.

Given the international nature of this review, the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of growth faltering seems most relevant to provide a simple, pragmatic approach for clinicians: a fall in weight for age (WFA) z score of ≥ 1.0 merits evaluation. Current definitions lack a timeframe for the period of growth faltering. We suggested that it was important to include a time frame for falling weight that should be sufficient to ensure that acute weight loss, such as that occurring rapidly with an episode of vomiting and diarrhea is not classified as growth faltering. Growth faltering also excludes the first 2 weeks after birth, when weight loss is expected.

Growth faltering potentially has an immediate effect on a child's health and can be a marker for something serious, so it is clearly important that clinicians recognize growth faltering and manage it appropriately.

### Failure to thrive [^7d20f966]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive is a condition commonly seen by primary care physicians. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are important for preventing malnutrition and developmental sequelae. Medical and social factors often contribute to failure to thrive. Either extreme of parental attention (neglect or hypervigilance) can lead to failure to thrive. About 25 percent of normal infants will shift to a lower growth percentile in the first two years of life and then follow that percentile; this should not be diagnosed as failure to thrive. Infants with Down syndrome, intrauterine growth retardation, or premature birth follow different growth patterns than normal infants. Many infants with failure to thrive are not identified unless careful attention is paid to plotting growth parameters at routine checkups. A thorough history is the best guide to establishing the etiology of the failure to thrive and directing further evaluation and management. All children with failure to thrive need additional calories for catch-up growth (typically 150 percent of the caloric requirement for their expected, not actual, weight). Few need laboratory evaluation. Hospitalization is rarely required and is indicated only for severe failure to thrive and for those whose safety is a concern. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended when failure to thrive persists despite intervention or when it is severe.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^55a143f9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity definitions — thresholds and classes specify that children and adolescents ≥ 2 years of age are overweight if BMI is ≥ 85th percentile but < 95th percentile for age and gender on the revised 2000 CDC charts; a child < 2 years is obese if weight for recumbent length is ≥ 97.7th percentile of WHO growth standards; and extreme obesity is defined as BMI ≥ 120% of the 95th percentile or ≥ 35 kg/m². A proposal suggests redefining this as class 2 obesity and proposes class 3 pediatric obesity to be BMI ≥ 140% of the 95th percentile or ≥ 40 kg/m²; class 2 and class 3 obesity are noted as increasing significantly in girls of all ages (most clearly between 6 and 11 years) and in boys between 12 and 19 years, with a nonsignificant trend in boys < 12 years.

### Implications of adopting the WHO 2006 child growth standard in the UK: two prospective cohort studies [^74f5f1e1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2008). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In summary, adoption of the new WHO growth charts for UK children up to age 5 years would have a significant impact on the interpretation of their weight gain and growth. However, the effects are complex and appear to differ at various ages. The marked reduction in numbers of infants who would be classified as underweight or growth faltering beyond age 4 months is an expected consequence of the WHO's decision to have the breastfed child as the normative model. However, UK infants would also be classified as being larger at birth, but not at 2–4 months, and would result in a complex pattern of weight centile changes over the first year for the average UK child (fig 1).

This analysis is based on data from two large representative UK birth cohorts, which between them allow comparison with the WHO charts at a wide range of ages. GMS provides detailed weight data early in infancy, and the ALSPAC provides both weight and height/length from infancy through to the pre-school years. At times of overlap, the two cohorts showed very close similarity in weights and heights, and, at least in infancy, they are also broadly similar to the UK 1990 reference. The gradual increase in weight z-scores by 4–5 years of age compared with the UK 1990 has been previously reported in ALSPAC and probably reflects the secular changes in UK children. We are therefore confident that our findings in these two cohorts may be extrapolated to contemporary UK children.

### Patterns of fetal and infant growth and brain morphology at age 10 years [^a4e81910]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Infant weight was measured in community health centers using a mechanical personal scale at approximately 6, 12, and 24 months. Age- and sex-adjusted SD scores were obtained using Dutch reference growth charts.

We categorized fetal and infant weight change into 3 groups (growth deceleration, normal growth, and growth acceleration) and created combined variables that reflect 9 different growth patterns. Fetal weight change was defined as growth between the second trimester and birth. Infant weight change was defined as growth from birth to 24 months in 69.4% of the full group. To achieve adequate sample size on subgroup analyses, if weight at 24 months was missing, we calculated the weight change by using weight at 12 or 6 months (20% and 10.6% of the full group, respectively). Growth acceleration or deceleration were defined as a change in SD scores greater than 0.67 between time points. This clinically significant change reflects the difference between 2 percentile lines on the growth charts.

Peak weight velocity, reflecting the greatest weight growth in infancy, was derived using the Reed1 model by sex on all weight measurements taken from birth to 3 years of age, including birth weight. To obtain age and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) reached at adiposity peak, we analyzed repeated infant BMI measurements using a cubic mixed-effects model fitted on a log(BMI) scale from age 14 days to 1.5 years, adjusted for sex, which showed the best fit to the data. The growth measures are presented in detail in eTable 1 in the Supplement.

### Associations of fetal and infant growth patterns with early markers of arterial health in school-aged children [^39b93213]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Sex, gestational age at birth, and birth weight were collected from midwives. In our study population, birth weight was standardized based on gestational age and sex according to growth charts by Niklasson et al. These growth charts are well known and commonly used growth charts for northern European countries, including the Netherlands. For the analyses, we used internal percentiles for comparison. We used the clinical cutoffs for gestational age and weight at birth. Gestational age was categorized as preterm (< 37 weeks), term (37–42 weeks), and postterm (> 42 weeks). Birth weight was categorized as low (< 2500 g), normal (2500–4500 g), and high (> 4500 g). Children born SGA were defined as those with a gestational age–adjusted and sex-adjusted SDS for birth weight below the 10th percentile, and those born large size for gestational age (LGA) were defined as those with a gestational age–adjusted and sex-adjusted SDS for birth weight above the 90th percentile.

Infant weight was measured at approximately 6 months of age (median, 6.2 months; 95% range, 5.2–8.3 months), 12 months (median, 11.1 months; 95% range, 10.1–12.5 months), and 24 months (median, 24.8 months; 95% range, 23.4–28.2 months). We created age-adjusted and sex-adjusted SDSs using Dutch reference growth charts in Growth Analyser, version 4.0 (Growth Analyser BV).

We prospectively constructed 9 categories of fetal and infant weight change variables. Fetal weight change was defined as an increase in the SDS between the second trimester and birth. Infant weight change was defined as an increase in the SDS from birth to 24 months (2929 of 3651 children). If weight at 24 months was not available, we used weight at 11 months (587 of 3651 children), and if weight at 11 months was not available, we used weight at 6 months (135 of 3651 children). We considered an increase of more than 0.67 SD between time points as growth acceleration and a decrease of more than 0.67 SD between time points as growth deceleration, reflecting the difference between 2 percentile lines on the growth charts.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^4580ee2e]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Early breastfeeding cessation and formula feeding — weight-related outcomes include that some, but not all, studies have reported decreased risk of childhood and adolescent obesity in breastfed infants; the majority of evidence is derived from observational studies and may include confounding effects; compared with bottle-fed infants, breastfed infants are better able to regulate their energy intake and have lower risk of childhood excess weight gain, with other studies also showing slower body weight gain in breastfed infants; breastfeeding has been found to be inversely associated with overweight risk in the first year of life, independent of maternal BMI and SES; breastfeeding cessation before 6 months was associated with an increased risk of rapid weight gain and overweight by 12 months of age compared with exclusive breastfeeding; certain feeding practices may lead to rapid infant weight gain, and infants fed high-protein formulas are at greater risk of elevated BMI later in childhood.

### Low birth weight and early weight gain in the metabolic syndrome: consequences for infant nutrition [^f849e81c]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2009). Low credibility.

Emerging data indicate that being born small for gestational age (SGA) and rapid infant catch-up growth may play a significant role in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and the metabolic syndrome (MS) many years later in life. The impact of these perinatal T2DM and MS risk factors may be more important than genetics in some parts of the world, including low-income countries. Breastfeeding for 3–6 months is associated with reduced risk of developing insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Promotion of fast growth in SGA infants by nutrient-enriched formula increases risk of hypertension and the metabolic syndrome. While waiting for better knowledge of how to combat T2DM and MS with early-life interventions, breastfeeding should be recommended and enforced whenever possible, keeping in mind the health and nutritional status of the mother. Furthermore, promotion of fast weight gain in SGA infants by nutrient-enriched formula feeding should be used with caution. However, growth limitation by restriction of nutrition in SGA infants below general recommendations should not be recommended.

### Rapid growth in infancy: balancing the interests of the child [^3a517562]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Low birth weight is associated with a number of immediate adverse consequences, and it has been assumed that "catch-up" growth is a "good thing" because "better" nutritional status is associated with greater childhood health and survival. The same thinking applies to infants who suffer malnutrition and growth faltering during weaning. Recent studies suggest that the rapid postnatal growth of babies is associated with an enhanced risk for obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and osteopenia in later life. If this is true, it has implications for our recommendations for infant feeding. Insights from evolutionary biology, life cycle theory, animal husbandry, epidemiology and comparative zoology suggest that the energetic feeding of underweight infants should be considered in the context of the whole life cycle and balance the interests of the child with its likely fortunes in adulthood. Before we revise our current recommendations, we must consider the meaning of catch-up growth, what it involves in terms of tissues gained (fat, muscle and bone) and to what degree association represents causation. In the meantime, it will be prudent to balance the short- and long-term interests of the child by endeavoring to (1) optimize maternal nutrition and health, to avoid low birth weight, (2) breast-feed ideally, (3) consider birth weight, gestation and future "nutritional environment" when making decisions about infant feeding, (4) use appropriate growth charts, (5) avoid excessive postnatal weight gain, (6) think about the whole life span and (7) extrapolate from animal studies cautiously.

### Limitations of BMI z scores for assessing weight change: a clinical tool versus individual risk [^25f27584]. Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Although pediatric growth curves provide clinical utility, using these metrics for within-person change over time can be misleading. As research is focused on understanding cardiometabolic consequences of weight gain, it is important to use precise metrics to analyze these longitudinal research questions. Despite several foundational recommendations to limit the use of reference pediatric growth curves (e.g. BMI z scores) for within-person longitudinal research, it has evolved into the "gold standard" for using growth curves for pediatric weight gain analyses. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to discuss (A) the methodology used to create reference growth curves; (B) the appropriate use of reference pediatric BMI growth curves within the context of cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses in research; and (C) how to select metrics based on desired evaluations. Careful consideration using standardized references scores is essential when assessing obesity-related questions and comorbid risk over time in pediatric populations.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^3378c7c8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society pediatric obesity — beverage intake and policy considerations: Fruit juice has no role in the diet of infants under 6 months of age, and after 6 months of age fruit juice must be limited to 4 to 6 ounces per day until children reach 6 years of age, after which 8 to 12 ounces is an acceptable serving; an Early Childhood Longitudinal Study — Birth Cohort of > 4000 children found that daily ingestion of fruit juice at 2 years of age resulted in an increase in BMI at 4 years compared with children who had no or infrequent fruit juice, with whole fruit providing increased nutritional benefit over juice. Since 1965, teens have doubled their consumption of sugar-sweetened and fruit-flavored beverages. School-based interventions can reduce soda consumption and reduce weight in students at the highest BMI percentiles, and although there has reportedly been a 95% decrease in the amount of regular sodas shipped to schools, other sweetened beverages have become more available in schools. Obese or normal weight children and adolescents who substituted noncaloric beverages in lieu of sugar-sweetened beverages had less of an increase in BMI at 1 year. As an alternative to sugar-sweetened beverages, the introduction of water jets to New York City elementary school students led to a 0.022 to 0.025 decrease in BMI and a 0.6% to 0.9% decrease in risk for overweight, possibly related to a 12.3% decrease in milk purchases. The Task Force placed a high value on decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages and a high value on strengthening the message to families that these beverages contribute to pediatric obesity, and the committee supports the suggestion by the WHO for worldwide tax leverage on calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods.

### Trends in anthropometric measures among US children 6 to 23 months, 1976–2014 [^48654659]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The surveillance of children's growth reflects a population's nutritional status and risk for adverse outcomes. This study aimed to describe trends in length-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-length, and early childhood weight gain among US children aged 6 to 23 months.

Methods

We analyzed NHANES data from 1976–1980, 1988–1994, 1999–2002, 2003–2006, 2007–2010, and 2011–2014. We estimated z scores < -2 (low) and ≥ +2 (high) in comparison with World Health Organization growth standards for each indicator. Weight gain (relative to sex-age-specific medians) from birth until survey participation was estimated. Trends were assessed by low birth weight status and race/Hispanic origin. Race/Hispanic origin trends were assessed from 1988–1994 to 2011–2014.

Results

In 2011–2014, the prevalence of low and high length-for-age was 3.3% (SE, 0.8) and 3.7% (SE, 0.8); weight-for-age was 0.6% (SE, 0.3) and 7.0% (SE, 1.1); and weight-for-length was 1.0% (SE, 0.4) and 7.7% (SE, 1.2). The only significant trend was a decrease in high length-for-age (5.5% in 1976–1980 vs 3.7% in 2011–2014; P = 0.04). Relative weight gain between birth and survey participation did not differ over time, although trends differed by race/Hispanic origin. Non-Hispanic black children gained more weight between birth and survey participation in 2011–2014 versus 1988–1994, versus no change among other groups.

Conclusions

Between 1976–1980 and 2011–2014, there were no significant trends in low or high weight-for-age and weight-for-length among 6- to 23-month-old children whereas the percent with high length-for-age decreased. A significant trend in relative weight gain between birth and survey participation was observed among non-Hispanic black children.

### Normal range and predictors of serum erythroferrone in infants [^701215e7]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics and iron status in the included infants.

Values are n (%), mean (95% CI), or mean (SD).

NBW normal-birth-weight infants, LBW/placebo low-birth-weight infants (2000–2500 g) supplemented with placebo from 6 weeks to 6 months, LBW/iron low-birth-weight infants (2000–2500 g) supplemented with iron 2 mg/kg/day from 6 weeks to 6 months.

a NBW infants were assessed at 4 months of age and the LBW infants at 12 weeks of age.

Descriptive data of ERFE in NBW infants at 4 time points over the first year of life is presented in Table 2. Reference ranges (5th to 95th percentile) changed from < 0.005–0.99 ng/mL at 6 weeks to < 0.005–33.7 ng/mL at 12 months. In each group, respectively, ERFE showed an increasing trend during the first year of life (Fig. 2) and ERFE was significantly higher at 12 months compared to 6 weeks of age in all 3 groups (p < 0.001). Compared to NBW infants, LBW infants had significantly higher ERFE at 6 weeks (Median [5th; 95th percentile] was 0.28 [< 0.005; 1.9] vs. 0.058 [< 0.005; 1.12], p = 0.004) and significantly lower levels at 12 months of age (1.9 [0.17; 43] vs. 7.39 [< 0.005; 34], p = 0.013). Between the two LBW groups, significantly higher ERFE was observed in the placebo group at 6 months of age (1.7 [< 0.005; 133]) compared to iron supplemented infants (0.86 [< 0.005; 27], p = 0.036), but no differences were observed at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, or 12 months.

### Protein and growth during the first year of life: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^03afea43]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The minimal set of anthropometric variables collected in all studies included body weight and length. The time-schedule of data collection differed across papers. Although all studies except onereported anthropometric measurements at enrollment, some studies treated infants and checked anthropometric measures on the same time span,– and others monitored anthropometric measures on a longer follow-up (e.g. several years after the intervention). In either case, the most common intervention strategy considered treatment from enrollment to 120 days of life of the infant. However, heterogeneity was present even when considering age at enrollment within the first month of life. – This implied that, while some studies were likely to actually treat infants for about 4 months in total, one studytreated infants for 3 months, another two, were likely to include subsets of older infants, treated for less than 4 months. In addition, within the same period of 120 days of an infant's life, the number and schedule of data collection differed across studies, with measurements taken 2,3, 5, and 6times. Among selected articles, 8. (67%) were of "good", 3, (25%) of "fair", and one (8.3%) of "poor" quality. Two studies found a similar weight gain in the first 120 days for high- and low-protein content formulas. On the contrary, one study found a lower weight gain among infants in the low-protein, as compared with the high-protein formula group, and another studyobserved a lower weight gain in the low-protein formula group, as compared with medium- or high-protein content groups in the first 120 days of life. In addition, gain in weight was similar between Swedish and Italian infants assuming formulas with high-, medium-, and low-protein content over a 3–6-month and a 6–12-month period.

### National, longitudinal NASCITA birth cohort study: prevalence of overweight at 12 months of age in children born healthy [^646213f1]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of overweight at 12 months in an Italian birth cohort and to identify factors related to an increased likelihood of being overweight.

Methods

The Italian NASCITA birth cohort was analysed. Infants were classified as underweight (< 5th), normal weight (5-84th) and overweight (≥ 85th centile) at 12 months of age according to the WHO percentiles of body mass index (BMI) and the prevalence of overweight was estimated. To test the association between the chance of being overweight and parental and newborn characteristics, and infant feeding, healthy newborns (no preterm/low birth weight and with no malformations), with appropriate-for-gestational-age birth weight were selected, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.

Results

The prevalence of overweight was 23.5% (95% CI 22.2% to 24.8%) in all cohort members with 12-month data (N = 4270), and 23.1% in the appropriate-for-gestational age subsample (N = 2835). A big infant appetite (OR 3.92, 95%CI 2.40 to 6.40) and living in southern Italy (OR 1.58, 95%CI 1.29 to 1.94) were the main variables associated with a greater likelihood of being overweight. Breastfeeding practice did not influence the chance of being overweight, but was associated with an increase (exclusive breast feeding for at least 6 months) or a decrease (breast feeding for at least 12 months) in BMI z score at 12 months.

Conclusions

The sociodemographic factors (eg, area of residence, maternal employment status) seem to be the most relevant determinants influencing the chance of being overweight at 12 months. Early interventions, with particular attention to vulnerable families, may be helpful in preventing childhood and adult obesity.

### Infant growth and child cognition at 3 years of age [^d3c26c6b]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Infancy is a critical period for brain development. Few studies have examined the extent to which infant weight gain is associated with later neurodevelopmental outcomes in healthy populations.

Objective

The purpose of this work was to examine associations of infant weight gain from birth to 6 months with child cognitive and visual-motor skills at 3 years of age.

Patients and Methods

We studied 872 participants in Project Viva, an ongoing prospective, longitudinal, prebirth cohort. We abstracted birth weight from the medical chart and weighed infants at 6 months of age. We used the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts to derive weight-for-age z scores. Our primary predictor was infant weight gain, defined as the weight-for-age z score at 6 months adjusted for the weight-for-age z score at birth. At 3 years of age, we measured child cognition with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III and visual-motor skills with the Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities.

Results

Mean Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III score was 104.2, and mean Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities test score was 102.8. Mean birth weight z score was 0.21, and mean 6-month weight z score was 0.39. In multiple linear regression adjusted for child age, gender, gestational age, breastfeeding duration, primary language, and race/ethnicity; maternal age, parity, smoking status, and cognition; and parental education and income level, we found no association of infant weight gain with child Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III score (-0.4 points per z score weight gain increment, 95% confidence interval -1.3, 0.6) or total Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities standard score (-0.4 points, 95% confidence interval -1.2, 0.5).

Conclusions

Slower infant weight gain was not associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes in healthy, term-born 3-year-old children. These results should aid in determining optimal growth patterns in infants to balance risks and benefits of health outcomes through the life course.

### Normal range and predictors of serum erythroferrone in infants [^66d4154b]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Erythroferrone (ERFE) has been identified as a hepcidin-regulating hormone synthetized by erythroblasts correlating to the erythropoietic activity and the needs for iron substrate in bone marrow of adults. The present study aimed to assess the ERFE serum concentrations and its predictors in infants.

Methods

ERFE was explored at 4 time points during the first year of life in 45 healthy, breastfed, normal birth weight (NBW) infants, and 136 marginally low birth weight infants (LBW, 2000–2500 g) receiving iron (N = 58) or placebo (N = 78) between 6 weeks and 6 months of age.

Results

ERFE concentrations were low at birth, increasing gradually during the first year of life. In NBW infants, reference ranges (5th to 95th percentile) were at 6 weeks < 0.005–0.99 ng/mL and at 12 months < 0.005–33.7 ng/mL. ERFE was higher in LBW infants at 6 weeks but lower at 12 months compared to NBW and minimally affected by iron supplementation among LBW infants. Correlations of ERFE with erythropoietic and iron status markers were weak and inconsistent.

Conclusions

The role of ERFE in the crosstalk of erythropoiesis and iron homeostasis remains unclear in infants and further studies on ERFE in infants and older children are warranted within the framework of the erythropoietin–ERFE–hepcidin axis.

Impact

Normal range of erythroferrone in healthy infants is described for the first time.
Erythroferrone in infants lacks correlation to iron status and markers of erythropoiesis.
The findings indicate differences in infant regulation of iron homeostasis as compared to adults.
The findings point to a need to study infant erythropoiesis separately from its adult counterpart.
The findings may have clinical impact on management strategies of iron-loading anemia in infancy.

### The risk of obesity by assessing infant growth against the UK-WHO charts compared to the UK90 reference: findings from the born in bradford birth cohort study [^bdcf764b]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Routine growth assessment is a fundamental part of the monitoring of child health in the United Kingdom (UK). Growth in weight, length, and head circumference is measured by child health practitioners during infancy at 10 to 14 days and six to eight weeks of age; weight is measured again at 12 months and 24 to 30 months of age. The primary reason for these assessments has traditionally been for the identification of growth faltering. However, recent increases in the prevalence of childhood obesity, and the identification of rapid infant weight gain as a determinant of later obesity, have emphasised the need for routine growth assessment to identify infants on a trajectory toward obesity.

The normality of the pattern of growth of an infant is determined by comparison to a growth chart. In the UK, the current growth charts are a combination of the UK90 reference and the World Health Organisation (WHO) 2006 child growth standard. The former is a true growth reference depicting the normal growth of children, whilst the WHO standard depicts the optimal growth of children who were specifically selected for inclusion in the chart source sample because they were exclusively or predominantly breastfed until at least four months of age in environments free from any socio-economic constraint to their growth. Goldstein and Tanner provide good discussion on the difference between a growth standard and a growth reference. Adopted for practice in 2009, the new charts in the UK are called the UK-WHO child growth charts; they combine recalculated UK90 reference birth data with the WHO standard data from ages two weeks to four years.

The use of the WHO standard data for growth assessment of UK infants presents a problem of interpretation. That dilemma is epitomised by the fact that the majority of UK infants are not fed according to the WHO recommendations and do not live in constraint-free environments. The similarity of their growth to that depicted in the WHO standard is thus not guaranteed. Indeed patterns of growth of infants from two UK studies used to test the WHO standard for adoption in the UK identified the fact that whilst growth in length was similar to the WHO standard, growth in weight differed significantly, demonstrating initial faltering followed by acceleration through the centiles. It was explained that this acceleration (in weight but not length) would "support efforts to avoid future childhood obesity" because more infants would be identified as having a high body mass index (BMI).
