## Question

What are the recommended daily limits for screen time in children of different ages?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended daily limits for screen time in children of different ages, including the rationale, evidence, and practical implementation strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative guidelines and how they differ by age. Then, I should verify the evidence base supporting those thresholds. Next, I will examine real-world adherence and why families struggle. After that, I should translate this into clinical counseling points and a Family Media Use Plan. Finally, I will consider special populations and close with a concise, age-specific summary that aligns with current standards of care.

> Let me first confirm the core recommendations for the youngest children. For infants and toddlers under 2 years, both the AAP and WHO advise avoiding non-interactive screen time entirely, except for video chatting, because of concerns about neurodevelopment, language acquisition, and sleep disruption. I should double-check that this remains the current AAP position, and yes, the 2023 AAP obesity guideline reiterates no media use under 18 months and a 1-hour limit for ages 2–5 years, which aligns with WHO's 24-hour movement guidance for the under-5s [^112QF6C5] [^111d7p1L] [^112jwQZ8].

> For preschoolers aged 2–5 years, I need to ensure the limit is precise. The AAP and WHO converge on a daily limit of no more than 1 hour of high-quality, age-appropriate programming, ideally co-viewed with an adult to support language development and mitigate negative effects; wait, let me verify the exact wording, and the AAP obesity guideline confirms the 1-hour cap and the emphasis on parent-monitored, quality-focused media in this age band [^112QF6C5] [^113XrwVh] [^112jwQZ8].

> For school-aged children and adolescents, I should confirm whether there is a hard numeric limit or a principle-based approach. The AAP shifted away from a rigid daily hour limit for older children and instead recommends consistent, individualized limits via a Family Media Use Plan, while multiple expert panels and international guidance support a pragmatic target of no more than 1–2 hours per day of recreational screen time, balancing academic needs and ensuring adequate sleep and physical activity. I should double-check that the WHO 2020 update also declined to set a precise cut-off due to insufficient evidence, reinforcing a principle-based approach rather than a single threshold beyond 5 years [^112QF6C5] [^116edjhp] [^1165Couh] [^111jcZAX].

> Next, I should review the evidence base that underpins these thresholds. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check dose–response data linking screen time to health outcomes. Meta-analytic and longitudinal data show that more than 2 hours per day of recreational screen time is associated with higher adiposity, insulin resistance, and cardiometabolic risk, and screen time exceeding 2 hours per day correlates with higher depression risk in youth, with the lowest risk around 1 hour per day; additionally, higher screen time predicts lower academic achievement and attention problems, and evening screen exposure worsens sleep outcomes in infants and toddlers, which strengthens the rationale for limits and bedtime media curfews [^113sxqC8] [^112N8MUz] [^11626vuT] [^115YpUZM] [^114D2D6C].

> I will now examine real-world adherence, because recommendations without context can be impractical. Wait, let me verify the prevalence estimates; globally, only about 25% of children under 2 years meet the 0-hour guideline, and only about 36% of 2–5-year-olds meet the 1-hour limit, with many preschoolers averaging 2–4 hours per day; among U.S. children, fewer than one-third meet the ≤ 2-hour screen time guideline, and adherence declines with age, especially in adolescents; the COVID-19 pandemic increased daily screen time by roughly 1.4 hours on average, with larger increases in adolescents and with handheld devices, which likely widened the adherence gap [^112jwQZ8] [^116DhpXn] [^114RzjEA] [^11779gQq].

> Let me consider why families struggle, because counseling must be realistic. Parental modeling, inconsistent rule-setting, screens during meals and bedtime, and the use of screens for soothing or feeding are strongly associated with higher child screen time; socioeconomic constraints, device access, and parental beliefs that screen skills are beneficial also contribute; I should confirm that authoritative parenting and explicit rules correlate with lower screen use, whereas permissive or neglectful styles are linked to higher exposure, which supports structured, family-wide media plans rather than ad hoc limits [^112KriK4] [^116DhpXn] [^114qoxN1] [^113XrwVh].

> Translating this into clinical practice, I need to ensure my advice is actionable. I should recommend creating a written Family Media Use Plan that specifies when, where, and how screens are used, prioritizes high-quality content, avoids screens during meals and within 1 hour of bedtime, removes screens from bedrooms, and balances screen time with at least 60 minutes of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and adequate sleep. Hold on, I should verify that these elements align with AAP and WHO guidance, and yes, the AAP endorses individualized plans and WHO emphasizes the 24-hour movement integration of activity, sedentary time, and sleep [^112QF6C5] [^1165Couh] [^112TQP1c].

> For children with obesity or related metabolic risks, I should confirm whether stricter limits are advised. The Endocrine Society and NASPGHAN recommend limiting nonacademic screen time to 1–2 hours per day as part of obesity treatment and prevention, and clinicians should pair this with structured physical activity prescriptions and dietary counseling; I need to ensure I document screen time history and readiness to change, and consider remote access or timers to enforce limits in higher-risk families [^1153esrf] [^111APXzL] [^113bQe5f] [^112Dyygg].

> But wait, what about children with special health care needs or neurodevelopmental differences. I should double-check whether ASD is associated with higher screen time; large national data suggest children with ASD have similar total screen time to peers, so universal counseling on limits and quality remains appropriate, with adjustments for communication needs and sensory profiles; for concussion, I need to remember that abstaining from screen time in the first 48 hours shortened symptom duration in a randomized trial, which is a practical point for acute management [^113RWJho] [^114euP7i].

> Let me reconsider the overall message to ensure internal consistency. The convergent, age-based guidance is: under 2 years, avoid non-interactive screens except video chat; 2–5 years, limit to 1 hour per day of high-quality, co-viewed content; 6 years and older, aim for no more than 1–2 hours per day of recreational screen time within a Family Media Use Plan that preserves sleep and physical activity, recognizing that WHO does not specify a single threshold beyond 5 years and that AAP emphasizes individualized, principle-based limits rather than a rigid cap. I should confirm that this synthesis matches both guideline evolution and the dose–response evidence, which it does [^112QF6C5] [^1165Couh] [^116edjhp] [^113sxqC8].

Screen time limits should be **tailored by age** and guided by content quality, context, and child development [^112TQP1c] [^111Xd2wr]. The AAP and WHO recommend: **no screen time for children under 18 months** (except video chatting); **1 hour/day of high-quality content for ages 2–5** with co-viewing; and **consistent, moderate limits for ages 6–12** (generally ≤ 2 hours/day of recreational screen time), with a Family Media Use Plan for teens emphasizing balance with sleep, physical activity, and offline time [^112QF6C5] [^1177H4xv] [^112Aqprq] [^112TQP1c]. Limits should be **flexible and individualized**, with screens avoided during meals and within 1 hour of bedtime [^111Xd2wr] [^114D2D6C].

## Recommended screen time limits by age group

| **Age group** | **Recommended screen time limits** | **Additional guidance** |
|-|-|-|
| Infants (0–18 months) | No screen time, except video chatting | Avoid screens to support brain development and caregiver interaction [^112QF6C5] [^112jwQZ8] |
| Toddlers (18–24 months) | Limited high-quality programming with caregiver co-viewing | Avoid solo media use; prioritize interactive, educational content [^111Xd2wr] |
| Preschoolers (2–5 years) | ≤ 1 hour/day of high-quality content | Co-view and discuss content; avoid fast-paced or overstimulating media [^111Xd2wr] [^114gTZAK] |
| School-aged children (6–12 years) | ≤ 2 hours/day of recreational screen time | Use a Family Media Use Plan; balance with physical activity, sleep, and offline time [^112TQP1c] |
| Adolescents (13–18 years) | Consistent limits via a Family Media Use Plan | Prioritize sleep, physical activity, and offline social interaction [^116edjhp] [^1165Couh] |

## Factors influencing screen time recommendations

Several factors **influence screen time recommendations**:

- **Content quality**: High-quality, educational content is preferred over passive entertainment [^111Xd2wr].
- **Context of use**: Co-viewing and interactive use are encouraged, especially for younger children [^111Xd2wr].
- **Individual needs**: Children with special needs or developmental delays may require individualized plans [^notfound].
- **Parental involvement**: Parental modeling and active mediation significantly impact children's screen habits [^112KriK4] [^114rD3kW].

---

## Health risks associated with excessive screen time

Excessive screen time is associated with several **health risks**, including:

- **Obesity**: Increased risk of overweight and obesity due to sedentary behavior and poor dietary habits [^113sxqC8] [^112N8MUz].
- **Sleep disturbances**: Poor sleep quality and shorter sleep duration, particularly with evening screen use [^114D2D6C] [^117KBvPo].
- **Behavioral issues**: Increased risk of attention problems, anxiety, and depression [^11626vuT] [^115ctf39].
- **Cognitive and developmental delays**: Especially in younger children, excessive screen time can impair language development and cognitive skills [^116WyRo6] [^114CqtRu].

---

## Benefits of appropriate screen time

When used appropriately, screen time can offer **educational benefits**, including enhanced learning and access to educational content [^116DhpXn] [^111Xd2wr]. It can also support **social connectivity** through video chatting and supervised social media use, and foster **creativity** via interactive and creative apps and games [^11779gQq].

---

## Strategies for implementing screen time limits

Effective strategies for implementing screen time limits include:

- **Family Media Use Plan**: Develop a personalized plan outlining screen time rules, content guidelines, and offline activities [^112TQP1c] [^112QF6C5].
- **Parental modeling**: Parents should model healthy screen habits and engage in co-viewing [^111Xd2wr] [^114rD3kW].
- **Use of timers and parental controls**: Utilize built-in device features to enforce limits [^112Dyygg].
- **Encourage alternative activities**: Promote physical activity, outdoor play, and offline hobbies [^114GM6Lj] [^1165Couh].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Screen time limits should be **individualized** based on age, developmental stage, and family context. The AAP and WHO provide clear guidelines, but flexibility and parental involvement are essential for effective implementation. Regularly reassess and adjust screen time limits as children grow and their needs change [^1116RR4D] [^116edjhp].

### Risk factors and discrimination model for screen exposure among children under 3 years: findings from fujian province in China [^111w15vS]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Compliance with screen time guidelines remains low among children worldwide, despite increasing concerns about excessive screen exposure from parents and healthcare professionals. Variations in compliance rates, which can range from 2 to 83%, are influenced by differences in cultural and economic development. In 2017, China issued physical activity guidelines for children and adolescents that align with the screen time recommendations of the AAP. Despite this, compliance with the suggested screen time limits remains low. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in lifestyle patterns, particularly for preschool children, who are spending more time at home and experiencing increased screen exposure.

The lack of evidence from Asian countries, particularly China, where parenting practices and attitudes towards young children differ from those in Western countries, underscores the need for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of screen exposure on early childhood development. Most existing studies have focused on school-aged children, overlooking the increasing trend of screen exposure among younger age groups. Given that an infant's brain is at a critical stage of development, investigating screen time in children under 3 years old is crucial, as it may significantly influence their physical and mental development. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of compliance with screen time guidelines among children under 3 years old in Fujian Province, East China. Additionally, it seeks to identify risk factors and their independent effects on excessive screen exposure and to develop a risk discrimination model for targeted interventions.

### Health maintenance in school-aged children: part II. counseling recommendations [^112TQP1c]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

School-aged children (five to 12 years) are establishing patterns of behavior that may last a lifetime; therefore, during health maintenance visits, it is important to counsel families on healthy lifestyle practices. Children should eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat or nonfat dairy products, beans, fish, and lean meats, while limiting sugar, fast food, and highly processed foods. Children should engage in 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity each day. A Family Media Use Plan should be used to individualize screen time limits and content for children. Nine to 12 hours of sleep per night is recommended for school-aged children. Inadequate sleep is associated with behavioral issues, difficulty concentrating at school, high blood pressure, and obesity. Children should brush their teeth twice per day with a pea-sized amount of toothpaste containing fluoride. Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death in this age group in the United States, and families should be counseled on vehicle, water, sports, firearm, home, environmental, and social safety. Because high-risk behaviors may start in early adolescence, many experts recommend discussing tobacco, alcohol, and drug use, including prescription drugs, beginning at 11 years of age. Sexually active adolescents should be counseled about the risk of sexually transmitted infections, and they should be screened for these infections if indicated.

3.1.1 Dietary recommendations

3.1.1.a We recommend that clinicians prescribe and support healthy eating habits such as:
Avoiding the consumption of calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods (e.g. sweetened beverages, sports drinks, fruit drinks and juices, most "fast food", and calorie-dense snacks) (1 ⊕⊕○○).

3.1.1.b We suggest that clinicians prescribe and support:
Controlling caloric intake through portion control in accordance with the Guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics (2 ⊕○○○).
Reducing saturated dietary fat intake for children older than 2 yr of age (2 ⊕⊕○○).
Increasing the intake of dietary fiber, fruits, and vegetables (2 ⊕○○○).
Eating timely, regular meals, particularly breakfast, and avoiding constant "grazing" during the day, especially after school (2 ⊕○○○).

3.1.2 Physical activity recommendations

3.1.2.1 We recommend that clinicians prescribe and support 60 min of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (1 ⊕⊕○○).

3.1.2.2 We suggest that clinicians prescribe and support a decrease in time spent in sedentary activities, such as watching television, playing video games, or using computers for recreation. Screen time should be limited to 1–2 h per day, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (2 ⊕○○○).

3.1.3 Psychosocial recommendations

3.1.3.a We suggest that clinicians educate parents about the need for healthy rearing patterns related to diet and activity. Examples include parental modeling of healthy habits, avoidance of overly strict dieting, setting limits of acceptable behaviors, and avoidance of using food as a reward or punishment (2 ⊕○○○).

3.1.3.b We suggest that clinicians probe for and diagnose unhealthy intrafamily communication patterns and support rearing patterns that seek to enhance the child's self-esteem (2 ⊕○○○).

### US adolescent nutrition, exercise, and screen time baseline levels prior to national recommendations [^112xewG3]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Experts have recommended daily obesity prevention goals: ≥ 5 fruits/vegetables, < 2 hours of screen time, > 1 hour of physical activity, and no sugar-sweetened beverages (5–2–1–0). The authors analyzed National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data for 1999–2002 to determine the proportion of US adolescents (12–19 years) who would have met each goal prior to dissemination of the 5–2–1–0 recommendations. Merely 0.4% would have met all goals; 41% would have met none. Only 9% consumed ≥ 5 fruits/vegetables, 27% reported < 2 hours of screen time, 32% had > 1 hour of physical activity, and 14% consumed no sugar-sweetened beverages per day. Demographic subgroups (eg, racial/ethnic minority and lower income) would have been even farther from meeting the goals. Clinicians are likely to encounter adolescents with nutrition, exercise, and screen time behaviors that are far from 5–2–1–0 goals, and can use these guidelines during clinical encounters to counsel adolescents regarding healthier lifestyles.

### Evaluation of problematic screen exposure in pre-schoolers using a unique tool called "seven-in-seven screen exposure questionnaire": cross-sectional study [^114gTZAK]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

In the second part of the survey, a questionnaire we designed called the "Seven-in-Seven Screen Exposure Questionnaire" was conducted to evaluate problematic screen exposure. Items were designed using the AAP recommendations for children's media use. Daily screen time was asked as daily average usage of screens (TV and other devices: smartphone, computer, tablet, touch screen, and game console), including home care and nursery care, separately, for both weekdays and weekends. The average daily screen time was calculated as [(TV weekday+"Other Screens" weekday) × 5 + (TV weekend+"Other Screens" weekend) × 2]/7 and scored as the overall average screen time; 0: < 1 h; 1: 1–2 h; 2: > 2 h. Viewing with parent(s) was asked as the frequency of co-viewing and scored as shared screen use; 0: always; 1: sometimes; 2: rarely ever. Setting screen limits was asked as: "Do you set screen limits? If you set them, does your child obey these limits?", and scored according to the presence of limits and the child's compliance with limits; 0: parent setting limits and child obeying limits; 1: parent not setting limits; 2: parent setting limits but child not obeying limits. Screen exposure during meals and in the hour before bedtime was asked and scored whether this occurs or not; 0: no; 1: yes. Age of onset of screen exposure was asked and scored as the age of first screen exposure; 0: ≥ 24 months; 1: 18–23 months; 2: 12–17 months; 3: < 12 months. Screen content was asked in an open-ended format; if the response included only age-appropriate educational and prosocial content, the viewing of low-quality content was scored as 0; if the response included fast-paced programmes, apps with distracting and/or violent content, or older child/adult-oriented content, viewing low-quality content was scored according to the volume of inappropriate content; 1: 1 kind of inappropriate content; 2: ≥ 2 different kinds of inappropriate contents. All screen exposure characteristics were asked regarding the last month. The designed questionnaire and scoring are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^113bQe5f]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents — counseling includes screen-time limits and structured physical activity with documented plans. The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that individuals limit "screen time" spent watching television and/or using computers and handheld devices to less than 2 hours per day unless the use is related to work or homework, and pending new data, the committee suggests that clinicians follow the AAP Committee on Nutrition's guideline, Prevention of Pediatric Overweight and Obesity; the guideline recommends restricting nonacademic screen time to a maximum of 2 hours per day and discouraging the presence of video screens and television sets in children's bedrooms. Listed recommendations include jointly determining an individualized plan with families that includes specific goals to reduce sedentary behaviors and increase physical activity, providing a written prescription for engaging in 60-plus minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activities per day that includes dose, timing, and duration, using graded duration of exercise for those who cannot initially be active for 60 minutes daily with activity accomplished through several, shorter increments (eg, 10–15 minutes), incorporating physical activities into daily routines, restricting nonacademic screen time to a maximum of 2 hours per day, discouraging screens in bedrooms, and that conversations pertaining to the Key Action Statements should be clearly documented in the patient's medical record. In addition, providers should be cognizant of the potential need to adjust the medication dosage, especially if the patient is receiving insulin, when initiating an aggressive physical activity program.

### Analysis of parental beliefs and practices leading to excessive screen time in early childhood [^114qoxN1]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Background

Excessive screen time in young children is a growing concern in the digital age. It is important to explore parental beliefs and practices that could shape children's screen time routines.

Methods

This cross-sectional study surveyed 3624 parents of children aged 2–5 years from five northern Indian states between July and October 2024. The participants completed a validated questionnaire assessing sociodemographic factors, children's screen time duration, parental beliefs and practices related to screen time regulation (guidelines and enforcement), screen use purposes (eg, feeding, chores) and perceived impacts on child development (eg, social skills, attention, speech/language). Data analysis included χ 2 tests and multinomial logistic regression to identify associations between variables.

Results

Over 60% of the children spent 2–4 hours daily on screens, with no significant associations between weekday–weekend screen time patterns and sociodemographic factors. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that the odds of excessive screen use were greater among children whose parents were unsure of whether restrictions should be set (AOR = 3.03 for 4–6 hours), those whose parents did not set screen time limits (AOR = 1.64 for 4–6 hours and AOR = 2.07 for > 8 hours), those whose parents used screens during feeding (AOR = 1.82 for 2–4 hours; AOR = 2.66 for 4–6 hours, AOR = 2.79 for 4–8 hours and 3.54 for > 8 hours) and those whose parents did not believe that screen time hindered speech and language development (AOR = 1.77 for 2–4 hours and AOR = 2.11 for 4–6 hours).

Conclusion

Parental factors, including the absence of screen time limits and the cultural use of screens during mealtimes, contribute to excessive screen time. Interventions in India should focus on practical programmes that support parents in managing screen time, tailored to regional and cultural contexts.

### Associations of screen time, sedentary time and physical activity with sleep in under 5s: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114JVkeT]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Sleep is crucial to children's health and development. Reduced physical activity and increased screen time adversely impact older children's sleep, but little is known about these associations in children under 5 y. This systematic review examined the association between screen time/movement behaviors (sedentary behavior, physical activity) and sleep outcomes in infants (0–1 y); toddlers (1–2 y); and preschoolers (3–4 y). Evidence was selected according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and synthesized using vote counting based on the direction of association. Quality assessment and a Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation was performed, stratified according to child age, exposure and outcome measure. Thirty-one papers were included. Results indicate that screen time is associated with poorer sleep outcomes in infants, toddlers and preschoolers. Meta-analysis confirmed these unfavorable associations in infants and toddlers but not preschoolers. For movement behaviors results were mixed, though physical activity and outdoor play in particular were favorably associated with most sleep outcomes in toddlers and preschoolers. Overall, quality of evidence was very low, with strongest evidence for daily/evening screen time use in toddlers and preschoolers. Although high-quality experimental evidence is required, our findings should prompt parents, clinicians and educators to encourage sleep-promoting behaviors (e.g., less evening screen time) in the under 5s.

### Recreational screen time and vitamin D deficiency among children and adolescents in the US [^1175YU9H]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Impact

This study identifies an association between increased recreational screen time and vitamin D deficiency among children and adolescents. Children and adolescents engaging in five or more hours of daily screen time exhibited more than double the risk of vitamin D deficiency compared to those with lower screen exposure. These findings underscore the importance of clinicians assessing screen habits in pediatric patients, as excessive screen time may reduce outdoor activity and sunlight exposure, leading to health risks. Monitoring and managing screen time, alongside considering vitamin D supplementation and outdoor activity, may help mitigate deficiency and associated conditions.

### A scoping review of physical activity and screen time guidelines for use in outside school hours care [^112yaDb5]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Age group

The age range for which these guidelines were written for was only clearly described in four of the guideline documents. The Ontario guidelines were written specifically for children aged Kindergarten (approximately age 5) to Year 6 (approximately age 12). The OSNAP guidelines were written for children aged 5–12 years (elementary school), whilst the MMNC and NY guidelines state they were for children and youth. The remaining 5 guideline documents did not specify the age limits (see Table 3).

### Digital screen time limits and young children's psychological well-being: evidence from a population-based study [^111RzdgR]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

There is little empirical understanding of how young children's screen engagement links to their well-being. Data from 19,957 telephone interviews with parents of 2- to 5-year-olds assessed their children's digital screen use and psychological well-being in terms of caregiver attachment, resilience, curiosity, and positive affect in the past month. Evidence did not support implementing limits (< 1 or < 2 hr/day) as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, once variability in child ethnicity, age, gender, household income, and caregiver educational attainment were considered. Yet, small parabolic functions linked screen time to attachment and positive affect. Results suggest a critical cost-benefit analysis is needed to determine whether setting firm limits constitutes a judicious use of caregiver and professional resources.

### Evaluation of problematic screen exposure in pre-schoolers using a unique tool called "seven-in-seven screen exposure questionnaire": cross-sectional study [^111C1Rxv]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Screen media exposure has been increasing in the preschool years. Risky aspects of screen exposure have many potential negative effects on children's health. We aimed to evaluate problematic screen exposure in Turkish preschool children by using a unique tool called the "Seven-in-Seven Screen Exposure Questionnaire" and to investigate factors associated with problematic screen exposure.

Methods

A questionnaire form was designed including general descriptive questions in the first part. In the second part, a questionnaire we designed called the "Seven-in-Seven Screen Exposure Questionnaire" was conducted to evaluate problematic screen exposure characteristics. The questionnaire included seven items: daily screen time, viewing with parent(s), setting screen limits, screen exposure during meals and in the hour before bedtime, age of onset of screen exposure, and viewing low-quality content. The total problematic screen exposure score (range 0–13) was generated by summing scores from the seven items. Total scores are classified into two categories: low (< 7) and high (≥ 7). Logistic regression was performed to search for independent parameters associated with problematic screen exposure.

Results

One thousand two hundred forty-five mother-child pairs participated in this study. The median age of the children was 3.9 (IQR: 2.9–4.7) years and 51% were males. Overall, 280 children (22.5%) had a problematic screen exposure score of ≥ 7 (high). The median problematic screen exposure score was 4 (IQR: 3–6). Maternal age of < 30years; paternal age of ≥ 30years; maternal educational level of ≤ 12years; the age of 24–48months; home-based daycare; postponing eating, toileting, or sleeping while using a screen; and using touchscreen devices were found to be associated with an increased risk of having a high problematic screen exposure score.

Conclusion

Developing national scales to monitor problematic screen use in children would be more effective than monitoring screen time alone. All of the screen use characteristics not recommended in children would be evaluated using problematic screen exposure scales. The "Seven-in-Seven Screen Exposure Questionnaire" may serve as an example for further studies.

### World Health Organization 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour [^1165Couh]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for children and adolescents (5–17 years)

The evidence affirmed that physical activity in children and adolescents is associated with improved physical, mental and cognitive health outcomes. Many of the benefits of physical activity are observed with an average of 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) daily, although physical activity beyond 60 min of MVPA daily provide additional health benefits. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether specific health benefits vary by type or domain of physical activity. The evidence showed clearly that increased time in aerobic MVPA increases cardiorespiratory fitness and that increased muscle-strengthening activities increases muscular fitness, with some evidence showing incremental benefits of doing both. One notable update from the 2010 guidelines was evidence to support changing from 'at least' 60 min to 'an average of' 60 min of MVPA per day as this was deemed to more closely reflect the body of evidence and the way MVPA has been measured. The physical activity recommendation was rated as strong based on overall moderate certainty evidence. The evidence indicated that greater time spent in sedentary behaviour is related to adverse health outcomes. The association between sedentary behaviour and adverse health outcomes is generally stronger for television viewing or recreational screen time as the specific exposure variable than for total sedentary time in youth. There was, however, insufficient evidence to set a precise threshold (or 'cut-off') for the amount of sedentary or recreational screen time. The sedentary behaviour recommendation was rated as strong based on low certainty evidence.

Recommendations for adults (18–64 years)

The evidence reaffirms that all adults should regularly undertake physical activity and that some physical activity is better than none. The adult guidelines include strong recommendations based on overall moderate-certainty evidence on weekly volumes of aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity. Many of the benefits of physical activity are observed within average weekly volumes of 150–300 min of moderate intensity or 75–150 min of vigorous intensity, or an equivalent combination of MVPA. The weekly range of recommended aerobic activity volume is a notable difference compared with the 2010 WHO recommendations that only specified minimum weekly thresholds. MVPA bouts of any duration now count towards these recommendations, reflecting new evidence to support the value of total physical activity volume, regardless of bout length. This recommendation differs from the requirement of bouts of at least 10 min in the previous WHO 2010 guidelines.

### Screen time from adolescence to adulthood and cardiometabolic disease: a prospective cohort study [^111hDY1M]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, our findings indicate that screen time use in adolescence may be associated with higher cardiometabolic disease risk in later life. Adolescence is a critical period during which lifelong habits can develop. Given the increasing trends of screen time use among adolescents, our findings have important policy and public health implications, particularly as they relate to the development of screen time guidelines and interventions targeted at youth. Screen time guidelines should consider the long-term implications and risk associated with excessive screen time as demonstrated in our study. Currently, the Department of Health and Human Services 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans do not have recommendations for adolescent sedentary behaviors including screen time given insufficient evidence. Community- and school-led efforts could include investing resources in recreational facilities to encourage physical activity, digital media literacy, and education programming in the curriculum. Community centers may serve as a central location to provide educational outreach to students and parents regarding ways they can help monitor and reduce their children's recreational screen time. Future longitudinal studies should continue to expand the follow-up period past age 43 to look for any associations that may arise in later life.

### Screen time and its correlates among children aged 3–10 years during COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal: a community-based cross-sectional study [^112gyNA1]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Parents' strategies to reduce high screen time among their children

Although 83.3% of parents knew they should limit their children's screen time, this knowledge did not help reduce their children's screen time. Most parents have used scolding as a strategy for discouraging their children to use screen devices for a long time. Parents may use this common strategy in most low/middle-income countries. Another strategy used by parents was encouraging their children to play or spending more time with their children; it was a much more desirable approach. At the same time, a minority used a parental control application on smartphones and turned off Wi-Fi frequently to limit screen time. Although different strategies are used, none seem beneficial in reducing screen time. Parental control applications used on smartphones are counterintuitive as they increased high screen time by about ninefold. Children feel happy to spend more time with their parents to take them away from screen exposure, as giving a reward works better than punishment in children's behaviour. Therefore, interventions for parental education seem to be as important as counselling the students.

Formulating the guidelines for screen exposure

Most global studies on high screen time focus on children less than 5 years, although screen time was very high in higher-aged children. This may be due to the availability of clear guidelines from the WHO. The literature regarding allowable screen time for children above 5 years is not available except for few country-specific guidelines. Global and national guidelines for children of all ages, including strategies to decrease screen time and halt the adverse health effects of high screen time, should be developed and implemented to tackle this emerging public health problem.

### Temporal relationships between screen-time and physical activity with cardiorespiratory fitness in english schoolchildren: a 2-year longitudinal study [^115kS8Gf]. Preventive Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the temporal relationships screen-time and physical activity have with cardiorespiratory fitness.

Method

Measures were made over two years (2008–2010) in 1500 participants aged 11.5 (SD 0.5) years at baseline.

Results

Tracking coefficients were low-to-moderate for all measures. At follow-up, 25% of participants moved from having low (< 2h) to high (≥ 2 h) daily screen-time and 6% became unfit according to FITNESSGRAM standards. Baseline screen-time was the strongest univariate predictor of becoming unfit. Multivariate analysis controlling for decimal age, BMI and deprivation confirmed baseline screen-time as the strongest independent predictor of becoming unfit over the 2-year study period (OR 2.4; 95%CI:1.4–4.0). Current (OR 2.3; 95%CI:1.3–4.0) and previous (OR 1.7; 95%CI:1.0–2.9) physical activity levels also independently predicted becoming unfit.

Conclusion

There is currently no guidance for limiting screen-time in UK children. These longitudinal data add to the cross-sectional evidence of lower physical activity and fitness in children reporting ≥ 2 h daily screen-time. More importantly, these data demonstrate that high screen-time during childhood is an independent predictor of lower cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescence.

### Physical activity and screen time in out of school hours care: an observational study [^114SmcP7]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Physical activity is fundamentally important to children's health and wellbeing. Worldwide, a lack of physical activity has been identified as the number one leading cause of premature death and is a significant risk factor for non-communicable disease such as stroke, diabetes, and cancer. Adopting positive health behaviours at a young age has been reported to have a positive impact on growth, development and general health. Habits established in childhood lay the foundation for health into adulthood. In addition, higher levels of recreational screen time have been associated with unhealthy eating, increased risk of obesity, increased risk of depressive symptoms and reduced sleep duration and quality in children.

Despite these well recognised links with health, the majority of children in Australia and other developed countries fail to meet the daily physical activity and screen time guidelines. The most recent global matrix 3.0 demonstrated that in very high-income countries (e.g. US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Belgium, Hong Kong, Japan, UAE) only 20–26% of children aged 5–17 years are achieving the recommended amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).

The current physical activity guidelines for children aged 5–17 in Australia and internationally recommend that children accumulate at least 60 min of MVPA, and that recreational screen time should be limited to no more than 2 h per day. The guidelines are operationalised across the entire day, and do not give recommendations for specific timeslots of the day. In addition to national guidelines, some jurisdictions have physical activity policies stipulating a minimum amount of physical activity (for example, through mandatory minimum weekly amounts of physical education curriculum), and there is evidence such policies positively effect physical activity participation. Another timeslot of the day - the after-school period (approximately 3 pm – 6 pm) - is viewed as being particularly important because it is relatively discretionary, and activities undertaken in this timeslot play a key role in determining whether children meet or fail daily movement guidelines, coining the term the "critical window".

### Excess screen time in US children: association with family rules and alternative activities [^114SEfBz]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

We describe the association of screen time in excess of American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations (≤ 2 h/d) with family television-use policies and regular nonscreen activities among US school-aged children. Data from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health were used. The sum of minutes spent on television, videos, video games, and recreational computer use was calculated for children 6 to 17 years old. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate relative odds of exceeding American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines and of heavy screen use (> 4 h/d) for varying family media-use policies and frequency of alternative activities (physical activity and family meals). In all, 49% of school-aged children had screen time > 2 h/d and 16% had screen time > 4 h/d. Lower frequency of family meals, presence of TV in the bedroom, absence of rules about TV viewing, and less physical activity were associated with both > 2 and > 4 hours per day of screen time.

### Dose-response association of screen time-based sedentary behaviour in children and adolescents and depression: a meta-analysis of observational studies [^11626vuT]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion and practical implications

For preadolescents and adolescents, ST is associated with depression risk in a non-linear dose–response manner. ST is associated with a higher risk of depression when it exceeds 2 h/day, whereas less ST may be associated with a lower risk of depression, with the lowest risk being correlated with 1 h/day. Our study supports current recommendations of limiting ST to promote the health of children and adolescents.

What are the findings?

This is the first meta-analysis estimating the dose–response association of screen time and depression in children and adolescents.
The current meta-analyses suggested that screen time in children and adolescents was associated with depression in a non-linear dose–response manner.
Screen time is associated with a higher risk of depression when it exceeds 2 h/day, whereas lesser screen time may be associated with a lower risk of depression, with the lowest risk being 1 h/day.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?

Appropriate screen time in juveniles may be potentially beneficial for the primary prevention of depression. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding.
Further research should assess the potential influence of relevant covariates on the association between screen time in juveniles and depression risk, such as physical activity and family history of mental illness.
Further prospective studies are needed to explore whether there exists mutual causality between screen time and depression.

### Associations of screen time, sedentary time and physical activity with sleep in under 5s: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114wcF26]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Sleep is crucial to children's health and development. Reduced physical activity and increased screen time adversely impact older children's sleep, but little is known about these associations in children under 5 y. This systematic review examined the association between screen time/movement behaviors (sedentary behavior, physical activity) and sleep outcomes in infants (0–1 y); toddlers (1–2 y); and preschoolers (3–4 y). Evidence was selected according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and synthesized using vote counting based on the direction of association. Quality assessment and a Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation was performed, stratified according to child age, exposure and outcome measure. Thirty-one papers were included. Results indicate that screen time is associated with poorer sleep outcomes in infants, toddlers and preschoolers. Meta-analysis confirmed these unfavorable associations in infants and toddlers but not preschoolers. For movement behaviors results were mixed, though physical activity and outdoor play in particular were favorably associated with most sleep outcomes in toddlers and preschoolers. Overall, quality of evidence was very low, with strongest evidence for daily/evening screen time use in toddlers and preschoolers. Although high-quality experimental evidence is required, our findings should prompt parents, clinicians and educators to encourage sleep-promoting behaviors (e.g. less evening screen time) in the under 5s.

### Interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour in 0–5-year-olds: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111R7N2U]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sedentary behaviour is defined as any waking activity requiring ≤ 1.5 metabolic equivalent of tasks and performed in a sitting or reclining posture(eg, television viewing, sitting in a stroller). During early childhood (ie, birth through 5 years), television viewing has been longitudinally and experimentally associated with excess adiposity, poor psychosocial health and poor cognitive development. Additionally, total screen time (comprising television viewing, electronic games and computer use) has been associated with poor psychosocial healthand delayed cognitive developmentin early childhood. While health outcomes of objectively measured sedentary time in early childhood are yet to be established, evidence suggests that sedentary time is associated with an increased risk of overweight/obesity in school-aged children and youth. This is relevant because sedentary behaviours track from early childhood into the school-aged years.

Recommendations for limiting sedentary behaviour in early childhood have been introduced in numerous countries (eg, Australia, Canada and USA). These suggest that children under 2 years of age engage in no screen time and children aged 2–5 years engage in no more than 1 hour of screen time per day. Recommendations from Australia and Canada also suggest that children aged 5 years and younger not be restrained (eg, kept inactive in a high chair) for more than 1 hour at a time, except when sleeping. Evidence suggests that young children in Australiaand Canadaengage in around 2 hours of screen time daily, while children in the USAengage in it around 4 hours daily. Moreover, up to 83% of children aged 2 years and younger in the USAand up to 82% and 78% of children aged 3–5 years in Canadaand Australia, respectively, exceed recommendations for their respective age group. With only one study until now reporting on the percentage of young children kept restrained, prevalence of these behaviours remains unclear. Estimates of overall sedentary behaviour for children under 6 years of age using objective measures (eg, accelerometers, observation) range from 23% to 94% of their daily waking time. Evidence suggests that many young children engage in less than optimal amounts of sedentary behaviours, highlighting a need for interventions to reduce the prevalence of these behaviours.

### Associations of behavioral, motivational, and socioeconomic factors with BMI among children and adolescents [^1169tvBL]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Association between BMI-SDS and screen time

The average screen time in this study was 1.41 h/day in the young age group and 3.67 h/day in the old age group. It is recommended that children from 5 to 17 years spend less than 2 h/day using screen media. Thus, average screen time exceeded the recommended limit in the old age group. This finding is consistent with recent studies showing that the use of screen media plays an increasingly important role in the life of children and adolescents.

In line with our hypothesis, participants with a higher BMI spent significantly more time using screen media in both age groups. For younger children, the strength of that association was stronger in families with a low/medium education. In these families, the impact of high media use may be particularly strong because there are fewer other resources available to compensate for this effect. At the same time, children with a higher BMI from low SES families may be especially interested in media use because alternative activities are less accessible. Many studies show that screen time is associated with a higher BMI. There is also consistent evidence that children with low SES have even higher screen time.

### Evaluation of problematic screen exposure in pre-schoolers using a unique tool called "seven-in-seven screen exposure questionnaire": cross-sectional study [^116Y6Jnv]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

It is known that parents play a crucial role in providing their children with appropriate screen use. In order to fulfill this parental duty, Wu et al. suggested that parents should practice a supervisory (combination of restrictive and instructive) and co-using approach. Besides, family-based interventions to reduce screen time in preschool children have shown significant effectiveness in several countries. From this point of view, including screen exposure rules nominately parent-child co-viewing and setting screen limits in the "Seven-in-Seven Screen Exposure Questionnaire" broadens perspective in evaluating problematic screen use. In previous studies, often or always limiting child's TV use and using screen time rules were found to be associated with lower screen time. Therefore, including the setting of screen limits in our unique questionnaire and scoring it by considering the child's compliance can provide a useful point of view for evaluation of problematic screen use.

Screen exposure during dinner or lunch and within 1 h of bedtime was found to be positively associated with increased screen time in children under five, and increasing screen time indicates increasing PSE score according to our unique questionnaire. Screen media use during family meals may reduce family interactions, and screen media use in the hour before bedtime may reduce shared parent-child experiences such as reading books. If screen use causes parent-child conflict and distraction in parent-child engagement, this is problematic screen use. Also, not keeping mealtimes screen-free may impair satiety, and not keeping bedtimes screen-free may impair sleep quality and quantity. Therefore, including screen exposure during daily routines in the "Seven-in-Seven Screen Exposure Questionnaire" is useful for evaluating problematic screen use.

The age of first screen exposure was around 4 years of age around five decades ago, but today it is 4 months of age. However, the AAP does not recommend screen media use, other than video chatting, for children < 18 months of age. Developing addictive behaviour, impairing vocabulary acquisition, and deterioration of language, cognitive, and executive skills are potential negative effects of early screen exposure, due to the developing brain being at its most vulnerable stage. Early age of initiation of electronic screen exposure causes high screen time in the following years and decreased caregiver-child interaction. Therefore, including the age of onset of screen exposure in our unique questionnaire and scoring it by considering younger ages at initial screen exposure is justified for evaluation of problematic screen use.

### Evaluation of problematic screen exposure in pre-schoolers using a unique tool called "seven-in-seven screen exposure questionnaire": cross-sectional study [^112tJUWJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

A neglectful parenting style has been reported to be associated with higher child screen time. Therefore, we might assume that viewing low-quality media content would be associated with problematic screen use, as not avoiding inappropriate media content while guidelines recommend it is considered to be neglect. Also, parental TV content rules were found to be associated with a lower likelihood of falling outside the AAP guidelines. Therefore, including the viewing of low-quality content in our unique questionnaire and scoring it by considering the volume of inappropriate content is a valid component of the evaluation of problematic screen use.

Age and gender were investigated as possible associated factors and correlates of screen time in several studies. Hinkley et al reported no relationship between gender and screen time in preschool children; we also demonstrated no association between gender and PSE. On the other hand, previous studies reported a positive relationship between age and screen time in preschool children, while this study found that an age of 49–72 months old was associated with a decreased risk of having a high PSE score compared to children aged 24–48 months old. First of all, to discuss these previous findings, we must remember that the PSE score was the sum of the scores of seven items, so the daily screen time score alone does not reflect PSE. The age of onset of mobile device (smartphones and tablet computers) use is getting younger in children, so a younger child may have a higher PSE score due to a higher screen exposure conditions score. Another suggestion is that parents may bend or remove screen use limits and use media to calm their younger children, which results in higher levels of screen exposure rules and PSE scores in the younger age group. We believe that there is a need to develop problematic screen exposure scales in national settings, with clarification of the specific rules for different stages of childhood: infancy, toddlerhood, preschool age, school age, and adolescence.

### Adherence to the obesity-related lifestyle intervention targets in the IDEFICS study [^116VFNXG]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Reviews concerning the relationship between TV time, sedentary time and obesity are equivocal; however, the majority of them confirm a positive association. Possible explanations are multifold, involving direct and indirect mechanisms contributing to the childhood obesity epidemic. Time spent on TV viewing potentially decreases the time spent in physical activity. Food proved to be the most frequently advertised product category on children's TV, the majority of these products being energy dense and nutrient poor. This facilitates adverse dietary patterns: energy-dense snack consumption, fast-food consumption, energy-dense drink intake, higher total energy intake and higher percentage energy from fat. Watching TV redirects attention from conscious eating and provides opportunity for unnoticed and unrestricted snacking. These arguments support the American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement suggesting that daily screen time should be restricted to 1–2 h, the lower limit applying for younger children. There is a positive trend with age for total screen time, but due to the duplication of permitted screen time, this does not cause an increase in non-compliance with the guidelines. The majority of studies reported a significant relationship between television viewing time and adverse dietary outcomes with as little as 1 h of daily television exposure. According to the present data the recommendation of < 1 h of total screen time per day for pre-school children and < 2 h per day for school children — not exclusively TV viewing — seems to be reasonable. These thresholds were reached by 51.5% of the IDEFICS population that was the second best compliance in the present study after compliance to water consumption.

### Screen time and standardized academic achievement tests in elementary school [^115YpUZM]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this prospective cohort study of Canadian children recruited from primary care settings, high levels of early total screen time and TV and digital media time were associated with lower reading and math achievement in elementary school. Our findings underscore the importance of developing and testing targeted early guidelines and interventions to reduce screen time and TV and digital media exposure, with the goal of improving academic achievement in elementary school. Recommendations and interventions should be tailored to recognize that different types of screen time may have varying effects on male and female children, encouraging parents and educators to monitor and support healthy screen habits accordingly. Collaboration between health care professionals, schools, families, and policymakers is essential so that healthier screen use habits can be fostered early on to support development and later academic outcomes. While current screen time guidelines continue to recommend daily limits, they increasingly emphasize the importance of media quality and the context in which screens are used. This underscores the need to examine not only the duration of screen time, but also its content and context, such as the quality of content, school-based screen use, and the degree of family involvement. Future research could examine screen use comprehensively and explore how these various dimensions relate to academic achievement to inform more targeted and meaningful screen use recommendations.

### Childhood obesity: highlights of AMA expert committee recommendations [^111pxVTa]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Childhood obesity is an increasingly serious problem; 13.9 percent of children two to five years of age, 18.8 percent of children six to 11 years of age, and 17.4 percent of adolescents 12 to 19 years of age in America are obese. Practical strategies that primary care physicians can use to tackle the problem are scarce. The American Medical Association recently convened an expert panel to address this need. Evidence about how best to manage and prevent obesity was reviewed and incorporated into a series of reports. The Expert Committee on the Assessment, Prevention, and Treatment of Child and Adolescent Overweight and Obesity recommends addressing the issue of weight with all children at least once a year. Family physicians are urged to assess key dietary habits (e.g., consumption of sweetened beverages), physical activity habits, readiness to change lifestyle habits, and family history of obesity and obesity-related illnesses. Laboratory testing recommendations depend on the degree of obesity and associated illnesses. For children with a body mass index between the 85th and 94th percentiles but who have no obesity-related illnesses, a fasting lipid profile should be done. Those with the same body mass index and obesity-related illnesses should also have tests for alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and fasting blood glucose levels. Measurement of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels should be added in children with a body mass index above the 95th percentile. A four-stage approach to treatment of childhood obesity is recommended. Many of these recommendations can be carried out by family physicians for treatment and prevention. These include advising families to limit consumption of sweetened beverages and fast food, limit screen time, engage in physical activity for at least 60 minutes per day, and encourage family meals on most, and preferably all, days of the week.

### Associations of screen time, sedentary time and physical activity with sleep in under 5s: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ZhUFd]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Investigated exposures were: 1) daily and evening screen time including parent report of child time spent on TV, tablet, phone, playing computer games, using the internet; 2) accelerometry measured physical activity including total sedentary behavior, light physical activity and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; 3) parent reported floor based play, organized sport and outdoor play. Total sedentary behavior and screen time were treated as two different exposures to provide more detailed evidence about whether screen time or all sedentary behaviors influence sleep.

For longitudinal studies, all time points up to age five were included. The latest time point included was before, or as soon after, the children were five years old (> 5 y if no follow-up data on < 5 y was provided). If two or more papers reported on the same study sample, both were treated as separate studies if they reported different exposure-outcome relationships (n = 4). Several papers examined multiple exposure-outcome associations (e.g. how total screen time and TV time were associated with sleep) and reported findings for different groups (e.g. examined differences across age groups, by time of the week, or by sex). Each exposure-outcome was therefore counted as an individual association, e.g. a paper examining the association between screen time and total sleep duration, but reporting results for weekdays and weekend days separately, was counted as one study but two associations. For experimental studies, differences in outcomes between control and intervention groups over time were used to assess influence of exposures. Where possible, results from adjusted multivariable models were reported.

Reviewers who extracted the data also assessed the methodological quality of primary studies and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Risk of bias assessment was completed as part of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) of evidence quality. Six domains (selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting, and other sources of bias) specific to study design (observational or experimental) were assessed. Each domain was determined to have a low, unclear or high risk of bias.

### Prevalence and correlates of screen time in youth: an international perspective [^115J3mxj]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Screen time (including TV viewing/computer use) may be adversely associated with metabolic and mental health in children.

Purpose

To describe the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of screen time in an international sample of children aged 4–17 years.

Methods

Data from the International Children's Accelerometry Database were collected between 1997–2009 and analyzed in 2013. Participants were 11,434 children (48.9% boys; mean [SD] age at first assessment, 11.7 [3.2] years). Exposures were sex, age, weight status, maternal education, and ethnicity. The outcome was self- or proxy-reported screen time < 2 or > 2 hours/day. Analyses were conducted initially at study level and then combined using random-effects meta-analysis.

Results

Within each contributing study, at least two thirds of participants exceeded 2 hours/day of screen time. In meta-analytic models, overweight or obese children were more likely to exceed 2 hours/day of screen time than those who were non-overweight (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.33,1.88). Girls (vs boys: 0.65; 0.54, 0.78) and participants with more highly educated mothers (vs < university level: 0.53; 0.42, 0.68) were less likely to exceed 2 hours/day of screen time. Associations of age and ethnicity with screen time were inconsistent at study level and non-significant in pooled analyses.

Conclusions

Screen time in excess of public health guidelines was highly prevalent, particularly among boys, those who were overweight or obese, and those with mothers of lower educational attainment. The population-attributable risk associated with this exposure is potentially high; further efforts to understand the determinants of within- and between-country variation in these behaviors and inform the development of effective behavior change intervention programs is warranted.

### The impact of modifiable parenting factors on the screen use of children five years or younger: a systematic review [^112KriK4]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Most children under age 5 exceed recommended screen time guidelines, with lifelong implications for children's psychosocial, cognitive, socio-emotional, and physiological outcomes. Socio-ecological models point towards the important contribution of parental knowledge, modelling, practices, self-efficacy and style on child screen use. This study aimed to determine the extent to which these parenting factors influence child screen use, as well as the moderating role of screen media type (i.e. fixed vs. portable) on the relationship between parenting factors and child screen use. A systematic literature search for peer-reviewed studies published in English from 1982 to 2023 was conducted and yielded 87 eligible studies. Greater parental modelling, mealtime viewing, and the use of screens as a babysitting, mood regulation or reinforcement tool, were associated with higher child screen use. Contrastingly, higher levels of parental self-efficacy, and the implementation of screen use rules were associated with lower child screen use. Interventions targeting these parenting factors pose as a promising avenue to reduce child screen use. An authoritative parenting style was associated with lower child screen use, while authoritarian and permissive styles were associated with higher child screen use. The evidence for parental knowledge and co-viewing and, a neglectful parenting style was inconsistent or inconclusive. Finally, no observable trends or patterns in the data regarding the role of screen media type emerged. Future research should look to address issues in the measurement of child screen use to ensure comprehensive and objective assessments.

### A scoping review of physical activity and screen time guidelines for use in outside school hours care [^111jcZAX]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Rationale

Physical activity (PA) is associated with an array of health benefits across the lifespan, such as improved cardiovascular health, reduced rates of obesity, cancer and other non-communicable diseases. In children aged 5–17 years, specifically, it has been linked with improved body composition, cardiovascular and metabolic health, cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness, academic achievement and cognition, improved mental health and quality of life, emotional regulation and social behaviour. In addition, excessive recreational screen time has been associated with a wide range of physical and mental health deficits. Since around the 2000s, PA and sedentary behaviour (including recreational screen time) have been viewed as being "independent" health behaviours, with independent health impacts. However, more recently, the field has recognised that daily activities are constrained within the 24-h day, and that more time on one activity must necessarily mean less time for something else, leading to a "whole-of-day" or integrated approach. In keeping with this paradigm shift, the latest iterations of children's PA guidelines published by the World Health Organization, and various countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Finland and Croatia recommend that each day children aged 5–17 years should get at least 60 min of moderate- to- vigorous physical activity (MVPA), no more than 2 h of recreational screen time and between 9 and 11 h of sleep for children aged 5–13 years, or 8–10 h of sleep for those aged 14–17 years.

Despite these clear and achievable guidelines, the most recent PA global matrix conducted in 2018 identified that that only 40 to 46% of children between the ages of 5 and 17 years in high income countries (such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and Spain) were achieving the recommended levels of PA. Low- to middle- income countries and high income countries had similar low PA prevalence of 40–46% and 34–39% respectively. Results are similar for screen time use. The same global matrix identified that in children from high and very high income countries only 27–39% were adhering to the guideline of no more than 2 h recreational screen time use. This was consistent with earlier findings from Atkin in 2014 which found approximately two thirds of children exceeded the screen time guidelines. Given this low prevalence of sufficient PA, and high prevalence of excessive recreational screen time, further efforts are required to identify ways to help children achieve healthy daily MVPA and screen time.

### Children with autism spectrum disorder and screen time: results from a large, nationally representative US study [^113RWJho]. Academic Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypotheses that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have higher screen time than other children on a US nationally representative sample and that children with ASD are overrepresented among children who exceed the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) screen time recommendation (2 hours or less a day).

Methods

The National Survey of Children's Health 2011–2012, a nationally representative survey, asked parents to report their child's (aged 6–17 years) average daily media usage. The ASD subpopulation (n = 1393) was compared to children without ASD (non-ASD, n = 64,163). Differences were compared by design-corrected F tests. Regression models were estimated for both groups separately. Adjusted Wald tests were used to rigorously test the hypotheses.

Results

More than half of US children exceed the AAP screen time recommendation. Compared to non-ASD, children with ASD had similar amounts of total screen time (3.21 hours per day vs 3.46 hours per day; P > .05), media (TV/video) time, and computer/mobile device leisure time. Children with ASD have a milder age gradient than the general population on computer/mobile device usage. Children with ASD were proportionally represented among high users (more than 2 hours per day). Data did not support hypotheses.

Conclusions

In a large, nationally representative US sample, there was no evidence that children with ASD differ in their screen time habits from other children. Both groups have high screen time use. Caution should be exercised before assuming that children with ASD are at higher risk of exceeding AAP screen time recommendations. Efforts to promote adherence to the recommendation are needed, but they should neither target nor exclude children with ASD.

### Evaluation of problematic screen exposure in pre-schoolers using a unique tool called "seven-in-seven screen exposure questionnaire": cross-sectional study [^111Xd2wr]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) reviewed the health and developmental concerns related to media use (obesity, shorter sleep duration, behavioural problems, and cognitive, language, and social-emotional delays) for children under 5 years old, and recommended management of young children's media use in terms of time and content limits, and parent-child sharing. AAP recommendations set limits on media use in preschool-age children, such as avoiding digital media use in children younger than 18 to 24 months, choosing high-quality programming (educational, age-appropriate, and interactive), avoiding solo media use in 18- to 24-month-old children if digital media is introduced, limiting screen use to 1 h per day of high-quality programming, parent-child co-viewing for 2- to 5-year-old children, keeping mealtimes screen-free, and not using screen media for 1 h before bedtime.

In this digital age, physicians and other healthcare providers should consider asking screen exposure-related questions to parents/caregivers with young children in order to improve child health. While counselling parents/caregivers of preschool children on the recommended use of screen media, practical questionnaires may be useful. Starting from this point of view, we aimed to evaluate problematic screen media exposure in Turkish preschool children by using a unique tool called the "Seven-in-Seven Screen Exposure Questionnaire", and to investigate factors associated with problematic screen media exposure. The "Seven-Seven Screen Exposure Questionnaire" can be used as a tool to identify young children and their families with inappropriate screen use and facilitate monitoring the results of preventive intervention efforts for them.

### Managing screen use in the under-fives: recommendations for parenting intervention development [^113XrwVh]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The impact of excessive screen use on children's health and development is a public health concern and many countries have published recommendations in an effort to limit and guide the use of screen media in childhood. Current international and Australian guidelines recommend that infants and toddlers under 2 years old have no screen use at all, and that children aged 2 to 5 years have less than 1 h of screen use per day (Department of Health; World Health Organisation). Despite these recommendations, international studies report that only a minority of parents and children adhere to screen use guidelines (McArthur et al; Rideout & Robb; Roman-Vinas et al.), and the majority of Australian children under age five have more screen time than guidelines recommend (Chandra et al; Tooth et al.). Infants and toddlers under age two in Australia average 14 h of screen use per week (i.e. 2 h per day) and children aged 2 to 5 years average 26 h of screen use per week (i.e. 3–4 h per day) (Rhodes).

Early childhood is a critical time in which family health behaviours and routines are established (Hamilton et al.), and children's earliest screen use experiences are often formative for later childhood and beyond (Brown & Smolenaers; Hingle et al; Hodges et al.). For example, greater exposure to screen media in early childhood has been linked to greater screen use in later childhood (Xu et al.). Children under five years of age spend around 50% of their time engaged in sedentary behaviour (Pereira et al.), and sedentary behaviours track over time across infancy (Meredith-Jones et al.) and from childhood to adolescence (Biddle et al.), and increase as children age (Kontostoli et al; Lauricella et al.).

### Global prevalence of meeting screen time guidelines among children 5 years and younger: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jwQZ8]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Pediatric guidelines suggest that infants younger than 2 years avoid screen time altogether, while children aged 2 to 5 years receive no more than 1 hour per day. Although these guidelines have been adopted around the world, substantial variability exists in adherence to the guidelines, and precise estimates are needed to inform public health and policy initiatives.

Objective

To derive the pooled prevalence via meta-analytic methods of children younger than 2 years and children aged 2 to 5 years who are meeting guidelines about screen time.

Data Sources

Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase up to March 2020.

Study Selection

Studies were included if participants were 5 years and younger and the prevalence of meeting (or exceeding) screen time guidelines was reported.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data extraction followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Two independent reviewers extracted all relevant data. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to derive the mean prevalence rates.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prevalence of meeting screen time guidelines.

Results

From 63 studies, 95 nonoverlapping samples with a total of 89 163 participants were included. For children younger than 2 years, the pooled prevalence of meeting the screen time guideline (0 h/d) was 24.7% (95% CI, 19.0%-31.5%). Moderator analyses revealed that prevalence of meeting screen time guidelines varied as a function of year of data collection (increased over time), measurement method (higher when questionnaires compared with interview), and type of device use (higher when a combination of screen use activities compared with television/movies only). For children aged 2 to 5 years, the mean prevalence of meeting the screen time guideline (1 h/d) was 35.6% (95% CI, 30.6%-40.9%). Moderator analyses revealed that the prevalence of meeting screen time guidelines varied as a function of type of device use (higher when screen time was television/movies only compared with a combination of screen use activities).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that only a minority of children 5 years and younger are meeting screen time guidelines. This highlights the need to provide support and resources to families to best fit evidence-based recommendations into their lives.

### Preschoolers' physical activity, screen time, and compliance with recommendations [^115FLS91]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Little evidence exists about the prevalence of adequate levels of physical activity and of appropriate screen-based entertainment in preschool children. Previous studies have generally relied on small samples. This study investigates how much time preschool children spend being physically active and engaged in screen-based entertainment. The study also reports compliance with the recently released Australian recommendations for physical activity (≥ 3 h·d(-1)) and screen entertainment (≤ 1 h·d(-1)) and the National Association for Sport and Physical Education physical activity guidelines (≥ 2 h·d(-1)) and American Academy of Pediatrics screen-based entertainment recommendations (≤ 2 h·d(-1)) in a large sample of preschool children.

Methods

Participants were 1004 Melbourne preschool children (mean age = 4.5 yr, range = 3–5 yr) and their families in the Healthy Active Preschool Years study. Physical activity data were collected by accelerometry during an 8-d period. Parents reported their child's television/video/DVD viewing, computer/Internet, and electronic game use during a typical week. A total of 703 (70%) had sufficient accelerometry data, and 935 children (93%) had useable data on time spent in screen-based entertainment.

Results

Children spent 16% (approximately 127 min·d(-1)) of their time being physically active. Boys and younger children were more active than were girls and older children, respectively. Children spent an average of 113 min·d(-1) in screen-based entertainment. Virtually no children (< 1%) met both the Australian recommendations and 32% met both the National Association for Sport and Physical Education and American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations.

Conclusions

The majority of young children are not participating in adequate amounts of physical activity and in excessive amounts of screen-based entertainment. It is likely that physical activity may decline and that screen-based entertainment may increase with age. Compliance with recommendations may be further reduced. Strategies to promote physical activity and reduce screen-based entertainment in young children are required.

### Pooled analysis of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep among children from 33 countries [^1177H4xv]. JAMA Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The prevalence estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep (collectively known as movement behaviors) in 3- and 4-year-old children worldwide remains uncertain.

Objective

To report the proportion of 3- and 4-year-old children who met the World Health Organization guidelines for physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep across 33 countries.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Pooled analysis of data from 14 cross-sectional studies (July 2008 to September 2022) identified through systematic reviews and personal networks. Thirty-three countries of varying income levels across 6 geographical regions. Each study site needed to have at least 40 children aged 3.0 to 4.9 years with valid accelerometry and parent-/caregiver-reported screen time and sleep duration data. Data were analyzed from October 2022 to February 2023.

Exposures

Time spent in physical activity was assessed by reanalyzing accelerometry data using a harmonized data-processing protocol. Screen time and sleep duration were proxy reported by parents or caregivers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The proportion of children who met the World Health Organization guidelines for physical activity (≥ 180 min/d of total physical activity and ≥ 60 min/d of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity), screen time (≤ 1 h/d), and sleep duration (10–13 h/d) was estimated across countries and by World Bank income group and geographical region using meta-analysis.

Results

Of the 7017 children (mean [SD] age, 4.1 [0.5] years; 3585 [51.1%] boys and 3432 [48.9%] girls) in this pooled analysis, 14.3% (95% CI, 9.7–20.7) met the overall guidelines for physical activity, screen time, and sleep duration. There was no clear pattern according to income group: the proportion meeting the guidelines was 16.6% (95% CI, 10.4–25.3) in low- and lower-middle-income countries, 11.9% (95% CI, 5.9–22.5) in upper-middle-income countries, and 14.4% (95% CI, 9.6–21.1) in high-income countries. The region with the highest proportion meeting the guidelines was Africa (23.9%; 95% CI, 11.6–43.0), while the lowest proportion was in North and South America (7.7%; 95% CI, 3.6–15.8).

Conclusions and Relevance

Most 3- and 4-year-old children in this pooled analysis did not meet the current World Health Organization guidelines for physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep. Priority must be given to understanding factors that influence these behaviors in this age group and to implementing contextually appropriate programs and policies proven to be effective in promoting healthy levels of movement behaviors.

### Outdoor play as a mitigating factor in the association between screen time for young children and neurodevelopmental outcomes [^114CqtRu]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Screen time refers to the amount of time spent watching or using screen devices, such as televisions, video game systems, tablets, and smartphones. The inverse association of screen time with children's neurodevelopmental well-being has been investigated, with a recent meta-analysis revealing that 75% of children younger than 2 years use them. These young children are particularly at increased risk of delayed language development, inattention problems, emotional problems, defiant behaviors, and poorer reading and academic performance through preschool ages and childhood. This is alarming because the age of first use is becoming lower. Guidelines have been issued by health bodies for caregivers on how to avoid the use of screen devices for children younger than 18 months or to limit screen time to 1 hour daily for children younger than 2 years. However, adherence to these guidelines is low.

Findings on the association of screen time in young children with neurodevelopmental outcomes are still inconclusive. Pagani et alreported that screen time at ages 6 months and 1 year was moderately associated with cognitive dysfunction in school at age 10 years. However, another study found no association between screen time at ages 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years and cognitive skills at age 3 years. One issue is that neurodevelopmental domains are different between studies. Some focused on developmental milestones, language skills, or socioemotional problems, while recent studies have suggested that screen time is associated with developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Further, the directionality of the association between high screen time and suboptimal neurodevelopment has been questioned, although recent studies support directionality of the association.

### Managing screen use in the under-fives: recommendations for parenting intervention development [^111FHuQ4]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023). Medium credibility.

The impact of excessive screen use on children's health and development is a public health concern and many countries have published recommendations to limit and guide the use of screen media in childhood. Despite this, international studies report that the majority of parents and children do not adhere to screen use recommendations. Existing research aiming to understand children' screen use has largely focused on older children, and on demographic and structural aspects of the child's environment. Parents play a central role in determining young children's screen use and identify numerous barriers to developing healthy screen use practices with their children. However, no clear models exist that incorporate key parenting factors in understanding children's screen use, which presents an impediment to intervention development. Likewise, while some evidence exists for interventions to improve children's screen use behaviours, most are focused on older children and parental involvement has generally been limited. In this paper, we overview key factors associated with screen use in young children (< 5 years) and summarise the existing evidence base for interventions designed to support healthy screen use. This paper proposes a conceptual model linking aspects of parenting and the socio-ecological environment to young children's screen use. Our proposed model could be used to design longitudinal studies of screen use predictors and outcomes, and inform intervention development. Finally, the paper provides key recommendations for future research, intervention development and testing.

### Risk factors and discrimination model for screen exposure among children under 3 years: findings from fujian province in China [^1151xXJC]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The rise of digital technology has significantly increased the usage of electronic and interactive media in our daily lives. As smartphones and tablets become more prevalent, younger generations are growing up in a screen-saturated environment, resulting in substantial increases in screen time for both parents and children. This trend is especially pronounced among children under 5, whose screen time has nearly doubled over the past two decades and is now affecting even younger age groups. A meta-analysis of 63 studies, encompassing 95 non-overlapping samples and 89,163 participants, found that compliance with screen time guidelines was 24.7% among children under 2 years old. For children aged 2 to 5 years, the mean prevalence of adherence to screen time guidelines was 35.6%. The issue of screen exposure has become increasingly prominent in the lives of children and youth worldwide.

Previous research has extensively documented the negative impacts of screen exposure on the health of children and teenagers. These negative effects are especially pronounced among younger children, particularly those aged 0–3 years, who are at a crucial stage of brain development that profoundly impacts their long-term physical and mental well-being. Infants and young children exposed to excessive screen time are at risk of experiencing developmental setbacks, including obesity, sleep disturbances, visual impairment, delayed language development, poor concentration, and difficulties with emotional regulation. Moreover, screen exposure habits established during infancy and toddlerhood can persist into school age and adulthood, potentially impacting lifestyle choices and long-term health.

Due to the critical stage of physical and mental development characterized by heightened curiosity and adaptability, infants and toddlers benefit from limited screen exposure to support optimal cognitive and intellectual growth. In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) established screen time guidelines, recommending that pediatricians advise parents to avoid TV viewing for children younger than 2 years. In 2001, the AAP expanded its recommendations to include a limit of no more than 1 to 2 h per day of screen time for children aged 2 to 5 years. In 2016, the guidelines were revised to advise avoiding screen time for children younger than 2 years and limiting screen use to 1 h per day for children aged 2 to 5 years. Pediatric societies worldwide, such as the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines and the Australian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines, as well as the World Health Organization, have adopted similar recommendations urging parents to limit their children's screen time.

### Screen time and its correlates among children aged 3–10 years during COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal: a community-based cross-sectional study [^115vF96v]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The present study explored the burden of higher screen time than allowable for schoolchildren aged 3–10 years. These results suggest that the average daily screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic was higher (2.8 hours) than allowable. This is almost like a 14-country study. Most studies assessed the screen time during the lockdown when children were confined to their homes; in contrast, there was no restriction in Nepal during our data collection. As expected, children used to have more screen time when they were restricted. Children in Spain used about 3.9–4.7 hours a day of screen time during confinement due to COVID-19; this was more than double the average screen time used by children before the pandemic. The studies done in other countries revealed that the increase in screen time has increments varying from 55 min to 2.9 hours. In Chile, during this pandemic, the average screen time of children aged 1–5 years was 3.0 hours per day, increasing by 174 min per day compared with before the pandemic. The present study found that one in two children aged 3–10 years had more screen time daily than the limit recommended. In contrast, only 31% of schoolchildren below 13 years in China had higher screen time before the COVID-19 pandemic. In another study done before the pandemic, 57% of extremely preterm children and 55.3% of healthy preschool children had high screen time, and 266 (64%) had a television/computer in their bedroom. Among the schoolchildren aged 3–13 years in China, 77% engaged in prolonged screen time. Neighbouring India has few studies on screen time; 84%–89.4% of children aged 2–5 years had screen time of more than 1 hour a day.

### Improving physical activity and screen time in Australian outside school hours care: study protocol [^117CjjwN]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Children's lifestyle behaviours, including their daily physical activity and screen time behaviour, impact their physical health, psychosocial well-being, and academic performance. In Australia, evidence shows that only a minority (15–40%) of children meet the physical activity guideline of 60 minutes per day at moderate-to-vigorous intensity, and only about one-third (32%) adhere to the screen time guideline of less than 2 hours per day, underscoring the need for novel strategies to address these behavioural patterns. Particularly, the need for scalable, low-cost cost, and easily implementable solutions that are contextually appropriate for the environments where children spend their time is paramount.

Substantial efforts have focussed on designing interventions targeting children's physical activity and screen time in school.and family.contexts. Relatively less attention has been paid to childcare settings, particularly those serving elementary school-aged children (i.e. children aged approximately 5–12 years). Around the globe, millions of children attend formal childcare services before or after school to fit their parents' work schedules, engage in enrichment activities, foster social interactions, and receive homework support. – In the United States, such services are typically known as "After-School Programs", while in Australia, they are referred to as Outside School Hours Care (OSHC). Approximately 10% of Australian school children between the ages of 5 and 12 participate in OSHC every week. The duration of their stay at OSHC is considerable, with before-school care sessions lasting up to approximately 2 hours, after-school care approximately 3.5 hours, and vacation care extending to approximately 11 hours per day. Consequently, the types of activities facilitated in OSHC have an impact on whether children meet daily physical activity and screen time guidelines.

### The impact of screen exposure on attention abilities in young children: a systematic review [^115ctf39]. Pediatric Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The neurocognitive consequences of exposure to screens in school-aged children have been the subject of multiple studies. However, the relationship between screen exposure and neurocognitive development, especially attentional functions, remains unclear in preschool children. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the immediate and long-term impact of screen exposure on attentional functions in preschoolers.

Methods

Three electronic databases (PubMed, COCHRANE, and SCOPUS) were searched for studies published between January 1, 2000, and November 30, 2020. Two reviewers independently selected studies. Inclusion criteria were observational studies, inclusion of children aged less than seven years with no neurodevelopmental disorders, evaluation of screen time, and evaluation of attentional functions. Data extracted including participants' ages, number of participants, screen exposure time, attention assessment tool, and confounding factors. Study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

Results

Five cross-sectional studies were included: all reported significant, positive associations between high levels of screen exposure and attention difficulties. Ten longitudinal studies were included: six found a significant impact of earlier screen exposure on subsequent attentional function and four found no relationship. Eight of the studies included evaluated the direction of the relationship between screen exposure and attentional difficulties: seven suggested the relationship is bidirectional.

Conclusions

These findings support current guidelines to limit screen time in preschoolers to prevent the development of attention difficulties.

### Analysis of parental beliefs and practices leading to excessive screen time in early childhood [^116DhpXn]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Today's children are growing up in a world where the pervasive presence of technology shapes nearly every aspect of their daily lives. Since the 1970s, children's engagement with screens has grown substantially, with many now being exposed to screens as early as 4 months of age, compared with 4 years previously. Parents today view screen time (ST) not only as an integral part of their children's daily lives but also as an essential necessity in the modern world. Age-appropriate and content-rich educational television programmes play crucial roles in enhancing young children's knowledge, shaping their attitudes, expanding their language skills and promoting their overall psychosocial well-being. However, studies have shown that most children exceed the recommended daily ST limit. Excessive ST can significantly hinder children's development, adversely affecting their physical health, cognitive abilities, social skills and emotional well-being, leading to long-term consequences for their overall growth and quality of life. Research shows that parental perceptions and practices significantly influence children's ST, with factors such as parents' own screen usage, household device count, education, occupation, socioeconomic status and marital status contributing to excessive ST in children. As technology and ST behaviours evolve, it is crucial to examine parental beliefs and attitudes influencing screen engagement in young children.

Organisations such as the WHO, American Academy of Paediatrics and Indian Academy of Paediatrics recommend limiting ST to 1 hour per day for children aged 2–5 years, stressing the importance of parental coviewing and high-quality educational content. Similarly, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry advised limiting ST to 1 hour per day on weekdays and no more than 3 hours on weekends for children in this age group. A systematic review on the global prevalence of meeting the ST guidelines in children under 5 years of age revealed that only one in four children under 2 years of age and one in three children aged 2 to 5 years met the ST guidelines. Research indicates that while parents with good knowledge and a positive attitude towards ST may recognise its importance, they often struggle to implement it in practice. Unfortunately, most children exceed this limit on both weekdays and weekends, with the excess being more pronounced on weekends. Additionally, some parents take pride in their children's technological proficiency and choose not to restrict ST, resulting in a mixed attitude towards ST among parents. While many parents are aware of the potential negative effects of excessive ST, they often lack knowledge about ST guidelines or the optimal duration for children's screen use.

### U.S. children meeting physical activity, screen time, and sleep guidelines [^114RzjEA]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Physical inactivity, high screen time, and short sleep are targets of public health initiatives for children. However, few data exist on how many U.S. children meet guidelines for these behaviors-data vital to inform which needs greater targeting. This study describes national prevalence estimates of U.S. children who meet physical activity, screen time, and sleep guidelines alone or in combination across each childhood year.

Methods

This analysis (completed in 2019) used cross-sectional data from the 2016–2017 National Survey of Children's Health, a nationally representative sample of U.S. children. Child physical activity (days per week with ≥ 60 minutes), recreational screen time (hours per day of TV viewing and electronic device use), and sleep duration (hours per day) were assessed through parental report. Guidelines recommend ≥ 60 minutes per day of physical activity, ≤ 2 hours per day of screen time, and 9–12 hours per day of sleep for individuals aged 6–12 years (8–10 hours for those aged 13–17 years).

Results

Only 8.8% (95% CI = 8.2%, 9.5%) of U.S. children meet all the 3 guidelines combined. Majority of children/adolescents attain the sleep guideline (86.0%, 95% CI = 85.2%, 86.7%), but a lower proportion meet physical activity (23.0%, 95% CI = 22.1%, 23.9%) or screen time (32.9%, 95% CI = 31.9%, 33.8%) guidelines. A substantial age effect was identified, with prevalence of meeting each distinct guideline and all the 3 declining with age (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Few U.S. children meet all the 3 movement guidelines, with prevalence rates of children meeting guidelines declining with age. Although many meet sleep guidelines, few meet physical activity or screen time guidelines. Initiatives targeting physical activity and screen time, especially for adolescents, should be pursued.

### Associations of screen time, sedentary time and physical activity with sleep in under 5s: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111HZB84]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Study screening, data extraction and quality assessment

Identified titles and abstracts were screened for relevance (KH, GK) and included titles were separated by exposure type (sedentary time, physical activity or screen time; KH). Full texts of identified articles were retrieved and read in full to assess eligibility for inclusion (physical activity: KH, RK; sedentary behaviors: XJ, AM). Reviewers independently extracted and cross-checked relevant data using a pre-piloted data extraction form (physical activity: AM, KH; sedentary behaviors: AH, CH, XJ). Data were extracted per age group; infants (0 to < 1 y), toddlers (1 to < 3 y), preschoolers (3 to < 5 y) and for each exposure-outcome association. The split between age groups was chosen for two reasons. First, major developmental differences exist during the early years in both physical and cognitive development. Therefore, we hypothesize that the investigated associations may be different for each of these age groups. Second, the chosen split in age groups is consistent with the international 24-h movement guidelines.

### Influence of limit-setting and participation in physical activity on youth screen time [^114xd3Xv]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the associations of demographics, rules associated with television-viewing, and physical activity with daily screen time (including television, non-school-related computer use, and video games) in children and adolescents.

Methods

We analyzed data from a telephone survey of 7415 youth aged 9 to 15 years from the Youth Media Campaign Longitudinal Survey. We used logistic regression models to calculate odds of exceeding recommended screen-time limits (> 120 minutes/day) according to demographics, rules, and physical activity.

Results

Odds that children would exceed recommended screen-time limits were positively associated with age and black race/ethnicity and negatively associated with income level. Children and adolescents who reported that they really agreed that their parents had rules about time spent watching television and playing video games were less likely to exceed recommended limits than those who strongly disagreed that their parents had rules. Similarly, when parents reported always or very often having limits on television watching (versus rarely or never) and when parents correctly identified the recommended limits, children were less likely to exceed recommended limits. Children whose parents reported consistent limits and who themselves reported consistent rules about time spent watching television had the lowest prevalence of exceeding recommended limits. Odds that children would exceed recommended limits decreased as physical activity in the previous week increased.

Conclusions

Parental rules regarding screen time and participation in physical activity play a role in the amount of screen time among children and adolescents. Programs that encourage limit-setting by parents and promote physical activity may reduce screen time among youth.

### Electronic screen device usage and screen time among preschool-attending children in a suburban area of Sri Lanka [^114ahL9N]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive use of screen devices in children is associated with several health hazards. These include a negative impact on language development, cognition, social interactions, sleep, learning, behaviour and non-communicable diseases. Several guidelines and recommendations were developed in recent years to set limits for screen device use by children. The World Health Organisation recommends that children of 3–4 years limit screen time to less than 60 min per day. The most recent guideline issued in 2016 by the American Academy of Paediatricians also recommends a maximum of one hour of screen time per day in children aged between 2–5 years. A number of recent studies done in the Americas and Europe have evaluated screen time among pre-school children in high-income countries against these guidelines. However, studies evaluating the conformity of preschool children in low- and middle-income countries to these guidelines are sparse.

Increased use of electronic screen devices has become a significant health problem in the paediatric population worldwide. Studies done in developed countries have shown a rapid increase in the rate of screen device usage among children over the past decade. Similarly, the average age of using electronic screen devices has declined steadily. Of note, the American Academy of Paediatrics stated that screen time is the most common wake time activity in many children and in some, it was longer than their sleep time.

Sri Lanka is a lower middle-income country in South Asia that has a population of 21.5 million (2021 data). Compared to other developing countries, the literacy rates of both genders are high in Sri Lanka. Due to this, the electronic device usage by the Sri Lankan population is higher than that of other countries in the region. A survey done in 2020 revealed 31.8 million mobile phone connections in Sri Lanka, which corresponds to 1.38 connections per person.

Parallel to the rise in screen media use in adults, it is expected that screen device use and related health adversities in children have also risen. Recent studies have reported associations between high screen time and migraine and behavioural problems among older children in Sri Lanka. However, the conformity to international recommendations on screen time among preschool children in Sri Lanka has not been studied. This study describes the electronic device usage and screen time and determines the factors associated with their use among preschool-attending children in a suburban population of Sri Lanka.

### Special considerations for the child with obesity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2024 [^112Dyygg]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Children with special health care needs (SHCN) — behavioral counseling, sleep, and screen time guidance notes that behavioral and environmental controls are the treatments of choice for the youngest children and that stimulus control is the first-line recommendation. For sleep, reviewing sleep patterns is critical; brief sleep hygiene counseling and bedtime routines, including an "electronics bedtime", can be beneficial, and referral to a sleep psychologist or behavioral sleep medicine clinician may be warranted. For media use, the AAP recommends no media under age 2 years, a one-hour limit at ages 2–5 years, and parent‑monitored, quality‑focused media in older children; remote access or a timer is recommended so the device turns itself off.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112YU3Sw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity — screen time and physical activity — 3.5 We recommend balancing unavoidable technology-related screen time in children and adolescents with increased opportunities for physical activity. (1|⊕⊕○○) Supporting evidence includes that a systematic analysis of 24 papers reviewing 15 studies demonstrated strong evidence for decreasing screen time and increasing physical activity to prevent obesity, another study reported that decreasing screen time decreases sedentary time, a 2-generation study associated increased BMI with ≥ 2 hours of screen time per day for both parents and offspring, and data from > 11,000 preschool children 4 to 6 years of age linked increased caloric intake from snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages to increased screen time.

### Managing screen use in the under-fives: recommendations for parenting intervention development [^115esujW]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023). Medium credibility.

The impact of excessive screen use on children's health and development is a public health concern and many countries have published recommendations to limit and guide the use of screen media in childhood. Despite this, international studies report that the majority of parents and children do not adhere to screen use recommendations. Existing research aiming to understand children' screen use has largely focused on older children, and on demographic and structural aspects of the child's environment. Parents play a central role in determining young children's screen use and identify numerous barriers to developing healthy screen use practices with their children. However, no clear models exist that incorporate key parenting factors in understanding children's screen use, which presents an impediment to intervention development. Likewise, while some evidence exists for interventions to improve children's screen use behaviours, most are focused on older children and parental involvement has generally been limited. In this paper, we overview key factors associated with screen use in young children (< 5 years) and summarise the existing evidence base for interventions designed to support healthy screen use. This paper proposes a conceptual model linking aspects of parenting and the socio-ecological environment to young children's screen use. Our proposed model could be used to design longitudinal studies of screen use predictors and outcomes, and inform intervention development. Finally, the paper provides key recommendations for future research, intervention development and testing.

### Preschoolers' total daily screen time at home and by type of child care [^114uEoY4]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess preschoolers' cumulative daily screen time, measure the contributions of the home and the child care setting to this total, and characterize children that are most at risk for excessive screen time.

Study Design

We used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, to calculate daily screen time based on reports by preschooler's parents and care providers.

Results

The sample size of 8950 represented approximately 4 million children. By preschool age, > 80% of children were in some child care. On average, children in this study were exposed to 4.1 hours of screen time daily, including 3.6 hours at home and 0.4 hours in child care. Children in centers had the lowest screen time (3.2 hours) compared with children in parental care only (4.4 hours), home-based care (5.5 hours), and Head Start (4.2 hours). Even when adjusted for relevant covariates, these differences remained significant (P < .001).

Conclusions

Preschoolers' cumulative screen time exceeds recommendations and most previous estimates. Pediatric clinicians are uniquely positioned to encourage families to discuss screen time with their children's caregivers and to advocate for high quality child care. Efforts to decrease screen time in homes and home-based child care settings are needed.

### Reducing children's television-viewing time: a qualitative study of parents and their children [^113GGhut]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children over age 2 years spend ≤ 2 hours per day with screen media, because excessive viewing has been linked to a plethora of physical, academic, and behavioral problems. The primary goal of this study was to qualitatively explore how a recommendation to limit television viewing might be received and responded to by a diverse sample of parents and their school-age children.

Methods

The study collected background data about media use, gathered a household media inventory, and conducted in-depth individual and small group interviews with 180 parents and children ages 6 to 13 years old.

Results

Most of the children reported spending approximately 3 hours per day watching television. The average home in this sample had 4 television sets; nearly two thirds had a television in the child's bedroom, and nearly half had a television set in the kitchen or dining room. Although virtually all of the parents reported having guidelines for children's television viewing, few had rules restricting the time children spend watching television. Data from this exploratory study suggest several potential barriers to implementing a 2-hour limit, including: parents' need to use television as a safe and affordable distraction, parents' own heavy television viewing patterns, the role that television plays in the family's day-to-day routine, and a belief that children should spend their weekend leisure time as they wish. Interviews revealed that for many of these families there is a lack of concern that television viewing is a problem for their child, and there remains confusion about the boundaries of the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Conclusions

Parents in this study expressed interest in taking steps toward reducing children's television time but also uncertainty about how to go about doing so. Results suggest possible strategies to reduce the amount of time children spend in front of the screen.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^112ngLeJ]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Physical activity and fitness outcome measures — Included measures comprise self-reported physical activity, preferences for physical activity and sedentary behaviors, electronic or mechanical monitoring of physical activity (e.g., via accelerometer, pedometer), minutes or percentage of time at different intensity levels of physical activity (e.g., vigorous, moderate, light, sedentary), direct observation and rating of physical activity (through in-person observation or recorded video), energy expenditure (e.g., via indirect calorimetry), cardiorespiratory fitness testing (treadmill exercise, endurance time, bicycle exercise ergometry, metabolic equivalents, distance runs/timed run, 20-meter shuttle test/Pacer, step-tests, resting heart rate), and sedentary time (e.g., screen time, TV time, computer time, video/DVD/movie time, video game time, phone time); studies measured these and other indicators of physical activity and did not limit outcomes because measurement varies widely across studies.

### Screen time and sleep among school-aged children and adolescents: a systematic literature review [^117KBvPo]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

We systematically examined and updated the scientific literature on the association between screen time (e.g., television, computers, video games, and mobile devices) and sleep outcomes among school-aged children and adolescents. We reviewed 67 studies published from 1999 to early 2014. We found that screen time is adversely associated with sleep outcomes (primarily shortened duration and delayed timing) in 90% of studies. Some of the results varied by type of screen exposure, age of participant, gender, and day of the week. While the evidence regarding the association between screen time and sleep is consistent, we discuss limitations of the current studies: 1) causal association not confirmed; 2) measurement error (of both screen time exposure and sleep measures); 3) limited data on simultaneous use of multiple screens, characteristics and content of screens used. Youth should be advised to limit or reduce screen time exposure, especially before or during bedtime hours to minimize any harmful effects of screen time on sleep and well-being. Future research should better account for the methodological limitations of the extant studies, and seek to better understand the magnitude and mechanisms of the association. These steps will help the development and implementation of policies or interventions related to screen time among youth.

### The effects of tv / video viewing hours on later ADHD symptoms: a counterfactual analysis in longitudinal population-representative data [^11463wts]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The large, representative nature of the MCS sample is advantageous with respect to estimating screen time effects on ADHD symptoms for UK children and the estimates from this sample suggested that magnitude of the effects may be quite modest. Specifically, the effect associated with watching > 3 h of TV/video daily compared with between 1 and 3 was 0.350, where the possible score range is 0 to 10. In terms of effect size, this translated into a small effect size. However, the presence of negative effects is in line with existing guidelines that recommend TV/video viewing limits for young children. Specific guidelines vary but, for example, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that children aged 3–4 years limit sedentary screen time to no more than 60 min per day (World Health Organization, 2019). As screen use remains high among this age group despite these guidelines (with the largest proportion of the current sample watching between 1 and 3 h per day), further research may be needed to help inform effective public health strategies to help parents/caregivers to sustainably reduce their children's TV/video viewing.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115uKamo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Increased screen time — observational and interventional findings: In a parent–offspring cohort assessed at ~12 y of age, both generations demonstrated a relationship between screen time and obesity at about 12.5 y of age. A systematic review of 7 prospective studies on television time and 1 study on computer time found that six studies demonstrated a positive relationship between screen time and the development of obesity. In a randomized controlled study of 70 children assessed every 6 mo during 2 y with an intervention to decrease television viewing 50% and decrease sedentary activity in the intervention group of 35, the intervention decreased sedentary activity especially in lower socioeconomic group children, and there was relationship between decreased television viewing, decreased body mass index (BMI), and decreased energy, but not increased activity.

### Analysis of parental beliefs and practices leading to excessive screen time in early childhood [^1111NmFW]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Background

Excessive screen time in young children is a growing concern in the digital age. It is important to explore parental beliefs and practices that could shape children's screen time routines.

Methods

This cross-sectional study surveyed 3624 parents of children aged 2–5 years from five northern Indian states between July and October 2024. The participants completed a validated questionnaire assessing sociodemographic factors, children's screen time duration, parental beliefs and practices related to screen time regulation (guidelines and enforcement), screen use purposes (eg, feeding, chores) and perceived impacts on child development (eg, social skills, attention, speech/language). Data analysis included χ 2 tests and multinomial logistic regression to identify associations between variables.

Results

Over 60% of the children spent 2–4hours daily on screens, with no significant associations between weekday-weekend screen time patterns and sociodemographic factors. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that the odds of excessive screen use were greater among children whose parents were unsure of whether restrictions should be set (AOR = 3.03 for 4–6hours), those whose parents did not set screen time limits (AOR = 1.64 for 4–6hours and AOR = 2.07 for > 8hours), those whose parents used screens during feeding (AOR = 1.82 for 2–4hours; AOR = 2.66 for 4–6hours, AOR = 2.79 for 4–8hours and 3.54 for > 8hours) and those whose parents did not believe that screen time hindered speech and language development (AOR = 1.77 for 2–4hours and AOR = 2.11 for 4–6hours).

Conclusion

Parental factors, including the absence of screen time limits and the cultural use of screens during mealtimes, contribute to excessive screen time. Interventions in India should focus on practical programmes that support parents in managing screen time, tailored to regional and cultural contexts.

### Children's screen time and psychosocial symptoms at 5 years of age-the role of parental factors [^113LFGMh]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Electronic media (e-media) has become a universal part of young children's daily lives. For even younger children, e-media use is very popular sedentary behavior. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends limiting the use of e-media for children aged 2–5 years to one hour per day (see also the WHO). Based on a recent study of Finnish 5-year-olds, the average daily screen time was almost two hours and among American children aged 2–4 over two–and–a–half hours, thus considerably larger amounts than the limits recommended by the AAP. However, there are many potential risks associated with excessive e-media use at a young age, such as increased internalizing as well as externalizing problems, including inattention and impulsivity. In their longitudinal study, Christakis et al. reported that hours of television viewing per day at both ages 1 and 3 years were associated with attentional problems at age 7 (OR = 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03–1.15 and OR = 1.09; CI: 1.02–1.16]). Similarly, McNeill et al. found that higher levels of program viewing at 3–5 years of age were significantly associated with increases in externalizing behaviors (β = 0.008; CI: 0.002–0.014) and total difficulties (β = 0.013; CI: 0.005–0.022) at 12 months later. Moreover, cognitive delays at preschool age have been reported among those children whose screen time was high during the early childhood years. There seems to be a growing body of research on the potential harmful effects of screen time, but it is not yet clear how factors related to family functioning contribute to the effects of screen time in young children.

### A scoping review of physical activity and screen time guidelines for use in outside school hours care [^113XPM8f]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Globally, millions of children attend Outside School Hours Care. Children's activity in this setting is critical to meeting daily physical activity recommendations. Guidelines are evidence-based statements intended to optimise practice. This study aimed to identify guidelines used in Outside School Hours Care for physical activity and screen time and summarise their content and methods of development.

Methods

Outside School Hours Care guidelines for children aged 5 to 12years were identified by systematically searching Medline, Emcare, Embase, Scopus, ERIC, Sportsdiscus, TROVE, ProQuest, UpToDate, NICE, SIGN and Google in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The search was conducted in March 2019 and results screened independently by two authors. Data were synthesized narratively.

Results

Nine guideline documents were identified from grey literature only (n = 8 USA, n = 1 Canada). The included guidelines focused predominantly on the after school care period (n = 9 vs n = 2 for the before school period). All had recommendations for physical activity, whilst 7 included screen time recommendations. There was considerable variability across the physical activity and screen time recommendations, though taken together, they recommended 30–60min of moderate- to- vigorous physical activity and less than 60min of recreational screen time per session. All guidelines were developed by expert/stakeholder panels, but none followed rigorous guideline development methods.

Conclusions

Limited published guidelines for physical activity and screen time in Outside School Hours Care exist. There is a variation in duration and intensity of physical activity recommended, whilst screen time recommendations are more consistent. Guidelines designed with rigorous tools and for other world regions are warranted.

### Associations of screen time, sedentary time and physical activity with sleep in under 5s: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114D2D6C]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Screen time is unfavorably associated with multiple sleep outcomes in infants, toddlers and preschoolers. Conversely, in toddlers and preschoolers more time spent in outdoor play, and in higher intensity physical activity, was associated with better sleep outcomes. There is a pressing need for future research to establish how contemporary screen time (e.g. tablets and e-readers) influences the 24-h equipoise of activity and sleep in young children. Public health initiatives and policies are needed to help parents and educators encourage balanced use of screen-based technologies and positive movement behaviors to promote healthy lifestyles and development in the under 5s.

Practice points

1 While global and national 24-h movement guidelines suggest that a relationship between screen exposure and sleep exists, the recommendations do not explicitly address the relationship between sleep outcomes and other movement behaviors found here. Future 24-h movement behavior guidelines should therefore consider the findings from this review, which highlight the importance of limiting screen time, especially before bedtime, and providing sufficient exposure to natural daylight, in young children.
2 In a time when electronic media use among young children is becoming the norm, it is crucial to raise public (and particularly parental) awareness about the potential harmful effects exposure to screens may have on a young child's sleep and development.
3 Public health initiatives and policies that stress the importance limiting screen time before bed and the potential benefits of active outdoor play for sleep are warranted. For example, the American Academy of Pediatrics in the USA and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in the UK recently published guidelines recommending an hour's screen curfew before bedtime in children.

### Effect of screen time on recovery from concussion: a randomized clinical trial [^114euP7i]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

There are limited data to guide screen time recommendations after concussion.

Objective

To determine whether screen time in the first 48 hours after concussion has an effect on the duration of concussive symptoms.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial was conducted in the pediatric and adult emergency departments of a tertiary medical center between June 2018 and February 2020. Participants included a convenience sample of patients aged 12 to 25 years presenting to the emergency department within 24 hours of sustaining a concussion. A total of 162 patients were approached, 22 patients met exclusion criteria, and 15 patients declined participation; 125 participants were enrolled and randomized.

Interventions

Patients were either permitted to engage in screen time (screen time permitted group) or asked to abstain from screen time (screen time abstinent group) for 48 hours after injury.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was days to resolution of symptoms, defined as a total Post-Concussive Symptom Scale (PCSS) score of 3 points or lower. Patients completed the PCSS, a 22-symptom scale that grades each symptom from 0 (not present) to 6 (severe), each day for 10 days. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression modeling were used to compare the 2 groups. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was also performed among participants who completed the PCSS each day through recovery or conclusion of the study period.

Results

Among 125 patients with concussion, the mean (SD) age was 17.0 (3.4) years; 64 participants (51.2%) were male. A total of 66 patients were randomized to the screen time permitted group, and 59 patients were randomized to the screen time abstinent group. The Cox regression model including the intervention group and the patient's self-identified sex demonstrated a significant effect of screen time (hazard ratio [HR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29–0.90), indicating that participants who engaged in screen time were less likely to recover during the study period. In total, 91 patients were included in the Wilcoxon rank sum test (47 patients from the screen time permitted group, and 44 patients from the screen time abstinent group). The screen time permitted group had a significantly longer median recovery time of 8.0 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3.0 to > 10.0 days) compared with 3.5 days (IQR, 2.0 to > 10.0 days; p = 0.03) in the screen time abstinent group. The screen time permitted group reported a median screen time of 630 minutes (IQR, 415–995 minutes) during the intervention period compared with 130 minutes (IQR, 61–275 minutes) in the screen time abstinent group.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study indicated that avoiding screen time during acute concussion recovery may shorten the duration of symptoms. A multicenter study would help to further assess the effect of screen time exposure.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^117LLaP8]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Physical activity dosing and sedentary behavior guidance for children and adolescents — intervention ranges and Expert Panel recommendations are specified. Reported physical activity interventions ranged from 20 to 60 minutes, 2–5 times/week in children ages 3–17 years, and the Expert Panel recommended at least 1 hour of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity every day of the week, with vigorous, intense physical activity on at least 3 of these days. The Expert Panel suggested that moderate-to-vigorous activity could be compared with walking briskly or jogging and that vigorous physical activity could be compared with running, playing singles tennis, or playing soccer. Reducing sedentary time is convincingly associated with a favorable CV profile, and the Expert Panel agreed with the recommendation from the American Academy of Pediatrics for limiting leisure screen time to no more than 1 to 2 hours of quality programming per day. The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines is recommended to pediatric care providers as an extensive resource on physical activity recommendations for their patients.

### Assessment of changes in child and adolescent screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11779gQq]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Importance

To limit the spread of COVID-19, numerous restrictions were imposed on youths, including school closures, isolation requirements, social distancing, and cancelation of extracurricular activities, which independently or collectively may have shifted screen time patterns.

Objective

To estimate changes in the duration, content, and context of screen time of children and adolescents by comparing estimates taken before the pandemic with those taken during the pandemic and to determine when and for whom screen time has increased the most.

Data Sources

Electronic databases were searched between January 1, 2020, and March 5, 2022, including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. A total of 2474 nonduplicate records were retrieved.

Study Selection

Study inclusion criteria were reported changes in the duration (minutes per day) of screen time before and during the pandemic; children, adolescents, and young adults (≤ 18 years); longitudinal or retrospective estimates; peer reviewed; and published in English.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

A total of 136 articles underwent full-text review. Data were analyzed from April 6, 2022, to May 5, 2022, with a random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Change in daily screen time comparing estimates taken before vs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results

The meta-analysis included 46 studies (146 effect sizes; 29 017 children; 57% male; and mean [SD] age, 9 [4.1] years) revealed that, from a baseline prepandemic value of 162 min/d (2.7 h/d), during the pandemic there was an increase in screen time of 84 min/d (1.4 h/d), representing a 52% increase. Increases were particularly marked for individuals aged 12 to 18 years (k [number of sample estimates] = 26; 110 min/d) and for device type (handheld devices [k = 20; 44 min/d] and personal computers [k = 13; 46 min/d]). Moderator analyses showed that increases were possibly larger in retrospective (k = 36; 116 min/d) vs longitudinal (k = 51; 65 min/d) studies. Mean increases were observed in samples examining both recreational screen time alone (k = 54; 84 min/d) and total daily screen time combining recreational and educational use (k = 33; 68 min/d).

Conclusions and Relevance

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to considerable disruptions in the lives and routines of children, adolescents, and families, which is likely associated with increased levels of screen time. Findings suggest that when interacting with children and caregivers, practitioners should place a critical focus on promoting healthy device habits, which can include moderating daily use; choosing age-appropriate programs; promoting device-free time, sleep, and physical activity; and encouraging children to use screens as a creative outlet or a means to meaningfully connect with others.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^114GM6Lj]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Physical activity prescriptions and sedentary behavior limits — children and adolescents report that interventions ranged from 20 to 60 minutes, 2–5 times/week in children ages 3–17 years. Extrapolating from these interventions, the Expert Panel recommended at least 1 hour of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity every day of the week, with vigorous, intense physical activity on at least 3 of these days. In working with children and families, the Expert Panel suggested that moderate-to-vigorous activity could be compared with walking briskly or jogging and that vigorous physical activity could be compared with running, playing singles tennis, or playing soccer. Reducing sedentary time is convincingly associated with a favorable CV profile, and the Expert Panel agreed with the recommendation from the American Academy of Pediatrics for limiting leisure screen time to no more than 1 to 2 hours of quality programming per day. The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines is recommended to pediatric care providers as an extensive resource and is available at http://www.health.gov/ paguidelines. Pediatric care providers represent an important source of accurate information about physical activity recommendations for children and adolescents.

### A scoping review of physical activity and screen time guidelines for use in outside school hours care [^116SWzTz]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Globally, millions of children attend Outside School Hours Care. Children's activity in this setting is critical to meeting daily physical activity recommendations. Guidelines are evidence-based statements intended to optimise practice. This study aimed to identify guidelines used in Outside School Hours Care for physical activity and screen time and summarise their content and methods of development.

Methods

Outside School Hours Care guidelines for children aged 5 to 12 years were identified by systematically searching Medline, Emcare, Embase, Scopus, ERIC, Sportsdiscus, TROVE, ProQuest, UpToDate, NICE, SIGN and Google in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The search was conducted in March 2019 and results screened independently by two authors. Data were synthesized narratively.

Results

Nine guideline documents were identified from grey literature only (n = 8 USA, n = 1 Canada). The included guidelines focused predominantly on the after school care period (n = 9 vs n = 2 for the before school period). All had recommendations for physical activity, whilst 7 included screen time recommendations. There was considerable variability across the physical activity and screen time recommendations, though taken together, they recommended 30–60 min of moderate- to- vigorous physical activity and less than 60 min of recreational screen time per session. All guidelines were developed by expert/stakeholder panels, but none followed rigorous guideline development methods.

Conclusions

Limited published guidelines for physical activity and screen time in Outside School Hours Care exist. There is a variation in duration and intensity of physical activity recommended, whilst screen time recommendations are more consistent. Guidelines designed with rigorous tools and for other world regions are warranted.

### Electronic screen device usage and screen time among preschool-attending children in a suburban area of Sri Lanka [^114aAARv]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive use of screen devices and screen time are increasing health problems in children. We aim to describe the electronic screen device usage and determine the factors associated with their use among preschool-attending children in a suburban population in Sri Lanka.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted in a suburban Medical Officer of Health area of Sri Lanka from January to March 2020. All children aged between 36–59 months attending ten randomly selected preschools were recruited. Data were collected using a parent-administered questionnaire and analysed using binary logistic regression in SPSS. The prevalence of electronic device usage, the average time spent on each device, and factors associated with individual device usage were analysed.

Results

A total of 340 children (Male-48%; mean age-50.1 ± 6.9 months) were recruited. Electronic devices were used by 96% of children. The most common devices were the television (87%) and the smartphone (63%). Of the children who used electronic devices, 60% exceeded the recommended screen time limit of one hour per day, 21% used devices for more than two hours per day, and 51% commenced using devices by two years of age. The higher education level of the father was independently associated with the use of smartphones and laptops and daily screen time of more than one hour (p < 0.05 for all). Male sex and being the only child were significantly associated with the use of smartphones, whereas maternal employment was associated with the use of laptops (p < 0.05 for all).

Conclusions

Electronic screen devices were used by 96% of preschool-attending children, and over 60% used them for more than the recommended daily upper limit of one hour. Higher paternal education, maternal employment and being the only child were significantly associated with electronic screen device use.

### QuickStats: percentage* of children and adolescents aged 5–17 years who reported being tired most days or every day, by age group and hours of screen time-national health interview survey, United States, 2020 [^115KePBM]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2020, 3.5% of children aged 5–11 years and 10.9% of adolescents aged 12–17 years reported being tired on most days or every day. Among adolescents aged 12–17, the percentage reporting being tired was higher (12.0%) for those who reported > 2 hours of screen time (in addition to that for schoolwork) per weekday than for those who reported ≤ 2 hours of screen time each day (6.5%). In children aged 5–11 years, the percentage reporting being tired did not differ by hours of screen time (3.6% for > 2 hours versus 3.5% for ≤ 2 hours). Regardless of the amount of screen time reported, adolescents aged 12–17 years were more likely to report being tired on most days or every day than were children aged 5–11 years.

### The impact of modifiable parenting factors on the screen use of children five years or younger: a systematic review [^114MRpZV]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Measurement of Child Screen Use

Following data extraction, two conceptually different measures of screen use were identified; total screen use and adherence to screen time guidelines. Though related, the measures serve different purposes. Total screen use offers an overall estimate of screen-related activities, whereas measures of guideline adherence assess screen use as a function of meeting or exceeding defined time limits. Both measures contribute to a holistic understanding of screen use, however given their conceptual differences they were considered separately. All screen use measures were assessed using parent proxy report.

Sixty-eight studies reported outcomes of total screen use. Of these, 45 studies measured an estimated average daily screen time; 13 measured total weekly screen time; five used screen use recording diaries; two considered the frequency of screen media access and one considered total background TV exposure. In addition, a single study considered the averages of amassed screen time viewing of child and general (e.g. news) TV programmes.

Nineteen studies used dichotomous outcomes of screen time guideline adherence. Of these, nine studies used guidelines equivalent to those suggested by the World Health Organisation (WHO; i.e. > 1 vs. < 1 h); eight used guidelines equivalent to those suggested by the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP; i.e. > 2 vs. < 2 h); and two dichotomised screen time as high or low according to whether children had > 4 or < 1 h(s) of screen time.

### Physical activity and screen-time viewing among elementary school-aged children in the United States from 2009 to 2010 [^112Aqprq]. JAMA Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVES To describe the percentage of children who met physical activity and screen-time recommendations and to examine demographic differences. Recommendations for school-aged children include 60 minutes of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and no more than 2 hours per day of screen-time viewing. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Data from the 2009–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a representative sample of the US population. PARTICIPANTS Analysis included 1218 children 6 to 11 years of age. MAIN EXPOSURES Age, race/ethnicity, sex, income, family structure, and obesity status. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Proxy-reported adherence to physical activity and screen-time recommendations, separately and concurrently. RESULTS Based on proxy reports, overall, 70% of children met physical activity recommendations, and 54% met screen-time viewing recommendations. Although Hispanics were less likely to meet physical activity recommendations (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.60 [95% CI, 0.38–0.95]), they were more likely to meet screen-time recommendations compared with non-Hispanic whites (aOR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.18–2.43]). Only 38% met both recommendations concurrently. Age (9–11 years vs 6–8 years: aOR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.38–0.85]) and obesity (aOR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.38–0.73]) were inversely associated with concurrent adherence to both recommendations. CONCLUSIONS Fewer than 4 in 10 children met both physical activity and screen-time recommendations concurrently. The prevalence of sedentary behavior was higher in older children. Low levels of screen-time viewing may not necessarily predict higher levels of physical activity.

### Screen time at age 1 year and communication and problem-solving developmental delay at 2 and 4 years [^116WyRo6]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Screen time is the amount of time that individuals spend watching television, playing video games, and using mobile phones, tablets, and other electronic devices. To ensure that children engage in physical activity and obtain adequate sleep for healthy growth and well-being, the World Health Organizationand the American Academy of Pediatricshave issued guidelines that recommend limiting screen time for children, including a limit of 1 hour per day for children aged 2 to 5 years. However, a recent meta-analysis reported that only a minority of children meet these guidelines. In addition, children's screen time has increased in recent years because of the rapid proliferation of digital devices and the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is essential to consider how screen time affects child development.

Previous studies have reported associations between screen time and child development outcomes. These outcomes include communication, daily living skills, socialization, gross and fine motor skills, problem-solving skills, personal and social skills, developmental screening test total scores, cognitive development, socioemotional development, language development, attention problems, behavioral problems, and developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder.

### Screen time is associated with adiposity and insulin resistance in children [^112N8MUz]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

While the present findings are of considerable potential public health interest, evidence from randomised controlled trials is needed to establish causality. Intervention studies in children showing decreased body size associated with reduced screen time are supportive of a causal effect, although causal associations between screen viewing and early T2D risk factors remain to be established. Future studies could illuminate the causal pathways by which screen time manifests itself such as diet and lack of breaks in sedentary behaviour as well as decreased physical activity. Recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) previously suggested that children should limit daily screen-time to < 2 hours, although the most recent AAP guidance did not propose a time-limit, instead suggesting that parents should place consistent limits on hours per day of media use, proposing a more pragmatic interpretation given the pervasive use of electronic devices. However, such limitations, which may be beneficial for other aspects of health, must not overlook the underlying sedentary nature of screen-related activities and their potential impact on metabolic health. Our findings suggest that reducing screen time may be beneficial in reducing T2D risk factors, in both boys and girls and in different ethnic groups from an early age. This is particularly relevant, given rising levels of T2D, the early emergence of T2D riskand recent trends suggesting that screen-time-related activities are increasing in childhoodand may pattern screen-related behaviours in later life.

### Nutrition interventions for youth with dyslipidemia: a National Lipid Association clinical perspective [^114wEqoH]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Table 10 — Dietary recommendations for treatment of children and adolescents with hypertriglyceridemia present, for moderate hypertriglyceridemia, fat at 25–30% daily caloric intake and to increase dietary sources of omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs), with fish high in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) while low in methyl-mercury recommended; cholesterol is 200 mg or less per day; and carbohydrate guidance is to decrease sugar intake by limiting foods and beverages with added sugars. Additional recommendations state that supplementation with prescription O3FAs may be beneficial for further TG-lowering, encourage 60 min moderate-to-vigorous physical activity or active play time daily for children 2 years of age and older, and limit sedentary screen time to < 2 h daily. For severe hypertriglyceridemia (familial chylomicronemia syndrome and multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome), fat is < 10–15% daily caloric intake (< 15–20 g/day), ensure adequate intake of essential fatty acids (EFA), and medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, as needed, to increase caloric intake and daily percent caloric intake from fat; carbohydrates are limited to < 60% daily caloric intake with advice to avoid foods that contain simple carbohydrates and avoid alcohol; and additional recommendations include to monitor for EFA deficiency and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency — supplement as needed, encourage 60 min moderate-to-vigorous physical activity or active play time daily for children 2 years of age and older, and limit sedentary screen time to < 2 h daily; note that recent guidelines recommend lowering dietary cholesterol, but do not provide a specific limit.

### Associations of screen time, sedentary time and physical activity with sleep in under 5s: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111d7p1L]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adequate sleep plays a critical role in children's health and development, particularly in the early years. Short sleep duration in preschool children is linked to obesity in later childhood. Furthermore, sleep problems beyond age two are associated with reduced grey matter volume at seven years, indicating a role of sleep in early brain development.

International guidelines recommend that infants (0–1 y) sleep for up to 17 h/d, while toddlers (1–3 y) and preschoolers (3–5 y) should sleep between 10 and 14 h/d. However, today's children sleep less than they did a century ago and 20–30% of parents report that their child has difficulties falling or staying asleep. The causes for this apparent epidemic of sleep problems are likely multi-factorial but lifestyle changes in an increasingly digitized world are a cause for concern.

Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and WHO have issued 24-h movement guidelines for under 5s, recommending an 'optimal day' in terms of children's sleep, physical activity and sedentary behaviors (including screen time). This 'whole day matters' approach places each behavior along a continuum, where declines in one behavior results in an increase in another. Studies in older children and adults have shown that daytime physical activity and screen time both influence sleep, but less is known about these relationships in children under 5 y of age. The early years are also a critical period in life for establishing healthy behaviors as screen time and physical activity appear to track from early into later childhood and adolescence and consequently may influence sleep later in life.

No reviews to date have synthesized and evaluated the quality of international research evidence in the under 5s. This review therefore sought to determine how screen time, sedentary time and physical activity are associated with eight sleep outcomes (i.e. total sleep duration; night awakenings; sleep onset latency; bed time; daytime napping; sleep efficiency; sleep stability; and sleep quality) in children aged 0–4 y.

Recommendations and Future Directions

Parents are their child's first teacher, and most are keen to gain knowledge during their child's early development (Baker et al.); yet existing services are not evidence based and have not been effective in changing population level screen use practices among young children or any other age group. Even when parents have accurate knowledge about lifestyle factors that contribute to the long-term health of their children, they may face barriers (such as their child's refusal or lack of cooperation) in implementing the recommended strategies with their children (Baker et al.); knowledge alone is therefore not enough to establish healthy habits. For example, parents' ability to incorporate healthy habits (e.g. appropriate quantity and quality of screen time) into their child's daily routine, manage their child's resistance to health activities (e.g. when switching off screens), place limits around their child's behaviour (e.g. screen use at bedtime), and role-model healthy behaviours (e.g. limiting screen use during mealtimes) are all important aspects which may influence parents' ability to meet child health recommendations and, ultimately, improve child health outcomes. In this section we outline some key recommendations and future directions.

While research with older children has examined the influence of social norms, social messaging and peer influences on screen use, the socio-ecological influences on the day-to-day behaviour and experiences of younger children are quite different. Thus, future research needs to replicate, extend or adapt research questions, study designs and methodologies for use with families of young children from birth to preschool age to better understand whether and what findings from studies with older children hold true in early childhood, and to identify additional factors that may be specific to the early childhood context. This should include high-quality longitudinal studies to enable identification of causal (and not just correlational) relationships to build a valid and reliable evidence base that can be used to develop targeted interventions that are tailored to the socio-ecological systems in which young children and their families operate.
