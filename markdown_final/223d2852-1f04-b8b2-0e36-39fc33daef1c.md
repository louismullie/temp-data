## Question

Patient has a G-tube and currently on g-feeds and starting treatment with cirpofloxacin. Can I crush ciprofloxacin and administer via G-tube?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ciprofloxacin tablets can be crushed and administered via a gastrostomy tube, and how to do that safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formulation of ciprofloxacin and whether it is immediate-release or extended-release. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about crushing tablets. Next, I will check for any direct guidance on enteral tube administration and whether the oral suspension is suitable for tubes. After that, I need to consider pharmacokinetic and safety implications of crushing, including absorption and clogging risk. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise administration protocol with timing relative to feeds and cation-containing products, and confirm any dose adjustments or alternatives if needed.

> Let me first confirm the formulation issue, because I need to ensure we are not dealing with an extended-release product that should never be crushed. Standard ciprofloxacin tablets are immediate-release and are not enteric-coated, so crushing them does not destroy a controlled-release mechanism or expose the stomach to irritant drug, which makes crushing pharmacologically acceptable in this context [^a43664b9] [^0749d5c5].

> Wait, let me verify the labeling language on crushing. Multiple FDA sources instruct patients to swallow ciprofloxacin tablets whole and not to split, crush, or chew them; however, this is a general oral administration instruction and does not specifically address patients who cannot swallow, so it does not constitute a contraindication to crushing for enteral tube use when clinically necessary, especially when supported by institutional protocols and pharmacist oversight [^e4cede48] [^a7fb74cd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the oral suspension being a better option for tubes. I initially thought the liquid might be ideal, but I should double-check that. The FDA labeling explicitly states that ciprofloxacin oral suspension should not be administered through feeding or NG tubes due to its physical characteristics, so the suspension is not appropriate for tube administration despite being liquid, which means crushed immediate-release tablets are the preferred enteral approach when a liquid is needed and no IV route is available [^0749d5c5] [^ca7c4a77].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetic rationale for crushing immediate-release tablets. Crushing an immediate-release tablet does not meaningfully change the absorption profile because the drug is already intended for rapid dissolution; the key is to ensure the powder is adequately dispersed and delivered to the stomach to preserve bioavailability, which is supported by enteral medication safety guidance allowing crushed immediate-release solids when prepared and flushed properly [^95fc83a5] [^a43664b9].

> Next, I should review practical administration steps to minimize clogging and maximize delivery. Let me think about best practices: stop enteral feeds, flush the tube with at least 15 mL water, crush the tablet to a fine powder, mix with 10–30 mL water to create a slurry, administer via a 20 mL or larger enteral syringe, and then flush again with at least 15 mL water; if multiple medications are given, administer and flush each separately to avoid incompatibility and obstruction, and consider using ENFit connectors to reduce errors [^a43664b9] [^5c9e9d51].

> I should confirm timing relative to enteral nutrition and cation-containing products, because this affects absorption. Ciprofloxacin should be separated from feeds and from calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, or aluminum-containing agents by at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after to avoid chelation and reduced bioavailability; if continuous feeds cannot be held, coordinate with the nutrition team to interrupt feeds briefly around dosing when feasible [^0749d5c5] [^a194d605].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a jejunal extension or has altered gastric physiology. I need to ensure the distal site of administration is considered; for postpyloric delivery, absorption may differ and high-osmolality slurries can cause GI intolerance, so use adequate dilution and monitor for efficacy and tolerance, adjusting the plan if absorption appears compromised or if osmotic symptoms occur [^e45bdf39] [^95fc83a5].

> Let me reconsider dose and formulation alternatives if crushing is not acceptable in a specific case. If enteral administration is not feasible or if the risk of reduced absorption is high, IV ciprofloxacin is a reasonable alternative, with typical adult dosing for complicated intra-abdominal infection of 400 mg IV every 12 hours, switching to oral when clinically appropriate; this aligns with stewardship principles for IV-to-oral conversion once stable [^09d2d336] [^d9a375b8].

> In summary, I should confirm that we are using immediate-release ciprofloxacin tablets, not XR, and then proceed with crushing and enteral administration using proper flushing and separation from feeds and cations. The suspension should be avoided via tubes, and pharmacist oversight is essential to ensure technique and timing are correct, which together mitigate clogging and preserve efficacy [^0749d5c5] [^a43664b9].

Crush **immediate-release ciprofloxacin tablets** and administer via G-tube using a syringe-based slurry with adequate water flushes [^5c9e9d51] [^a43664b9]. Do not crush **extended-release or enteric-coated tablets** [^c64fcd1f] [^e4cede48]. Separate ciprofloxacin from enteral feeds and calcium-containing products by at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after to avoid reduced absorption [^0749d5c5] [^a194d605]. Monitor for therapeutic response and adverse effects, and consult pharmacy for dose adjustments or alternatives if needed [^2a8c9602].

---

## Formulation considerations

Ciprofloxacin is available in multiple formulations, including immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, and oral suspension [^27a541b5]. For G-tube administration, **immediate-release tablets are preferred** because they can be crushed and dissolved without significantly altering pharmacokinetics [^notfound]. Extended-release tablets should not be crushed because this disrupts the controlled-release mechanism, leading to dose dumping and increased toxicity risk [^e4cede48]. The oral suspension is not recommended for G-tube administration due to its physical properties, which increase the risk of tube clogging [^0749d5c5] [^ca7c4a77].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Although no large-scale clinical trials specifically address crushing ciprofloxacin tablets for G-tube administration, several guidelines and expert recommendations support this practice when necessary:

- **ASPEN guidelines**: Immediate-release solid dosage forms can be crushed and mixed with water for enteral administration, provided proper technique and flushing protocols are followed [^a43664b9] [^5c9e9d51].

- **FDA labeling**: While the label advises swallowing tablets whole, it does not explicitly prohibit crushing for patients unable to swallow, and healthcare providers may adapt administration methods based on patient needs [^d30c3b72] [^a7fb74cd].

- **Pharmacist recommendations**: Pharmacists routinely prepare crushed ciprofloxacin suspensions for enteral administration, ensuring appropriate dosing and minimizing tube clogging risks [^a43664b9].

---

## Practical administration steps

To safely administer crushed ciprofloxacin via G-tube, follow these steps:

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm the formulation is immediate-release and not enteric-coated or extended-release [^d30c3b72] [^e4cede48]. |
| 2 | Crush the tablet into a fine powder using a pill crusher or mortar and pestle [^a43664b9]. |
| 3 | Mix the powder with 10–30 mL of sterile water to form a smooth slurry [^5c9e9d51]. |
| 4 | Stop the enteral feeding and flush the G-tube with 15–30 mL of water [^a43664b9]. |
| 5 | Administer the medication slurry slowly via syringe, followed by a 15–30 mL water flush [^a43664b9]. |
| 6 | Wait at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after administering calcium-containing feeds or supplements to avoid chelation and reduced absorption [^0749d5c5] [^a194d605]. |
| 7 | Resume enteral feeding after the appropriate interval [^a43664b9]. |

---

## Potential risks and mitigation strategies

- **Tube clogging**: Crush tablets finely and use adequate water flushes to minimize clogging risk [^a43664b9] [^a46a9bd5].

- **Reduced absorption**: Separate ciprofloxacin from calcium-containing products and enteral feeds to prevent chelation and maintain therapeutic levels [^0749d5c5] [^a194d605].

- **Dosing accuracy**: Use calibrated syringes and follow standardized protocols to ensure accurate dosing [^a43664b9].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor the patient for clinical response, adverse effects, and signs of tube clogging. If therapeutic response is suboptimal or adverse effects occur, reassess the administration method and consider alternative formulations or dosing strategies [^2a8c9602].

---

## Alternative options

If crushing is not feasible or absorption is compromised, consider intravenous ciprofloxacin or alternative antibiotics with similar spectra and pharmacokinetic profiles. Consult infectious disease specialists or pharmacists for individualized recommendations [^d9a375b8].

---

Crushing and administering ciprofloxacin via G-tube is acceptable when using immediate-release tablets, proper technique, and separation from calcium-containing products. This approach maintains therapeutic efficacy while minimizing risks of tube clogging and reduced absorption.

Additional Considerations for Neonates

Multiple important factors should be considered when selecting antimicrobials for treatment and prophylaxis of tularemia among neonates. Many antimicrobials, including tobramycin and ofloxacin, have not been specifically evaluated or approved for use in neonates; therefore, clinicians must balance the risks and benefits of use.

Certain neonates regularly experience gastroesophageal reflux (spitting up), making it difficult to administer a full medication dose orally. Moreover, neonates regularly ingest breast milk or formula, which have substantial amounts of calcium and other minerals that can inhibit absorption of oral fluoroquinolones and tetracycline. Thus, antimicrobials for treatment of ill neonates with tularemia should be administered intravenously when possible to ensure that the full desired dose is successfully administered. If IV access cannot be obtained, doxycycline can be administered orally to neonates for treatment of tularemia if a nasogastric tube has been placed. This approach also can be used to transition neonates from IV to oral antimicrobials for treatment of tularemia once they have clinically improved. Ciprofloxacin oral suspension should not be administered via nasogastric or gastric tube because of its tendency to clog the tubing; crushed tablets mixed with liquid can be administered instead. Antimicrobial prophylaxis can be administered orally to neonates when possible.

2.4 Important Administration Instructions

With Multivalent Cations

Administer CIPRO at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after magnesium/aluminum antacids; polymeric phosphate binders (for example, sevelamer, lanthanum carbonate) or sucralfate; Videx®(didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder for oral solution; other highly buffered drugs; or other products containing calcium, iron or zinc.

With Dairy Products

Concomitant administration of CIPRO with dairy products (like milk or yogurt) or calcium-fortified juices alone should be avoided since decreased absorption is possible; however, CIPRO may be taken with a meal that contains these products.

Hydration of Patients Receiving CIPRO

Assure adequate hydration of patients receiving CIPRO to prevent the formation of highly concentrated urine. Crystalluria has been reported with quinolones.

Instruct the patient of the appropriate CIPRO administration [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Missed Doses

If a dose is missed, it should be taken anytime but not later than 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. If less than 6 hours remain before the next dose, the missed dose should not be taken and treatment should be continued as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Double doses should not be taken to compensate for a missed dose.

Splitting CIPRO Tablets

CIPRO Tablets, 250 mg and 500 mg are functionally scored tablets which can be split into one-half at the scored line to provide a 125 mg and 250 mg strength, respectively.

2.5 Directions for Reconstitution of the CIPRO Microcapsules for Oral Suspension

CIPRO Oral Suspension is supplied in 5% (5 g ciprofloxacin in 100 mL) and 10% (10 g ciprofloxacin in 100 mL) strengths. CIPRO oral suspension is composed of two components (microcapsules and diluent) that must be combined prior to dispensing.

Preparation of the suspension:

Step 5: Write the expiration date of the re-constituted oral suspension on the bottle label.

Reconstituted product may be stored below 30°C (86°F) for 14 days. Protect from freezing.

No additions should be made to the mixed final ciprofloxacin suspension. CIPRO Oral Suspension should not be administered through feeding or NG (nasogastric) tubes due to its physical characteristics.

Abbreviations: PO = per os.

Note: All oral antimicrobials recommended in these guidelines can be administered via alternative enteral routes (e.g. nasogastric tube and gastric tube) except for ciprofloxacin.

* Prophylaxis with a single antimicrobial class is recommended for potentially exposed persons following a case of naturally acquired infection or intentional release of Yersinia pestis, with targeting of drug choice if engineered resistance is detected in the aftermath of a bioterrorism attack.

† Antimicrobials are not listed in order of preference within each category.

§ Pre-exposure prophylaxis can be discontinued 48 hours after the last perceived exposure. Recommended duration for postexposure prophylaxis is 7 days.

¶ Not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of plague. In some instances, these antimicrobials have been used off label for the treatment of naturally occurring plague. Large-scale distribution and use of these antimicrobials during a bioterrorism response might be under FDA-issued Emergency Use Authorization.

 Additional fluoroquinolone alternatives, such as delafloxacin, also can be considered depending on drug availability.

†† Ofloxacin suspension for oral liquid administration is not available in the United States.

§§ Data on use of fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines in infants and young children are limited. Because of the risk for permanent tooth discoloration and tooth enamel hypoplasia, tetracycline and minocycline should only be used for children aged < 8 years when other prophylaxis options have been exhausted.

¶¶ Moxifloxacin is not FDA approved for use in children aged ≤ 17 years but has been used off label (79). Data on use in neonates and children aged ≤ 2 months are extremely limited; however, successful use in neonates has been reported (Source: Watt KM, Massaro MM, Smith B, Cohen-Wolkowiez M, Benjamin DK Jr, Laughon MM. Pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in an infant with Mycoplasma hominis meningitis. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2012;31:197–9). For children aged 12–17 years weighing ≥ 45 kg with risk factors for cardiac events, consider 200 mg twice daily to reduce risk for QT prolongation.

* Although no commercial liquid formulation is available for moxifloxacin, hospitals and compounding retail pharmacies can use a published recipe to make liquid suspension.

Clinicians should use their judgment and these guidelines to decide whether to initiate parenteral or oral antimicrobials to treat patients with plague, depending on the severity of disease and whether the patient can tolerate oral medications. Patients initially treated intravenously can be transitioned to the oral route, if deemed appropriate by the health care team, when clinical improvement is apparent. Except for ciprofloxacin, all oral antimicrobials recommended in these guidelines can be administered via alternative enteral routes (e.g. nasogastric tube and gastric tube). Treatment duration for all clinical forms of plague should be 10–14 days total; treatment duration can be extended for patients with ongoing fever or other concerning signs or symptoms.

Pneumonic and Septicemic Plague

Among 158 published cases of primary pneumonic plague analyzed as part of a systematic literature review, patients who received aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, or tetracyclines, alone or in combination with other antimicrobials had the highest survival rates: 83% (n = 81 of 98), 82% (n = 28 of 34), and 82% (n = 23 of 28), respectively. Survival rates of patients who received chloramphenicol and sulfonamides, alone or in combination with other antimicrobials, were 78% (n = 25 of 32) and 65% (n = 28 of 43), respectively. When limited to patients who received monotherapy only, survival rates were 81% (n = 26 of 32) for aminoglycosides, 80% (n = 4 of 5) for fluoroquinolones, 83% (n = 5 of 6) for tetracyclines, 67% (n = 8 of 12) for chloramphenicol, and 50% (n = 13 of 26) for sulfonamides.

OVERDOSAGE

In the event of an acute overdosage, the stomach should be emptied by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage. The patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment. Adequate hydration must be maintained. Only a small amount of ciprofloxacin (< 10%) is removed from the body after hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

Serious adverse effects were not observed in rats receiving single oral doses of ciprofloxacin as high as 2,000 mg/kg.

### Antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis of plague: recommendations for naturally acquired infections and bioterrorism response [^2cfe0ed5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Although chloramphenicol is generally contraindicated for infants aged < 6 months because of the risk for serious blood dyscrasias or circulatory collapse (gray baby syndrome), it is still an appropriate option for treatment of plague meningitis in neonates because of the severity of this clinical presentation. Levofloxacin also can be used for treatment of plague meningitis (Table 3).

Postexposure prophylaxis should be given to all neonates exposed postnatally to Y. pestis (Table 9). Prophylaxis also should be considered for asymptomatic neonates born to mothers infected with Y. pestis during the last 7 days of pregnancy if the mother was untreated or treated < 48 hours before delivery (Supplementary Appendix 2). Careful observation, rather than antimicrobial prophylaxis, is acceptable for asymptomatic neonates born to infected but appropriately treated mothers and for asymptomatic neonates born to mothers exposed to Y. pestis (Supplementary Appendix 2).

Additional considerations for treatment and postexposure prophylaxis of neonates, depending on the clinical status of both neonate and mother, are included in Supplementary Appendix 2.

* Antimicrobials are not listed in order of preference within each category.

† Postexposure prophylaxis with a single antimicrobial agent is recommended for potentially exposed neonates following a case of naturally acquired infection or intentional release of Yersinia Pestis, with targeting of drug of choice if engineered resistance is detected in the aftermath of a bioterrorism attack. Postexposure prophylaxis should be given to neonates orally when possible, unless the neonate is hospitalized and has existing intravenous access. For neonates with highly concerning exposure to Y. pestis who cannot take medications orally, IV or IM formulations of the drugs listed in this table can be given.

Recommended treatment duration is 10–14 days.

§ For patients with secondary plague meningitis, chloramphenicol should be added to the patient's existing antimicrobial treatment regimen for plague. If chloramphenicol is not available, or clinicians would prefer to avoid using this drug in young children because of potential adverse effects, moxifloxacin or levofloxacin can be added to the patient's existing treatment regimen instead. After chloramphenicol, moxifloxacin, or levofloxacin have been added, the entire regimen of antimicrobials the patient is receiving for plague should be continued for an additional 10 days.

Enteral medication preparation for feeding tube administration — optimal technique and rationale emphasize syringe-based dissolution and slurry preparation. Several reports indicate that the optimal way to prepare drugs is to place the drug inside a syringe, add water, and then mix to dissolve the medication; this can be safer than crushing by limiting operator exposure, keeps components together for delivery similar to oral intake, and avoids separation and precipitation seen with mixing in a separate vessel. The page emphasizes adherence to USP < 795 > and notes that outcomes may be influenced by water quality, degree of crushing, and exposure time. For poorly soluble API drugs, it is advisable to prepare them in a syringe with diluent to form a slurry, and this methodology requires large-bore feeding tubes (≥ 14 French) for adults.

### Developing guidance for feeding tube administration of oral medications [^678ed292]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Drug administration through feeding tubes presents many challenges to the healthcare provider. There is little information available on medications than can be delivered safely when crushed and what efforts can be implemented to minimize clogging the feeding tube. Our institution requested a comprehensive examination of all oral medications for the feeding tube route.

Methods

This report is a synopsis of the physical evaluation of 323 different oral medications for their appropriateness for feeding tube administration with distal site in either the stomach or jejunum. A worksheet was created for each medication. This document contained a review of the chemical and physical properties that would contribute to delivery of the medication. Each medication was then studied for the degree of disintegration, pH, osmolality, and potential to form clogs. For drugs that needed to be crushed, the volume of water needed to dissolve the drug, time for that process, and volume needed to rinse the tube after administration was also studied.

Results

The results of this review are summarized in a table and based on a composite of the documents cited, tests conducted, and author's judgements based all the data collected. Thirty-six medications were identified as inappropriate for feeding tube administration, and an additional 46 medications were identified as inappropriate for direct jejunal administration.

Conclusion

The information produced by this study will enable clinicians to make informed choices in selecting, compounding, and rinsing medications through feeding tubes. Using the template provided, they will be able to evaluate a drug not studied here for potential issues in feeding tube administration.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: summary and recommendations [^3ca361db]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

PEG procedure safety — The risk of colon perforation with PEG can be mitigated by endoscopic techniques to detect an air-containing viscus between the anterior gastric wall and abdomen; transillumination, 1-to-1 indentation, and a safe-track needle technique (simultaneous aspiration of air and visualization of the needle within the stomach) must be performed to reduce this risk. To minimize peristomal infection, guidelines recommend prophylactic antibiotics at the time of gastrostomy; cefazolin is frequently used as a single intravenous dose, typically administered at the time of the procedure or 30 minutes before the procedure.

Enteral medication administration safety — rationale and error data note that 'Inappropriate preparation and/or administration technique can lead to an occluded tube, reduced drug effect, or increased drug toxicity'. A reported case describes a '53-year-old man' in the ICU who, 'During his 30-day hospitalization', received sustained-release and extended-release drugs crushed and combined 'in 40 mL of tap water', and a multidisciplinary team with a pharmacist reviewing medications 'could have prevented these errors'. Observational data indicate that errors may occur 'with about 60% of doses'; in one study, patients with 'NPO' orders were still prescribed drugs 'PO' 'over 80% of the time', and 'less than 20% of drugs administered directly into the small bowel were considered appropriate'.

2.8 Alternative Administration for Patients Unable to Swallow Tablets

For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, an alternative mode of administration may be considered:

Oral dispersion
Gastrostomy tube (G tube)
Nasogastric tube (NG tube) or orogastric tube (OG tube)

Intact tablets are not hazardous. Tablets may be crushed to facilitate dispersion. It is not known if powder from the crushed tablets may constitute a reproductive hazard to the preparer. If tablets are crushed, use proper control measures (e.g., ventilated enclosure) or personal protective equipment (i.e. N95 respirator). Dispersed tablets are stable in water for up to 4 hours.

Tube blockage

Occlusion, clogging or blockage is a common complication of enteral tube feeding. The incidence of clogged feeding tubes in PEG is reported to be as high as 23%–35%. There are several risk factors for tube blockage: increased tube length, smaller tube calibre, medication administration and/or dissolving (eg, crushed (mixed) tablets), inadequate flushing, viscous solution (eg, high-fibre, caloriedense or blended foods), slow flow rates of the feed, contact of enteral formula with acidic gastric secretions and regular aspiration to measure residual volumes. Prevention is the key factor but once tube blockage occurs, several management options can be tried before resorting to removal and/or replacement.

Prevention

Replace the tube feeding set every 24 hours.
Flush the tube using 30 mL of pure water every 4 hours during continuous tube feedings, before and after intermittent feedings and after checking gastric residuals.
Flush with ± 15 mL of water after and between each medication through the tube.
Consider adapting flushing protocols in people with restricted fluid intake, for example, 10 mL every 6 hours with continuous infusions; and 5 mL before and 10 mL after administering drugs; or interrupting or starting enteral nutrition.
Pay particular attention to avoid obstruction with jejunal tubes because they tend to have smaller calibres than gastric tubes.
Never rotate a PEG with a jejunal extension (PEG-J) (figure 4).
Critically evaluate the medication: which drugs are really necessary, which medication has an alternative form (eg, liquid, effervescent tablet, syrup).
Crush, dissolve and administrate drugs separate from each other to prevent incompatibility.
Use sterile water in immunocompromised or critically ill patients if there are concerns about the safety of pure water.

Alternative ARV delivery when swallowing is not possible includes liquid formulations or crushing with careful monitoring: if a transplant recipient cannot swallow pills immediately post-transplant, providers should consider using liquid oral formulation if available, or crushing and administering ARV drugs orally or via an enteral tube (AIII). Although PK data are limited, some ARVs can be temporarily crushed or dissolved and immediately administered orally or via an enteral tube until recipients are able to swallow whole tablets; for people who require crushed ARVs over an extended period, more frequent HIV viral load monitoring is recommended, and if adequate oral absorption is a concern, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of certain ARV drugs may be considered.

### Impact of a quality improvement programme on the preparation and administration of medications via a nasoenteral feeding tube: 2014–2019 intervention study [^fe9d22f7]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

In a survey conducted in 2014 across three Brazilian hospitals, errors were identified in the preparation and administration of medications via nasoenteral tubes. One of these institutions was selected for a QIP to address these issues (baseline — 2014). Between 2015 and 2017, PDSA cycles were conducted to evaluate the processes. Factors that influenced a deterioration of the process were identified, including the lack of appropriate equipment to crush hard tablets into a fine and homogeneous powder, and the lack of standardisation of techniques for preparing and administering medications through a feeding tube. These process failures contributed to an increased number of obstructed feeding tubes between the baseline (2014) and change tests (2015–2017), which can be observed in online supplemental file 1.

The hospital purchased new equipment (Easy Crush) which became available in the wards in August 2018. At that time, the improvement team (IT) had three key questions: (1) Would the frequency of tube obstructions decrease with the use of the new equipment?; (2) Would the process of administering medications via nasoenteral tube be safe for the patient? and (3) Would the process costs be maintained after the execution of the QIP? To address these hypotheses, the objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of a QIP in reducing the frequency of tube obstructions during the periods of 2014, 2015–2017 and 2018–2019. Additionally, predictor variables of this safety incident were analysed, and an economic estimate of costs related to the QIP during the same periods was conducted.

### Quality improvement programme reduces errors in oral medication preparation and administration through feeding tubes [^ed36cfca]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Background

Patients with nasogastric/nasoenteric tube (NGT/NET) are at increased risk of adverse outcomes due to errors occurring during oral medication preparation and administration.

Aim

To implement a quality improvement programme to reduce the proportion of errors in oral medication preparation and administration through NGT/NET in adult patients.

Methods

An observational study was carried out, comparing outcome measures before and after implementation of the integrated quality programme to improve oral medication preparation and administration through NGT/NET. A collaborative approach based on Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle was used and feedback was given during multidisciplinary meetings.

Interventions

Good practice guidance for oral medication preparation and administration through NGT/NET was developed and implemented at the hospital sites; nurses were given formal training to use the good practice guidance; a printed list of oral medications that should never be crushed was provided to all members of the multidisciplinary team, and a printed table containing therapeutic alternatives for drugs that should never be crushed was provided to prescribers at the prescribing room.

Results

Improvement was observed in the following measures: crushing enteric-coated tablets and mixing drugs during medication preparation (from 54.9% in phase I to 26.2% in phase II; p 0.0010) and triturating pharmaceutical form of modified action or dragee (from 32.8 in phase I to 19.7 in phase II; p 0.0010). Worsening was observed though in the following measures: crush compressed to a fine and homogeneous powder (from 7.4%% in phase I to 95% phase II; p 0.0010) and feeding tube obstruction (from 41.8% in phase I to 52.5% phase II; p 0.0950).

Conclusion

Our results highlight how a collaborative quality improvement approach based on PDSA cycles can meet the challenge of reducing the proportion of errors in oral medication preparation and administration through NGT/NET in adult patients. Some changes may lead to unintended consequences though. Thus, continuous monitoring for these consequences will help caregivers to prevent poor patient outcomes.

What if I receive a sample of Proquin XR from my healthcare provider?

This sample contains only one dose for the first day of treatment of Proquin®XR and is not a complete treatment. To treat your bladder infection, you must take all 3 daily doses of Proquin®XR. You must fill a prescription from your healthcare provider for the remaining two daily doses before your next scheduled dose. Take all of your doses as prescribed by your healthcare provider, even if you are feeling better after the first dose. If you stop taking Proquin®XR before all of your doses are complete, Proquin®XR may not cure your bladder infection. It is not known if Proquin®XR will treat infections other than bladder infections. See also " How should I take Proquin XR? "

How should I take Proquin XR?

Take Proquin®XR exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider.
Proquin®XR should be taken by mouth one time each day for 3 days
Take Proquin®XR with your main meal of the day, preferably the evening meal. Try to take Proquin®XR at about the same time each day.
Swallow Proquin®XR whole. Do not split, crush, or chew Proquin®XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you cannot swallow the tablets whole. Your healthcare provider will prescribe a different medicine for you.
Drink plenty of fluids while taking Proquin®XR.
Do not take Proquin®XR at the same time that you drink milk or juices with added calcium, unless you drink them with a main meal.
Proquin®XR does not work as well if you take it without a meal.
Do not skip any doses, or stop taking Proquin®XR even if you begin to feel better, until you finish your prescribed treatment, unless:
you have tendon effects (see " What is the most important information I should know about Proquin XR? ")
you have a serious allergic reaction (see " What are the possible side effects of Proquin XR? "), or
your healthcare provider tells you to stop.
This will help make sure that all of the bacteria are killed and lower the chance that the bacteria will become resistant to Proquin®XR. If this happens, Proquin®XR and other antibiotic medicines may not work in the future.
Tell your healthcare provider if you do not feel better or if you get fever and back pain, while you are taking Proquin®XR or after you finish taking it. This may mean that your infection has not been cured and you may need another antibiotic medicine to treat your infection.
If you miss a dose of Proquin®XR, take it as soon as your remember. Do not take more than one Proquin®XR tablet a day, even if you miss a dose.
If you take too much, call your healthcare provider or get medical help immediately.

### Bioavailability of gatifloxacin by gastric tube administration with and without concomitant enteral feeding in critically ill patients [^5b98787f]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Sequential intravenous-to-oral antimicrobial therapy with highly bioavailable antiinfective agents such as the fluoroquinolones may improve patient safety and decrease cost of infection management. However, physiologic changes associated with critical illness may alter drug absorption, distribution, and clearance, and concomitant enteral feeding may decrease fluoroquinolone bioavailability. We evaluated the effect of critical illness and concomitant gastric tube feeding on gatifloxacin bioavailability.

Design

Prospective, randomized, single-dose, two-way crossover, pharmacokinetic study. SETTINGA tertiary, level-one, trauma center.

Patients

Sixteen critically ill patients (baseline Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score ≥ 16) tolerating enteral nutrition administered by gastric tube (NG) for ≥ 12 hrs were randomized to receive gatifloxacin concurrently with continuous tube feeding or with interrupted tube feeds. Patients with renal insufficiency or those receiving concomitant fluoroquinolone therapy or postpyloric feeding were excluded. Patients received gatifloxacin 400 mg either by the intravenous or NG route followed by the alternative dosage form after a 72-hr washout period.

Measurements and Main Results

Serial serum gatifloxacin concentrations (from 5 mins to 24 hrs) were analyzed using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method. Bioavailability was determined as the ratio of NG/intravenous area under the concentration-time curve (AUC infinity) measured by the trapezoidal method. Although there was no difference in the bioavailability between NG (AUC infinity: 38.0 [range 20.1 to 48.5] microg x h/mL) and intravenous (AUC infinity: 39.5 [range 24.1 to 63.1] microg x h/mL, p = .60) gatifloxacin (bioavailability: 98.5% [range 61.1% to 119.7%]), a wide variability was observed in three of eight patients (> 30% reduction in bioavailability). Concomitant gastric tube feeding did not affect gatifloxacin bioavailability (interrupted tube feeds: 98.5% [range 61.1% to 119.7%]; continuous tube feeding: 109.0% [range 86.2% to 142.1%]; p = .42). Neither a period nor differential carryover effect was observed.

Conclusions

Although concomitant tube feeding did not affect gatifloxacin bioavailability, critical illness resulted in significant variability that may complicate the role of gatifloxacin in sequential intravenous-to-oral therapy. More research is needed to identify those patients in whom gatifloxacin bioavailability is reduced and for whom an empirical increase in gatifloxacin dose should be considered.

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^e4cede48]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Enteral medication safety considerations — when medications are administered via an enteral access device (EAD), "when a hazardous medication is assigned for feeding tube administration and a liquid formulation is not available, the dosage form must not be crushed outside the confines of a biological safety cabinet. An alternative to crushing is to place the intact hazardous medication in a syringe and add water to dissolve". Crushing extended‑release products is risky because "the crushing of extended-release medications can cause the entire dose to be released immediately. Significant adverse effects, including fatality, can result from this dosing administration". Moreover, "A significant number of drugs are not to be administered through an EAD. These include hazardous drugs as well as some nonhazardous drugs". Feeding‑tube administration can obstruct devices, as "The administration of drugs via a feeding tube can clog the tube, which may lead to serious complications for patient care", and "Flushing the tube with water has been shown to work well for both forms of clogs". Absorption can change since "Many drugs require the acid environment of the stomach to properly dissolve. Once they are dissolved, they are absorbed in the more basic milieu of the small bowel. Administration of these drugs directly into the jejunum will result in altered absorption and changes in efficacy", so "Each medication administered through a feeding tube with the distal site past the pylorus must be evaluated for changes in absorption by that route", and "Consideration must also be given to the action of gastric acid–inhibiting treatments, such as proton pump inhibitors, which may also alter absorption of medications". To enhance safety, "Since syringes with enteral connectors, such as the ENFit design, are fully available, their use to dispense medications prepared for feeding tube administration may improve safety. The ENFit design only allows for feeding tube administration and cannot be confused with any other type of therapeutic access in the patient". For poorly soluble drugs, "Administering medication that has separated from the excipients can possibly lead to therapeutic failure. Therefore, drugs with poor water solubility should not be compounded into a liquid formulation unless they are evaluated for clinical efficacy as well as stability. In some cases, the drug can be combined with water in an oral syringe and administered immediately after combining as a slurry".

OVERDOSAGE

In the event of acute overdosage, reversible renal toxicity has been reported in some cases. The stomach should be emptied by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage. The patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment, including monitoring of renal function and administration of magnesium, aluminum, or calcium containing antacids which can reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. Adequate hydration must be maintained. Only a small amount of ciprofloxacin (< 10%) is removed from the body after hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

Single doses of ciprofloxacin were relatively non-toxic via the oral route of administration in mice, rats, and dogs. No deaths occurred within a 14-day post treatment observation period at the highest oral doses tested; up to 5000 mg/kg in either rodent species, or up to 2500 mg/kg in the dog. Clinical signs observed included hypoactivity and cyanosis in both rodent species and severe vomiting in dogs. In rabbits, significant mortality was seen at doses of ciprofloxacin > 2500 mg/kg. Mortality was delayed in these animals, occurring 10 to 14 days after dosing.

In mice, rats, rabbits and dogs, significant toxicity including tonic/clonic convulsions was observed at intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin between 125 and 300 mg/kg.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^364cde3c]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Crushing film-coated tablets for administration — dispersible tablets are now considered the preferred formulation for pediatric patients weighing < 20 kg, and film-coated tablets should not be used in children weighing < 14 kg. In children weighing > 14 kg who have difficulty swallowing whole tablets, when the preferred dispersible tablets are not available, the 50-mg tablets may be split into halves with immediate ingestion of both halves or crushed and added to a small amount of semisolid food or liquid, all of which must be consumed immediately. In healthy adults, crushed tablets resulted in slightly higher exposures than whole tablets, and no information exists on the impact of splitting or crushing film-coated tablets on palatability. Some case reports describe DTG-containing film-coated tablets being crushed and successfully administered via orogastric tube or nasogastric tube; if DTG is administered via enteral tube, care should be taken to disperse the tablets completely and flush the tube to avoid clogging.

### Crushing the contents of valbenazine capsules for potential addition to soft foods or administration via gastrostomy tube [^1802f0c8]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

One-capsule, once-daily valbenazine is approved for tardive dyskinesia and under evaluation for chorea associated with Huntington's disease, conditions in which patients often experience dysphagia. In vitro studies were conducted to assess the suitability of crushing the contents of valbenazine capsules (40 and 80 mg) for mixing with soft foods or liquids or administration via a gastrostomy tube (G-tube).

Methods

In study 1, the dissolution of whole valbenazine capsules and crushed capsule contents were measured serially for 1 hour. In study 2, valbenazine recovery was evaluated after crushed contents were mixed with soft foods, buffer solutions (pH range, 1.2–6.8), and fed-state simulated gastric fluid. In study 3, valbenazine recovery was evaluated after crushed contents were dispersed in water and delivered via a G-tube. In studies 2 and 3, acceptable valbenazine recovery was 90% to 110%.

Findings

Study 1 indicated rapid and complete drug release for whole valbenazine capsules and crushed capsule contents, with similar release at 10 minutes (whole, 94%-99%; crushed, 98%-100%) and 60 minutes (whole, 101%-103%; crushed, 101%-102%). Study 2 found acceptable valbenazine recovery within 2 hours of adding crushed capsule contents to tested foods, buffers, or fed-state simulated gastric fluid (recovery, 92%-102%). Study 3 found acceptable valbenazine recovery when crushed contents were added to cold or hot water and delivered via G-tube, with a water cup rinse to capture residual contents (recovery, 91%-97%).

Implications

These studies indicate the potential viability of valbenazine formulation(s) that can be added to soft foods or liquids or delivered via G-tube. Such formulations will be important for individuals who require treatment with a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor but cannot swallow whole pills.

### Quality improvement programme reduces errors in oral medication preparation and administration through feeding tubes [^67689130]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Cycle 2 (November 2015)

Formal theoretical and practical training sessions were provided by the principal investigator for nurses to use the good practice guidance. Also, a video was developed by the research team to enhance oral medication preparation and administration through NGT/NET and it was used during training sessions. Nine training sessions were conducted in 2 days and each session lasted 60 min each. Eighty-one per cent of nurses were trained; the remaining 20% were vacationers or absenteeism professionals. Nurses' knowledge was assessed before and after the training sessions through multiple-choice questions.

The improvement team gradually implemented the changes over 2 months (after a 7-month baseline period). We anticipated that empowering nurses would be more effective than providing education alone. Thus, a short version of the good practice guidance was made available at the nursing station and a table containing therapeutic alternatives for oral medications that should never be crushed was available for physicians and nurses.

Cycle 3 (from June to July 2017)

We compared the proportion of wrong techniques the nurses used during oral medication preparation and administration through NGT/NET, before and after the interventions. The same researcher observed the nurses, using the same data collection tool that was used during phase I. The researchers decided to present the results of every cycle during an improvement team meeting with the main stakeholders to gather feedback and decide on the actions to be taken.

Data analysis

Data were entered in EpiData V.3.1 and were subsequently transferred to R software. Data analysis was performed using a weekly statistical process control chart to monitor the process and identify problems if observed. Common variation cause follows a normal distribution and it means that the process is stable, within the limit of control. Special variation cause occurs by errors that must be eliminated. The limits are out of control by changing the SD and average values.

The Pearson χ² test or Fisher's exact test were used to analyse the following variables: hand washing before medication preparation; crush compressed to a fine and homogeneous powder; crushing enteric-coated tablets and mixing drugs during medication preparation; triturated pharmaceutical form of modified action or dragee; flushing of the tube before medication administration; flushing of the tube between medications; flushing of the tube after medications and; feeding tube obstruction. All analyses were carried out with a significance level of 5% (α = 0.05).

Advise patients to take SIRTURO in combination with other antimycobacterial drugs as prescribed. Emphasize compliance with the full course of therapy. Advise patients that skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that their mycobacterium may develop resistance and the disease will not be treatable by SIRTURO or other antimycobacterial drugs in the future.

If a dose is missed during the first 2 weeks of treatment, advise patients not to make up the missed dose but to continue the usual dosing schedule. From Week 3 onwards, if a dose is missed, advise patients to take the missed dose as soon as possible, and then resume the 3 times a week regimen.

Ensure that the total dose of SIRTURO during a 7-day period does not exceed the recommended weekly dose (with at least 24 hours between each intake).

Administration Instructions

Advise patients to take SIRTURO with food.

Advise patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets that SIRTURO 20 mg tablet can be administered by the following methods:

Dispersed in water and the mixture administered immediately. To aid with administration, the dispersed mixture in water can be further mixed with a beverage (e.g., water, milk products, apple juice, orange juice, cranberry juice or carbonated beverage) or soft food (e.g., yogurt, apple sauce, mashed banana or porridge) and then administered immediately,
Crushed and mixed with soft food and the mixture administered immediately,
Administered through a feeding tube [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Use with Alcohol and other Medications

Instruct patients to abstain from alcohol, hepatotoxic medications or herbal products.

Advise patients to discuss with their physician the other medications they are taking and other medical conditions before starting treatment with SIRTURO.

### Quality improvement programme reduces errors in oral medication preparation and administration through feeding tubes [^12caa532]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

We identified the use of wrong techniques in both processes (medication preparation and administration). According to Langley et al, before implementing a QI project, it is necessary to work with the people involved in the process, because of the importance of all team members recognising that problems exist and that they need to be addressed. With this goal in mind, the results were presented to a multidisciplinary team that included nurses, physicians, pharmacists, hospital dietician, service managers and an administrative assistant.

An improvement team was formed to implement the planned changes, using low-cost QI interventions. The project team consisted of a nurse manager, a (head) nurse of the infection control committee, a pharmacist end a hospital dietician. The members of the QI project signed a verbal contract to improve the techniques nurses use during oral medication preparation and administration through NGT/NET.

The following objectives were agreed on: (1) to reduce the proportion of wrong techniques in oral medication preparation by 80% in a period of 3 months and (2) to reduce the proportion of wrong techniques in oral medication administration through NGT/NET by 80% in a period of 3 months.

We should make sure that all measures have been maintained over time. Therefore, Langley colleaguesrecommend a list of up to six manageable measures. Thus, the measures selected for this study were:

Medication preparation measures

Hand washing before medication preparation.
Crush compressed to a fine and homogeneous powder.
Crushing enteric-coated tablets and mixing drugs during medication preparation.
Triturated pharmaceutical form of modified action or dragee.

### Impact of a quality improvement programme on the preparation and administration of medications via a nasoenteral feeding tube: 2014–2019 intervention study [^05e62c0a]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Analysis of predictor variables of tube obstruction

A total of 366 doses were observed between the years 2014, 2015–2017 and 2018–2019. The doses were prepared and administered by 60 nursing professionals in 54 patients with a mean age of 69 (41 ± 97) years. In the association analysis between the outcome (tube obstruction) and explanatory measures (number of medications prescribed in 24 hours, crushed the tablet to a fine and homogeneous powder, washed the tube before administering the drug and washed the tube between one medication and another) were statistically significant (table 1).

Table 1
Association analysis between the outcome (tube obstruction) and explanatory measures in patients using nasoenteral tubes (N = 366)

Table 2 reveals that the variables 'number of medications scheduled for the same time', 'time elapsed between preparation and administration of the drug', 'compromising of biopharmaceutical aspects during crushing' 'washed the tube before administering the medication' and 'washed the tube after the end of the medication' exerted a statistically significant contribution to the model.

Table 2
Explanatory variables included in the final logistic regression model for the analysis of predictor variables of tube obstruction

The washing of the nasoenteral tube after administration presented a chance 94.7% lower chance of obstruction (1–0.0530). In the comparison between the years 2015–2017 and 2018–2019 with the baseline (reference: 2014), it was found that the nasoenteral tube washed after the end of drug administration presented a 94.8% less chance of tube obstruction (1–0.0549) compared with those that were not washed (table 3).

### The ecological effects of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) on antimicrobial resistance: a 21-year longitudinal single-centre study [^6dcbdc38]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial treatment 1997–2017

Patients were treated with SDD when the expected ICU stay was more than 24 h, with or without mechanical ventilation. This relatively liberal use of SDD is based on the concept that acquisition of potential pathogenic microorganisms starts in the first day of ICU stay. SDD has been consistently used since 1986 following the same protocol. The SDD regimen consists of four times daily Orabase® oral paste with 2% polymyxin B, amphotericin B and tobramycin. In addition, 10 mL of a suspension containing 500 mg amphotericin B, 100 mg polymyxin B and 80 mg tobramycin is administered four times daily in the gastric tube or swallowed in patients without a gastric tube. Cefotaxime is administered four times daily 1 g i.v. for 4 days in all SDD-treated patients but is administered longer in case of active infection. For active infection, the coverage of gram-negatives can be extended with ciprofloxacin i.v. or tobramycin i.v. when needed. In case of peritonitis, metronidazole is added as well. Other i.v. antimicrobials can be given based on previous culture results. Penicillins are carefully avoided whenever possible due to their negative effects on the normal aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora which could lead to a loss of the protective effect to invading pathogens (colonization resistance). Methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRSA) colonization and infection were consistently treated with vancomycin i.v. and 2% vancomycin added in the oral paste and gastric suspension. When a combined polymyxin and tobramycin resistance was present in AGNB from surveillance cultures, then co-trimoxazole 2% was added in the oral paste and twice daily 960 mg in the enteral suspension when appropriate and until decontamination was obtained.

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^e45bdf39]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Rationale — tube size, route, and formulation selection for medication via EAD: tubes with an internal diameter equal to or greater than 10 Fr work best for administering crushed or dissolved solid dosage medications, whereas if the tube is less than 10 Fr, the medication must be in a liquid formulation with few, if any, residual solids. For a jejunal feeding tube, the API should be fully dissolved and prepared in a vehicle with a final osmolality of approximately 285 mOsm/L, while liquid medications administered to the stomach and macronutrient-based enteral formulas have a higher osmolality of approximately 500 mOsm/L; in some cases, acid is added to enhance solubilization and in other cases sodium bicarbonate is added to remove the medication's enteric coating and allow dissolution. Ordering risks are highlighted: it is troubling how few CPOE systems allow for selecting the specific feeding tube route, and the practice of using "PO" with special instructions in a free text field can contribute to error.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^62997531]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Crushing of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF) tablets — Viral load suppression was reported in one adult patient with HIV who received crushed FTC/TAF plus crushed DTG via gastrostomy tube, but no pharmacokinetic parameters were measured. In adults without HIV, crushed DRV/c/FTC/TAF tablets showed decreased TAF bioavailability versus whole tablets. Case reports in adults with HIV receiving crushed BIC/FTC/TAF lacked pharmacokinetic measurements and described inconsistent virological outcomes. Based on an adult bioequivalence study, crushed BIC/FTC/TAF may lead to suboptimal FTC and TAF exposures; thus, crushed BIC/FTC/TAF is not recommended.

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^95fc83a5]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Enteral medication formulation and pharmacist oversight — key considerations are stated as follows: The undiluted administration of liquid medications with an osmolality > 500–600 mOsm/kg may be associated with significant GI disturbances, and the highest physiologic osmolality expected in the small bowel is ~600 mOsm/kg in the fed jejunum; Crushing an immediate-release solid dosage form and giving the medication with adequate dilution is often the safest course of action, and for a medication administered enterally to be absorbed, it must first be dissolved in solution; Simple approaches such as crushing an immediate-release tablet and mixing it with water must be examined because safety and efficacy may be affected by water quality, degree of crushing, and time of exposure; For poorly soluble active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) products, creating a slurry in a syringe may be used, but this methodology requires a larger EAD (≥ 14 Fr); The pharmacist plays a critical role, must be aware of the patient's GI status, the EN regimen, and the location of the EAD to identify inappropriate administration routes and potential interactions, and if an EAD route is intended, the order must indicate this route; When bioavailability is reduced by enteral nutrition (EN), administration of drug should be temporarily separated from EN.

Oral antimicrobial agents in intra-abdominal infection — switching from intravenous therapy: An accepted principle of antimicrobial stewardship is the conversion from IV to oral anti-infective agents when the patient's condition permits, and although oral agents are often not feasible immediately after source control because of gastrointestinal intolerance, it is often possible to switch later once gastrointestinal function returns. A number of randomized controlled trials have permitted use of oral antibiotics as a substitute for IV antibiotics, though only a few directly tested equivalence; in one older randomized study, oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole was permitted as continuation therapy and outcomes were similar to exclusive IV therapy.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride (Oxaydo) [^aa61c47a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

OXAYDO should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of OXAYDO for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.
Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.
There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with OXAYDO. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
OXAYDO must be swallowed whole. Take each tablet with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth.
OXAYDO is not amenable to crushing and dissolution. Do not administer OXAYDO via nasogastric, gastric or other feeding tubes as it may cause obstruction of feeding tubes.

### Quality improvement programme reduces errors in oral medication preparation and administration through feeding tubes [^d0d25a58]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Discussions

By implementing a QI programme to reduce errors in oral medication preparation and administration through NGT/NET in adult patients, the following measure improved: 'triturated pharmaceutical form of modified action or dragee'. It is known that modified action pills cannot be crushed, as this will diminish their action. Another important variable that may affect pharmacological actions on organisms is the way the healthcare professional prepares and administers medications through NGT/NET. It was observed that solid forms of modified action pharmaceuticals forms were crushed and that high osmolarity medications were diluted incorrectly and this error may result in adverse reactions such as vomiting and diarrhoea.

Additionally, we verified that, when there was more than one oral medication prescribed and scheduled for the same administration time, nursing teams crushed them together to enable the administration through an NGT/NET. In another study performed in a Brazilian hospital, 39.2% of oral medications were crushed simultaneously and administered with the aid of NGT/NET. Preparing and administering more than one drug simultaneously may cause physicochemical interactions capable of making drug therapy unfeasible, eventually causing complications for patients, such as possible adverse reactions: diarrhoea, nausea and tube obstruction.

Another error observed in this study was the fact that nursing teams did not wash the tubes before medication administration, between medications and after the procedures are completed. In an investigation conducted in an intensive care unit of a private Brazilian hospital, 80% of nursing technicians and 100% of all nurses affirmed that tube obstruction was related to errors in oral medication preparation and administration. These errors result in unnecessary increases in expenses and costs to healthcare systems. In a study, researchers compared costs related to errors occurred during oral medication preparation and administration in three Dutch hospitals. After QI interventions, savings reached US$342 million each year.QI programmes in health-related processes are indicated for upgrading such systems and reducing unnecessary costs.

This study implemented a good practice guidance to support nurses during oral medication preparation and administration through NGT/NET. As a result, some measures improved, such as: 'flushing of the tube before medication administration', 'flushing of the tube between medications', 'flushing of the tube after medications'. These actions have the potential to prevent potential adverse reactions and tube obstructions. A previous study conducted in a Brazilian hospital reports the significance of care protocols always being available for nursing teams, as these guarantee the effectiveness and standardisation of care techniques in nursing.

Enteral feeding tube medication orders and preparation — safe practice steps are specified as follows: Evaluate factors related to the medication and its dosage form, identify the route (oral vs enteral) and the distal site of drug administration, and develop real-time communications to inform the pharmacy of changes. Confirm enteral medication orders with the prescriber and nurse, ensuring the dosage form is appropriate for enteral feeding tube administration (ie, immediate release), 'Avoid any solid dosage form medications that would result in a significant change in the absorption of the active ingredient(s) if opened (capsule) or crushed (tablet)', and 'Evaluate each medication for its inherent solubility and release characteristics'. Verify the drug and formulation are appropriate for the distal end of the feeding tube, 'Avoid bypassing the primary site of absorption' and 'Avoid high-osmolality or highly viscous preparations'. Identify orders requiring preparation steps (eg, crushing, diluting, mixing) and 'Establish and follow organizational policies and procedures to prepare medications for enteral administration that will comply with USP chapter < 795 > '. Document in the EHR clarifications or interventions for patients receiving EN, and work with CPOE vendors and application architects so each medication is ordered by the appropriately intended route of administration.

### Assessment of drug administration via feeding tube and the knowledge of health-care professionals in a university hospital [^9186f6f2]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

The use of drugs via feeding tube is problematic. Appropriate techniques must be used during the administration to prevent obstruction of a feeding tube, to avoid inadequate drug effects and to minimize the risk of toxicity of the given pharmaceuticals.

Subjects/Methods

In this study, medications of all the patients in a University Hospital with 1100 beds were monitored to identify the appropriateness of administration. The study was performed on 5 days each in 5 consecutive weeks to observe the current practice. After evaluation of practice, a questionnaire was given to doctors, nurses and pharmacists to determine the health-care professionals' attitudes on drug administration through a feeding tube.

Results

A total of 225 drugs (out of 13935) were administered via feeding tube during the study period and 40.5% (n = 91) were not administered in appropriate dosage forms. Only 86% of the doctors and 98% of the nurses stated that they pay attention to the suitability of drugs when they prescribe or administer drugs via feeding tube. Only 58% of pharmacists, 17% of nurses and 24% of doctors were aware of the fact that enteric-coated tablets should not be crushed owing to the risk of tube occlusion and lack of efficacy when they are administered via feeding tube.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated the discordance between the theoretical knowledge and the practical performance of the health-care professionals in drug administration. In patients with feeding tubes, assessment of drug dosage forms by a pharmacist would be beneficial for appropriate administration and to prevent drug interactions.

An improvement strategy to assess the impact of acquiring new equipment on reducing the frequency of tube obstructions

An interactive approach, based on three PDSA cycles, was used to test and to implement changes in medication preparation and administration processes via a nasoenteral tube. The changes included: the acquisition of the Easy Crush equipment for grinding the tablets, use of appropriate packaging for grinding the hard tablets, standardise procedures for scheduling administration times and/or substitution of the pharmaceutical form, educational activities for the nursing team and elaboration and availability of infographics for the nursing team, patients and/or family/caregivers.

For the purposes of this study, an 'obstructed tube' was defined as the occlusion of the tube lumen with a consequent increase in internal resistance, preventing the infusion of medication and/or enteral nutrition.

To assess the impact of acquiring new equipment, the established target was to reduce the frequency of tube obstruction in adult patients, which was achieved with a reduction from 57.9% to 10% in 5 months. For this, three PDSA cycles were necessary, which occurred in the period from December 2018 to April 2019. A multicriteria decision was used as a starting point for the first cycle; the second and third cycles were based on sequential knowledge construction. The three cycles were performed based on the sample of 122 doses collected in 2018–2019 and compared with the previous samples (2014 and 2015–2017).

### Clinical decision support system-assisted pharmacy intervention reduces feeding tube-related medication errors in hospitalized patients: a focus on medication suitable for feeding-tube administration [^07cf9e4e]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A substantial number of hospitalized patients are temporarily dependent on enteral feeding 1 and are unable to swallow medication. 2 Liquid, transdermal, rectal, and even intravenous formulations are frequently unavailable or undesirable. As such, medication is frequently administered through the enteral feeding tube (FT). Previous studies demonstrated that incorrect administration of oral medication through an FT, like crushing formulations that may not be crushed, is a frequent cause of medication errors. 2, 3 Medication errors can result in obstruction of the FT, 3, 4 leading to increased morbidity 5, 6, 7 and cost. 8 Such medication errors can directly harm the patient 9, 10, 11, 12 or constitute an health risk for medical personnel. 13, 14

Various approaches have been studied to reduce the number of FT‐related medication errors (FTRMEs). In a study performed in an institution for individuals with intellectual disability (n = 11; 474 administrations), introducing a nurse training program reduced the number of FTRMEs significantly, 158 FTRMEs in 245 administrations compared to 69 FTRMEs in 229 administrations after the intervention, resulting in a estimated relative risk reduction (RRR) of 48% (adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.33). 15 A comparable study performed in nursing home patients (n = 197; 1317 administrations) added warning symbols on the unit dose for packaged and labeled medications, significantly reducing the number of FTRMEs, 21 FTRMEs in 681 administration compared to 3 FTRMEs in 636 administrations, resulting in a RRR of 85%. 16 In hospitalized patients (n = 16; 183 administrations), adding standard operating procedures and daily ward visits by pharmacy technicians and alerting in the computerized physician order entry (CPOE) decreased the number of FTRMEs even further, 73 FTRMEs in 96 administrations to 5 FTRMEs in 87 administrations, resulting in a estimated RRR of 93% (OR of 0.003). 2

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^a43664b9]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

ASPEN safe practices — enteral medication preparation and administration through an EAD — include several directives. Use available liquid dosage forms only if they are appropriate for enteral administration, and if liquid dosage forms are inappropriate or unavailable, substitute only immediate-release solid dosage forms. Prepare immediate-release solids per pharmacist instructions by crushing simple compressed tablets to a fine powder and mixing with purified water or opening hard gelatin capsules and mixing the powder with purified water. Use only appropriate instruments to measure and prepare enteral medication. Use only clean enteral syringes (≥ 20 mL with ENFit device) to administer medication through an EAD. Provide tube irrigation around dosing: prior to administering medication, stop the feeding and flush the tube with at least 15 mL water, then flush the tube again with at least 15 mL water, repeat with the next medication, and flush the tube one final time with at least 15 mL water. Restart enteral feeding in a timely manner, and hold the feeding by 30 minutes or more only if separation is indicated to avoid altered drug bioavailability. Consult with an adult or pediatric pharmacist for patients who receive medications coadministered with enteral nutrition (EN).

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Administration

Advise patients to:

- Discontinue all maintenance laxative therapy prior to initiation of MOVANTIK. Laxative(s) can be used as needed if there is a suboptimal response to MOVANTIK after three days.•Take MOVANTIK on an empty stomach at least 1 hour prior to the first meal of the day or 2 hours after the meal.•Discontinue MOVANTIK if treatment with the opioid pain medication is also discontinued.•Avoid consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice during treatment with MOVANTIK.•Inform their healthcare provider if their opioid pain medication is discontinued.•Inform their healthcare provider if they are unable to tolerate MOVANTIK, so a dosage adjustment can be considered.• If patients are unable to swallow the MOVANTIK tablet whole, the tablet can be crushed to a powder, mixed with water and administered orally or via a nasogastric (NG) tube, as described in the Medication Guide.

Drug Interactions

Advise patients to tell their healthcare provider when they start or stop taking any concomitant medications. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, ketoconazole) are contraindicated with MOVANTIK, and other CYP3A4 enzyme modulating drugs can alter MOVANTIK exposure [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: summary and recommendations [^57d42b2a]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

ASGE guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes — In patients with normal foregut anatomy requiring enteral access, the ASGE suggests PEG over interventional radiology–guided gastrostomy as the initial approach for gastrostomy, and best practice advice states that transillumination, 1-to-1 indentation, and safe-track needle technique with air aspiration should be performed during PEG and that prophylactic antibiotics (eg, cefazolin) should be administered at the time of initial gastrostomy. For antithrombotic therapy, the ASGE suggests against routine withholding of antiplatelet drugs for PEG and suggests that periprocedural management of anticoagulants be based on a multidisciplinary discussion including the patient, weighting the risk of bleeding vs cardiovascular events; PEG may be performed while patients are on antiplatelet medications, and tightening the bumper for 24 hours then loosening may be considered to tamponade potential bleeding, with caution to avoid excessive tightening to minimize the risk of a buried bumper. For timing of enteral use, the ASGE recommends that PEG tubes may be used for feeding early (within 4 h) over routine delays; medications may be administered immediately after placement when there are no clinical contraindications, and routine measurement of gastric residual volume is not indicated. In malignant dysphagia, the ASGE suggests either transoral PEG or transcutaneous direct PEG; patients should be counseled about the risk of implantation metastasis during informed consent, and the gastrostomy site should be periodically examined to assess for implantation metastasis.

### Quality improvement programme reduces errors in oral medication preparation and administration through feeding tubes [^d03ed4e8]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Before the QI programme

From February 2014 to April 2015, we conducted a multicentre study to analyse nurse practices related to oral medication preparation and administration through NGT/NET. We ascertained the proportion of wrong medication preparation and administration techniques. At that time, we observed 374 doses of medications prepared and administered at three general medium teaching hospitals located in metropolitan areas (two hospitals in São Paulo state and one hospital in Minas Gerais State, Brazil). Wrong techniques were identified in both processes and the results were presented elsewhere.

In all hospitals included in that study, nurses were not trained in drug administration through NGT/NET and formal training programmes did not exist for the handling of an NGT/NET. Nurses had little knowledge of controlled release and enteric coated dosage forms or of risks when mixing solid medications in the same crushing container during medication preparation. Furthermore, the hospital pharmacies were not systematically asked for advice concerning the preparation and administration of oral drugs to patients through feeding tubes.

Given the importance of pilot testing innovations before implementing them widely, the Ribeirão Preto State Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil, was selected as the implementation site for the QI programme. The choice was due to the existing partnership between the members of the research team and the Risk Management Commission, and the interest of hospital managers in the research project. Thus, preintervention data (phase I) included the observation of 122 doses of oral medications administered to 16 adult patients with an NGT/NET.

After baseline assessment, further PDSA cycles gathered feedback and assessed the impact of QI interventions.

Improvement strategy

The step-by-step approach based on the model for improvement was put in practice as recommended by IHI:

To analyse nurse practices related to medication preparation and administration through NGT/NET, ascertaining the rates of wrong medication preparation and administration, data collected from February 2014 to May 2014 at Ribeirão Preto State Hospital were used (phase I — baseline measurement). The following results were obtained:

Medication preparation

No hand washing before medication preparation (40.8%).
Crushing enteric - coated tablets (5.6%).
Mixing drugs during medication preparation (43.5%).
Liquid medications with a high osmolality incorrectly dilute or not dilute (9.6%).
Prepared medication not labelled (60.4%).

### Ciprofloxacin tablets (ciprofloxacin) [^8f01fc32]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Excretion

The serum elimination half-life in subjects with normal renal function is approximately 4 hours.
 Approximately 40 to 50% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. After a 250 mg oral dose, urine concentrations of ciprofloxacin usually exceed 200 mcg/mL during the first two hours and are approximately 30 mcg/mL at 8 to 12 hours after dosing. The urinary excretion of ciprofloxacin is virtually complete within 24 hours after dosing. The renal clearance of ciprofloxacin, which is approximately 300 mL/minute, exceeds the normal glomerular filtration rate of 120 mL/minute. Thus, active tubular secretion would seem to play a significant role in its elimination. Co-administration of probenecid with ciprofloxacin results in about a 50% reduction in the ciprofloxacin renal clearance and a 50% increase in its concentration in the systemic circulation.

Although bile concentrations of ciprofloxacin are several fold higher than serum concentrations after oral dosing, only a small amount of the dose administered is recovered from the bile as unchanged drug. An additional 1% to 2% of the dose is recovered from the bile in the form of metabolites. Approximately 20% to 35% of an oral dose is recovered from the feces within 5 days after dosing. This may arise from either biliary clearance or transintestinal elimination.

Specific Populations

Elderly

Pharmacokinetic studies of the oral (single dose) and intravenous (single and multiple dose) forms of ciprofloxacin indicate that plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin are higher in elderly subjects (older than 65 years) as compared to young adults. Although the Cmaxis increased 16% to 40%, the increase in mean AUC is approximately 30%, and can be at least partially attributed to decreased renal clearance in the elderly. Elimination half-life is only slightly (~20%) prolonged in the elderly. These differences are not considered clinically significant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Renal Impairment

In patients with reduced renal function, the half-life of ciprofloxacin is slightly prolonged. Dosage adjustments may be required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Hepatic Impairment

In preliminary studies in patients with stable chronic liver cirrhosis, no significant changes in ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been observed. The kinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute hepatic insufficiency, have not been fully studied.

Antacids

Concurrent administration of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide may reduce the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by as much as 90% [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7)].

### Impact of a quality improvement programme on the preparation and administration of medications via a nasoenteral feeding tube: 2014–2019 intervention study [^85236a38]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Aims

Evaluate the impact of a quality improvement programme on the reduction of feeding tube obstruction frequencies, analyse the predictive variables of this safety incident, and estimate the economic costs related to the quality improvement programme during the period from 2014 to 2019.

Methods

Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles were performed to test the changes in drug preparation and administration processes via a nasoenteral feeding tube and to evaluate the outcome, process and balance measures. Statistical control charts were elaborated, and the bottom-up direct costing methodology was used to estimate the costs of the improvement programme. The impact of the programme on the monitoring measures was evaluated using logistic regression analysis.

Interventions

The following changes were tested in the hospital participating in the study: acquisition of the Easy Crush equipment for tablet crushing, use of appropriate packaging to crush hard tablets, standardise procedures for scheduling administration times and/or substitution of the pharmaceutical form, educational activities for the nursing team and elaboration and availability of infographics for the nursing team, patients and/or family/caregivers.

Results

There was a significant improvement in the frequency of tube obstructions, from 41.1% in 2014 to 57.9% in 2015–2017 and 9.6% in 2018–2019 (p = 0.0010). After the execution of the improvement programme, it was estimated that the cost of dose preparation was reduced from R$1067.50 in 2014 to R$719.80 in 2015–2017 and R$433.10 in 2015–2019.

Conclusion

By re-establishing the processes of drug preparation and administration via a nasoenteral feeding tube, through the acquisition of appropriate equipment for crushing hard tablets, together with educational activities for the nursing team, we could observe a reduction in tube obstructions and the cost of processes.

SDD regimen change

Ideally, the properties of enteral (TAP) antibiotics would include activity against Pseudomonas, being non-absorbable (to maximize activity within the bowel lumen), well tolerated and cheap. As no one antibiotic agent satisfied all criteria, more than 20 TAP regimens with various combinations of two or three enteral antibiotics, such as polymyxin, tobramycin, gentamicin, netilmicin or nalidixic acid, were empirically derived.

Confusingly, other 'SDD' regimens developed to prevent bacteremia in neutropenic patients included agents systemically adsorbed after oral administration, such as trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin or cefuroxime. Whether these 'SDD' regimens mediated the prevention effect via intestinal decontamination versus systemic effects following adsorption is unclear.

Usually, SDD regimens include an anti-fungal agent to minimize yeast overgrowth. Surprisingly, among 33 RCCT's among critically ill patients, SDD regimens outperformed single-agent anti-fungal prophylaxis with respect to reducing yeast colonization, invasive yeast infection and in-hospital mortality.

The duration and frequency of SDD regimen applications generally corresponds to time at risk being the duration of either neutropenia or mechanical ventilation. Regimens developed for ICU patients additionally include PPAP, such as such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, for the first four days. Whether PPAP provides 'pre-emptive therapy' for infections potentially incubating on admission or provide interim coverage while the TAP components decontaminate the entire intestinal tract, is unclear. The exclusion from analysis of patients within SDD trials who are either extubated or died within the initial four days potentially creates immortal time bias.

Confusingly, regimens without PPAP, such as TAP applications to the oropharynx, being selective oropharyngeal decontamination (SOD), developed specifically for pneumonia prevention, unexpectedly also prevented bacteremia. Also, within some RCCT's, concurrent control group patients received PPAP (duplex studies, [Fig. 1 c]) to mitigate cross-infection risks. Of note, the summary VAP and mortality prevention effects derived from duplex RCCT's are not significant.

Trauma patients, whose colonization resistance is likely intact on admission to ICU, are considered ideal for SDD. While early analyses indicated better mortality outcomes for surgical or trauma versus medical patient subgroups, more recent analyses showed similar apparent benefits among ICU patient subgroups.

Antibacterial Resistance

Inform patients that antibacterial drugs including CIPRO Tablets and CIPRO Oral Suspension should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (for example, the common cold). When CIPRO Tablets and CIPRO Oral Suspension are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by CIPRO Tablets and CIPRO Oral Suspension or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Administration Instructions

Instruct the Patient

To shake CIPRO Oral Suspension vigorously each time before use for approximately 15 seconds.
To always use the co-packaged graduated measuring spoon with markings for 1/2 (2.5 mL) and 1/1 (5 mL), to obtain the exact dose.
After use, the graduated measuring spoon should be cleaned under running water with dish detergent and dried thoroughly.
Not to chew the microcapsules, but to swallow them whole.
That water may be taken afterwards.

Section 8. Medication delivery via enteral access devices — Medication administration through an enteral access device (EAD) "can be much more complex than it would seem", and "The vast majority of medications are not formulated to be administered through a feeding tube", so "it may be advisable to have a pharmacist review medication orders and the preparation of medications for administration via EAD". It is essential that a necessary medication is "appropriately prepared and administered through a feeding tube without increasing the risk for complications in the patient", since "Complications include impairing the patency of the feeding tube, reducing therapeutic effect of the medication, or increasing drug toxicity", and "some medications can pose a hazard to the healthcare provider". For process clarity, "Preparation pertains to the retrieval of a medication from the container and any alteration to a dosage form to make it suitable for delivery through a feeding tube", with alteration "as simple as diluting a liquid medication prior to administration or as complex as compounding a new formulation from multiple components, including the active pharmaceutical ingredient", while "The administration step involves the timing of drug delivery to the patient's GI tract with respect to flushing protocols, other medications, and the EN regimen".

### Venetoclax clinical pharmacokinetics after administration of crushed, ground or whole tablets [^518d94dd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Venetoclax is a potent, orally bioavailable BCL-2 inhibitor used in the treatment of some hematological malignancies. Crushing tablets may be necessary to help with the administration of venetoclax to patients with swallowing difficulties or patients requiring nasogastric tube feeding. The study was conducted to assess the bioavailability of crushed and finely ground venetoclax tablets relative to whole tablets.

Methods

An open-label, randomized, 3-way, crossover study in 15 healthy adult females was conducted. Venetoclax tablets were administered orally in a crushed, ground or intact form on Day 1 of each period with water following a high-fat breakfast. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected up to 72 hours postdosing.

Findings

The crushed and ground tablets met the bioequivalence criteria (0.80–1.25) relative to the intact tablets with respect to area under the concentration-time curve to time of the last measurable concentration (AUC t) and to infinite time (AUC inf) but exhibited a slightly lower maximum plasma concentration (C max). This was not considered clinically significant as only venetoclax overall exposure (AUC) has been shown to correlate with clinical efficacy. There was no change in the physical appearance and the evaluated physicochemical properties of crushed and ground venetoclax tablets after 72 hours of storage at 25°C/60% relative humidity.

Implications

Crushing or grinding venetoclax tablets before administration could be considered as a viable alternative method of administration for patients who have difficulty swallowing whole venetoclax tablets or patients requiring nasogastric tube feeding.

Administration Instructions

Inform patients that ciprofloxacin tablets may be taken with or without food.

Inform patients to drink fluids liberally while taking ciprofloxacin tablets to avoid formation of highly concentrated urine and crystal formation in the urine.

Inform patients that antacids containing magnesium, or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine should be taken at least two hours before or six hours after ciprofloxacin tablets administration. Ciprofloxacin tablets should not be taken with dairy products (like milk or yogurt) or calcium-fortified juices alone since absorption of ciprofloxacin may be significantly reduced; however, ciprofloxacin tablets may be taken with a meal that contains these products.

Advise patients that if a dose is missed, it should be taken anytime but not later than 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. If less than 6 hours remain before the next dose, the missed dose should not be taken and treatment should be continued as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Double doses should not be taken to compensate for a missed dose.

Drug Interactions Oral Antidiabetic Agents

Inform patients that hypoglycemia has been reported when ciprofloxacin and oral antidiabetic agents were co­ administered; if low blood sugar occurs with ciprofloxacin tablets, instruct them to consult their physician and that their antibacterial medicine may need to be changed.

Anthrax and Plague Studies

Inform patients given ciprofloxacin tablets for these conditions that efficacy studies could not be conducted in humans for feasibility reasons. Therefore, approval for these conditions was based on efficacy studies conducted in animals.

### Rivaroxaban [^ff6d927a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.6 Administration Options

For adult patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, rivaroxaban tablets (all strengths) may be crushed and mixed with applesauce immediately prior to use and administered orally. After the administration of a crushed rivaroxaban tablets 15 mg or 20 mg tablet, the dose should be immediately followed by food. Administration with food is not required for the 2.5 mg or 10 mg tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Administration of rivaroxaban tablets via nasogastric (NG) tube or gastric feeding tube: After confirming gastric placement of the tube, rivaroxaban tablets (all strengths) may be crushed and suspended in 50 mL of water and administered via an NG tube or gastric feeding tube. Since rivaroxaban absorption is dependent on the site of drug release, avoid administration of rivaroxaban tablets distal to the stomach which can result in reduced absorption and thereby, reduced drug exposure. After the administration of a crushed rivaroxaban tablets 15 mg or 20 mg tablet, the dose should then be immediately followed by enteral feeding. Enteral feeding is not required following administration of the 2.5 mg or 10 mg tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Crushed rivaroxaban tablets (all strengths) are stable in water and in applesauce for up to 4 hours. An in vitro compatibility study indicated that there is no adsorption of rivaroxaban from a water suspension of a crushed rivaroxaban tablet to PVC or silicone nasogastric (NG) tubing.

Giving carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension through a nasogastric (NG) tube or gastrostomy tube (G-tube):

Children and Adults

Add a minimum of 2.5 mL of water into a small cup for each carglumic acid tablet for oral suspension, or each ½ or ¼ carglumic acid tablet for oral suspension, needed for the prescribed dose. For example:
If the prescribed dose is 2 carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension, add a minimum of 5 mL of water into the cup.
If the prescribed dose is 2 and a ¼ carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension, add a minimum of 7.5 mL of water into the cup.
If the prescribed dose is 2 and a ½ carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension, add a minimum of 7.5 mL of water into the cup.
Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure of how much water you should use for the prescribed dose of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension.
Place the prescribed number of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension into the water in the cup.
Carefully stir the carglumic acid tablet for oral suspension and water mixture in the cup to avoid spilling the mixture. Carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension do not dissolve completely in water.
Draw up all of the carglumic acid tablet for oral suspension and water mixture in the cup into a catheter-tip syringe.
Connect the catheter-tip syringe to the NG tube or G-tube.
Give the carglumic acid tablet for oral suspension and water mixture through the NG tube or G-tube right away.
Pieces of the tablet may remain in the catheter-tip syringe or NG tube or G-tube.
Refill the catheter-tip syringe with 1 mL to 2 mL of water and flush the NG tube or G-tube right away.
Repeat step 8 until there are no pieces of the tablet left in the catheter-tip syringe or NG tube or G-tube.

VIJOICE Tablets, Whole

Swallow VIJOICE tablets whole and take with food. Do not chew, divide, or crush.
Do not use broken, cracked, or damaged tablets.

VIJOICE Tablets Prepared as a Suspension for Oral use, or Feeding Tubes (Nasogastric or Gastric Tube) Administration

For patients who are not able to swallow tablets, or who are using a feeding tube, prepare and administer VIJOICE as a suspension and take with food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
To prepare VIJOICE tablets as a suspension for oral use, place VIJOICE tablets in a cup containing 2 to 4 ounces of water. To prepare VIJOICE tablets as a suspension for feeding tubes administration, place VIJOICE tablets in a cup containing 1 to 2 ounces of water. Make the suspension with water only.
Let tablets stand in water for approximately 5 minutes.
Crush the tablets with a spoon and stir until a suspension is obtained.
Immediately after preparation, administer the suspension as directed below. If not administered immediately after preparation, stir the suspension with the same spoon to re-suspend any particles before administration.
Discard the suspension if it is not administered within 60 minutes after preparation.
Administer the suspension from the cup. After administration of the suspension, add approximately 1 to 2 ounces of water to the same cup. Stir with the same spoon to re-suspend any remaining particles and administer the entire contents of the cup orally. Repeat if particles remain.
Administer VIJOICE tablets prepared as a suspension via French size 5 to 12 diameter silicone or polyurethane nasogastric tubes, or via French size 12 to 24 diameter silicone gastric tubes.
Withdraw VIJOICE suspension from the cup into an enteral syringe and administer it via the nasogastric or gastric tube.

Figure 2
OxyContin abusers and their route of administration. A sentinel surveillance sample of 140,496 individuals assessed for substance abuse treatment at 357 US centers between June 1, 2009, and March 31, 2012, was examined. Data on the route of administration used (percent) by OxyContin abusers (N = 1705) after the introduction of reformulated OxyContin are shown. Adapted from J Pain, volume 14(4), Butler SF, Cassidy TA, Chilcoat H, et al. Abuse rates and routes of administration of reformulated extended-release oxycodone: initial findings from a sentinel surveillance sample of individuals assessed for substance abuse treatment. 351–358, Copyright 2013, with permission from Elsevier.

OxyContin is problematic for patients with chronic pain who also have dysphagia or odynophagia and who must crush or break tablets to ingest their medication or have it administered via an enteral tube. Xtampza ER is the only form of oxycodone that can be taken by sprinkling the capsule contents on soft foods or into a cup and then administering directly into the mouth or through a gastrostomy or nasogastric feeding tube. In addition to being less attractive to illicit drug users, this formulation provides a viable option for patients who require such crushing or dissolving of their medication (due to difficulty swallowing). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study showed that both chewed and intact Xtampza ER were bioequivalent, whereas crushed oxycodone IR yielded higher peak plasma concentrations (C max) compared with similar Xtampza ER doses using any method of administration. Crushed oxycodone IR had an approximately 10-fold higher abuse quotient score (estimation of the relative abuse potential of different formulations based on a ratio of C max to T max) compared with both chewed and intact Xtampza ER. The T max was significantly longer for intact or chewed Xtampza ER (~3–5 hours) than for crushed IR oxycodone (1 hour). If the time to onset is attractive to misusers, these findings would suggest that Xtampza ER should have less appeal to individuals seeking a more rapid drug effect.
