## Question

Can tofacitinib be used to treat bacterial pneumonia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if tofacitinib can be used to treat bacterial pneumonia and how the evidence and guidelines inform that decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what tofacitinib is, its approved indications, and its infection-related safety warnings. Then, I should verify the current standard of care for bacterial pneumonia from major guidelines and check whether any immunomodulators, specifically JAK inhibitors, are recommended. Next, I will examine whether there is any clinical evidence for tofacitinib in bacterial pneumonia, and I should be careful not to conflate viral COVID-19 pneumonia with bacterial disease. After that, I need to review safety data regarding serious infections and pneumonia under tofacitinib. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation, including whether tofacitinib should be interrupted if a patient on it develops bacterial pneumonia [^115hZdfD] [^116LD2BE] [^114NQhP1].

> Let me first confirm what tofacitinib is and what it treats. Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor with predominant JAK1/JAK3 activity (some JAK2) approved for autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis; the FDA labeling emphasizes a class boxed warning for serious infections and advises interrupting therapy during serious or opportunistic infections, including pneumonia, which I need to keep in mind as I reason through bacterial pneumonia management [^113gPHMY] [^115hZdfD] [^1122j4L5]. Wait, let me verify the action step on active infections: yes, the label clearly instructs to interrupt therapy until the infection is controlled, underscoring that active serious infection is a contraindication to continued JAK inhibitor use [^115hZdfD].

> Next, I should review the guideline-based standard of care for bacterial pneumonia. For community-acquired pneumonia, ATS/IDSA 2019 recommends empiric antibiotics (e.g., beta-lactam plus macrolide, or respiratory fluoroquinolone) tailored to setting and comorbidities; there is no role for JAK inhibitors or other immunosuppressants as treatment for bacterial CAP, and the HAP/VAP guidelines likewise emphasize early, appropriate empiric antibacterial therapy rather than immunomodulation [^116LD2BE] [^114NQhP1] [^116e7UWk]. Hold on, I should verify whether any niche immunomodulator indications exist in CAP — no, recommendations consistently center on antibiotics and supportive care, not JAK inhibition [^116LD2BE] [^116e7UWk].

> Now, I will examine whether tofacitinib has been studied as a therapy for bacterial pneumonia. Initially, I wondered if positive data from COVID-19 pneumonia could translate to bacterial pneumonia; but wait, that would be a mistake because the pathobiology and therapeutic targets differ substantially. Let me verify the evidence: tofacitinib showed benefit in hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia by reducing death or respiratory failure in an NEJM trial, and JAK inhibitors (especially baricitinib) appear in multiple COVID-19 guidelines as adjuncts to steroids for hyperinflammation; however, these data address viral, hyperinflammatory pneumonia, not bacterial pneumonia, and I find no trials, case series, or guidelines recommending tofacitinib to treat bacterial pneumonia [^114uqg7q] [^115ciXyJ] [^114zWcbx] [^114nF4Wz]. I should double-check the provided references for any bacterial pneumonia signal — none are present, reinforcing that tofacitinib has no evidence base as an antibacterial pneumonia therapy [^116LD2BE] [^116e7UWk].

> I will now review safety signals relevant to infection risk. Across RA trials and observational cohorts, serious infections occur at roughly 3 per 100 patient-years with tofacitinib, and pneumonia is consistently among the most common serious infections; comparative data suggest increased hospitalization for serious infection versus some biologic DMARDs, and real-world registries and psoriasis programs similarly identify pneumonia and opportunistic infections in the safety profile [^111eyXyp] [^114HVFMb] [^116dGeDE] [^112TA32f]. Hold on, I should verify label guidance again: the FDA labeling instructs clinicians to interrupt tofacitinib during serious infections and resume only when controlled, which would directly apply if a patient on tofacitinib develops bacterial pneumonia [^115hZdfD].

> Mechanistically, I need to ensure I am not overlooking how JAK inhibition could impair antibacterial host defense. JAK-STAT blockade can dampen lymphocyte and myeloid effector function; lower lymphocyte counts with tofacitinib correlate with higher infection risk, and preclinical data show tofacitinib can facilitate reactivation or impaired control of intracellular pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which aligns with the observed infection signal in clinical programs [^116HEWWt] [^111PQMJo]. Hmm, wait a minute, could immunomodulation ever help in bacterial pneumonia? In bacterial disease, pathogen eradication via antibiotics and intact innate responses (e.g., neutrophil-mediated clearance) are paramount; suppressing these pathways risks delayed bacterial clearance rather than benefit, contrasting with COVID-19's hyperinflammatory phase where JAK inhibition targets dysregulated cytokine signaling [^116LD2BE] [^114uqg7q].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the clinical bottom line. There is no evidence supporting tofacitinib as treatment for bacterial pneumonia, and authoritative pneumonia guidelines do not include JAK inhibitors; conversely, tofacitinib carries a documented risk of serious infections including pneumonia, and the FDA label advises interrupting therapy during active serious infections. Therefore, tofacitinib should not be used to treat bacterial pneumonia; if a patient on tofacitinib develops bacterial pneumonia, the prudent course is to interrupt tofacitinib and provide guideline-concordant antibiotic therapy and supportive care, resuming the JAK inhibitor only after the infection is controlled and risk-benefit is reassessed [^116LD2BE] [^114NQhP1] [^116e7UWk] [^115hZdfD]. Hold on, let me verify one last time: no referenced source here supports JAK inhibition for bacterial pneumonia, while multiple sources underscore infection risk and the primacy of antibiotics in CAP and HAP/VAP management, which corroborates this recommendation [^116LD2BE] [^116e7UWk] [^111eyXyp] [^114HVFMb].

---

Tofacitinib should not be used to treat bacterial pneumonia because it is an immunosuppressive JAK inhibitor [^111eyXyp] that increases the risk of serious infections, including pneumonia [^114HVFMb]. It has no antibacterial activity [^1122j4L5] and is not recommended by any pneumonia guidelines [^116LD2BE]; using it in bacterial pneumonia could worsen outcomes by impairing host defenses [^115hZdfD]. Tofacitinib is only indicated for certain inflammatory diseases [^113gPHMY] and, if a patient on tofacitinib develops bacterial pneumonia, the drug should be stopped [^115hZdfD] and appropriate antibiotics started [^114NQhP1].

---

## Mechanism of action and immunosuppressive effects

Tofacitinib inhibits JAK1/3 (with some JAK2 activity) [^1122j4L5], blocking cytokine signaling and reducing lymphocyte function, thereby increasing susceptibility to serious infections [^111eyXyp], including pneumonia [^115hZdfD].

---

## Clinical evidence of infection risk

Clinical trials and real-world data demonstrate an increased risk of serious infections with tofacitinib, including pneumonia [^116dGeDE]:

- **Serious infections**: 3.09 per 100 patient-years in RA trials, with pneumonia the most common [^111eyXyp].
- **Opportunistic infections**: Reported in long-term RA programs, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [^115Njr7Q].
- **Comparative risk**: Higher risk of serious infections versus some biologic DMARDs [^114HVFMb].

---

## Lack of antibacterial activity

Tofacitinib has no direct antibacterial effect, does not inhibit bacterial growth or survival, and is not an antibiotic; it does not treat bacterial infections [^1122j4L5].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

No pneumonia guidelines recommend **tofacitinib** for bacterial pneumonia [^114NQhP1]; standard care consists of prompt, appropriate antibiotics and supportive measures [^116e7UWk].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Use of tofacitinib in bacterial pneumonia could **worsen outcomes** by impairing host defenses and increasing complications:

- **Serious infections**: Higher risk of severe infections, including pneumonia [^111eyXyp].
- **Opportunistic infections**: Increased risk of opportunistic infections [^115Njr7Q].
- **Thromboembolism**: Higher risk of thrombotic events [^113gPHMY].
- **Hematologic effects**: Neutropenia and lymphopenia [^116HEWWt], further impairing immunity [^115hZdfD].

---

## Clinical scenarios where tofacitinib may be considered

Tofacitinib is indicated for RA, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis [^113gPHMY]; it is **not indicated for bacterial pneumonia**. If a patient taking tofacitinib develops bacterial pneumonia, the drug should be **stopped** [^115hZdfD] and appropriate antibiotics started [^114NQhP1].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Tofacitinib **should not be used to treat bacterial pneumonia** because it lacks antibacterial activity [^1122j4L5] and increases infection risk [^115hZdfD]; using it could **worsen outcomes** by impairing host defenses. It is only indicated for certain inflammatory diseases; if bacterial pneumonia occurs, tofacitinib should be **stopped** [^115hZdfD] and appropriate antibiotics started [^116LD2BE].

### Risk of admission to hospital for serious infection after initiating tofacitinib versus biologic DMARDs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: A multidatabase cohort study [^114HVFMb]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

The risk of serious infection is a major concern when prescribing a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for rheumatoid arthritis. Little evidence exists regarding the serious infection risk associated with tofacitinib, a targeted synthetic (ts)DMARD, compared with biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) among patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We compared the risk of serious infection in patients with rheumatoid arthritis initiating tofacitinib versus one of the seven bDMARDs.

- **Methods**: In this multidatabase cohort study, we identified eight mutually exclusive groups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis initiating tofacitinib or one of the seven bDMARDs using US public (Medicare 2012–2015) and private (Optum Clinformatics 2012–2018 and IBM MarketScan 2012–2017) health insurance programs. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had one inpatient visit or two or more outpatient visits (7–365 days apart) for rheumatoid arthritis using International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th revision codes. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of admission to hospital for serious infection, including bacterial, viral, or opportunistic infection based on the inpatient principal diagnosis code. Secondary outcomes were individual types of serious infections and herpes zoster. We adjusted for more than 60 potential confounders through propensity score-based inverse probability treatment weighting in each database. Database-specific adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were combined using a fixed-effects meta-analysis.

- **Findings**: We identified 130,718 patients with rheumatoid arthritis initiating one of the studied treatments.

### Analysis of infections and all-cause mortality in phase II, phase III, and long-term extension studies of tofacitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^111eyXyp]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the rate of infection and all-cause mortality across tofacitinib phase II, phase III, and long-term extension (LTE) studies in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Pooled data from studies of tofacitinib in patients with RA were analyzed. In these studies, tofacitinib was administered as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. The cutoff date for inclusion of data was April 19, 2012.

Across phase II, phase III, and LTE studies, 4,789 patients received tofacitinib (8,460 patient-years of exposure). The overall rate of serious infection was 3.09 events per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.73–3.49), and rates were stable over time. A Cox proportional hazards model showed that age, corticosteroid dose, diabetes, and tofacitinib dose were independently linked to the risk of serious infection. Lymphocyte counts of < 0.5 × 10³/mm³ were rare but associated with an increased risk of treated and/or serious infection. Overall, all-cause mortality rates were 0.30 events per 100 patient-years (95% CI 0.20–0.44).

The conclusion indicates that the overall risk of infection (including serious infection) and mortality rates in RA patients treated with tofacitinib appear to be similar to those observed in RA patients treated with biologic agents. The rates of serious infection were stable over time.

Exposure to study treatment

The mean duration of study treatment was 572 days (median 709 days) for patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, 600 days (median 711 days) for patients receiving tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, 580 days (median 714 days) for patients receiving placebo and then switching to tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, and 569 days (median 714 days) for patients receiving placebo and then switching to tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily. Total exposure was 508 patient‐years and 525 patient‐years for patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily and those receiving 10 mg twice daily, respectively, compared with 129 patient‐years and 124 patient‐years for the patients receiving placebo and then switching to tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily and those receiving placebo and then switching to tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, respectively.

- **Treatment-emergent adverse events**: TEAEs occurring during months 0−12 have been reported previously. TEAEs (any cause) through month 24 are summarized as follows. Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. The most common TEAEs (affecting ≥ 5% of patients) for months 0−24 by treatment sequence were: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache for patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily; nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, herpes zoster, and bronchitis for patients receiving tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily.

### Opzelura [^111bTWxR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving oral Janus kinase inhibitors. Serious lower respiratory tract infections were reported in the clinical development program with topical ruxolitinib.

Avoid the use of Opzelura in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Opzelura in the following patients:

- **Chronic or recurrent infection**: Individuals with recurring infections.
- **History of serious or opportunistic infection**: Those who have previously experienced such infections.
- **Exposure to tuberculosis**: Patients who have been exposed to TB.
- **Residence or travel in endemic areas**: Individuals who have resided or traveled in areas with endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses.
- **Underlying conditions**: Patients with health conditions that may predispose them to infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Opzelura. Interrupt Opzelura if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Opzelura until the infection is controlled.

No cases of active tuberculosis (TB) were reported in clinical trials with Opzelura. However, cases of active TB were reported in clinical trials of oral Janus kinase inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Consider evaluating patients for latent and active TB infection prior to the administration of Opzelura. During Opzelura use, monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of TB.

Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation, has been noted.

Human lives and nations' economies have been adversely affected worldwide by the COVID-19 pandemic. The hyperinflammatory state associated with the disease may be related to mortality. Systemic glucocorticoid is the first-line therapy for cytokine storm. Various immunomodulatory drugs such as tocilizumab and baricitinib have been used in those not responding to glucocorticoid monotherapy.

Amid the peak crisis of COVID-19 in India, there was an extreme paucity of medications, oxygen, and hospital beds. We describe three patients with COVID-19 who received low-dose tofacitinib (an oral Janus kinase inhibitor) in addition to moderate-dose glucocorticoid. These patients were treated at their homes, as the hospitals were short of beds. Rapid reduction in hypoxemia along with gradual resolution of other signs of the disease were observed. The results are reassuring regarding the feasibility of managing severe COVID-19 outside the hospital setting when healthcare resources are overwhelmed by pandemic-related caseload.

### Effectiveness and safety of tofacitinib in Canadian patients with rheumatoid arthritis: Primary results from a prospective observational study [^116dGeDE]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). High credibility.

Serious infections occurred in 22 patients (4.4%; 3.8/100 patient-years). The most common serious infection was pneumonia (n = 6; 1.2%); serious COVID-19 infection occurred in 2 patients (0.4%). The herpes zoster vaccination rate, among patients with known vaccination status, was 52.8%. Ten cases of herpes zoster (1.3/100 patient-years) were reported. Three cases occurred in patients with a prior vaccination history (0.8/100 patient-years) who received concomitant methotrexate (n = 1), hydroxychloroquine (n = 1), and methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine (n = 1); none were reported with concomitant glucocorticoids. Five cases occurred in unvaccinated patients (1.7/100 patient-years; 2 cases in patients with unknown vaccination status). Nine of the 10 infections were considered to be nonserious. The serious case of herpes zoster occurred in a 59-year-old unvaccinated male; tofacitinib treatment was temporarily interrupted and the patient was successfully treated with valacyclovir.

Five patients (1.0%) experienced major adverse cardiovascular events (0.9/100 patient-years); major adverse cardiovascular events were reported as 1 cardiac failure (2 events in 1 patient; both nonfatal), 1 nonfatal myocardial infarction, 1 fatal myocardial infarction, and 2 cerebrovascular accidents (3 events in 2 patients). Malignancy (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) was reported in 8 patients (1.6%; 1.3/100 patient-years), of which 7 cases were reported as serious and none resulted in death; nonmelanoma skin cancer occurred in 4 patients (0.8%).

### Effectiveness and safety of tofacitinib in Canadian patients with rheumatoid arthritis: Primary results from a prospective observational study [^116w3nno]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Low credibility.

In total, 495 patients were included, amounting to 791 patient-years of follow-up. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported in 332 patients (67.1%; incidence rate 126.8/100 patient-years). Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 58 patients (11.7%; 11.9/100 patient-years), and 88 patients (17.8%) discontinued due to AEs (14.5/100 patient-years). Four deaths (0.8%; 0.8/100 patient-years) were reported, including fatal myocardial infarction (n = 1; investigator-reported as non-treatment-related), Salmonella bacteremia and sepsis (n = 1; possibly treatment-related), renal failure due to sepsis (n = 1; possibly treatment-related), and acute myeloid leukemia and pneumonia (n = 1; possibly treatment-related). The most common treatment-emergent AEs were upper respiratory tract infection (5.7%; 3.8/100 patient-years), urinary tract infection (4.4%; 3.7/100 patient-years), and headache (4.2%; 2.8/100 patient-years).

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in the inpatient setting for non-severe CAP, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend the following:

- **Combination therapy**: Administer a β-lactam (ampicillin/sulbactam 1.5–3 g every 6 hours, cefotaxime 1–2 g every 8 hours, ceftriaxone 1–2 g daily, or ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours) combined with a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg daily or clarithromycin 500 mg BID).

- **Monotherapy**: Use a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily) for adult inpatients with non-severe CAP who have no risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa.

### JAK-inhibitors for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): A meta-analysis [^112dTwvT]. Leukemia (2021).

We analyzed reports on the safety and efficacy of JAK-inhibitors in patients with coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) published between January 1st and March 6th, 2021, using the Newcastle-Ottawa and Jadad scales for quality assessment. We used disease severity as a proxy for the time when JAK-inhibitor therapy was started.

We identified 6 cohort studies and 5 clinical trials involving 2,367 subjects treated with ruxolitinib (N = 3) or baricitinib (N = 8). Use of JAK-inhibitors decreased the use of invasive mechanical ventilation (RR = 0.63; [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.47, 0.84]; P = 0.002) and had a borderline impact on rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR = 0.24 [0.06, 1.02]; P = 0.05) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; RR = 0.50 [0.19, 1.33]; P = 0.16). JAK-inhibitors did not decrease the length of hospitalization (mean difference (MD) -0.18 [-4.54, 4.18]; P = 0.94).

Relative risks of death for both drugs were 0.42 [0.30, 0.59] (P < 0.001), for ruxolitinib, RR = 0.33 [0.13, 0.88]; P = 0.03 and for baricitinib RR = 0.44 [0.31, 0.63]; P < 0.001. Timing of JAK-inhibitor treatment during the course of COVID-19 treatment may be important in determining the impact on the outcome. However, these data are not consistently reported.

Regarding the medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, particularly concerning empiric antibiotic therapy (MSSA coverage), the ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend considering the administration of antibiotics with activity against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. The recommended antibiotics include piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem for the initial empiric treatment of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) who have no risk factors for MRSA infection and are not at high risk of mortality.

### Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling to investigate baricitinib and tofacitinib dosing recommendations for COVID-19 in geriatrics [^115WSGwR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). High credibility.

The pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) may be driven by a dysregulated immune/inflammatory response to severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2, which often appears later in the clinical course, culminating in tissue damage. Consequently, anti‐inflammatory/immunosuppressive therapies have been included in the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID‐19 Treatment Guidelines for hospitalized adults requiring oxygen.

The Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway has been shown to be related to the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the pathology of COVID-19. Treatment with corticosteroid dexamethasone has conferred a survival benefit in patients with COVID‐19, and for those on dexamethasone who also have rapidly increasing oxygen needs and systemic inflammation, JAK inhibitor baricitinib is recommended by the NIH as an immunomodulatory drug.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in November 2020 to permit the emergency use of baricitinib for the treatment of COVID‐19 in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age or older. Another JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib, has been listed in the NIH guideline as an alternative if baricitinib is unavailable or not feasible to prescribe. Both are currently included in the Treatment Guidelines for COVID‐19 issued by the Singapore National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Approximately 70% and 30% of baricitinib and tofacitinib undergo renal clearance in humans, respectively.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^116NEoCU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the article titled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia. An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America". We congratulate the authors on their comprehensive review of the evidence. Although we understand that they are limited in their ability to establish recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system process, we believe it would be helpful for the practicing clinician to understand how to interpret the guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship (AS) lens. Below, we discuss three AS-guided recommendations that should be considered when interpreting the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines.

### Holding COVID in check through JAK? The MPN-approved compound ruxolitinib as a potential strategy to treat SARS-CoV-2 induced systemic hyperinflammation [^1164JySS]. Leukemia (2020). Low credibility.

One last aspect, however, is not questionable: with mankind eagerly waiting for effective and safe medication to treat COVID-19, drugs should not be tried with trial and error, as patients deserve appropriate care and academic assessment of novel therapies. With several promising compounds at hand, cherry-picking of random candidate drugs is not appropriate and prevents recruitment of patients for clinical trials that are urgently needed to answer open questions. As exemplified by La Rosée and colleagues, positive data obtained in relevant case series should be rapidly translated into structured clinical trials. Withholding patients from such clinical trials due to formalities, conflicting interests, or lack of personal experience during a deadly pandemic is neither ethical nor academically sound. These critically ill COVID-19 patients do indeed have 'something to lose'.

### Tofacitinib in combination with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis: Patient-reported outcomes from a phase III randomized controlled trial [^113dv7vB]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). High credibility.

Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study compared patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with RA who were treated with tofacitinib or placebo in combination with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

In a 12-month, phase III randomized controlled trial (ORAL Sync), 795 patients with active RA and a previous inadequate response to therapy with one or more conventional or biologic DMARDs were randomized in a 4:4:1:1 ratio to receive tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily (BID), tofacitinib 10 mg BID, placebo advanced to 5 mg BID, or placebo to 10 mg BID, in combination with stable background DMARD therapy. The PROs measured included patient global assessment of arthritis (PtGA), patient assessment of arthritis pain (Pain), physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index [HAQ DI]), health-related quality of life (Short Form 36 Health Survey [SF-36]), fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue [FACIT-F]), and sleep (Medical Outcomes Study Sleep [MOS Sleep]).

At month 3, statistically significant improvements from baseline compared to placebo were reported in PtGA, Pain, HAQ DI, all 8 SF-36 domains, FACIT-F, and MOS Sleep with tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and in PtGA, Pain, HAQ DI, 7 SF-36 domains, FACIT-F, and MOS Sleep with tofacitinib 5 mg BID. These improvements were sustained to month 12. Significantly more tofacitinib-treated patients reported improvements of greater than or equal to the minimum clinically important differences at month 3 compared to placebo in all PROs, except the SF-36 role-emotional domain.

### Compassionate use of JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib for severe COVID-19: A prospective observational study [^115WPmmD]. Leukemia (2021). Low credibility.

There is evidence that the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, representing the leading cause of death in patients with COVID-19, involves a systemic hyperinflammatory reaction. This hyperinflammatory response significantly contributes to lung damage, facilitated by the virus's entry into the respiratory epithelium via the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, and results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can be potentially fatal.

Similarities have been noted between this localized, overwhelming inflammatory reaction and diseases associated with systemic cytokine release storms, such as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Notably, children with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection may develop Kawasaki-like syndrome, a rare, largely cytokine-mediated disease. Hyperinflammation may also affect the vascular system, contributing to thrombotic events in the pulmonary vessels and systemic circulation, which have been reported at unusual rates.

Plasma levels of a vast array of inflammatory cytokines, some of which are associated with the severity of clinical manifestations and require more advanced measures like intensive care, are markedly elevated in patients with COVID-19. A condition of IL-6-dependent, impaired immune cell cytotoxicity may contribute to abnormal immunoregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, targeting the host inflammatory response might play an important role in dampening hyperinflammation and reducing lung damage in patients with COVID-19, especially when ARDS has not yet progressed to terminal stages of pulmonary failure.

### Janus kinase inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19 [^113874vS]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

With potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors represent a potential treatment for symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. They may modulate the exuberant immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and a direct antiviral effect has been described. An understanding of the evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors as a treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is required.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of systemic JAK inhibitors plus standard of care compared to standard of care alone (plus/minus placebo) on clinical outcomes in individuals (outpatient or in-hospital) with any severity of COVID-19, and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (comprising MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, medRxiv, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), Web of Science, WHO COVID-19 Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease, and the US Department of Veterans Affairs Evidence Synthesis Program (VA ESP) Covid-19 Evidence Reviews to identify studies up to February 2022. We monitor newly published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) weekly using the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and have incorporated all new trials from this source until the first week of April 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs that compared systemic JAK inhibitors plus standard of care to standard of care alone.

### Compassionate use of JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib for severe COVID-19: A prospective observational study [^112zykxq]. Leukemia (2021). High credibility.

Overwhelming inflammatory reactions contribute to respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19. Ruxolitinib is a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory properties. We report on a prospective, observational study in 34 patients with COVID-19 who received ruxolitinib on a compassionate-use protocol. Patients had severe pulmonary disease defined by pulmonary infiltrates on imaging and an oxygen saturation ≤ 93% in air and/or a PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 300 mmHg. The median age was 80.5 years, and 85.3% had ≥ 2 comorbidities. The median exposure time to ruxolitinib was 13 days, and the median dose intensity was 20 mg/day. Overall survival by day 28 was 94.1%.

Cumulative incidence of clinical improvement of ≥ 2 points in the ordinal scale was 82.4% (95% confidence interval, 71–93). Clinical improvement was not affected by low-flow versus high-flow oxygen support but was less frequent in patients with a PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mmHg. The most frequent adverse events were anemia, urinary tract infections, and thrombocytopenia. Improvement of inflammatory cytokine profile and activated lymphocyte subsets was observed at day 14. In this prospective cohort of aged and high-risk comorbidity patients with severe COVID-19, compassionate-use ruxolitinib was safe and was associated with improvement in pulmonary function and discharge home in 85.3%. Controlled clinical trials are necessary to establish the efficacy of ruxolitinib in COVID-19.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable.

### Efficacy and safety of tofacitinib monotherapy, tofacitinib with methotrexate, and adalimumab with methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ORAL Strategy): a phase 3b/4, double-blind, head-to-head, randomised controlled trial [^111knhAF]. Lancet (2017). High credibility.

Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor used for treating rheumatoid arthritis. The Oral Rheumatoid Arthritis Trial (ORAL) Strategy aimed to assess the comparative efficacy of tofacitinib monotherapy, tofacitinib plus methotrexate, and adalimumab plus methotrexate in patients with a previous inadequate response to methotrexate.

- **Methods**: ORAL Strategy was a 1-year, double-blind, phase 3b/4, head-to-head, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial involving patients aged 18 years or older with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive oral tofacitinib (5 mg twice daily) monotherapy, oral tofacitinib (5 mg twice daily) plus methotrexate, or subcutaneous adalimumab (40 mg every other week) plus methotrexate at 194 centres in 25 countries. Eligible patients received a live zoster vaccine at the investigators' discretion. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving at least a 50% response according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR50) at month 6 in the full analysis set. Non-inferiority between groups was shown if the lower bound of the 98.34% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between comparators was greater than -13.0%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02187055.

- **Findings**: A total of 1146 patients received treatment: 384 had tofacitinib monotherapy, 376 had tofacitinib and methotrexate, and 386 had adalimumab and methotrexate. At 6 months, the results…

### Randomized phase 3 trial of ruxolitinib for COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114fabyq]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Proof of concept was demonstrated with the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor baricitinib, which improved recovery time among patients with COVID-19–associated pneumonia when added to remdesivir. Baricitinib later improved 28-day mortality among hospitalized patients versus standard of care in the Baricitinib in Participants With COVID-19 (COV-BARRIER) study, including among critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Of note, COV-BARRIER did not meet its primary composite endpoint, which was progression to oxygen/ventilation requirement or death by day 28.

A small, prospective, open-label, nonrandomized phase 2 study of patients with ARDS reported clinical benefit of ruxolitinib, including a 28-day survival rate of 81% (13/16 patients). In contrast, the phase 3 placebo-controlled Ruxolitinib in Patients With COVID-19–Associated Cytokine Storm study (RUXCOVID) of ruxolitinib versus placebo in nonmechanically ventilated hospitalized patients did not reduce mortality, progression to respiratory failure, or need for ICU care by day 29. The trial builds upon previous experience with ruxolitinib by contributing data on treatment outcomes in patients with COVID-19–associated ARDS in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical setting.

Taken together with previous reports, these findings suggest that ruxolitinib may have added benefits in patients who are critically ill from COVID-19–associated ARDS, even those on corticosteroids. Several limitations should be considered. The trial was terminated before target enrollment was reached, and the final sample size was less than half of the anticipated enrollment, which may affect the generalizability of the results.

### Risk factors for severe disease and efficacy of treatment in patients infected with COVID-19: A systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis [^116DaM5q]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

SARS-CoV-2–induced pneumonia is marked by a cytokine storm, characterized by the hyperactivation of effector T cells and excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6). The blockade of IL-6 function using tocilizumab, a specific monoclonal antibody against its receptor, appears useful in alleviating hyperinflammation symptoms in severe cases. Selective Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) inhibitors, such as baricitinib, may also be beneficial, although clinical trials are required. Any benefit is likely to be greatest in combination with an effective antiviral.

There are several limitations to our study. First, only studies published in English were included, which may have introduced selection bias. Unpublished materials, such as recently completed studies, were excluded, which might have affected the conclusions drawn. Second, the results may not be generalizable to healthcare systems outside Asia, as no studies from Europe or the United States were available for inclusion in our review at the time of the literature search. Additionally, all included studies were observational. Clinical parameters were often not clearly defined and clinical follow-up time varied. Finally, there was heterogeneity in the range of symptoms and comorbidities recorded by different studies due to the lack of objective measurements.

It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. IDSA considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in light of each patient's individual circumstances. These guidelines are intended for use by healthcare professionals who care for patients at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), including specialists in infectious diseases, pulmonary diseases, critical care, surgeons, anesthesiologists, hospitalists, and any clinicians and healthcare providers caring for hospitalized patients with nosocomial pneumonia. The panel's recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of HAP and VAP are based upon evidence derived from topic-specific systematic literature reviews.

### Tofacitinib in combination with methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: Clinical efficacy, radiographic, and safety outcomes from a twenty-four-month, phase III study [^115B3fKX]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

- **TEAEs of special interest**: Narratives for all opportunistic infections, including tuberculosis (TB), are provided in Supplementary Table 7 (available online). There were 12 opportunistic infections, all occurring in female patients in Asia and considered treatment-related: two patients received tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily (one was an SAE), eight patients received tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily (three were SAEs), and one patient each in the placebo-switched-to-tofacitinib cohorts (one was an SAE).

None of the patients with reported opportunistic infections had confirmed lymphocyte counts < 500 × 10³/ml. One patient receiving tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily experienced disseminated herpes zoster (not serious), necessitating temporary discontinuation of the study medication. Herpes zoster (all) was reported in 24 patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, 32 patients receiving tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, four patients receiving placebo and then switching to tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, and seven patients receiving placebo and then switching to tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily. Another patient receiving tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily had the study medication temporarily discontinued on day 132 due to a treatment-related SAE of cytomegalovirus viremia, which resolved on day 155. The opportunistic infection in the group receiving placebo and then switching to tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily occurred five months after the switch, while the infection in the group receiving placebo and then switching to tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily occurred 18 months after the switch.

### Benefit-risk profile of tofacitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis: Pooled analysis across six clinical trials [^1133ik4h]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The incidence rates (IRs), defined as the number of patients with events per 100 patient‐years, were assessed for several safety endpoints such as serious infections, opportunistic infections, herpes zoster, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), malignancies excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and NMSC. Serious infections included those that required parenteral antimicrobial therapy, hospitalization, or met criteria to be reported as serious adverse events (AEs).

Opportunistic infections — defined as those occurring more frequently in immunocompromised individuals — included instances such as disseminated herpes zoster and herpes zoster affecting nonadjacent or more than two adjacent dermatomes. MACE was defined by the occurrence of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, or cardiovascular deaths. An independent adjudication committee, blinded to treatment assignments, reviewed all potential opportunistic infections and cardiovascular events.

The 2016 ATS/IDSA guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) emphasize the importance of empiric antibiotic therapy. To this end, they recommend initiating treatment with antibiotics that are effective against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and other Gram-negative bacilli. This approach is essential for the empiric treatment of patients diagnosed with HAP.

### Evaluation of the short-, mid-, and long-term effects of tofacitinib on lymphocytes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^116HEWWt]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Treatment with tofacitinib is associated with increased infections, likely related to immunomodulation, relative to findings in patients treated with placebo. In a meta-analysis of interventional studies, rates of serious infections associated with tofacitinib in patients with moderately to severely active RA were similar to those reported with biologic DMARDs 24. A recent report noted a trend toward increasing risk of serious infection with lower lymphocyte counts 25. Confirmed decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) to < 500 cells/mm³ occur during the first 3 months of exposure in approximately 0.04% of patients receiving tofacitinib at 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily; recommendations state that these patients should discontinue treatment if this threshold is reached, due to an increased risk of serious infection 26, 27.

Here, we evaluate the effects of tofacitinib on ALCs, lymphocyte subset counts (LSCs), and infection rates in patients with RA. The data are discussed in the context of immune function. Our primary objective was to characterize the short-, mid-, and long-term effects of tofacitinib treatment on ALCs and LSCs in patients with RA. Additional objectives were to assess whether ALC and LSC changes observed with long-term tofacitinib treatment are reversible upon treatment cessation, to evaluate the association of infection rates in patients receiving tofacitinib with ALCs or LSCs, and to assess the value of monitoring LSCs in addition to ALCs to mitigate the risk of infection.

### Benefit-risk profile of tofacitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis: Pooled analysis across six clinical trials [^112TA32f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Across all tofacitinib-treated patients in the six clinical trials included in this analysis, the most frequently observed serious infections were pneumonia (n = 16, 0.4%), herpes zoster (n = 8, 0.2%), and appendicitis (n = 7, 0.2%). There was no association between the occurrence of serious infections and cases of confirmed neutropenia or lymphopenia. Opportunistic infections were infrequent, with 12 infections adjudicated to be opportunistic, and no dose dependency was observed. Nine herpes zoster events, reported in eight of the 130 patients with herpes zoster (6%), were adjudicated to be opportunistic infections. Other opportunistic infections included listeria encephalitis, fungal pneumonia, herpes simplex meningitis, and cryptococcal pneumonia. Each was reported in one patient, and all resolved with anti-infective treatment.

Of the 130 cases of herpes zoster, more than 90% were classified as mild or moderate in severity. Most cases resolved with antiviral therapy without complications; however, eight patients discontinued treatment due to herpes zoster. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) was reported by 10 (8%) of the tofacitinib-treated patients with herpes zoster, equating to 0.3% of all the tofacitinib-treated patients, with an incidence rate (IR) of 0.19 per 100 patient-years. A higher IR for herpes zoster was observed in Asian (particularly Japanese) patients with psoriasis receiving tofacitinib; the IR (95% CI) over the total tofacitinib exposure for Asian patients was 5.75 (3.65–8.63), compared with 2.55 (2.13–3.03) for the global population.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^111qE7Fs]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia leads to significant mortality, morbidity, and high costs globally. Empirical selection of antibiotic treatment is crucial for managing patients with pneumonia. To reduce the misuse of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, and side-effects, an empirical, effective, and individualized antibiotic treatment is necessary. Follow-up after the start of antibiotic treatment is also important. Management should include early shifts to oral antibiotics, stewardship according to the microbiological results, and short-duration antibiotic treatment that accounts for clinical stability criteria.

New approaches for fast clinical (lung ultrasound) and microbiological (molecular biology) diagnoses are promising. Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with early and late mortality and increased rates of cardiovascular events. Studies focusing on the long-term management of pneumonia are needed.

### Tofacitinib in combination with methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: Clinical efficacy, radiographic, and safety outcomes from a twenty-four-month, Phase III study [^111BcG4Q]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

The incidence and severity of all‐cause adverse events (AEs), abnormal clinical laboratory findings, and vital signs were recorded. Treatment‐emergent AEs (TEAEs), serious AEs (SAEs), discontinuations due to AEs, and laboratory evaluations of interest were assessed according to treatment phase: months 0–3, months 3–6, and months 6–24. A Safety End Point Adjudication Committee, comprising external independent consultants who were blinded with regard to treatment sequence assignment, reviewed all deaths, cardiovascular events, and malignancies. Safety data up to month 12 have been presented previously.

Crude exposure‐adjusted incidence rates (with corresponding 95% confidence intervals [95% CIs]) for AEs and serious infections were calculated based on the number of unique patients with events per 100 patient‐years of exposure.

- **Statistical analysis**: All analyses were based on the full analysis set, which included all patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug and had ≥ 1 postbaseline assessment. Except where noted, data are presented by the randomized treatment sequences. Patients initially treated with tofacitinib who did not experience a decrease of > 20% in tender and swollen joints were "advanced" at month 3 to the same dosage of tofacitinib.

Missing ACR responses and data on remission and low disease activity status were addressed by nonresponder imputation with no advancement penalty; that is, missing values resulting from patients withdrawing from the study for any reason were set to failure, but in patients continuing the study, values measured after advancement were included.

### Randomized phase 3 trial of ruxolitinib for COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111CDQZy]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global health emergency, with many people developing clinically significant COVID-19, and 20% requiring hospitalization. One third of hospitalized patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a life-threatening inflammatory lung condition characterized by loss of aerated tissue, severe hypoxemia, and increased dead space. Despite the standard use of lung-protective ventilation strategies and prone positioning, patients with COVID-19–associated ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation have poor outcomes. Among these patients, only dexamethasone plus interleukin (IL)-6 inhibition or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibition has been shown to improve survival, but mortality remains high. Therefore, an unmet need remains for additional effective therapies.

COVID-19 is associated with aberrant cytokine signaling, including overactivation of the JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway. Several cytokines that activate JAK/STAT signaling, including interferon-γ, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-2, and IL-6, are overexpressed in patients with COVID-19, and inhibiting some of these inflammatory mediators is associated with clinical improvement compared with the standard of care. The IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab has received emergency use authorization; however, evidence from randomized trials of patients with severe disease is mixed. Because the COVID-19–associated cytokine storm involves several cytokines in addition to IL-6, blocking multiple inflammatory pathways may provide greater clinical benefits.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia and specifically the setting of care and ICU admission, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend considering admitting patients who do not require vasopressors or mechanical ventilator support to a higher-level monitoring unit. This recommendation should be based on the IDSA/ATS minor severity criteria together with clinical judgment.

### Randomized phase 3 trial of ruxolitinib for COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1153sFJt]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Although a numerical reduction in 28-day mortality was observed with ruxolitinib versus placebo (~50% vs. 70%, respectively), the results did not reach the prespecified significance level. The 15-mg ruxolitinib regimen also resulted in numerical improvements in several secondary outcomes, including ventilator-free, ICU-free, and vasopressor-free days, COVID-19 WHO ordinal scale score, and SOFA score. Safety findings were consistent with expectations for patients with COVID-19–associated ARDS and ruxolitinib, and no new safety concerns were identified.

Experimental treatments targeting cytokine signaling may mitigate the widespread inflammatory response that leads to lung injury and respiratory failure in severe COVID-19. Several JAK/STAT-regulated cytokines are overexpressed in COVID-19–associated ARDS, and some are predictive of adverse outcomes. In the adaptive platform Randomised, Embedded, Multi-factorial, Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP) trial, treatment of hospitalized patients with the IL-6 receptor antagonists tocilizumab or sarilumab improved outcomes, including survival, compared with usual care alone. Accordingly, tocilizumab (plus dexamethasone) was added to National Institutes of Health guidelines as a treatment option for COVID-19 with rapid respiratory decompensation and is authorized for emergency use in the United States. However, clinical trials have yielded conflicting results on the benefit of tocilizumab. Separate phase 3 studies showed no benefit of tocilizumab versus placebo in moderately ill patients.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of tofacitinib citrate PO (also known as Xeljanz):

- **Gastrointestinal perforation**: Use caution with a history of diverticulitis or when taking NSAIDs. Monitor patients for symptoms such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or signs of peritonitis. Discontinue tofacitinib and provide appropriate medical intervention, including surgical consultation if necessary.

- **Hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia**: Use caution with a history of high lipid profile. Monitor lipid levels before starting treatment and periodically thereafter. Consider lipid-lowering therapy based on the patient's overall cardiovascular risk profile.

- **Neutropenia**: Use extreme caution with a history of hematologic disorder. Monitor complete blood cell count regularly to detect any decline in neutrophil counts. Consider dose interruption or reduction as per clinical judgment. Monitor blood counts closely and manage according to the severity of neutropenia.

### Recent advances in clinical practice: Management of inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112R7BgM]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

Tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), has been associated with a higher risk of thrombosis and infections, particularly herpes zoster. Available data on its safety during COVID-19 have been limited.

- **Janus kinase inhibitor**: In a subgroup analysis of the SECURE-IBD study, which included only 37 tofacitinib-treated patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), tofacitinib use was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death when compared with other treatment regimens. No thrombotic events were reported. However, in a more recent community-based study from the United States involving a larger number of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), including IBD, 31% of patients treated with JAKi had an increased risk of severe COVID-19 (RR 3.35) compared with patients treated with other biologics. Reassuringly, recent data showed that tofacitinib was associated with a lower risk of hospitalization and death (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.76). Tofacitinib has also been shown to be an effective treatment to reduce the risk of death or respiratory failure from COVID-19.

### Clinical significance of Janus kinase inhibitor selectivity [^116QCHTf]. Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Radiographic damage was statistically significantly less in patients treated with tofacitinib 10 mg compared to placebo-treated patients as observed in ORAL-SCAN. Tofacitinib 5 mg-treated patients had less radiographic damage than placebo-treated patients, though this did not achieve statistical significance. Baricitinib has also been shown to reduce radiographic damage in RA-BUILD, RA BEAM, and RA-BEGIN. In RA-BUILD, baricitinib, both 2 and 4 mg in combination with MTX, statistically significantly reduced radiographic progression compared to placebo. In RA-BEGIN, baricitinib 4 mg monotherapy-treated patients had less radiographic progression than placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant.

- **Monotherapy vs combination therapy with MTX**: Since Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) are not biological DMARDs, they do not incite an anti-drug antibody response. Therefore, theoretically, concomitant treatment with MTX should be unnecessary. Tofacitinib monotherapy was assessed in ORAL-SOLO and ORAL-START, while baricitinib monotherapy was assessed in RA-BEGIN. Tofacitinib (5 mg and 10 mg) and baricitinib 4 mg monotherapy were superior to MTX alone. Baricitinib monotherapy produced a similar therapeutic response to 4 mg plus MTX. However, the study was not powered to compare differences between monotherapy and combination therapy. Indeed, the sample size of the monotherapy group (N = 159) was smaller than the MTX plus baricitinib group (N = 215). Furthermore, both ORAL-START and RA-BEGIN were trials of patients with early RA, while in routine clinical practice, JAKi are used in patients with more established RA.

### Janus kinases to jakinibs: From basic insights to clinical practice [^1122j4L5]. Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cytokines are critical mediators of diverse immune and inflammatory diseases. Targeting cytokines and cytokine receptors with biologics has revolutionized the treatment of many of these diseases, but targeting intracellular signalling with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (jakinibs) now represents a major new therapeutic advance. We are still in the first decade since these drugs were approved, and there is still much to be learned about the mechanisms of action of these drugs and the practical use of these agents. Here, we will review cytokines that do, and just as importantly, do not signal by JAKs, as well as explain how this relates to both efficacy and side effects in various diseases. We will review new, next-generation selective jakinibs, as well as the prospects and challenges ahead in targeting JAKs.

Tygacil was evaluated in adults for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multinational, multicenter studies (Studies 1 and 2). These studies compared Tygacil (100 mg intravenous initial dose followed by 50 mg every 12 hours) with levofloxacin (500 mg intravenous every 12 or 24 hours). In Study 1, after at least 3 days of intravenous therapy, a switch to oral levofloxacin (500 mg daily) was permitted for both treatment arms. Total therapy duration ranged from 7 to 14 days. Patients with CABP who required hospitalization and intravenous therapy were enrolled. The primary efficacy endpoint was the clinical response at the test of cure (TOC) visit in the co-primary populations of the clinically evaluable (CE) and clinical modified intent-to-treat (c-mITT) patients. Clinical cure rates at TOC by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable patients are presented in Table 9.

To further evaluate the treatment effect of tigecycline, a post-hoc analysis was conducted in CABP patients at higher risk of mortality, for whom the treatment effect of antibacterial drugs is supported by historical evidence. The higher-risk group included CABP patients from the two studies with any of the following factors: age ≥ 50 years, PSI score ≥ 3, or Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 10. Age ≥ 50 was the most common risk factor in the higher-risk group.

### Case report: home-based management of severe COVID-19 with low-dose tofacitinib [^114i2ETX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

Cytokine storm is a potentially life-threatening condition resulting from the dysregulated release of cytokines from inflammatory cells. Infections and autoimmune diseases are the most common causes. Cytokine production is a natural defense mechanism against infections. They give rise to localized inflammation and become undetectable after their function is over. However, the sustained activation of the immune system, which occurs in a cytokine storm, leads to undesirable effects on various organ systems. It may be observed in COVID-19.

In a cytokine storm, nonspecific markers of inflammation, such as ESR, CRP, ferritin, triglycerides, and D-dimer, may be elevated. Circulating levels of IL-6, IL-18, IL-10, IL-1, IL-2, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α may be raised. IL-6 is the master cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of hyperinflammatory states arising from various etiologies. It mediates its effects with the help of membrane-bound and circulating receptors, resulting in the activation of an intracellular inflammatory cascade via the JAK-STAT pathway. Inhibition of IL-6 signaling by tofacitinib has been demonstrated by McInnes et al. However, IL-6 is only one of the cytokines involved in hyperinflammatory states. Blocking the final common pathway of many cytokines by JAK inhibitors seems to be a more reasonable approach than blocking IL-6 alone by tocilizumab. Lymphocytic inflammation has been demonstrated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients. Inhibition of the action of JAK-dependent cytokines leads to the inactivation of lymphocytes. In addition, the number and function of natural killer cells.

### Xeljanz [^113gPHMY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The information provided below applies to Xeljanz, Xeljanz XR, and Xeljanz Oral Solution, as they all contain the same active ingredient, tofacitinib.

- **Risk summary**: The available data from a pregnancy exposure registry, which enrolled 11 exposed patients, along with pharmacovigilance and published literature, are insufficient to draw conclusions about a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis (UC) during pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations]. Animal reproduction studies indicated fetocidal and teratogenic effects when pregnant rats and rabbits received tofacitinib during organogenesis at exposure levels 73-times and 6.3-times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily, respectively. Additionally, in a peri- and post-natal study in rats, tofacitinib led to reductions in live litter size, postnatal survival, and pup body weights at exposure multiples of approximately 73-times the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily and approximately 36-times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily, respectively [see Data].

	- The background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risks of major birth defects and miscarriages are 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

### Tofacitinib in combination with nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized trial [^117FmFuK]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Many patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) do not achieve adequate and safe responses with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Tofacitinib is a novel, oral, Janus kinase inhibitor that treats RA.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in combination with nonbiologic DMARDs.

- **Design**: 1-year, double-blind, randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00856544).

- **Setting**: 114 centers in 19 countries.

- **Patients**: 792 patients with active RA despite nonbiologic DMARD therapy.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomly assigned 4:4:1:1 to oral tofacitinib, 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, or placebo advanced to tofacitinib, 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily.

- **Measurements**: Primary end points were 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) criteria; Disease Activity Score for 28-joint counts based on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28–4[ESR]) of less than 2.6; DAS28–4(ESR)-defined remission, change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score, and safety assessments.

- **Results**: Mean treatment differences for ACR20 response rates (month 6) for the 5-mg and 10-mg tofacitinib groups compared with the combined placebo groups were 21.2% (95% CI, 12.2% to 30.3%; P < 0.001) and 25.8% (CI, 16.8% to 34.8%; P < 0.001), respectively. The HAQ-DI scores (month 3) and DAS28–4(ESR) less than 2.6 response rates (month 6) were also superior in the tofacitinib groups versus placebo. The incidence rates of serious adverse events for patients receiving 5-mg tofacitinib, 10-mg tofacitinib, or placebo were 6.9, 7.3, or 10.9 events per 100 patient-years, respectively.

### Stewardship prompts to improve antibiotic selection for pneumonia: The INSPIRE randomized clinical trial [^1177EUQF]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

Pneumonia is the most common infection requiring hospitalization and is a major reason for the overuse of extended-spectrum antibiotics. Despite the low risk of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infection, clinical uncertainty often drives initial antibiotic selection. Strategies to limit empiric antibiotic overuse for patients with pneumonia are needed.

The objective was to evaluate whether computerized provider order entry (CPOE) prompts providing patient- and pathogen-specific MDRO infection risk estimates could reduce empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics for non-critically ill patients admitted with pneumonia.

The design involved a cluster-randomized trial in 59 US community hospitals, comparing the effect of a CPOE stewardship bundle (education, feedback, and real-time MDRO risk-based CPOE prompts; n = 29 hospitals) versus routine stewardship (n = 30 hospitals) on antibiotic selection during the first three hospital days (empiric period) in non-critically ill adults (≥ 18 years) hospitalized with pneumonia. There was an 18-month baseline period from April 1, 2017, to September 30, 2018, and a 15-month intervention period from April 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020.

The intervention included CPOE prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics in patients ordered to receive extended-spectrum antibiotics during the empiric period who have a low estimated absolute risk (< 10%) of MDRO pneumonia, coupled with feedback and education.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was empiric (first 3 days of hospitalization) extended-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy.

### Multidisciplinary authorship in clinical practice guidelines: An opportunity for inclusion [^116VsHiV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

I read with great interest the long-anticipated updates to the clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). It has been 12 years since the last ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines were updated, and clinicians have been anxiously waiting for more recent guidance to assist them in the management of patients presenting with this common and challenging infectious syndrome. The new CPG were produced by a multidisciplinary panel of 15 experts from Australia, Canada, and the United States, and incorporate new and relevant research published since 2007. Although the new CPG were endorsed by the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, and the National Academy of Medicine recommended that guideline development committees should be composed of experts from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds, there was no pharmacist representation among the authors.

This is not the first time major CPGs that include numerous pharmacotherapy recommendations have been released without inclusion of a pharmacist on the authorship panel. In fact, the proportion of pharmacist authorship in national CPG published between 2010 and 2016 was 31%, and the proportion of pharmacist authorship in IDSA guidelines was 21%. These numbers, albeit low, represent an improvement from the past, when the pharmacist authorship representation in retired IDSA guidelines was only 13%.

Calls to include pharmacists as authors on CPG are not new. Pharmacists are well trained in…

### Low-dose ruxolitinib plus steroid in severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [^115gQ9QU]. Leukemia (2021). Low credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 is a biphasic illness characterized by an initial flu-like phase, followed by a pulmonary and systemic disease, where a dysregulated cytokine storm may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. JAK-STAT inhibitors block the common pathway of cytokine activation and may reduce the excessive inflammatory reaction, thereby decreasing mortality.

Ruxolitinib, a Janus Kinase (JAK) 1 and 2 inhibitor, is used in the treatment of conditions such as myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, which is characterized by a cytokine imbalance similar to that observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We conducted a non-randomized clinical study assessing the effect of ruxolitinib in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who did not require mechanical ventilation at baseline (group A), comparing them to a control group of patients with similar clinical and radiological characteristics hospitalized during the same period (group B). All patients over the age of 18, admitted to our hospital from March 13, 2020, to April 13, 2020, and eligible for the ruxolitinib Managed Access Plan (MAP), were evaluated. The MAP program for ruxolitinib was registered by Novartis and approved by the Italian Ministry of Health and by the ethical review board of our institution. Inclusion criteria included a nasopharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction, pulmonary infiltrates typical of interstitial pneumonia on chest CT, and a respiratory frequency greater than 30/min or oxygen saturation equal to or lower than 93%. We excluded patients with chronic comorbidities or neoplastic disease with a life expectancy of less than one year.

### Risk of tuberculosis reactivation with tofacitinib (CP-690550) [^111PQMJo]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) live with a risk of reactivation, and several treatments for chronic inflammatory conditions are highly associated with such reactivation. A new Janus kinase inhibitor, tofacitinib (CP-690550), has shown promising results for the treatment of inflammatory disorders, thus raising concerns about the risk of active tuberculosis. Our goal was to characterize the impact of tofacitinib on LTBI using a mouse model of contained tuberculosis. Our data indicate that tofacitinib reduces host containment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and promotes bacterial replication in the lungs, suggesting tuberculosis reactivation. Tofacitinib may carry a significant risk for LTBI reactivation in humans.

### Effects of Janus kinase inhibitors in adults admitted to hospital due to COVID-19: A systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^113Jy5Gt]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, compared with usual care or placebo, in adults treated in hospital for COVID-19 is conflicting. We aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of JAK inhibitors compared with placebo or usual care and whether treatment effects differed between prespecified participant subgroups.

- **Methods**: For this systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA), we searched Medline via Ovid, Embase via Elsevier, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the COVID-19 L·OVE Platform, including backward and forward citation searching (last search Nov 28, 2024), for RCTs (unpublished or published in any format and any language) that randomly assigned adults (aged ≥ 16 years) admitted to a hospital due to COVID-19 to receive either a JAK inhibitor (any type) or no JAK inhibitor (i.e. received site-specific standard of care with or without placebo), and requested individual participant data (IPD) from the original trial teams. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at day 28 after random assignment. We used two-stage meta-analyses adjusting for age and respiratory support, and pooled estimates using random-effects models. The assessment of individual-level effect modifiers was based solely on within-trial information and continuous modifiers were investigated as both linear and non-linear interactions. We used the Instrument for Assessing the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses to appraise the subgroup analyses and the Grad

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114NQhP1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, specifically concerning empiric antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting for patients with comorbidities, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend administering a combination therapy of a β-lactam (amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg PO on the first day and 250 mg PO daily thereafter, clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO once daily) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg PO daily). This is recommended for outpatients with CAP and comorbidities, such as chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, or asplenia.

### Growing evidence of the safety of JAK inhibitors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^112zbC6t]. Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a 1.5- to 2-fold higher risk of infections requiring hospitalization or serious infections than the general population. Infection rates from five large registries of RA, including the Consortium of Rheumatology Researchers of North America (CORRONA), Institute of Rheumatology Rheumatoid Arthritis, Norfolk Arthritis Register, Swedish Rheumatology Quality of Care Register, and CORRONA International, were compared with harmonization of the infection definition. The incidence (95% confidence intervals) of infections requiring hospitalization, standardized for age and sex distribution in the RA clinical trial program, was consistent across registries, ranging from 1.14 (1.05, 1.25) to 1.62 (1.52, 1.72) per 100 patient years (PY).

Use of biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) increased the risk of serious infections compared to the use of csDMARDs, without differences across bDMARDs, showing an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.1–1.8. Of 4789 patients treated with tofacitinib (8460 PY of exposure) in phase II, phase III, and long-term extension (LTE) studies, 259 patients had serious infections, with 3.09 events per 100 PY (95% CI 2.73, 3.49). The most common infection was pneumonia.

A recent analysis of integrated data throughout the RA development program of tofacitinib, including phase I, phase II, phase III, and LTE studies, showed a similar risk for serious infections, at 2.7 events per 100 PY (95% CI 2.5, 3.0). A pooled analysis of LTE studies demonstrated that the incidence rates of serious infections remained constant up to 96 months. Risk factors included age and diabetes mellitus.

### Tofacitinib in patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia [^114uqg7q]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, in patients who are hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia are unclear.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, hospitalized adults with Covid-19 pneumonia to receive either tofacitinib at a dose of 10 mg or placebo twice daily for up to 14 days or until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was the occurrence of death or respiratory failure through day 28 as assessed with the use of an eight-level ordinal scale (with scores ranging from 1 to 8, and higher scores indicating a worse condition). All-cause mortality and safety were also assessed.

- **Results**: A total of 289 patients underwent randomization at 15 sites in Brazil. Overall, 89.3% of the patients received glucocorticoids during hospitalization. The cumulative incidence of death or respiratory failure through day 28 was 18.1% in the tofacitinib group and 29.0% in the placebo group (risk ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.97; P = 0.04). Death from any cause through day 28 occurred in 2.8% of the patients in the tofacitinib group and in 5.5% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.15 to 1.63). The proportional odds of having a worse score on the eight-level ordinal scale with tofacitinib, as compared with placebo, was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.36 to 1.00) at day 14 and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.27 to 1.06) at day 28. Serious adverse events occurred in 20 patients (14.1%) in the tofacitinib group and in 17 (12.0%) in the placebo group.

- **Conclusions**: Among patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia, tofacitinib treatment resulted in a lower risk of death or respiratory failure through day 28 compared to placebo.

### Compassionate use of JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib for severe COVID-19: A prospective observational study [^117EGZf2]. Leukemia (2021). Low credibility.

Results from two other clinical studies with ruxolitinib were reported recently, plus a few single cases. In the study of La Rosée et al, 14 COVID-19 patients with evidence of severe hyperinflammation, based on a newly developed COVID-19 inflammation score, received ruxolitinib over a median of 9 days and a median cumulative dose of 135 mg (approximately 15 mg per day). Evidence of reduced hyperinflammatory status was obtained in 12 patients, and sustained clinical improvement was reported in 11 patients without any notable toxicity. In the study by Cao et al, faster clinical improvement was observed in 20 patients receiving ruxolitinib compared to the control group, although the rate of overall clinical improvement was similar. Treatment was well tolerated.

Taking into account the role of hyperinflammation in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia and these preliminary clinical reports, findings support the development of controlled trials of ruxolitinib in patients with severe pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, aiming to control hyperinflammation and mitigate the progression of the disease. A phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is ongoing (NCT04362137), randomizing patients with COVID-19 who are not in need of mechanical ventilation, to ruxolitinib (5 mg twice daily) or placebo, in addition to standard care. The primary endpoint will compare the efficacy, including death, progression of respiratory failure, and need for intensive care, between the two arms by day 29.

### Case report: home-based management of severe COVID-19 with low-dose tofacitinib [^1119rbtj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

All three patients described here had hypoxemia and transaminitis suggestive of multiorgan dysfunction. In addition, Patient 3 had mild renal derangement. Markers of systemic inflammation were elevated, including CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, ESR, and IL-6. These observations were suggestive of a cytokine storm. Moreover, marked improvement in all the parameters was observed after the addition of a JAK inhibitor to moderate-dose glucocorticoid, targeted toward cytokine storm.

Baricitinib, an inhibitor of JAK 1 and 2, has been approved for use in severe COVID-19. Tofacitinib blocks JAK 1 and 3, with some activity against JAK 2. Our patients were seen during the peak crisis of COVID-19 in New Delhi. The use of baricitinib was difficult because of unavailability and prohibitively high cost. Therefore, tofacitinib was used as an alternative agent.

There are no published data on the efficacy of tofacitinib in COVID-19 when the patients described in the manuscript were treated. However, an ongoing trial was present under the National Institutes of Health (NCT04469114, subject recruitment completed). The study by Hayek et al. was published while our manuscript was being prepared. It was a retrospective, uncontrolled study that showed the addition of tofacitinib to dexamethasone in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 provided a survival benefit. Significant reduction in mortality was observed in the tofacitinib group compared with dexamethasone (odds ratio 0.3, P = 0.01). However, our report is distinct because our patients with severe COVID-19 were treated with low-

### Growing evidence of the safety of JAK inhibitors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^115Njr7Q]. Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Of 5671 patients enrolled in phase II, phase III, and LTE studies of tofacitinib, 34 non-TB opportunistic infections developed, including esophageal candidiasis (n = 9), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (n = 4), CMV infection (n = 6), non-tuberculous mycobacterium pulmonary infection (n = 2), cryptococcal infection (pneumonia n = 2, meningitis n = 1), disseminated or multidermatomal HZ (n = 8), BK virus encephalopathy (n = 1), and toxoplasmosis (n = 1), with a crude IR (95% CI) of 0.25 (0.18, 0.36). No progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was reported. The presentations of CMV infection were diverse, including asymptomatic cases, esophageal ulcer, sialadenitis, hepatitis, and gastritis.

A Japanese post-marketing surveillance program of tofacitinib reported 12 cases (0.4%) of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Patients treated with TNF inhibitors were also susceptible to intracellular infections, including non-tuberculous mycobacterium, Listeria monocytogenes, Legionella pneumophila, Salmonella sp., and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. The risks of opportunistic infection between tofacitinib and TNF inhibitors are difficult to compare due to differing definitions of opportunistic infection. It is recommended that a consensus definition for infection reporting be used in future studies to facilitate comparison across small-molecule kinase inhibitors and bDMARDs. Opportunistic infections, except for TB and HZ, reported during the clinical development program of baricitinib included CMV infection (n = 1), Epstein-B.
