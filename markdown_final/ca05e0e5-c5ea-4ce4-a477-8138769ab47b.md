## Question

Pacifier use

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pacifier use recommendations, including benefits, risks, timing, and weaning strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the major benefits, especially SIDS risk reduction. Then, I should verify the breastfeeding considerations and whether early pacifier use truly causes weaning. Next, I will examine risks such as otitis media and dental effects. After that, I need to check timing by infant feeding method and age. Then, I should review practical safety and weaning guidance. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced, guideline-aligned recommendation and note special populations and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the primary benefit: SIDS risk reduction. Multiple meta-analyses and systematic reviews consistently show that pacifier use at sleep is associated with a substantial reduction in SIDS risk, with pooled adjusted odds ratios around 0.39 to 0.71 for last-sleep or usual use, translating to an estimated number needed to treat of roughly 2733 infants to prevent one SIDS death, which is a strong population-level benefit [^112q4WzM] [^115KDpPv] [^116GYSAW]. Wait, let me verify the evidence hierarchy here; these are case-control studies and meta-analyses, not randomized trials, because RCTs for SIDS prevention are ethically infeasible, so the strength is graded as Grade A/B by major bodies despite observational designs [^115DUf2c] [^115KDpPv].

> I need to check the breastfeeding question carefully. Observational cohorts repeatedly associate early and frequent pacifier use with shorter breastfeeding duration, but randomized trials and high-quality reviews suggest pacifier use itself does not independently reduce exclusive breastfeeding through 3 to 4 months when lactation is established, implying confounding by breastfeeding difficulties or maternal intent rather than causation [^111Tx41h] [^112WWPYf] [^114C7hVg]. Hold on, I should verify the timing nuance; one RCT found early introduction before about 4 weeks shortened overall breastfeeding duration, but not exclusive duration, reinforcing the importance of delaying pacifiers until breastfeeding is well established rather than avoiding them outright [^1162mUDy]. Let me reconsider the practical implication: counsel on latch, milk transfer, and growth before introducing a pacifier, and avoid using a pacifier to delay feeds or mask hunger cues [^116a8gjS] [^115ofTdN].

> Next, I should review risks. Otitis media risk rises with pacifier use, particularly with frequent or continuous use beyond 6 months. Guidelines recommend reducing or eliminating pacifier use in the second 6 months to mitigate recurrent AOM risk, with a meta-analytic risk ratio around 1.24 and stronger associations for recurrent disease in some cohorts [^115g5UUa] [^111ppZBx] [^116f5GSw]. I need to ensure I'm not overstating causality; these are observational signals, but they are consistent across studies and biologically plausible via reflux of nasopharyngeal secretions and eustachian tube effects, so the precaution is reasonable [^111ppZBx].

> I will now examine dental and craniofacial effects. Prolonged and frequent pacifier use beyond 2 years, and especially beyond 4 years, is associated with malocclusion phenotypes such as anterior open bite and posterior crossbite; orthodontic pacifiers may reduce some risks but evidence is mixed and insufficient to claim prevention of malocclusion, so duration control remains key [^114GeYEa] [^117Jz23W]. Wait, let me verify the weaning window; most pediatric dentistry and primary care guidance converge on weaning by 12 to 24 months to minimize orthodontic risks, with earlier cessation preferred when feasible [^notfound].

> Let me think about timing by feeding method. For breastfed infants, I should confirm that major guidelines advise delaying pacifier introduction until breastfeeding is firmly established, typically around 3 to 4 weeks, but recognizing variability in dyads; once established, offering a pacifier at sleep is reasonable for SIDS risk reduction [^1152Lrdr] [^115KDpPv]. For non-breastfed infants, offering a pacifier as soon as desired is acceptable, again primarily for sleep-related SIDS benefit, with the same safety principles applied [^115zVgkb] [^113axBHX]. Hold on, I should verify that this delay strategy balances risks and benefits; yes, it preserves early latch and milk transfer while still capturing the SIDS protective association once breastfeeding is stable [^1152Lrdr].

> I should double-check practical safety guidance. Use a single-piece pacifier with a firm, soft nipple and a shield at least 1.5 inches in diameter with ventilation holes; never tie a pacifier to the crib, neck, or hand; clean regularly and replace when worn; avoid sharing between siblings; and do not coat with sweeteners except when using sucrose for procedural pain management in a controlled setting [^112MV8Qu] [^115PJxny]. Wait, let me verify the procedural analgesia point. Yes, pacifier use, with or without sucrose, reduces pain behaviors during procedures like venipuncture or orogastric tube insertion in young infants, supporting selective, time-limited use for comfort during painful interventions [^1139Ur9p] [^1149UoKp].

> Next, I should review weaning strategy. I need to ensure we align with primary care guidance: begin weaning between 6 and 12 months, using positive reinforcement and gradual reduction. Persistent use beyond 12 months increases risks for otitis media and dental malocclusion, so earlier cessation is preferable when developmentally feasible [^112euGUY] [^115pbieu]. But wait, what if parents worry about sleep disruption? I should counsel that brief, consistent, parent-present comfort strategies can substitute for the pacifier during weaning, and that most infants adapt within 1 to 2 weeks with supportive routines [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a balanced recommendation. Offer a pacifier at naptime and bedtime for SIDS risk reduction once breastfeeding is well established in breastfed infants, or from birth in non-breastfed infants. Avoid using a pacifier to delay feeds or as a default soothing tool during wakeful periods. Limit daytime use and do not force if the infant refuses. Implement weaning between 6 and 12 months with positive reinforcement. And reassess if recurrent otitis media or dental concerns arise [^114gaLhy] [^112MV8Qu] [^112euGUY]. Hold on, I should verify alignment with major guidelines. This approach matches AAP and AAFP positions emphasizing sleep-only use, delayed introduction for breastfed infants, and timely weaning to balance benefits and risks [^115zVgkb] [^113axBHX].

> I will now consider special populations. In preterm infants, non-nutritive sucking with pacifiers can facilitate oral feeding maturation, shorten transition from gavage to full oral feeds, and reduce length of stay. These benefits justify judicious NICU use under professional guidance, with attention to individualized feeding plans and infection control [^1147XEme] [^115AUdsb]. For infants with recurrent AOM, I should confirm that reducing or eliminating pacifier use after 6 months is specifically recommended to lower recurrence risk, which can be emphasized during acute care follow-up [^115g5UUa] [^111ppZBx].

> But wait, what about emerging or controversial areas. Observational data suggest parental pacifier cleaning by sucking may be associated with reduced eczema and asthma, possibly via microbial exposure, yet a separate cohort links antiseptic cleaning of pacifiers at 6 months with higher food allergy risk; these are hypothesis-generating and should not override standard hygiene, but they highlight the complexity of the infant microbiome and the need for more definitive research [^111Ar1V9] [^116DjgHq]. I should also note that while some studies report lower infant obesity with pacifier use, causality is uncertain and should not be used to justify prolonged use beyond dental and otitis considerations [^112r8rhn].

> Finally, I need to ensure the counseling message is clear and actionable. Pacifiers are a tool with meaningful SIDS benefits and manageable risks when used intentionally: delay until breastfeeding is established, reserve for sleep, avoid force or prolonged daytime use, prioritize oral health with timely weaning, and tailor for special circumstances like prematurity or recurrent otitis. This measured approach reflects the best available evidence and current guideline consensus [^1152Lrdr] [^113axBHX] [^112euGUY].

Pacifier use is recommended at **nap and bedtime** [^114gaLhy] to reduce SIDS risk [^112q4WzM], but should be delayed until breastfeeding is well established [^1152Lrdr] (about 3–4 weeks) to avoid interference [^1162mUDy]. Pacifiers also provide **analgesia during procedures** [^1139Ur9p] and support neurobehavioral organization in preterm infants [^114ps7r1]. Risks include **otitis media** [^115g5UUa] (especially with prolonged use), dental malocclusion [^114GeYEa], and possible early breastfeeding cessation if introduced too early [^1162mUDy]. Wean by 6–12 months [^112MV8Qu] to reduce otitis media and dental risks, and use a one-piece design with ventilation holes to minimize choking risk [^112MV8Qu].

---

## Benefits of pacifier use

### Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) risk reduction

Evidence shows a **significant reduction in SIDS risk** with pacifier use at sleep [^112q4WzM], with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.39 (95% CI 0.31–0.50) for use during the last sleep [^115KDpPv]. The AAP recommends offering a pacifier at nap and bedtime [^114gaLhy] for this reason [^115zVgkb].

---

### Pain management and procedural comfort

Pacifiers provide **analgesia during minor procedures** (e.g. heel sticks, immunizations, venipuncture) [^1139Ur9p] and reduce crying and distress [^112VUdfi]. Non-nutritive sucking also supports neurobehavioral organization and self-regulation, especially in preterm infants [^114ps7r1].

---

### Support for breastfeeding in special populations

In preterm infants, pacifiers facilitate the transition to oral feeding, improve weight gain, and shorten hospital stays [^1147XEme]. They also support neurobehavioral organization and self-regulation in this population [^114ps7r1].

---

## Risks associated with pacifier use

### Breastfeeding interference

Early introduction (before 3–4 weeks) may cause **nipple confusion** [^1162mUDy] and reduce breastfeeding duration, particularly with frequent use [^114iwMnc]. Delaying until breastfeeding is established mitigates this risk [^1162mUDy].

---

### Otitis media (ear infections)

Prolonged use increases **acute otitis media risk** [^117Jz23W], especially beyond 6 months [^115g5UUa]. Limiting use and weaning by 6–12 months reduces this risk [^115pbieu].

---

### Dental and oral health issues

Prolonged use is linked to **malocclusion** (open bite, crossbite) [^114GeYEa] and may affect craniofacial development. Weaning by 2–4 years helps prevent these issues [^115PJxny].

---

### Infection risk

Improper hygiene increases the risk of **oral infections** [^115PJxny]; regular cleaning and replacement are essential [^115PJxny].

---

## Recommended guidelines for pacifier use

| **Clinical context** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| General use | Offer at nap and bedtime to reduce SIDS risk [^114gaLhy] [^112q4WzM] |
| Breastfeeding infants | Delay until breastfeeding is well established (about 3–4 weeks) [^1152Lrdr] [^115KDpPv] |
| Preterm infants | Beneficial for oral feeding development and neurobehavioral organization [^1147XEme] [^114ps7r1] |
| Weaning | Wean by 6–12 months to reduce otitis media and dental risks [^115pbieu] [^112euGUY] |
| Safety | Use one-piece design with ventilation holes; clean regularly [^112MV8Qu] [^115PJxny] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Preterm infants**: Pacifiers support feeding development and self-regulation [^1147XEme] [^114ps7r1]; use is beneficial in NICU settings [^1147XEme].
- **Pain management**: Effective for procedural pain in neonates and infants [^1139Ur9p] [^1149UoKp].
- **Parental stress**: May reduce parenting stress and improve parent-infant interactions [^116Dq1WA] [^116tQw2x].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Pacifier use offers **clear benefits**, notably SIDS risk reduction [^112q4WzM] and procedural pain relief [^1139Ur9p], with risks that are manageable with timing and hygiene. Clinicians should:

- **Delay introduction** until breastfeeding is established [^1152Lrdr].
- **Use at sleep** to reduce SIDS risk [^114gaLhy].
- **Wean by 6–12 months** to limit otitis media and dental risks [^115pbieu].
- **Use safe, clean, one-piece pacifiers** with ventilation holes [^112MV8Qu].

Overall, **pacifier use is beneficial when guided by evidence-based timing and safety practices** [^112MV8Qu].

Discussion

This is the first comprehensive study examining the practice, perceptions, and psychological correlates of pacifier use by mothers. In the current study, more than half of the mothers gave a pacifier to their baby, a consistent trend reported for the Western part of the world. – There were no differences between age of mother or age or sex of the infant when choosing to use a pacifier. Additionally, pacifier use did not differ based on maternal anxiety or parenting self-efficacy. Despite this general similarity in psychological characteristics, pacifier users tend to be less educated than non-users – suggesting a possible role of socio-economic status in decision-making around pacifier usage. We found that when pacifiers are used, mothers use them frequently throughout the day to help calm their baby, help their baby to sleep, or when their concentration is away from their baby (e.g. when driving or shopping). Mothers see pacifiers as useful when babies are asleep or trying to sleep, when there is nothing else to help their baby stop crying, and during moments of divided attention when caring for their infant alone, rather than using them indiscriminately. Indeed, these behaviors are consistent with the baby-friendly hospital recommendationsand research highlighting the benefits of non-nutritive sucking for the prevention of SIDS, calming, and aiding sleep. In contrast, pacifiers were least frequently used when the baby was outside of the home with family or friends, to prevent the baby sucking its thumb, or when the baby was awake and outside the home with strangers around.

Pacifier use was related to lower levels of parenting stress. Mothers who use pacifiers report less stress and more positive interactions with their child relative to pacifier non-users. Not surprisingly, mothers who use pacifiers also perceive their child as less difficult and displaying less negative affect compared to pacifier non-users. Reducing parenting stress and optimizing the parent-infant dynamic can have significant benefits to child outcomes. Research has shown that decreased parental stress during infancy is associated with improved child emotion regulation, social competence, and achievement at 4 years, and decreased disruptive behaviors at 5 years. More positive parent-infant interactions were also linked with better language production at 4 yearsand better academic achievement in middle school. Therefore, pacifiers may help support positive parenting practices that are known to have long-term benefits to the child across developmental domains.

### Effects of pacifier use on transition time from gavage to breastfeeding in preterm infants: a randomized controlled trial [^1147XEme]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nonnutritive sucking (NNS) has been identified as having many benefits for preterm infants. NNS may improve the efficacy of oral feeding, reduce the length of time spent in orogastric (OG) tube feeding, and shorten the length of hospital stays for preterm infants.

Aim

This study aimed to assess the effect of pacifiers on preterm infants in the transition from gavage to oral feeding, their time to discharge, weight gain, and time for transition to full breastfeeding.

Methods

A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted in our center. Ninety infants were randomized into two groups: a pacifier group (PG) (n = 45) and a control group (n = 45). Eligibility criteria included body weight less than or equal to 1,500g, gestational age (GA) younger than 32 weeks, tolerating at least 100 kcals/kg/day by OG feeding, growth parameters appropriate for GA, and a stable clinical condition.

Results

Mean GAs were 29.2 ± 1.86 versus 28.4 ± 1.84 weeks (p = 0.46), and birth weights were 1,188.2 ± 272 versus 1,112.8 ± 267g (p = 0.72) in the PG and CG groups, respectively. The time for transition to full oral feeding (38 ± 19.2 days), time to transition to full breastfeeding (38.1 ± 20 days), and time to discharge (48.4 ± 19.2 days) in the PG were significantly shorter compared with the control group (49.8 ± 23.6, 49.1 ± 22, 65.3 ± 30.6 days, respectively) (p < 0.05). For preterm infants with gastrointestinal motility disturbance, similar symptoms (regurgitation, vomiting, abdominal distension) (n = 6, 22%) in the PG were significantly lower than the control group (n = 21, 77.8%) (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

In this study, we determined that the method of giving pacifiers to preterm infants during gavage feeding reduced the infants' transition period to oral feeding and the duration of hospital stay. In addition, the pacifiers could be used during gavage feeding and in the transition from gavage to oral/breastfeeding in preterm infants to encourage the development of sucking ability.

### Sudden infant death syndrome prevention [^1166yURW]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings

Current evidence supports statistical associations between risk factors and SIDS, but there is globally limited evidence by controlled studies assessing the effect of the social promotion strategies to prevent SIDS through knowledge, attitude and practices, due to obvious ethical reasons.
A dramatic decline in SIDS incidence has been observed in many countries after the introduction of "Back to Sleep" campaigns for prevention of SIDS.
All infants should be placed to sleep in a safe environment including supine position, a firm surface, no soft objects and loose bedding, no head covering, no overheating, and room-sharing without bed-sharing.
Breastfeeding on demand and the use of pacifier during sleep time protect against SIDS and should be recommended.
Parents should be advised against the use of tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs during gestation and after birth.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations updated in 2016 are the most comprehensive resume about SIDS prevention.

### The who, when, and why of pacifier use [^116tQw2x]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Previous research tended to explore controversial aspects of pacifier use with little acknowledgement of the potential benefits. Here, we show that the long history of pacifier use in humans might be related to immediate benefits to the mother and infant. We found that mothers who use pacifiers report less negative affect in their infant, less stress as a parent, and more positive interactions with their infant relative to mothers who do not use pacifiers. These important aspects to the mother-infant relationship have long-term consequences for the healthy development of the child. It is important that health professionals are aware of these potential benefits and consider them when discussing pacifier use with parents.

### The who, when, and why of pacifier use [^114bFD4y]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study highlights potentially important benefits of pacifier use in early infancy, but those findings should be considered with a few caveats. Our sample included a large proportion of mothers who have or have not given their infant a pacifier. As a result, the psychological traits we assessed may reflect characteristics of mothers who chose to use pacifiers, rather than a direct outcome of using pacifiers. However, the broad disagreement with the statement ' pacifiers decrease parental satisfaction ' increases confidence that pacifiers reduce stress and improve mother-infant interactions rather than the other way around. The same argument can be made for the negative emotionality of the infants because causality cannot be established without assessing that trait before the introduction of the pacifier. The study is an online questionnaire conducted with an external market research company. While Pureprofile aims to recruit representative samples, our participants needed to have access to a computer or a mobile device and time to complete the survey. Therefore, our findings should be replicated using different recruitment methods and with different participant groups, ideally accounting for other factors such as socioeconomic status, family dynamics, or cultural differences in pacifier use and beliefs about pacifiers. Finally, the present study relies on maternal report for all the measures of both maternal and infant characteristics. Our focus was on parents' perceptions of pacifier use and so this limitation has less of an impact. However, behavioral assessments of mothers' and infants' emotional competence would provide more objective descriptions of these domains, shedding more light on the long-term consequences of pacifier use.

The debate surrounding whether or not to provide pacifiers to infants will likely continue. Importantly, research suggests a wide range of positive applications for pacifiers, but less is known about the impact of pacifiers on the long-term development of language, cognitive skills, emotion regulation, and parent-child relationships. Future research is needed to address these questions, highlighting the ages when pacifiers increase risk for developmental delays in these domains and providing better guidance for cessation of pacifier use.

### Predictors of and reasons for pacifier use in first-time mothers: an observational study [^114iwMnc]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

A third of mothers reported being advised to use a pacifier by a midwife or child health nurse. The questionnaire design did not allow for identification of whether women had received this advice from a hospital-based or community-based midwife or child health nurse. Based on the 'Ten steps to successful breastfeeding', Baby Friendly Health Initiative (BFHI) accredited hospitals discourage the use of artificial teats or pacifiers in breastfeeding mothers. Future research should distinguish between hospital-based and community-based workers in order to investigate further the association between the advice and BFHI accreditation. Nevertheless, ensuring the currency and quality of midwife and child health nurse advice is important.

This study confirmed the findings of numerous other studies that there is a negative association between pacifier use and breastfeeding duration, and more specifically, that the association is related to the time of introduction and frequency of use. Our results indicate that infants given a pacifier prior to four weeks of age and those using pacifiers most days had a three-fold risk of shorter breastfeeding duration, independent of maternal education and age. These results are similar to those of two Australian studies, supporting a stronger association between shorter breastfeeding duration and early pacifier introduction compared with later introduction. Previous research has also found similar results with regards to frequency of use.

### Risk factors for and protective factors against breastfeeding interruption before 2 years: a birth cohort study [^1175hEjx]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

There were a few studies examining the risk factors of breastfeeding interruptions before 2 years of child age. Each of these studies showed different risk factors for this outcome. This diversity of results is probably due to the different characteristics of the populations studied, the risk factors explored and the strong influence of socio-economic-cultural factors in the practice of breastfeeding. The present study differs from the previous ones regarding the representativeness of the sample, given that women were selected in all maternity wards in the city, with the exclusion of only a few mother-child pairs. Also, it explored risk factors never explored in those studies, like sleeping environment at the time of breastfeeding interruption. Compared to other two Brazilian studies, the present one was carried out in a region of the country (northeast) with social, economic and cultural characteristics very different from those in the south of the country, where the other Brazilian studies were carried out.

The present results confirm that risk factors differ across populations. Of the 23 variables assessed, five were identified as risk factors, and four as protective factors.

The risk factor with the most robust association with the outcome was use of a pacifier at the time of breastfeeding interruption. The risk of interrupting breastfeeding before 2 years was almost 3.5 times higher for children who used a pacifier. This association was found in two other Brazilian studies that investigated breastfeeding maintenance for 2 years or more. There are at least four arguments to explain this association, all of which may occur simultaneously: the use of a pacifier per se may reduce breastfeeding; use of a pacifier may indicate breastfeeding difficulties; it may be a reflection of the infant's personality and of mother-infant interaction patterns; and there could be a profile of mothers/families that support both non-use of a pacifier and longer breastfeeding duration. However, it is important to mention that there is no consensus in the literature regarding the recommendation to use or not to use a pacifier. Some investigators contraindicate the use of this artifact due to assumed adverse effects, e.g. reduction of breastfeeding duration and increased risk for otitis media, gastroenteritis masticatory dysfunction, and distoclusion. Conversely, other authors recommend their use, especially in an attempt to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.

### Sudden infant death syndrome prevention [^112jPBcf]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Existing evidence

With the aim to analyse preventive measures to reduce SIDS, factors that increase or decrease the risk of SIDS have been identified. However, the identification of statistical associations between risk factors and SIDS does not prove a causal link or mechanistic explanation. The different institutions developed their recommendations based on these statistical associations together with the assessment of other factors such as the balance between potential benefit from reducing the risk and any harm derived from the preventive strategy. Although the evidence exposed below show the association between identified risk factors and SIDS, there is limited evidence assessing the effect of the recommendations through knowledge, attitude, and practices, with the exception of the sleep position.

We mainly retrieved the evidence from the two supportive documents developed for the PrevInfad and AAP recommendations. Therefore, the references cited below were used in these documents and do not correspond with an additional literature review conducted by the authors of this summary document. As already indicated by the AAP, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with regard to SIDS and other sleep-related deaths. Evidence mainly derives from case-control studies and national pre and post intervention data. Currently, it is very unlikely that any clinical trial will be initiated to assess effectiveness of known risk factors due to obvious ethical reasons. The only Cochrane review identified aimed to assess the use of infant pacifiers for reduction of SIDS but no RCT addressing the topic was found. We summarize below the evidence supporting the recommendations addressing the most relevant or controversial risk factors.

### Pacifier use versus no pacifier use in breastfeeding term infants for increasing duration of breastfeeding [^111Tx41h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

To successfully initiate and maintain breastfeeding for a longer duration, the World Health Organization's Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding recommends total avoidance of artificial teats or pacifiers for breastfeeding infants. Offering the pacifier instead of the breast to calm the infant may lead to less frequent episodes of breastfeeding and as a consequence may reduce breast milk production and shorten duration of breastfeeding; however, this remains unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effect of pacifier use versus no pacifier use in healthy full-term newborns whose mothers have initiated breastfeeding and intend to exclusively breastfeed, on the duration of breastfeeding, other breastfeeding outcomes and infant health.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing pacifier use versus no pacifier use in healthy full-term newborns who have initiated breastfeeding regardless of whether they were born at home or in the hospital.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction.

Main Results

We found three trials (involving 1915 babies) for inclusion in the review but have included only two trials (involving 1302 healthy full-term breastfeeding infants) in the analysis. Meta-analysis of the two combined studies showed that pacifier use in healthy breastfeeding infants had no significant effect on the proportion of infants exclusively breastfed at three months (risk ratio (RR) 1.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.06), and at four months of age (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06) and also had no effect on the proportion of infants partially breastfed at three months (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.02), and at 4 months of age (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.03).

Authors' Conclusions

Pacifier use in healthy term breastfeeding infants, started from birth or after lactation is established, did not significantly affect the prevalence or duration of exclusive and partial breastfeeding up to four months of age. However, evidence to assess the short-term breastfeeding difficulties faced by mothers and long-term effect of pacifiers on infants' health is lacking.

### The who, when, and why of pacifier use [^111amra6]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pacifiers have accompanied humanity for more than 3000 years, as evidenced by excavations in Italy, Cyprus, and Greece. Pacifiers are now used across the world to soothe fussy or colicky babies, reduce the pain of teething, and promote restful sleep. Widespread popularity of pacifiers is reflected in empirical evidence documenting the benefits of non-nutritive sucking, including pain management in neonates, shorter duration of hospital stays, and greater readiness for bottle feeding in preterm infants. Despite these benefits, pacifier use remains a controversial parental practice. While pacifier use is recommended for preventing sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), it has also been linked with acute otitis media and other infections, – dental malocclusion, and excessive weight gain.

In addition to the mixed health consequences, the psychological consequences of pacifier use remain poorly understood. – Niedenthal and colleaguessuggest that the diurnal use of pacifiers in infancy decreases infants' spontaneous imitation of others' facial expressions (i.e. facial mimicry) as well as their empathy and emotional intelligence at later developmental stages. However, the correlational nature of this research makes it challenging to tease apart the causes and consequences of this parental practice. For example, pacifiers could be used by caregivers with children considered more difficult (i.e. children whose negative emotions are challenging to manage). Alternatively, seeing the pacifier in an infant's mouth could reduce the extent to which adults imitate the baby's facial expressions. This behavior is involved in the development of babies' own facial mimicry and emotional competence.

In addition to infant temperament, the characteristics of parents may also play a role in pacifier adoption. For example, stressed caregivers might be more inclined to introduce pacifiers. Moreover, existing research shows associations between pacifier use and maternal anxiety and rigid breastfeeding styles. Beyond these traits, little is known about the characteristics of parents giving pacifiers to their infants. Here we recruited a large sample of British parents to examine demographic profiles of pacifier users versus non-users. Among these groups, we compared the frequency and circumstances of pacifier use and relations between the use of pacifiers and parenting stress as well as infant temperament. We also examined beliefs about pacifiers among users and non-users.

### Effect of neonatal unit interventions designed to increase breastfeeding in preterm infants: an overview of systematic reviews [^116BJ2yg]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

Available meta-analyses in seven high-quality systematic reviews, suggest that the standalone interventions: avoidance of bottles during breastfeeding establishment, KMC (any), early-onset KMC, and cup feeding, and additionally, a QI bundle designed to support breastfeeding, can increase breastfeeding rates in preterm infants. It is unclear which are most effective, or what bundles are likely to work best (and in which setting or preterm infant populations). There is insufficient pooled evidence to establish impacts on breastfeeding rates among preterm infants of NNS, oral stimulation, and OPC. However, this does not mean these interventions are not of benefit.

Research Priorities

Updates of the meta-analyses assessing the effects of NNS, OPC, and oral stimulation on breastfeeding rates in preterm infants could be helpful. Systematic reviews with meta-analysis are required to determine the effectiveness of other well-endorsed strategies or promising interventions for which we did not identify any pooled effects, such as medications aimed at increasing milk supply, donor human milk, lactation consultant support, staff education, maternal education, early initiation of breastmilk expression, and use of pacifiers/dummies.

Future research on this topic should aim to stratify effects by GA and birthweight subgroups. Investigating the effects of standalone interventions to enable and sustain breastmilk feeds in preterm infants admitted to neonatal units and different types of intervention combinations (bundles) in different settings is important, as knowledge is required on key features of effective bundles and which interventions will work best in what settings.

### Predictors of and reasons for pacifier use in first-time mothers: an observational study [^115mu2qQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The use of pacifiers may be related to a variety of inter-related factors. For instance, younger, less educated mothers may be less aware of alternative methods of soothing infants, whereas older, better educated mothers may use 'attachment methods' of soothing such as carrying, rocking, swaddling, singing and massage and only use 'non-attachment methods' of soothing (i.e. pacifiers) as a last resort. A Dutch multicultural study demonstrated that less educated women were less likely to carry, rock or swaddle their infant and more likely to give their infant a pacifier or night bottle compared with more educated women. It may be that the concomitant use of alternative non-attachment soothing methods such as a night bottle may be a confounder not considered in this or other studies. While plausible mechanisms for how a pacifier may contribute to the early cessation of breastfeeding have been postulated it is possible that the use of a pacifier may simply be a marker of breastfeeding problems that result in the early cessation of breastfeeding rather than an independent cause of breastfeeding cessation. For instance, prolonged suckling at the breast may be an indicator that an infant's nutritional needs are not being met, perhaps due to poor feeding technique, and warrants investigation by a health care professional.

Studies have shown that an infant's grandmothers (both maternal and paternal) are a key influence on the way a first-time mother cares for her child and they have been shown to be influential with regards to a woman's decision to initiate and continue breastfeeding. They may be a source of both solicited and unsolicited advice, and in this study mothers and mothers-in-law were identified as a woman's primary source of advice regarding the use of a pacifier. Many of these grandmothers may not be aware of the negative association of pacifier use with breastfeeding duration and dental malocclusion, as much of this evidence has been published in the last 20 years or so. Interventions that aim to reduce the use of pacifiers should include opportunities for grandmothers to learn of the risks associated with early and frequent pacifier use. These may be in the form of print material specifically targeted at grandmothers and/or the opportunity to accompany their daughters/in-law to antenatal classes where feeding and pacifier use is discussed, to ensure that their knowledge aligns with current recommendations.

### When is the use of pacifiers justifiable in the baby-friendly hospital initiative context? A clinician's guide [^112vJJWh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Breastfeeding or the use of expressed human milk is an essential practice that should be protected and promoted to ensure the survival of newborn infants. The practice of breastfeeding has moved through different phases of popularity over the decades, but currently the evidence is overwhelmingly in support of it. Its importance should be highlighted and its practice should be supported by all healthcare professionals.

The drive towards best practice gave rise to initiatives such as the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, which includes Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. However, until recently this initiative did not provide for infants outside the healthy birth environment, such as high-risk, sick and immature infants separated from their mothers. In these circumstances additional support is required to achieve breastfeeding, and the literature strongly supports the use of pacifiers in justifiable situations to prevent delays in feeding development and to support infants in reaching maturity on different levels of development, such as feeding, motor organisation, neurobehaviour and self-regulation. Despite the evidence supporting the use of pacifiers, the practice encounters challenges because views vary on the matter. Furthermore, studies conducted vary in ages, feeding practices, deficits, and medical conditions in the cohorts of infants used which makes it difficult to draw definite conclusions regarding the safe use, duration and design of pacifiers in NICUs.

We have presented the argument that pacifier use is justifiable in specific conditions, such as immaturity and other medical situations and when the mother is not available. The benefits of using pacifiers are reported in the literature as supporting soothing in infants; enhancing maturation and protecting the suck reflex; and lowering the risk of SIDS. It is, however, essential to have guidelines available for clinicians to be able to assess the safety of a pacifier's design and to be able to apply general measures to ensure safety when using pacifiers, specifically in the NICU context and/or with infants with special needs. Finally, pacifiers have an 'expiry date' and use should be ceased after six months of age to prevent complications such as otitis media and dental malocclusions.

A pacifier is an aid that can be used during mother–infant separation and to support breastfeeding in a therapeutic manner. Pacifiers should only be used in justifiable situations and in collaboration with or under the supervision of a healthcare professional who is concerned about protecting breastfeeding.

### Is pacifier use a risk factor for acute otitis media? A dynamic cohort study [^116f5GSw]. Family Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, the use of a pacifier has been identified as a risk factor for acute otitis media (AOM). The studies performed so far, however, suffer from methodological limitations.

Objective

To study whether pacifier use increases the risk of AOM.

Methods

Four hundred and ninety-five children between the ages of 0 and 4 years followed from 2000 to 2005 in a dynamic population study in the Leidsche Rijn residential area in Utrecht, The Netherlands. At baseline, the parents of these children filled out a questionnaire regarding pacifier use and potential confounders. AOM was diagnosed by GPs according to the International Classification of Primary Care coding system. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

Results

Of the 216 children that used a pacifier at baseline, 76 (35%) developed at least one episode of AOM, and of the 260 children that did not use a pacifier, 82 (32%) developed at least one AOM episode; for recurrent AOM, these figures were 33 (16%) versus 27 (11%), respectively. The adjusted ORs for pacifier use and AOM and recurrent AOM were 1.3 (95% CI 0.9–1.9) and 1.9 (95% CI 1.1–3.2), respectively.

Conclusion

Pacifier use appears to be a risk factor for recurrent AOM. Parents should be informed about the possible negative effects of using a pacifier once their child has been diagnosed with AOM to avoid recurrent episodes.

### When is the use of pacifiers justifiable in the baby-friendly hospital initiative context? A clinician's guide [^111kM6Uu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Exclusive breastfeeding in newborn infants is well researched and agreed upon as an essential aspect of newborn care as is evident from guidelines by the World Health Organization (WHO). Sucking is an important milestone for every newborn infant to master to ensure exclusive breastfeeding after birth, and it also contributes to self-regulatory behaviour and bonding. Non-nutritive sucking (NNS), or sucking not for the purpose of feeding, is a precursor to nutritive sucking, and holds various physiological benefits including improved digestion, behavioural organisation, pain management, and prevention of aspiration. Furthermore, the American Academy of Pediatric (AAP) has published recommendations on the use of pacifiers in healthy infants associated with a reduction in the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Although these benefits have been documented, the use of pacifiers to support NNS is not welcomed in pro-breastfeeding contexts, such as hospitals holding or working towards obtaining Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) status, and consequently also not welcomed in neonatal intensive care environments.

### A randomized controlled trial of sucrose and / or pacifier as analgesia for infants receiving venipuncture in a pediatric emergency department [^1139Ur9p]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Although sucrose has been accepted as an effective analgesic agent for procedural pain in neonates, previous studies are largely in the NICU population using the procedure of heel lance. This is the first report of the effect of sucrose, pacifier or the combination thereof for the procedural pain of venipuncture in infants in the pediatric emergency department population.

Methods

The study design was a double (sucrose) and single blind (pacifier), placebo-controlled randomized trial – factorial design carried out in a pediatric emergency department. The study population was infants, aged 0–6 months. Eighty-four patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups: a) sucrose b) sucrose & pacifier c) control d) control & pacifier. Each child received 2 mL of either 44% sucrose or sterile water, by mouth. The primary outcome measure: FLACC pain scale score change from baseline. Secondary outcome measures: crying time and heart rate change from baseline.

Results

Sucrose did not significantly reduce the FLACC score, crying time or heart rate. However sub-group analysis revealed that sucrose had a much greater effect in the younger groups. Pacifier use reduced FLACC score (not statistically significant), crying times (statistically significant) but not heart rate. Subgroup analysis revealed a mean crying time difference of 76.52 seconds (p < 0.0171) (0–1 month) and 123.9 seconds (p < 0.0029) (1–3 month). For subgroup age > 3 months pacifier did not have any significant effect on crying time. Age adjusted regression analysis revealed that both sucrose and pacifier had significant effects on crying time. Crying time increased with both increasing age and increasing gestational age.

Conclusion

Pacifiers are inexpensive, effective analgesics and are easy to use in the PED for venipuncture in infants aged 0–3 months. The benefits of sucrose alone as an analgesic require further investigation in the older infant, but sucrose does appear to provide additional benefit when used with a pacifier in this age group.

### Impact of a baby-friendly-aligned pacifier policy on pacifier use at 1 month of age [^114BMCeq]. Academic Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pacifier use decreases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, but its impact on breastfeeding remains controversial. We evaluated the impact of a pacifier policy aligned with the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative on subsequent pacifier use and breastfeeding at 1 month of age.

Methods

We conducted a prospective 2-stage (pre- and post-implementation) cohort study of newborns at a birth hospital before and after implementation of a Baby-Friendly-aligned pacifier policy. Consecutive mothers of newborns admitted to the nursery participated in a telephone survey when the infants were 1 month of age.

Results

In total, 342 mothers participated (190 before and 152 after implementation of the policy). Pacifier adoption was delayed in the post-implementation group, but pacifier use by 1 month of age was comparable (78.9% pre-implementation vs 77.6% post-implementation; p = 0.793). In the pre-implementation group, female and male infants used pacifiers at comparable rates; however, in the post-implementation group, females were significantly less likely to use a pacifier compared to males after controlling for insurance, race, parity, and delivery mode (adjusted odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.15–0.83; p = 0.02). In the post-implementation group, exclusive breastfeeding rates at discharge increased significantly (from 40% to 51.3%; p = 0.04), but rates were not different at 1 month (23.7% pre-implementation vs 24.3% post-implementation; p = 0.89).

Conclusion

A Baby-Friendly-aligned pacifier policy delayed pacifier adoption but did not impact overall pacifier use or breastfeeding rates at 1 month of age. The finding of lower pacifier use rates among female infants post-intervention requires verification in other populations before evaluating public heath relevance.

Consider offering a pacifier at naptime and bedtime

Recommendations

"Not rejecting the use of a pacifier during sleeping time in the first year of life seems to be a cautious measure". (Grade B recommendation).

"Consider offering a pacifier at naptime and bedtime" (Grade A recommendation).

"Offer a pacifier to the infant when put to sleep in supine position, and do not reinsert it once the infant is asleep. If the infant refuses the pacifier, do not force him or her to use it".

"For breastfed infants, pacifier introduction should be delayed until breastfeeding is firmly established" or until the infant is 1 month of age.

Evidence

Although the mechanism is unclear, the use of pacifier during the sleep has a protective effect on SIDS. A Cochrane review was published in 2017, after the development of both the PrevInfad and the AAP recommendations. The aim of this review was to evaluate the use of infant pacifiers versus no pacifiers during sleep in reducing the risk of SIDS. However, the review authors found no randomized controlled trials addressing this topic.

Recommendations are mainly based on findings from another systematic review that was conducted by Hauck et al. and included case control studies published between 1993 and 2004. A protector effect of pacifier was shown for usual pacifier use (AOR 0.71 [95% CI 0.59 to 0.85]; 4 studies) and for use of pacifier in the last sleep (AOR 0.39 [95% CI 0.31 to 0.50]; 7 studies). Authors also estimated the number needed to treat as 2733 (95% CI 2416 to 3334), meaning that one SIDS death could be prevented for every 2733 infants using a pacifier during the sleep.

Pacifier can be introduced as soon as desired after birth in not breastfed infants, but it is recommended to delay its introduction in breastfed infants until breastfeeding is well established. There is however a lack of evidence to confirm the belief that the use of pacifier interferes with breastfeeding.

Immediate postpartum — supplementation and pacifiers: Supplemental feeding should not be given to breastfed infants unless there is a medical indication, and there is no role for the routine supplementation of non-dehydrated infants with water to prevent hyperbilirubinemia; before any supplementary feedings are begun, it is important that a formal evaluation of each mother–baby dyad, including a direct observation of the breastfeeding, be completed by a provider trained in lactation; pacifiers in the neonatal period should be used with caution, and a recent Cochrane review found that pacifier use in healthy term breastfeeding infants, started at birth or after lactation was established, did not significantly affect the prevalence or duration of exclusive and partial breastfeeding up to 4 months of age.

### Influence of pacifier use on the association between duration of breastfeeding and anterior open bite in primary dentition [^1155Bw88]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The literature is controversial with regard to the association between longer breastfeeding duration and lower prevalence of anterior open bite. Pacifier use may be involved in this controversy. Thus, the objective of the study was to assess the influence of pacifier use and its duration on the association between longer breastfeeding duration and lower prevalence of anterior open bite in children with primary dentition.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study nested in a cohort study involving 153 infants recruited at a maternity hospital in the municipality of Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. The study outcome (anterior open bite) was assessed when the children were between 3 and 5 years old. Data on breastfeeding and pacifier use were collected at 7, 30, 60, 120, and 180 days of life and on the date of the evaluation here described. Poisson regression with robust variance was used to analyze the association between the prevalence of anterior open bite and breastfeeding duration, expressed in months.

Results

The univariate analysis showed a protective effect of breastfeeding against anterior open bite (prevalence ratio [PR] 0.96; 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.95–0.98). This effect remained significant after adjustment for pacifier use at any time between birth and the date of dental assessment (PR0.98; 95%CI; 0.96–0.99), i.e. there was a reduction of 2% in the prevalence of anterior open bite for each month of breastfeeding. However, this effect lost significance when pacifier use duration was included in the multivariate analysis (PR1.00; 95%CI; 0.99–1.01).

Conclusions

Pacifier use duration influences the association between longer breastfeeding duration and lower prevalence of anterior open bite. It is likely that prolonged pacifier use reduces the magnitude of this association.

### Sudden infant death syndrome prevention [^113Jc1aP]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

We looked at existing recommendations and supporting evidence for successful strategies to prevent the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

We conducted a literature search up to the 14th of December 2020 by using key terms and manual search in selected sources. We summarized the recommendations and the strength of the recommendation when and as reported by the authors. We summarized the main findings of systematic reviews with the certainty of the evidence as reported.

Current evidence supports statistical associations between risk factors and SIDS, but there is globally limited evidence by controlled studies assessing the effect of the social promotion strategies to prevent SIDS through knowledge, attitude and practices, due to obvious ethical reasons. A dramatic decline in SIDS incidence has been observed in many countries after the introduction of "Back to Sleep" campaigns for prevention of SIDS. All infants should be placed to sleep in a safe environment including supine position, a firm surface, no soft objects and loose bedding, no head covering, no overheating, and room-sharing without bed-sharing. Breastfeeding on demand and the use of pacifier during sleep time protect against SIDS and should be recommended. Parents should be advised against the use of tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs during gestation and after birth.

### When is the use of pacifiers justifiable in the baby-friendly hospital initiative context? A clinician's guide [^115ofTdN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

General recommendations for safe pacifier use

General recommendations for determining the appropriateness of pacifier use for healthy and preterm infants include determining their individual feeding programme by qualified health professionals. Parents and caregivers should routinely be counselled by such professionals about safe and appropriate pacifier use, and information given to parents should include justifiable reasons for pacifier use in hospital, as well as alternative ways of soothing the infant, such as using the mother's emptied breast, and recommendations to minimize pacifier use.

Delayed introduction and limited use

The introduction of a pacifier in full term infants should be delayed until one month of age to ensure the establishment of breastfeeding, and thereafter its use should be limited to the soothing of a breast-fed infant. It is therefore important for parents to be able to differentiate between a hungry baby, who will continue crying when the pacifier is removed from the mouth, and an infant who needs comforting through sucking. Pacifiers should never be used to replace or delay meals with full term infants, and should be offered only when the caregiver is certain that the child is not hungry.

Combined use

Pacifiers in combination with the mother's voice through using a pacifier-activated music player during NNS has shown some benefits in oral feeding skills in preterm infants and may be used, specifically in the NICU when the mother cannot use her breast as a pacifier.

Pacifiers should not be coated in any sweet solution except when the pacifier and sucrose solution are used simultaneously for the purpose of pain management, for example in minor procedures in which glucose and pacifiers was found analgesic for preterm infants. This sweet solution should preferably be mother's own milk.

Sleep

The pacifier should be used when putting the infant down for sleep and it should not be reinserted after the infant falls asleep. Parents and caregivers should be advised to exercise judgement and to restrain pacifier use. They should be taught to avoid ad lib use throughout the day.

Furthermore, in all cases, the health care professionals should recognize the use of a pacifier as a parental choice, which is determined by the needs of their infant.

Conclusions

This study confirms the findings of earlier studies that the use of a pacifier is widespread in Australia and that the early introduction, and frequent use, of a pacifier is associated with shorter breastfeeding duration. Furthermore, it identifies an opportunity for educating new mothers and their support network, particularly grandmothers, with regards to potential risks associated with the early and frequent use of a pacifier, and alternative methods for soothing their infant, in order to reduce the use of pacifiers and the potentially negative effect associated with their use on breastfeeding duration.

### Risks and benefits of pacifiers [^117Jz23W]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Physicians are often asked for guidance about pacifier use in children, especially regarding the benefits and risks, and when to appropriately wean a child. The benefits of pacifier use include analgesic effects, shorter hospital stays for preterm infants, and a reduction in the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Pacifiers have been studied and recommended for pain relief in newborns and infants undergoing common, minor procedures in the emergency department (e.g., heel sticks, immunizations, venipuncture). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents consider offering pacifiers to infants one month and older at the onset of sleep to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Potential complications of pacifier use, particularly with prolonged use, include a negative effect on breastfeeding, dental malocclusion, and otitis media. Adverse dental effects can be evident after two years of age, but mainly after four years. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends that mothers be educated about pacifier use in the immediate postpartum period to avoid difficulties with breastfeeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommend weaning children from pacifiers in the second six months of life to prevent otitis media. Pacifier use should not be actively discouraged and may be especially beneficial in the first six months of life.

### Predictors of and reasons for pacifier use in first-time mothers: an observational study [^115SWKhB]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Pacifier use

In total 79% of infants (n = 532) had ever used a pacifier, and 69% of infants (n = 464) were currently using a pacifier at baseline, while 10% of mothers had tried but were no longer giving a pacifier to their infant. The median age at which a pacifier was introduced was 2 weeks (IQR 0.6–4 weeks) and two thirds of infants (n = 353) were given a pacifier prior to 4 weeks of age. Of those infants currently using a pacifier, 85.1% (n = 395) were using it most days and 14.9% less often. The frequency of pacifier use was not associated with the age at which it was first given (χ² = 3.43, P = 0.18). Mothers with a high school education, compared with a university education, were more likely to give their infant a pacifier (OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.17–3.81) and mothers born outside Australia were less likely to use pacifiers (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.39–0.93) (Table 2). The relationship with mother's highest education level and country of birth remained significant (adjOR 1.95; 95% CI 1.08–3.53 and adjOR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40–0.95, respectively) after adjustment for potential confounders.

### Effects of pacifier and taste on swallowing, esophageal motility, transit, and respiratory rhythm in human neonates [^117EL8AS]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pacifier use is widely prevalent globally despite hygienic concerns and uncertain mechanistic effects on swallowing or airway safety.

Aims

The effects of pacifier and taste interventions on pharyngo-esophageal motility, bolus transit, and respiratory rhythms were investigated by determining the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), esophageal body, esophagogastric junction (EGJ) motor patterns and deglutition apnea, respiratory rhythm disturbances, and esophageal bolus clearance.

Methods

Fifteen infants (six males; median gestation 31 weeks and birth weight 1.4 kg) underwent high-resolution impedance manometry at 43 (41–44) weeks postmenstrual age. Manometric, respiratory, and impedance characteristics of spontaneous swallows, pacifier-associated dry swallowing and taste (pacifier dipped in 3% sucrose)-associated swallowing were analyzed. Linear mixed and generalized estimating equation models were used. Data are presented as mean ± SEM, %, or median (IQR).

Key Results

Pharyngo-esophageal motility, respiratory, and impedance characteristics of 209 swallows were analyzed (85 spontaneous swallows, 63 pacifier- swallows, 61 taste- swallows). Basal UES and EGJ pressures decreased upon pacifier (p < 0.05) and taste interventions (p < 0.05); however, esophageal motility, respiratory rhythm, and impedance transit characteristics were similar with both interventions.

Conclusions & Inferences

Oral stimulus with pacifier or taste interventions decreases UES and EGJ basal pressure, but has no effects on pharyngo-esophageal motility, airway interactions, or esophageal bolus transit. A decrease in central parasympathetic-cholinergic excitatory drive is likely responsible for the basal effects.

Based on strong research evidence: All infants should be placed in the supine position for every sleep. Tobacco exposure pre- and postnatally should be avoided. Room sharing without bed sharing is recommended. It is recommended that blankets, pillows, and other soft bedding be removed from the infant sleep area. Overheating should be avoided.

### Comparison of the effect of two methods of sucking on pacifier and mother's finger on oral feeding behavior in preterm infants: a randomized clinical trial [^111GxTnD]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The advancement of technology has increased the possibility of surviving preterm infants with a very low gestational age. Most preterm infants are born before the development of the cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous and muscular systems, which is why a significant number of them have serious problems with oral feeding. Feeding and swallowing problems are the obvious and prevalent medical and behavioral factors that preterm infants and their families face in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Infant feeding consists of three basic components: sucking, swallowing, and breathing. Unlike full-term infants, most preterm infants cannot be bottle-fed or breastfed immediately after birth. This is due to weak muscle tone, lack of development of mechanisms to control oral movements, and a lack of coordination in sucking, swallowing, and breathing. Also, the cardiorespiratory system, central nervous system, and oral muscles of preterm infants have not developed. Oral feeding problems often affect the infant's ability to achieve independent oral feeding, prolong hospitalization, and may lead to long-term feeding problems. Successful feeding of infants not only plays an important role in their survival but also in improving the infant's communication and speech skills. Since the primary feeding behaviors such as sucking and swallowing are prerequisites for secondary behaviors (e.g.; speech), any disorder in these behaviors will have a direct impact on the future development of the infant's speech communication skills. Breastfeeding is a challenge for neonatal nurses trying to prepare preterm infants for discharge from the hospital. Because oral feeding problems cause prolonged hospitalization of preterm infants in the hospital and are costly, evidence-based interventions are needed to facilitate the development of oral motor skills, improve sucking and feeding behaviors in 30 weeks or younger infants, and reduce the length of hospitalization and costs. Sensory and motor interventions are used to increase the efficiency of oral feeding in preterm infants. Various intervention techniques have been used to facilitate oral feeding in preterm infants, the most common of which are: sensory and motor interventions including cheek and chin support, oral stimulation, tactile-kinesthetic and vestibular stimulation. The beneficial effects of non-nutritive sucking (NNS) and oral stimulation on nutritional efficiency include the coordination of suck-swallow-breathe, the development of the sucking reflex, increased weight gain and reduced time for a transmission from gavage to full oral feeding. Oral stimulation has been reported to lead to weight gain and a decrease in hospitalization and an increase in received milk volume. Younesian et al. noted that due to the combined use of the two methods, it is not clear whether NNS or oral massage is more effective. In studies conducted by Say et al. and Mohammadi PirKashani et al. these two methods have been presented separately and have not been compared with each other. It is not clear which method is better and more suitable for clinical use. This study is important because it will (1) assist healthcare providers in clarifying policy related to implementing treatment for preterm infants in appropriate clinical settings and (2) assist in promoting evidence-based practice in the treatment of preterm infants. If these interventions are found to be effective, they could become a routine and standard part of delivery of care to preterm infants in NICU settings, facilitating earlier discharge and reducing costs of care associated with long hospital stay.

### Sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2022 recommendations for reducing infant deaths in the sleep environment [^1152Lrdr]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for sudden infant death syndrome, more specifically with respect to pacifier, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to advise delaying pacifier introduction until breastfeeding is firmly established (defined as having sufficient milk supply, a consistent, comfortable, and effective latch for milk transfer, and appropriate infant weight gain as defined by established normative growth curves) in breastfed infants. Recognize that the time required to establish breastfeeding is variable.

### Predictors of and reasons for pacifier use in first-time mothers: an observational study [^111b8mxG]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Data analysis

All data were double-entered into a Microsoft Access database, and then imported into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 17.0). Study participants were compared with non-participants using independent samples T-Tests for maternal age at infant's birth, and Chi-square tests for independence for relationship status at infant's birth, highest level of education attained, country of birth and initial feeding intention. Non-participants were those mothers who declined further contact at the first approach but consented to provide basic demographic data, and those who subsequently declined, or could not be recontacted for, full enrolment. Descriptive statistics were used to present data on variables related to pacifier use.

Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were used to investigate pacifier use in relation to mother's age and relationship status at infant's birth, highest level of education, country of birth, and infant's gender. Infants were defined as pacifier 'users' or 'non-users' (dependent variable) based on whether or not the infant had ever used a pacifier, regardless of current use. Bivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for breastfeeding duration by age pacifier given and extent of pacifier use, maternal age, level of education, relationship status and infant gender. Breastfeeding duration refers to the duration of time that a mother breastfed to any extent and was measured in weeks. To account for those still breastfeeding at baseline, a censoring factor was applied. Two multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to determine if age pacifier given (model one) and the extent of pacifier use (model two) were independently associated with breastfeeding duration adjusting for potential confounding factors demonstrating a significant association with breastfeeding duration in the bivariate analyses. Survival analyses (Life Tables) plots were used to illustrate the effect of age at pacifier introduction and the extent of pacifier use on breastfeeding duration. Pairwise comparisons were made in order to determine if there were significant differences between survival curves. Significance for all analyses was set at a P-value of 0.05 or less.

### Randomized clinical trial of pacifier use and bottle-feeding or cupfeeding and their effect on breastfeeding [^1162mUDy]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To enhance breastfeeding practices, the World Health Organization discourages pacifiers and bottle-feeding. However, the effect of artificial nipples on breastfeeding duration is poorly defined. The effects of 2 types of artificial nipple exposure on breastfeeding duration were evaluated: 1) cupfeeding versus bottle-feeding for the provision of in-hospital supplements and 2) early (2–5 days) versus late (> 4 weeks) pacifier introduction.

Methods

A total of 700 breastfed newborns (36–42 weeks, birth weight ≥ 2200 g) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 intervention groups: bottle/early pacifier (n = 169), bottle/late pacifier (n = 167), cup/early pacifier (n = 185), or cup/late pacifier (n = 179). The cup/bottle intervention was invoked for infants who received supplemental feedings: cup (n = 251), bottle (n = 230). Data were collected at delivery and at 2, 5, 10, 16, 24, 38, and 52 weeks' postpartum. Intervention effects on breastfeeding duration were evaluated with logistic regression and survival analyses.

Results

Supplemental feedings, regardless of method (cup or bottle), had a detrimental effect on breastfeeding duration. There were no differences in cup versus bottle groups for breastfeeding duration. Effects were modified by the number of supplements; exclusive and full breastfeeding duration were prolonged in cup-fed infants given > 2 supplements. Among infants delivered by cesarean, cupfeeding significantly prolonged exclusive, full, and overall breastfeeding duration. Exclusive breastfeeding at 4 weeks was less likely among infants exposed to pacifiers (early pacifier group; odds ratio: 1.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.0–2.0). Early, as compared with late, pacifier use shortened overall duration (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.22; 95% confidence interval: 1.03–1.44) but did not affect exclusive or full duration.

Conclusions

There was no advantage to cupfeeding for providing supplements to the general population of healthy breastfed infants, but it may have benefitted mother-infant dyads who required multiple supplements or were delivered by cesarean. Pacifier use in the neonatal period was detrimental to exclusive and overall breastfeeding. These findings support recommendations to avoid exposing breastfed infants to artificial nipples in the neonatal period.

### When is the use of pacifiers justifiable in the baby-friendly hospital initiative context? A clinician's guide [^114V3Lwz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

To clarify the current points of departure and opinions regarding the use of pacifiers in ill and healthy infants, and to provide evidence supporting the use or non-use of pacifiers in cases of mother–infant separation, we present literature to support informed, clinical decision-making on the appropriate use of pacifiers in various situations. We discuss the literature dealing with the development of sucking during the fetal period; background to the BFHI; and the expansion of the Ten Steps as presented by Nyqvist et al. We also discuss the value of NNS and presumed risks associated with pacifier use, and we conclude with recommendations for pacifier use as presented by Sexton and Natale and the AAP. Our paper adds to the knowledge base by providing arguments and evidence that allow clinicians to make informed decisions on appropriate circumstances for the use of pacifiers, and by outlining a scientific and evidence-based clinical guide for pacifier use.

### A randomized controlled trial of sucrose and / or pacifier as analgesia for infants receiving venipuncture in a pediatric emergency department [^114iR3JN]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

For sucrose as analgesia, the results are less clear. T-test results demonstrated no significant benefit; however age adjusted regression analysis showed significant reduction in crying time. Trends seem to show greater reduction in the younger age sub-groups. Sucrose appears to be less effective with increasing age at the dosage studied. Further study with larger sample sizes and perhaps using stronger concentrations of sucrose would be required to determine the upper age limit for the effectiveness of sucrose. It seems that sucrose and pacifier have an additive beneficial effect when used together and perhaps this is where the best use for sucrose as analgesia lies- to be used in conjunction with pacifier.

One must consider the dose of sucrose used. We chose 0.88 g (2 mL of a 44% solution) as this was easily prepared by our pharmacy, which uses an 88% sucrose solution to mix oral pediatric medications, and diluted this solution for the purposes of our study. Doses up to 0.5 g have been studied and determined to be safe for use in the neonatal period and immunization studies have used doses as high as 2.5 g for older infants without adverse events. Future studies could look closely at the issue of optimal doses, especially with older infants.

There are several limitations to our study. One limitation to our study was that the study population was a convenience sample of patients and a few potentially eligible patients were not enrolled. The research nurses were available for 8–16 hours during the day so some children arriving overnight may have been missed. It is unlikely, however that these children would have been different from our study population.

Another limitation of this study was that despite accurate randomization, our randomization produced somewhat of an "unlucky sample" in that there were imbalances in some of the baseline statistics particularly age, NPO, and rate admitted. NPO was found in our adjusted analyses to not have an effect on our outcomes, while admission rates were not too unbalanced, and would be unlikely to have an effect on our final outcomes. Due to our determination in the adjusted analysis that, older children tend to experience more pain, the lower age in the pacifier/placebo group could lead to slight overestimation of pain relief in pacifiers and an underestimation of pain relief in the sucrose. These results may need to be interpreted with caution.

### Predictors of and reasons for pacifier use in first-time mothers: an observational study [^1169ysjz]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The use of pacifiers is commonplace in Australia and has been shown to be negatively associated with breastfeeding duration. In order to influence behaviour related to the use of pacifiers it is important to understand the reasons for their use. The primary aim of this observational study was to investigate who (if anyone) advises first-time mothers to give a pacifier and the reasons for which they first give (or try to give) a pacifier to their infant. Additionally, this study investigated the predictors of pacifier use and the relationship between pacifier use and breastfeeding duration.

Methods

In total, 670 Australian first-time mothers recruited as part of the NOURISH trial completed a questionnaire regarding infant feeding and pacifier use.

Results

Pacifiers were introduced by 79% of mothers, of whom 28.7% were advised to use a pacifier by their mother/mother-in-law with a further 22.7% being advised by a midwife. The majority of mothers used a pacifier in order to soothe their infant (78.3%), to help put them to sleep (57.4%) and to keep them comforted and quiet (40.4%). Pacifiers given to infants before four weeks (adjHR 3.67; 95%CI 2.14–6.28) and used most days (adjHR 3.28; 95%CI 1.92–5.61) were significantly associated with shorter duration of breastfeeding.

Conclusions

This study identifies an opportunity for educating new mothers and their support network, particularly their infant's grandmothers, with regards to potential risks associated with the early and frequent use of a pacifier, and alternative methods for soothing their infant, in order to reduce the use of pacifiers and their potentially negative effect on breastfeeding duration.

### Approach to the patient… [^111ppZBx]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

DENTAL HEALTH A systematic review found inconsistent results regarding the effect of pacifier use on early childhood caries, suggesting that there is no proven correlation. INFECTION Several studies have shown that pacifiers are often colonized with Candida and bacterial organisms. 35–37 One study found 21 of 40 pacifiers to have a positive culture finding, with none containing the common pathogens of otitis media. 38 Latex pacifiers are more significantly colonized with Candida and Staphylococcus than silicone pacifiers. 36, 39. OTITIS MEDIA There are two proposed mechanisms for how pacifier use could cause otitis media: reflux of nasopharyngeal secretions into the middle ear from sucking, and eustachian tube dysfunction from altered dental structure. 42 A meta-analysis, including 22 studies from various countries, showed that pacifier use increased the risk of developing otitis media, with a risk ratio of 1.
24.

43 Infants in day care outside the home had an RR of
2. 45, those in family day care had an RR of 1. 59, and those with a parent who smoked had an RR of 1.
66. Breastfeeding reduced the risk of otitis media, with an RR of 0.
87. One widely cited, open, controlled cohort study of more than 400 patients evaluated the incidence of otitis media in infants whose parents were counseled to restrict pacifier use to when the infant was falling asleep. This counseling reduced continuous pacifier use by 21 percent and led to 29 percent fewer episodes of otitis media in the intervention group. 3 A more recent prospective cohort study from the Netherlands found that 35 percent of 216 children using pacifiers and 32 percent of 260 children in the control group developed at least one episode of otitis media.

42 However, rates of recurrent otitis media were higher in the pacifier group, leading the authors to conclude that pacifier use may increase the risk of recurrent otitis media. AAFP/AAP joint guidelines on otitis media, which are based on evidence from cohort studies, recommend that physicians advocate for little to no use of pacifiers in the second six months of life to prevent otitis media. 8 The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement makes a similar recommendation, but suggests avoiding use by 10 months of age. 9.

### Infant pacifiers for reduction in risk of sudden infant death syndrome [^115DUf2c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been most recently defined as the sudden unexpected death of an infant less than one year of age, with onset of the fatal episode apparently occurring during sleep, that remains unexplained after a thorough investigation, including the performance of a complete autopsy and a review of the circumstances of death and clinical history. Despite the success of several prevention campaigns, SIDS remains a leading cause of infant mortality. In 1994, a 'triple risk model' for SIDS was proposed that described SIDS as an event that results from the intersection of three factors: a vulnerable infant; a critical development period in homeostatic control (age related); and an exogenous stressor. The association between pacifier (dummy) use and reduced incidence of SIDS has been shown in epidemiological studies since the early 1990s. Pacifier use, given its low cost, might be a cost-effective intervention for SIDS prevention if it is confirmed effective in randomised controlled trials.

Objectives

To determine whether the use of pacifiers during sleep versus no pacifier during sleep reduces the risk of SIDS.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL to 16 March 2016. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.

Selection Criteria

Published and unpublished controlled trials using random and quasi-random allocations of infants born at term and at preterm (less than 37 weeks' gestation) or with low birth weight (< 2500 g). Infants must have been randomised by one month' postmenstrual age. We planned to include studies reported only by abstracts, and cluster and cross-over randomised trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed studies from searches. We found no eligible studies.

Main Results

We identified no randomised controlled trials examining infant pacifiers for reduction in risk of SIDS.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no randomised control trial evidence on which to support or refute the use of pacifiers for the prevention of SIDS.

### Infant pacifier sanitization and risk of challenge-proven food allergy: a cohort study [^116DjgHq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Environmental microbial exposure plays a role in immune system development and susceptibility to food allergy.

Objective

We sought to investigate whether infant pacifier use during the first postnatal year, with further consideration of sanitization, alters the risk of food allergy by age 1 year.

Methods

The birth cohort recruited pregnant mothers at under 28 weeks' gestation in southeast Australia, with 894 families followed up when infants turned 1 year. Infants were excluded if born under 32 weeks, with a serious illness, major congenital malformation, or genetic disease. Questionnaire data, collected at recruitment and infant ages 1, 6, and 12 months, included pacifier use and pacifier sanitization (defined as the joint exposure of a pacifier and cleaning methods). Challenge-proven food allergy was assessed at 12 months.

Results

Any pacifier use at 6 months was associated with food allergy (adjusted odds ratio, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.04–3.61), but not pacifier use at other ages. This overall association was driven by the joint exposure of pacifier-antiseptic use (adjusted odds ratio, 4.83; 95% CI, 1.10–21.18) compared with no pacifier use. Using pacifiers without antiseptic at 6 months was not associated with food allergy. Among pacifier users, antiseptic cleaning was still associated with food allergy (adjusted odds ratio, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.18–10.77) compared with no antiseptic use. Furthermore, persistent and repeated antiseptic use over the first 6 months was associated with higher food allergy risk (P = 0.029).

Conclusions

This is the first report of a pacifier-antiseptic combination being associated with a higher risk of subsequent food allergy. Future work should investigate underlying biological pathways.

### Predictors of and reasons for pacifier use in first-time mothers: an observational study [^116YsLDV]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Pacifier use and breastfeeding duration

After adjusting for mother's highest level of education, mother's age at delivery and relationship status in the Cox regression analyses, mothers who gave (or tried to give) their infant a pacifier prior to 4 weeks of age were more likely to have discontinued breastfeeding (adjHR 3.67; 95% CI 2.14–6.28) than mothers who had never given their infant a pacifier. Similarly, in a second adjusted model use of a pacifier on most days was significantly associated with shorter duration of breastfeeding (adjHR 3.28; 95% CI 1.92–5.61) compared with never having used a pacifier. Survival curves for overall breastfeeding duration by age of introduction of pacifier and extent of pacifier use are displayed in Figures 2 and 3.

### ABM clinical protocol # 7: model maternity policy supportive of breastfeeding [^1113MWgL]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #7 — pacifiers and artificial nipples — states that pacifiers, artificial nipples, or teats will not routinely be used nor routinely offered to healthy‑term breastfeeding infants; if a mother requests a bottle or teat, staff will explore reasons, address concerns, and educate on risks (with emphasis on sucking), and breastfeeding will be assessed to rule out difficulties; staff will not routinely give pacifiers to breastfeeding infants, and when requested, staff will explore reasons, address concerns, educate on potential problems, and document the education.

### Recommendations for sudden infant death syndrome prevention: a discussion document [^117NdJHv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

This article reviews the evidence for the current UK Department of Health recommendations for prevention of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and suggests other factors that should be considered. The wording of the Department of Health recommendations for SIDS prevention has changed over the past 6 years, but the specific recommendations are largely consistent with the scientific evidence. The emphasis on thermal and illness factors and immunisation could be reduced. Bed sharing and sharing the parental bedroom should be given more emphasis. Two major recommendations need to be discussed in greater detail: (1) breast feeding and (2) pacifier use. Meta-analyses or reviews looking at each risk factor or a combination of risk factors are required. Further, it is recommended that a committee is established that reviews the recommendations and publishes the evidence that leads to these recommendations, as is done by the American Academy of Pediatrics Taskforce on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

### When is the use of pacifiers justifiable in the baby-friendly hospital initiative context? A clinician's guide [^112DBXGX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Presumed risks associated with pacifier use

Resistance to the use of pacifiers according to the Original Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (as outlined in Table 1, Step 9) in a breastfeeding supportive context is based on presumed risk factors for which, however, little supporting evidence can be found, and whose relevance to the young infant population has not been established.

Potential risks of pacifier use were highlighted in Sexton and Natale's review for different age groups. For example, in the full term and older infant up to six months, early breast weaning can be a complication of pacifier use and, when the use of pacifiers is prolonged, risks include otitis media (six months to two years) and dental malocclusion, for example, misalignment of the teeth such as open bite, cross bite or over jet (two years and older). Castilho and Rocha suggest that the use of pacifiers may cause suffocation, poisoning, or allergies, and increase the risk of caries, infections, and intestinal parasitic diseases. Pacifier use was said to cause nipple confusion in breastfeeding infants, however no physical evidence validating such a confusion could be found in the literature, and infants seem to be able to differentiate between nutritive and non-nutritive sucking. Although one large randomized controlled trial including 700 breastfed newborns found that pacifier use shortened breastfeeding duration, it did not affect exclusive or full duration of breastfeeding. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that pacifier use is a marker of breastfeeding difficulties or reduced motivation to breastfeed, rather than the cause of early weaning.

Use of a pacifier should be restricted for infants with chronic or recurrent otitis media. Rovers et al explain that the pacifier induces reflux of nasopharyngeal secretions into the middle ear, which may in turn increase susceptibility to acute otitis media. The first middle ear infection causes damage to the mucosa of the middle ear, thereby predisposing the infant to further infection. Sexton and Natale therefore recommend the use of pacifiers only for the first six months and thereafter weaning is recommended in order to avoid the general risks as outlined in this section.

### Interventions for the cessation of non-nutritive sucking habits in children [^115QU916]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Comforting behaviours, such as the use of pacifiers (dummies, soothers), blankets and finger or thumb sucking, are common in babies and young children. These comforting habits, which can be referred to collectively as 'non-nutritive sucking habits' (NNSHs), tend to stop as children get older, under their own impetus or with support from parents and carers. However, if the habit continues whilst the permanent dentition is becoming established, it can contribute to, or cause, development of a malocclusion (abnormal bite). A diverse variety of approaches has been used to help children with stopping a NNSH. These include advice, removal of the comforting object, fitting an orthodontic appliance to interfere with the habit, application of an aversive taste to the digit or behaviour modification techniques. Some of these interventions are easier to apply than others and less disturbing for the child and their parent; some are more applicable to a particular type of habit.

Objectives

The primary objective of the review was to evaluate the effects of different interventions for cessation of NNSHs in children. The secondary objectives were to determine which interventions work most quickly and are the most effective in terms of child and parent- or carer-centred outcomes of least discomfort and psychological distress from the intervention, as well as the dental measures of malocclusion (reduction in anterior open bite, overjet and correction of posterior crossbite) and cost-effectiveness.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 8 October 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 9), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 8 October 2014), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 8 October 2014), PsycINFO via OVID (1980 to 8 October 2014) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1937 to 8 October 2014), the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (Clinical Trials.gov) (to 8 October 2014) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 8 October 2014). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication in the searches of the electronic databases. We screened reference lists from relevant articles and contacted authors of eligible studies for further information where necessary.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials in children with a non-nutritive sucking habit that compared one intervention with another intervention or a no-intervention control group. The primary outcome of interest was cessation of the habit.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Three review authors were involved in screening the records identified; two undertook data extraction, two assessed risk of bias and two assessed overall quality of the evidence base. Most of the data could not be combined and only one meta-analysis could be carried out.

Main Results

We included six trials, which recruited 252 children (aged two and a half to 18 years), but presented follow-up data on only 246 children. Digit sucking was the only NNSH assessed in the studies. Five studies compared single or multiple interventions with a no-intervention or waiting list control group and one study made a head-to-head comparison. All the studies were at high risk of bias due to major limitations in methodology and reporting. There were small numbers of participants in the studies (20 to 38 participants per study) and follow-up times ranged from one to 36 months. Short-term outcomes were observed under one year post intervention and long-term outcomes were observed at one year or more post intervention. Orthodontics appliance (with or without psychological intervention) versus no treatmentTwo trials that assessed this comparison evaluated our primary outcome of cessation of habit. One of the trials evaluated palatal crib and one used a mix of palatal cribs and arches. Both trials were at high risk of bias. The orthodontic appliance was more likely to stop digit sucking than no treatment, whether it was used over the short term (risk ratio (RR) 6.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 25.53; two trials, 70 participants) or long term (RR 5.81, 95% CI 1.49 to 22.66; one trial, 37 participants) or used in combination with a psychological intervention (RR 6.36, 95% CI 0.97 to 41.96; one trial, 32 participants). Psychological intervention versus no treatmentTwo trials (78 participants) at high risk of bias evaluated positive reinforcement (alone or in combination with gaining the child's co-operation) or negative reinforcement compared with no treatment. Pooling of data showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the psychological interventions in the short term (RR 6.16, 95% CI 1.18 to 32.10; I(2) = 0%). One study, with data from 57 participants, reported on the long-term effect of positive and negative reinforcement on sucking cessation and found a statistically significant difference in favour of the psychological interventions (RR 6.25, 95% CI 1.65 to 23.65). Head-to-head comparisonsOnly one trial demonstrated a clear difference in effectiveness between different active interventions. This trial, which had only 22 participants, found a higher likelihood of cessation of habit with palatal crib than palatal arch (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.59).

Authors' Conclusions

This review found low quality evidence that orthodontic appliances (palatal arch and palatal crib) and psychological interventions (including positive and negative reinforcement) are effective at improving sucking cessation in children. There is very low quality evidence that palatal crib is more effective than palatal arch. This review has highlighted the need for high quality trials evaluating interventions to stop non-nutritive sucking habits to be conducted and the need for a consolidated, standardised approach to reporting outcomes in these trials.

### Risk factors, protective factors, and current recommendations to reduce sudden infant death syndrome: a review [^116GYSAW]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Sudden infant death syndrome remains the leading cause of death in infants aged 1 month to 1 year in the United States.

Observations

While its exact cause is unknown, sudden infant death syndrome is believed to be multifactorial, ie, occurs in infants with underlying biological vulnerability who experience an exogenous stressor, such as prone/side sleeping or soft bedding, during a critical developmental period. Much genetic and physiologic evidence points to impaired arousal responses to hypercarbia and hypoxia, which ultimately leads to asphyxia. Known risk factors for infants include prone and side sleeping, soft bedding, bed sharing, inappropriate sleep surfaces (including sofas), exposure to tobacco smoke, and prematurity; protective factors include breastfeeding, pacifier use, room sharing, and immunizations.

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite our improved understanding of the physiologic mechanisms that cause sudden infant death, the mainstay of risk reduction continues to be a safe sleep environment, as most infants who die suddenly and unexpectedly do so in unsafe sleep environments.

### Effect of pacifier use on duration of breastfeeding… [^117DaogP]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Does unrestricted pacifier use in healthy, full-term, exclusively breastfed infants decrease the duration of breastfeeding. Evidence-Based Answer In healthy, full-term, breastfeeding infants, there is moderate evidence that unrestricted pacifier use, started at birth or after lactation has been established, does not decrease the likelihood of continued exclusive or partial breastfeeding through four months of age.

1. Practice Pointers The United States has seen a rise in infant breastfeeding rates over the past two decades, likely because of the growing body of evidence that supports improved health outcomes for both mother and baby. The percentage of infants who have ever breastfed increased from 71% in 2002 to 83% in 2014.

2 To encourage successful breastfeeding, many hospital systems ascribe to baby-friendly behavior practices based on the World Health Organization's Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. 3 One behavior postulated to interfere with the establishment of successful breastfeeding is pacifier use during the first few weeks of life. Step 9 of the WHO's 10 steps instructs parents to refrain from giving pacifiers or artificial nipples to breastfeeding infants; this is based on four observational studies published before 1998. 3 One recent systematic review identified 46 relevant studies. 4 Meta-analysis of the largely observational data found a consistent association between pacifier use and risk of exclusive breastfeeding disruption. This Cochrane review sought to evaluate whether pacifier use in healthy breastfeeding infants affects multiple breastfeeding outcomes, including the duration of breastfeeding.

1. Two RCTs with 1, 302 infants found no apparent difference between the pacifier and control groups in the proportion of infants who were exclusively or partially breastfeeding at three and four months of age. 5, 6 The included studies did not report outcomes for total duration of breastfeeding. Additionally, this review did not assess secondary outcomes of breastfeeding difficulties, infant health, or maternal satisfaction or confidence in parenting.
2. Breastfeeding is endorsed by many professional societies, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, as the preferred method of feeding infants during the first six to 12 months of life.

### Effect of pacifier use on oral breathing in healthy newborn infants [^116j9wEF]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2002). Low credibility.

We tested the hypothesis that the use of a pacifier may affect the ability of some term infants to maintain effective oral breathing during prolonged nasal occlusion. Three nasal occlusion tests without a pacifier and 3 with a pacifier were alternately carried out in 20 healthy term infants (age 2–5 days). Once the infant commenced oral breathing, nasal occlusion was continued for up to 90 sec (prolonged nasal occlusion), provided the infant did not start crying and that arterial oxygen saturation (SaO₂) did not drop to ≤ 80%. The response to nasal occlusion was considered maladaptive if oral breathing was accomplished with signs of upper airway obstruction. After nasal occlusion, the infants succeeded in starting oral breathing in all instances after a delay which was strongly correlated to the drop in SaO(2) (P < 0.001). Once the infants commenced oral breathing, 17/20 infants presented a maladaptive response to 62% of all tests without pacifier, whereas 10/20 infants presented a maladaptive response to 30% of all tests with a pacifier in place (P < 0.001). Following prolonged nasal occlusion, 18 of 19 infants presented a maladaptive response to 84% of all tests without pacifier, whereas 12 of 19 infants presented a maladaptive response to 41% of all tests with a pacifier in place (P < 0.001). Thus, after prolonged nasal occlusion with or without pacifier, the drop in mean SaO₂ from baseline values changed in accordance with an appropriate and maladaptive response (-4 ± 1 vs. -7 ± 1; P < 0.001). We conclude that normal term infants often present with a maladaptive response to prolonged nasal occlusion. The use of a pacifier enhances the infant's ability to maintain a more adequate oral air flow.

### A randomized controlled trial of sucrose and / or pacifier as analgesia for infants receiving venipuncture in a pediatric emergency department [^112VUdfi]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Unadjusted effects

Estimates for FLACC score and heart rate are presented as mean change from baseline ± standard deviation.

Sucrose

The FLACC score in the 43 sucrose infants increased from baseline by an average of 3.2 ± 3.6 which was not significantly different from the 3.6 ± 3.3 average of the 41 placebo infants (p = 0.66). There were also no significant differences in crying time (sucrose: 168.4 ± 112.2, placebo: 200.7 ± 96.0; p = 0.16) or heart rate change (sucrose: 28.1 ± 29.3, placebo: 26.4 ± 18.7; p = 0.75).

Pacifier

The 40 infants that did not receive a pacifier had an average increase from baseline in FLACC score of 4.3 ± 4.5 compared to the average increase from baseline of 2.5 ± 3.7 in the 44 infants that did receive a pacifier. The difference between the two groups was very close to being statistically significant (p = 0.06). The difference in crying time between the two groups was statistically significant (pacifier: 143.3 ± 101.7, no pacifier: 229.1 ± 90.6; p = 0.0001) while the difference in heart rate change was not (pacifier: 30.6 ± 27.7; no pacifier: 23.7 ± 20.4; p = 0.20).

### When is the use of pacifiers justifiable in the baby-friendly hospital initiative context? A clinician's guide [^115B9KHv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The use of pacifiers is an ancient practice, but often becomes a point of debate when parents and professionals aim to protect and promote breastfeeding as most appropriately for nurturing infants. We discuss the current literature available on pacifier use to enable critical decision-making regarding justifiable use of pacifiers, especially in the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative context, and we provide practical guidelines for clinicians.

Discussion

Suck-swallow-breathe coordination is an important skill that every newborn must acquire for feeding success. In most cases the development and maintenance of the sucking reflex is not a problem, but sometimes the skill may be compromised due to factors such as mother–infant separation or medical conditions. In such situations the use of pacifiers can be considered therapeutic and even provide medical benefits to infants, including reducing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. The argument opposing pacifier use, however, is based on potential risks such as nipple confusion and early cessation of breastfeeding. The Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding as embedded in the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative initially prohibited the use of pacifiers in a breastfeeding friendly environment to prevent potential associated risks. This article provides a summary of the evidence on the benefits of non-nutritive sucking, risks associated with pacifier use, an identification of the implications regarded as 'justifiable' in the clinical use of pacifiers and a comprehensive discussion to support the recommendations for safe pacifier use in healthy, full-term, and ill and preterm infants.

Summary

The use of pacifiers is justifiable in certain situations and will support breastfeeding rather than interfere with it. Justifiable conditions have been identified as: low-birth weight and premature infants; infants at risk for hypoglyceamia; infants in need of oral stimulation to develop, maintain and mature the sucking reflex in preterm infants; and the achievement of neurobehavioural organisation. Medical benefits associated with the use of pacifiers include providing comfort, contributing towards neurobehavioural organisation, and reducing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Guidelines are presented for assessing and guiding safe pacifier use, for specific design to ensure safety, and for cessation of use to ensure normal childhood development.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115g5UUa]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Feeding practices, pacifier use, and child care — modifiers of AOM risk: Avoiding supine bottle feeding and reducing or eliminating pacifier use in the second 6 months of life may reduce acute otitis media (AOM) incidence, and pacifier use has been associated with AOM recurrence. During infancy and early childhood, altering child care-center attendance patterns to reduce upper respiratory infections can significantly reduce recurrent AOM. Eliminating exposure to passive tobacco smoke has been postulated to reduce AOM incidence in infancy, and bottles and pacifiers have been associated with AOM.

### Predictors of and reasons for pacifier use in first-time mothers: an observational study [^112CXW9U]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Despite this observational evidence, a recent systematic review reported that four RCTs with interventions aimed at reducing pacifier use did not demonstrate a difference in breastfeeding outcome. The interventions included 'no pacifier' use and education regarding the avoidance of pacifiers and alternative soothing methods compared with education regarding soothing methods including pacifier use. However, in two of these studies, non-compliance with the intervention was high, with many mothers in the intervention groups choosing to use a pacifier, and thus the interventions were not delivered as intended.

Little is currently known about the reasons behind the use of pacifiers, and whether or not they have simply become a cultural norm. The poor compliance in intervention studies suggests that the use of pacifiers is firmly entrenched in some cultures and that the reasons why mothers use pacifiers needs to be investigated and better understood in order to design effective interventions to reduce pacifier use. Hence the aim of this study was to investigate who (if anyone) advises first-time mothers to give a pacifier and the reasons for why they first give (or try to give) a pacifier to their healthy term infant. Additionally, this study aimed to identify predictors of pacifier use and confirm (or refute) previous research regarding pacifier use and breastfeeding duration.

### Effect of restricted pacifier use in breastfeeding term infants for increasing duration of breastfeeding [^112WWPYf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

To successfully initiate and maintain breastfeeding for a longer duration, the World Health Organization's Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding recommends total avoidance of artificial teats or pacifiers for breastfeeding infants. Concerns have been raised that offering the pacifier instead of the breast to calm the infant may lead to less frequent episodes of breastfeeding and as a consequence may reduce breast-milk production and shorten duration of breastfeeding.

Objectives

To assess the effect of restricted versus unrestricted pacifier use in healthy full-term newborns whose mothers have initiated breastfeeding and intend to exclusively breastfeed, on the duration of breastfeeding, other breastfeeding outcomes and infant health.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing restricted versus unrestricted pacifier use in healthy full-term newborns who have initiated breastfeeding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We found three trials (involving 1915 babies) for inclusion in the review, but have included only two trials (involving 1302 healthy full-term breastfeeding infants) in the analysis. Meta-analysis of the two combined studies showed that pacifier use in healthy breastfeeding infants had no significant effect on the proportion of infants exclusively breastfed at three months (risk ratio (RR) 1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.07, two studies, 1228 infants), and at four months of age (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09, one study, 970 infants, moderate-quality evidence), and also had no effect on the proportion of infants partially breastfed at three months (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02, two studies, 1228 infants), and at four months of age (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.02, one study, 970 infants). None of the included trials reported data on the other primary outcomes, i.e. duration of partial or exclusive breastfeeding, or secondary outcomes: breastfeeding difficulties (mastitis, cracked nipples, breast engorgement); infant's health (dental malocclusion, otitis media, oral candidiasis; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)); maternal satisfaction and level of confidence in parenting. One study reported that avoidance of pacifiers had no effect on cry/fuss behavior at ages four, six, or nine weeks and also reported no effect on the risk of weaning before age three months, however the data were incomplete and so could not be included for analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

Pacifier use in healthy term breastfeeding infants, started from birth or after lactation is established, did not significantly affect the prevalence or duration of exclusive and partial breastfeeding up to four months of age. Evidence to assess the short-term breastfeeding difficulties faced by mothers and long-term effect of pacifiers on infants' health is lacking.

### Effect of pacifier and pacifier with dextrose in reducing pain during orogastric tube insertion in newborns: a randomized controlled trial [^112PVjkq]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of pacifier use, with and without 25% dextrose, in reducing pain during orogastric tube insertion in newborns.

Study design

In a randomized controlled trial involving 60 newborns at a public hospital from April to December 2019, participants were divided into three groups: pacifier (n = 20), pacifier with 25% dextrose (n = 20), and control (n = 20). A pacifier, with and without dextrose, was used for the experimental groups, while the control group performed a routine procedure. Neonatal infant pain scale, crying duration, heart rate (HR), and oxygen saturation (SpO₂) were evaluated.

Results

Results indicated that the control group experienced significantly higher pain levels, elevated HRs, decreased SpO₂, and prolonged crying. Conversely, the pacifier with 25% dextrose group showed a notable reduction in crying duration.

Conclusion

A pacifier, with and without 25% dextrose, effectively reduces pain and improves physiological and behavioral parameters during orogastric tube insertion.

### Poor oral habits and malocclusions after usage of orthodontic pacifiers: an observational study on 3–5 years old children [^114GeYEa]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of pacifiers is accepted during the first year of life, because it decreases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, due to its influences on autonomic and cardiovascular control; in addition, it could help to calm the children and improve his/her psychological development. Also other non-nutritive habits such as thumbsucking or fingersucking are often implemented by infants/children to pacify and comfort themselves, as sucking is a natural instinct for a baby, and it is the baby's first coordinated muscular activity. However, from the craniofacial development point of view, the use of a conventional pacifier for a long time (over 2 years) and with high frequency (a "daily use", as recently stated by Ling et al.) has been associated with some alterations of the occlusion, such as anterior open bite and posterior crossbite.

For this reason, the so-called orthodontic pacifiers have been introduced into the market, designed with a flattened nipple to simulate mothers' nipple anatomy, to maintain the necessary pressure of tongue on the palatal vault and to obtain a more acceptable lip seal, allowing its physiological development and reducing the side effects related to utilising conventional pacifiers. In fact, the use of such pacifiers would rise to replicate the patterns of muscle contraction, tongue position and nasal breathing similar to the ones occurring during breastfeeding, whereby they would not interfere with the growth and development of the face and occlusion.

The first systematic literature review on the differences between conventional and orthodontic pacifiers, was not able to draw any conclusion due to the low level of available studies, requesting more data on this field. That systematic review did not include parameters such as frequency and duration of pacifier usage. Another recent systematic review including five trials about the comparison between orthodontic and conventional pacifiers concludes that a proper definition for a functional or orthodontic pacifier is missing, and that functional orthodontic pacifiers seem to cause less anterior open bite than conventional ones, while the no statistical difference implies the absence of an association between the prevalence of posterior crossbite and the use of orthodontic pacifiers. Thus, the main conclusion stated the insufficiency of currently available evidence to support this hypothesis that the usage of orthodontic pacifiers is able to prevent malocclusion traits when compared to conventional ones, and that new data on orthodontic pacifiers effects are necessary in literature to substantiate the argument.

### Effect of restricted pacifier use in breastfeeding term infants for increasing duration of breastfeeding [^113MvMc9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

To successfully initiate and maintain breastfeeding for a longer duration, the World Health Organization's Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding recommends total avoidance of artificial teats or pacifiers for breastfeeding infants. Offering the pacifier instead of the breast to calm the infant may lead to less frequent episodes of breastfeeding and as a consequence may reduce breast milk production and shorten duration of breastfeeding; however, this remains unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effect of unrestricted versus restricted pacifier use in healthy full-term newborns whose mothers have initiated breastfeeding and intend to exclusively breastfeed, on the duration of breastfeeding, other breastfeeding outcomes and infant health.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (14 March 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing unrestricted versus restricted pacifier use in healthy full-term newborns who have initiated breastfeeding regardless of whether they were born at home or in the hospital.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

We found three trials (involving 1915 babies) for inclusion in the review but have included only two trials (involving 1302 healthy full-term breastfeeding infants) in the analysis. Meta-analysis of the two combined studies showed that pacifier use in healthy breastfeeding infants had no significant effect on the proportion of infants exclusively breastfed at three months (risk ratio (RR) 0.99; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.05), and at four months of age (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06) and also had no effect on the proportion of infants partially breastfed at three months (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13), and at 4 months of age (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.03).

Authors' Conclusions

Pacifier use in healthy term breastfeeding infants, started from birth or after lactation is established, did not significantly affect the prevalence or duration of exclusive and partial breastfeeding up to four months of age. However, evidence to assess the short-term breastfeeding difficulties faced by mothers and long-term effect of pacifiers on infants' health is lacking.

### Pacifier restriction and exclusive breastfeeding [^112Fgoqt]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

We tested the hypothesis that removing pacifiers from routine distribution in our mother-baby unit (MBU) would be associated with greater breastfeeding initiation or exclusivity during the birth hospitalization.

Methods

We retrospectively compared exclusive breastfeeding, breastfeeding plus supplemental formula feeding, and exclusive formula feeding rates for 2249 infants admitted to the MBU at our university teaching hospital during the 5 months before and 8 months after restriction of routine pacifier distribution. Formula supplementation, if not medically indicated, was discouraged per standard practice, but access to formula was not restricted.

Results

Of the 2249 infants, 79% were exclusively breastfed from July through November 2010, when pacifiers were routinely distributed. During the 8-month period after pacifier restriction, this proportion decreased significantly to 68% (P < .001). A corresponding increase from 18% to 28% was observed in the number of breastfed infants receiving supplemental formula feeds in the same period (P < .001). During the study period, the proportion of exclusively formula-fed infants increased from 1.8% to 3.4% (P < .05).

Conclusions

Restricting pacifier distribution during the newborn hospitalization without also restricting access to formula was associated with decreased exclusive breastfeeding, increased supplemental formula feeding, and increased exclusive formula feeding. Because high-quality, prospective medical literature addressing pacifier use and breastfeeding does not conclusively show an adverse relationship in women who are motivated to breastfeed, more studies are needed to help determine what effect, if any, pacifiers have on breastfeeding initiation and exclusivity in the immediate newborn period.

### Does the use of pacifier affect gastro-esophageal reflux in Preterm Infants? [^116nJMxs]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

This crossover study showed that non-nutritive sucking, provided with a pacifier in 30 preterm infants, had no effect on acid and nonacid gastro-esophageal reflux evaluated by esophageal pH-impedance, and thus may be reasonably used in preterm neonates with symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux.

### Pacifier use and breastfeeding: a qualitative study of postpartum mothers [^114QwofT]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: Due to the inconclusive evidence supporting the traditional recommendation to avoid early pacifier use among breastfeeding newborns, this study aims to understand what information mothers are receiving from hospital based care providers and their perspectives about pacifier use in the newborn period. Methods: Interviews with mothers of healthy, term newborns during the postpartum hospitalization were conducted in this qualitative study. Results: Qualitative data analysis yielded several major themes that included the following: (1) pacifiers are beneficial for the maternal/infant experience, (2) concerns that pacifiers may interfere with breastfeeding, and (3) concerns about long-term use (including reliance and effect on teeth). Conclusion: Given the maternal perception of benefit and the paucity of high-quality evidence showing harm, further research on the effects of early pacifier use is needed.

### The who, when, and why of pacifier use [^111NRUa5]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Compared to physicians, it was more common for family or friends to recommend pacifiers to mothers, consistent with evidence reported by Mauch and colleagues. Given the health benefits and risks of pacifier use, and the potential risk of misinformation from non-expert sources; doctors and other health professionals should consider talking with parents about pacifiers at early check-ups, particularly when parents express distress or difficulty dealing with their infant's negative emotions. Such conversations should include advice for the cessation of pacifier use by 2 years.

Attitudes surrounding pacifier use were consistently split between pacifier users and never-users. Pacifier users agreed with statements surrounding the utility of pacifiers in non-nutritive sucking and reducing negative emotions in their baby, whereas they disagreed that pacifiers intruded on their ability to parent. Conversely, never-users reported more negative feelings about pacifiers and felt pacifiers may prevent their understanding of their infants' emotions. Mothers that had tried a pacifier shared agreement with pacifier users on the utility of pacifiers and remained more agnostic about other aspects of pacifiers. These findings suggest that mothers consider multiple factors in their decision on whether or not to use a pacifier. We did not probe mothers' reasoning for their negative attitudes which may arise from socio-cultural, familial, or the prevalence of pseudo-evidence suggesting pacifiers can disrupt breastfeeding. Future research on mothers' attitudes surrounding pacifier use should probe the specific negative attitudes held and the sources informing those attitudes.

### Do pacifiers reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome? A meta-analysis [^112q4WzM]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Pacifier use has been reported to be associated with a reduced risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), but most countries around the world, including the United States, have been reluctant to recommend the use of pacifiers because of concerns about possible adverse effects. This meta-analysis was undertaken to quantify and evaluate the protective effect of pacifiers against SIDS and to make a recommendation on the use of pacifiers to prevent SIDS.

Methods

We searched the Medline database (January 1966 to May 2004) to collect data on pacifier use and its association with SIDS, morbidity, or other adverse effects. The search strategy included published articles in English with the Medical Subject Headings terms "sudden infant death syndrome" and "pacifier" and the keywords "dummy" and "soother". Combining searches resulted in 384 abstracts, which were all read and evaluated for inclusion. For the meta-analysis, articles with data on the relationship between pacifier use and SIDS risk were limited to published original case-control studies, because no prospective observational reports were found; 9 articles met these criteria. Two independent reviewers evaluated each study on the basis of the 6 criteria developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Infant Positioning and SIDS; in cases of disagreement, a third reviewer evaluated the study, and a consensus opinion was reached. We developed a script to calculate the summary odds ratio (SOR) by using the reported ORs and respective confidence intervals (CI) to weight the ORs. We then pooled them together to compute the SOR. We performed the Breslow-Day test for homogeneity of ORs, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for the null hypothesis of no effect (OR = 1), and the Mantel-Haenszel common OR estimate. The consistency of findings was evaluated and the overall potential benefits of pacifier use were weighed against the potential risks. Our recommendation is based on the taxonomy of the 5-point (A-E) scale adopted by the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Results

Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. The SOR calculated for usual pacifier use (with univariate ORs) is 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79–1.03) and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.59–0.85) with multivariate ORs. For pacifier use during last sleep, the SORs calculated using univariate and multivariate ORs are 0.47 (95% CI: 0.40–0.55) and 0.39 (95% CI: 0.31–0.50), respectively.

Conclusions

Published case-control studies demonstrate a significant reduced risk of SIDS with pacifier use, particularly when placed for sleep. Encouraging pacifier use is likely to be beneficial on a population-wide basis: 1 SIDS death could be prevented for every 2733 (95% CI: 2416–3334) infants who use a pacifier when placed for sleep (number needed to treat), based on the US SIDS rate and the last-sleep multivariate SOR resulting from this analysis. Therefore, we recommend that pacifiers be offered to infants as a potential method to reduce the risk of SIDS. The pacifier should be offered to the infant when being placed for all sleep episodes, including daytime naps and nighttime sleeps. This is a US Preventive Services Task Force level B strength of recommendation based on the consistency of findings and the likelihood that the beneficial effects will outweigh any potential negative effects. In consideration of potential adverse effects, we recommend pacifier use for infants up to 1 year of age, which includes the peak ages for SIDS risk and the period in which the infant's need for sucking is highest. For breastfed infants, pacifiers should be introduced after breastfeeding has been well established.

### A randomized controlled trial of sucrose and / or pacifier as analgesia for infants receiving venipuncture in a pediatric emergency department [^112biVrw]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

From the neonatal literature, which most frequently examined pain responses to heel lance, it seems that sucrose is a safe, easy-to-administer, inexpensive and effective analgesic for short painful procedures. A growing number of studies, looking at infants undergoing immunizations, suggest that this analgesic effect may indeed extend past the neonatal period into infancy. Nevertheless, the upper limit of this effect is unknown in terms of age and appropriate sucrose strength. Also, the analgesic effect of non-nutritive sucking for infants older than one month has not been previously studied.

We wished to know if the analgesic effect of sucrose or pacifier holds true for neonates and young infants in the emergency department, particularly for the procedure of venipuncture, which unlike heel lance and intramuscular injection, is commonly performed in that setting. Patients frequenting the emergency department generally differ in physiology and pathology from that of neonates in intensive care units where the majority of previous studies were carried out. We anticipated that this study would provide direction as to whether the use of sucrose, plus or minus pacifiers, as analgesia for venipuncture is useful for infants undergoing assessment in pediatric emergency departments.

### Pacifiers: common questions and answers [^112MV8Qu]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients commonly seek guidance about the risks and benefits of pacifiers as well as when and how to wean children from them. Various types of pacifiers appear to have similar risks and benefits. The benefits of pacifier use include reduced risk of sudden infant death syndrome, decreased discomfort during air travel, and pain control during intramuscular injections, venipuncture, and heel sticks. Associated risks include potential negative effects on the initiation of breastfeeding, dental malocclusion, dental caries (when sugar is added), and otitis media. To mitigate the risk of dental caries, caregivers should avoid adding sugar to pacifiers. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using a single-piece pacifier with a soft nipple and a shield at least 1.5 inches in diameter with ventilation holes. The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends delaying pacifier use until breastfeeding is well established, offering a pacifier when putting an infant to sleep, not reinserting pacifiers once an infant is asleep, and not forcing an infant to use a pacifier. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends weaning pacifier use during the second 6 months of life to decrease the risk of otitis media. The optimal time to wean a child from a pacifier is unknown, but health risks appear to increase after 12 months of age.

### Pacifier cleaning practices and risk of allergy development [^111Ar1V9]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Immune stimulation through exposure to commensal microbes may protect against allergy development. Oral microbes may be transferred from parents to infants via pacifiers. We investigated whether pacifier cleaning practices affected the risk of allergy development.

Methods

A birth-cohort of 184 infants was examined for clinical allergy and sensitization to airborne and food allergens at 18 and 36 months of age and, in addition, promptly on occurrence of symptoms. Pacifier use and pacifier cleaning practices were recorded during interviews with the parents when the children were 6 months old. The oral microbiota of the infants was characterized by analysis of saliva samples collected at 4 months of age.

Results

Children whose parents "cleaned" their pacifier by sucking it (n = 65) were less likely to have asthma (odds ratio [OR] 0.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01–0.99), eczema (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.15–0.91), and sensitization (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.10–1.27) at 18 months of age than children whose parents did not use this cleaning technique (n = 58). Protection against eczema remained at age 36 months (hazard ratio 0.51; p = 0.04). Vaginal delivery and parental pacifier sucking yielded independent and additive protective effects against eczema development. The salivary microbiota differed between children whose parents cleaned their pacifier by sucking it and children whose parents did not use this practice.

Conclusions

Parental sucking of their infant's pacifier may reduce the risk of allergy development, possibly via immune stimulation by microbes transferred to the infant via the parent's saliva.

### A randomized controlled trial of sucrose and / or pacifier as analgesia for infants receiving venipuncture in a pediatric emergency department [^115PBVzd]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that venipuncture in infants is a moderately painful procedure. The use of pacifier with sucrose as procedural analgesia for venipuncture in the PED is effective in reduction of pain in infants 0–3 months old, as shown by decrease in crying times. Pacifiers and sucrose are inexpensive, easy to use, have quick onset, short duration of action, and no serious side effects. They should be used in the pediatric emergency department and other pediatric units to help prevent pain from venipuncture for infants aged 0–3 months. Further study to clarify effects of age and sucrose concentrations, as well as effectiveness for other painful procedures is required.

### Sids [^111vegky]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

By definition, the cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is not known. Observational studies have found an association between SIDS and several risk factors, including prone sleeping position, prenatal or postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke, soft sleeping surfaces, hyperthermia/overwrapping, bed sharing (particularly with mothers who smoke), lack of breastfeeding, and lack of soother use. The risk of SIDS is increased in families in which there has been a prior sudden infant death.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of interventions to reduce the risk of SIDS? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 28 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: advice to avoid prone sleeping; advice to avoid tobacco-smoke exposure; advice to avoid soft sleeping surfaces; advice to avoid overheating or overwrapping; advice to avoid bed sharing; advice to breastfeed; advice to promote soother/pacifier use; and advice to promote room sharing (without bed sharing).

Recommendations for future research

It was evident from the review of the available literature that there are many different aspects which influence the safe use of pacifiers in both the full term and ill or preterm infant populations. Furthermore, it was clear from the literature that even within the breastfeeding and baby-friendly hospital environment there is a need for the use of pacifier is specific circumstances. These circumstances have been identified, however studies exploring the benefits of pacifier use in different age ranges, feeding practices, presence of deficits and medical conditions with clear guidelines for implementation were not documented in the literature. Systematic reviews have been done to determine the benefits of NNS, but can be expanded by exploring benefits specific to specific age groups and medical conditions. Limited research is available on the best design of pacifiers, and whether this is the best method of providing NNS. Research on design of pacifiers for both the preterm and fullterm infants can thus be useful. Finally, risks associated with pacifier use should further be explored and identified for various age groups, levels of illness and other differentiating circumstances Table 2.

Discussion

There is limited published research regarding who and what influences a mother's decision to give her infant a pacifier. In view of the well documented, and confirmed in this study, negative association between pacifier use and breastfeeding duration, the results of this study are of importance to inform the design of any future interventions aimed at reducing pacifier use.

This study confirms the widespread use of pacifiers by Australian mothers reported in an earlier study with eight out of 10 infants having been given a pacifier at some stage and seven out of 10 infants still using a pacifier at the time data for this study were collected. In the present study, women with a high school education were more likely to use a pacifier than women with a university education. This association between lower education level and pacifier use is supported by a previous study conducted in Brazil. Cultural differences in the use of pacifiers were observed in this current study with women born outside of Australian being significantly less likely to give their infant a pacifier than Australian born mothers. This finding is consistent with the findings of a multicentre study which reported a widespread difference between countries in the prevalence of pacifier use ranging from 12.5% in Japan to 71% in the Ukraine. The findings of this study suggest that pacifier use in Australia, while approaching universality, is still significantly influenced by socioeconomic and cultural factors.

This study showed that almost 60% of mothers gave (or tried to give) their infant a pacifier to help settle them to sleep, which is consistent with the findings of a New Zealand study. Using pacifiers to soothe or comfort a crying or distressed infant, or to settle an infant to sleep, is likely to result in prolonged or extensive use of the pacifier as crying and sleep are both necessary and frequent behaviours in newborn infants. This may explain the early introduction of pacifiers by the majority of mothers (two thirds before 4 weeks) and the large percentage of mothers using pacifiers most days. The reportedly wide variation in the use of a pacifier between different countries suggests that women from other cultures must use other methods that do not involve the use of a pacifier to effectively soothe their infant. Certainly, it has been shown that pacifiers are no more effective than the traditional ('attachment') methods of soothing (breastfeeding, carrying, rocking) and the traditional methods of soothing may better support mother-infant bonding and subsequently breastfeeding success.

### Effect of pacifier and pacifier with dextrose in reducing pain during orogastric tube insertion in newborns: a randomized controlled trial [^1149UoKp]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of pacifier use, with and without 25% dextrose, in reducing pain during orogastric tube insertion in newborns.

Study Design

In a randomized controlled trial involving 60 newborns at a public hospital from April to December 2019, participants were divided into three groups: pacifier (n = 20), pacifier with 25% dextrose (n = 20), and control (n = 20). A pacifier, with and without dextrose, was used for the experimental groups, while the control group performed a routine procedure. Neonatal infant pain scale, crying duration, heart rate (HR), and oxygen saturation (SpO₂) were evaluated.

Results

Results indicated that the control group experienced significantly higher pain levels, elevated HRs, decreased SpO₂, and prolonged crying. Conversely, the pacifier with 25% dextrose group showed a notable reduction in crying duration.

Conclusion

A pacifier, with and without 25% dextrose, effectively reduces pain and improves physiological and behavioral parameters during orogastric tube insertion.

### Predictors of and reasons for pacifier use in first-time mothers: an observational study [^111y8tTz]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

This study has a number of limitations, firstly the restriction of this study to first time mothers means that results cannot be generalised to all mothers, although previous research indicates that the association between pacifier use and breastfeeding duration exists in both primiparous and multiparous mothers. A major limitation of the study is that the sample is not representative of the population from which it was drawn, further limiting the generalizability of results. While 76% of women contacted shortly after delivery agreed to be contacted when their infants were older, only 44% consented to participate further when approached the second time. The relatively low response rate is consistent with other Australian studies that involve an active intervention. First time mothers were probably less inclined, once they had realised how time consuming caring for a young infant can be, to participate in a study which possibly would require them to attend education sessions. However this also means that the significance of some results to the general population may have been underestimated. For example, participants were older and better educated and likely therefore to be more health conscious. Given that an education level lower than university was positively associated with both early introduction and more frequent use of pacifiers, this may lead to an underestimation of both these measures of pacifier use. The investigation of pacifier use was not the primary purpose of the NOURISH study, which limited the ability to investigate pacifier use more extensively, particularly because the design of the study was retrospective, introducing potential recall bias, and preventing investigation of the causality of the relationship between pacifier use and breastfeeding duration.

Nevertheless, this study has several strengths and confirms the findings of earlier studies. As previously identified breastfeeding rates and rates of pacifier use vary greatly between countries, highlighting the need for country specific data, which this study provides being one of only a handful of studies conducted in Australia. The sample size of this study was relatively large, and inclusion of data from two cities increases its generalizability. The scope of this study is greater than previous Australian studies, being the first to investigate both who advises first-time mothers to give a pacifier, and the reasons for which they first give a pacifier to their infant.

Pacifier users report less negative affect in their child

The Infant Behavior Questionnaire Negative Affectivity scale measured, via maternal report, the infant's propensity to experience negative emotions. Pacifier-Users reported less Negative Affect (M = 4.02, SD = 1.06) compared to Non-Users (M = 4.31, SD = 1.11; t (424) = 2.74, p = 0.006, d = 0.268; Fig. 1b). This difference remained significant after controlling for parental education, F (1422) = 4.39, p = 0.04, η² = 0.01. There were no differences between Pacifier-Users and Non-Users on Positive Affectivity or Regulation Capacity.

Experience with pacifiers shapes more positive attitudes towards pacifiers

To better understand the mother's attitudes towards pacifiers, we examined the perceptions and beliefs of Pacifier-Users, those that Tried-Pacifiers, and Never-Users. We used univariate ANOVAs with endorsement of each of the 6 beliefs as the dependent variable and group as the fixed factor. Figure 2 presents a summary of the findings for each belief.

Fig. 2
Beliefs about pacifiers.

The figure displays ratings of agreement with statements about beliefs and purposes of pacifiers by mothers who are previous or current Pacifier-Users (solid blue), mothers who Tried-Pacifiers (striped yellow) but their baby rejected them, and mothers who are Never-Users (checkered red). For ease of interpretation, neither agree nor disagree responses were set to zero.

### Should pacifiers be recommended to prevent sudden infant death syndrome? [^116vGmYu]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our aim was to review the evidence for a reduction in the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) with pacifier ("dummy" or "soother") use, to discuss possible mechanisms for the reduction in SIDS risk, and to review other possible health effects of pacifiers.

Results

There is a remarkably consistent reduction of SIDS with pacifier use. The mechanism by which pacifiers might reduce the risk of SIDS is unknown, but several mechanisms have been postulated. Pacifiers might reduce breastfeeding duration, but the studies are conflicting.

Conclusions

It seems appropriate to stop discouraging the use of pacifiers. Whether it is appropriate to recommend pacifier use in infants is open to debate.

Infection

To avoid infection, pacifiers should be cleaned often and replaced regularly. They should never be shared among siblings and never licked to clean them. Parents should consider having several pacifiers available so as to rotate them through cycles of cleaning and use during the day.

In a happy infant, a pacifier should be used for pacifying, to support sleep and self-regulation and not as a plug. Furthermore, bigger children should rather not be using a pacifier when playing and walking around, and do not need the pacifier to support with soothing.

Design safety

A pacifier should be a single-piece unit and made of durable material to prevent parts from dislodging and posing a choking hazard. It should be replaced when worn, and never tied with a string to the crib or around a child's neck or hand. A symmetrical nipple shape allows the pacifier to remain in the correct sucking position. Flanges should have minimum horizontal and vertical dimensions of 43 mm to prevent the pacifier from lodging in the soft palate, and manufacturers should be required to place a ring behind the flange for removal in case of aspiration. Pacifiers should have a large shield that is wider than the child's mouth (just over 3 cm in diameter).

Shields should have ventilation holes, which are essential to permit air passage, with a textured inner surface to help to prevent irritation and rashes that result from trapped saliva.

Cessation of pacifier use

Pacifier use should not be actively discouraged and may be especially beneficial in the first six months of life. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommend weaning children from pacifiers in the second six months of life to preventand Sexton and Natale support this recommendation, in support of avoiding dental problems.

Cessation of pacifier use is recommended by various authors. Although they vary regarding cessation age, they agree that curtailing should start at the age of three years and that the habit should be discontinued by or before the age of four years to minimize the development of malocclusion. From a speech therapy perspective, clinicians recommend cessation at 14 months of age to prevent interference with speech. Since these recommendations seem to be conflicting we suggest weaning from as early as six months and if the situation requires, not later than four years of age.

Techniques to support NNS

Different techniques can be used to support sucking, some of which are regarded as better as and safer than others. They include sucking on the infant's own hands or fingers, on the mother's 'emptied' breast, on an adult's finger, or even on an oro-gastric tube in the case of a hospitalised infant, as well as sucking on pacifiers.

The use of pacifiers (also referred to as dummies, soothers or artificial teats) for sucking dates back thousands of years and is helpful when the infant's self-regulation needs support but when the mother is unavailable to provide comfort and sucking on the breast, and when alternative measures to support self-regulation are insufficient.

In 2009, UNICEF described oral feeding as an art and a science and not something that happens automatically. It has become increasingly clear that additional support may be required for infant feeding and, as indicated in a joint WHO/UNICEF statement as long ago as 1989; such support ought to be provided by trained professionals from a multidisciplinary team.

ABM Clinical Protocol #7 — essential breastfeeding issues before discharge emphasize that the average feeding frequency (8–12 times per 24 hours) should be reviewed, and that infants should be fed in response to feeding cues, offered both breasts per feeding and fed until they seem satisfied. The protocol also states that the effects of pacifiers and artificial teats on breastfeeding and why to avoid them until lactation is established should be discussed, that not all medications nor mother's illnesses contraindicate breastfeeding, and that accurate information resources (www.e-lactancia.org and www.mommymeds.com) are provided to parents.

Behavioural benefits

Behavioural organization is improved in infants exposed to NNS, since the practice improves self-consolation and soothing in the infant, self-regulatory state modulation, and the time spent sleeping, and it increases levels of alertness. All these contribute to lower energy consumption. Giving the infant five (5) minutes of NNS before a feed is, furthermore, associated with increased alertness during feeds, leading to greater feeding. The treatment plan of infants struggling with poor suck, swallow and breathe coordination can also include NNS, since it aids in neurobehavioral organization and maturation. Furthermore, in a crossover study including 30 preterm infants, a pacifier did not had an effect on acid and nonacid gastro-esophageal reflux, and may therefore be used in preterm neonates with gastro-esophageal reflux.

Motor system benefits

NNS contributes to improvement in muscle tone and coordination, which is an important aspect of energy conservation and growth.

Neurological benefits

Accelerated maturation and improved pain management can be classified as neurological benefits. The use of NNS in conjunction with a sweet substance, such as expressed breast milk or sucrose, for managing pain during painful procedures and interventions such as immunizations, and heel pricks are often underutilized, especially in preterm infants and full term infants up to six months. In addition, the benefits of NNS specifically for immature preterm infants are even more far reaching. It protects the infant against aspiration, since suck inhibits swallowing, and in tube-fed infants it contributes to accelerated maturation, which in turn contributes to faster transition from tube to oral feeds. All these benefits lead to greater weight gain and, in the hospitalized infant, to earlier discharge.

SIDS

Evidence suggests that using pacifiers in older infants at nap times and bedtime at night is associated with a decrease in the risk of SIDS. The reduced risk was, however, found in combination with other factors, such as mothers who were older, married, non-smoking, and breastfeeding, and mothers who had received adequate prenatal care.

However, with regards to the benefits outlined, mention should be made of the broad range of ages, feeding practices, deficits, and medical conditions in the cohorts of infants used in the above mentioned studies. Benefits of using pacifiers in the NICU's can therefore not be established which leads to general recommendations for safe pacifier use, which will be outlined later in this paper.

### The who, when, and why of pacifier use [^116Dq1WA]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Social and familial consequences of pacifier use remain poorly understood. The present study attempts to shed more light on the characteristics of parents using pacifiers with their infants and to explore how pacifier use affects perceptions of infant emotionality, maternal stress, and parental efficacy.

Methods

The study sample consisted of 428 mothers (range: 17–49 years) of infants (0–36 months) who completed a comprehensive questionnaire assessing infant and parent characteristics as well as parenting practices and pacifier use. We compared attitudes toward pacifiers, parenting stress, children's levels of reactivity and self-regulation, and maternal efficacy among Pacifier Users, Never-Users, and families that Tried-Pacifiers.

Results

The reported results reveal benefits of pacifier use for the family relationships, namely reduced parenting stress (p = 0.018), better parent-child dynamics (p < 0.001), and more positive perceptions of child's affectivity (p = 0.006), which are all important aspects of infant development.

Conclusion

Our findings highlight developmental benefits of pacifier use, a practice that is known to have both positive and negative long-term consequences for healthy child development. It is, therefore, important for health professionals to have discussions about the pros and cons of pacifier use with parents.

Impact

The study provides novel insights into how and why mothers use pacifiers and into the psychological consequences of this practice.
We found pacifier use is associated with less maternal stress, better mother-child dynamics, and more positive perceptions of child's affectivity.
Our findings document developmental benefits of pacifier use adding a new perspective to the debate on pacifiers.
Doctors, health visitors, pediatric nurses, and midwives may consider this evidence when advising parents on pacifier use.

### Does the recommendation to use a pacifier influence the prevalence of breastfeeding? [^1168oy1H]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether the recommendation to offer a pacifier once lactation is well established reduces the prevalence or duration of breastfeeding.

Study Design

A multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority, controlled trial comprising 1021 mothers highly motivated to breastfeed whose newborns regained birth weight by 15 days. They were assigned to offer versus not to offer pacifiers. Primary outcome was prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months. Main secondary outcomes were the prevalence of exclusive and any breastfeeding at different ages and duration of any breastfeeding.

Results

At 3 months, 85.8% infants in the offer pacifier group and 86.2% in the not offer pacifier group were exclusively breastfeeding (risk difference, 0.4%; 95% CI, -4.9%-4.1%), satisfying the pre-specified non-inferiority requirement of -7%. Furthermore, the recommendation to offer a pacifier did not produce a significant decrease in the frequency of exclusive and any breastfeeding at different ages or in the duration of lactation.

Conclusions

The recommendation to offer a pacifier at 15 days does not modify the prevalence and duration of breastfeeding. Because pacifier use is associated with reduced incidence of sudden infant death syndrome, the recommendation to offer a pacifier appears safe and appropriate in similar populations.

### Pacifier use, early weaning, and cry / fuss behavior: a randomized controlled trial [^114C7hVg]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

The World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund strongly discourage use of pacifiers because of their perceived interference with breastfeeding. Observational studies have reported a strong association between pacifier use and early weaning, but such studies are unable to determine whether the association is causal.

Objectives

To test whether regular pacifier use is causally related to weaning by 3 months postpartum and to examine differences in results according to randomized intervention allocation vs observational use or nonuse of pacifiers.

Design

Double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted from January 1998 to August 1999.

Setting

Postpartum unit of a university teaching hospital in Montreal, Quebec.

Participants

A total of 281 healthy, breastfeeding women and their healthy, term singleton infants.

Interventions

Participants were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 counseling interventions provided by a research nurse trained in location counseling. The experimental intervention (n = 140) differed from the control (n = 141) by recommending avoidance of pacifier use and suggesting alternative ways to comfort a crying or fussing infant.

Main Outcome Measures

Early weaning, defined as weaning within the first 3 months, compared between groups; 24-hour infant behavior logs detailing frequency and duration of crying, fussing, and pacifier use at 4, 6, and 9 weeks.

Results

A total of 258 mother-infant pairs (91.8%) completed follow-up. The experimental intervention increased total avoidance of pacifier use (38.6% vs 16.0% in the control group), reduced daily use (40.8% vs 55.7%), and decreased the mean number of pacifier insertions per day (0.8 vs 2.4 at 4 weeks [P < .001]; 0.8 vs 3.0 at 6 weeks [P < .001]; and 1.3 vs 3.0 at 9 weeks [P = 0.004]). In the analysis based on randomized intervention allocation, the experimental intervention had no discernible effect on weaning at 3 months (18.9% vs 18.3% in the experimental vs control group; relative risk [RR], 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6–1.7), and no effect was observed on cry/fuss behavior (in the experimental vs control groups, respectively, total daily duration, 143 vs 151 minutes at 4 weeks [P = 0.49]; 128 vs 131 minutes at 6 weeks [P = 0.81]; and 110 vs 104 minutes at 9 weeks [P = 0.58]). When randomized allocation was ignored, however, we observed a strong observational association between exposure to daily pacifier use and weaning by 3 months (25.0% vs 12.9% of the exposed vs unexposed groups; RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1–3.3).

Conclusions

We found a strong observational association between pacifier use and early weaning. No such association was observed, however, when our data were analyzed by randomized allocation, strongly suggesting that pacifier use is a marker of breastfeeding difficulties or reduced motivation to breastfeed, rather than a true cause of early weaning.

### The who, when, and why of pacifier use [^111P1Px8]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

All participants completed a 6-item measure of their attitudes toward pacifiers. Three items concerned positive attitudes (e.g. dummies reduce a baby's distre ss), and three concerned negative attitudes (e.g. I have negative feelings toward the use of dummies). Participants answered on scales ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). This scale showed strong internal consistency (α = 0.73). Mothers also rated how frequently they would offer their babies a pacifier in ten social contexts (e.g. when s/he is asleep or trying to fall asleep; when other kids are present, see Table 2 for all items) on a scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (very frequently).

Statistical analysis

We compared the characteristics of parents and infants who used pacifiers with those who did not use them. Mothers whose children used a pacifier at the time of the study or in the past were coded as Pacifier-Users and those who had never used a pacifier, as Non-Users. We aimed to characterize how pacifiers are used and examine qualitative differences between Users and Non-Users.

Although this binary categorization was used in most analyses, when examining attitudes towards pacifiers, we assessed three categories: Pacifier-Users, Never-Users, and families that Tried-Pacifiers. The categories were created based on the question Did you introduce a dummy but your baby refused to use it? Those who answered negatively were coded as Never-Users (n = 128), and those who answered positively as Tried-Pacifiers (n = 57). Analyses were conducted in SPSS v27 and we adjusted all post-hoc tests using the Bonferroni correction.

### Safe sleep practices in a New Zealand community and development of a sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) risk assessment instrument [^1158Z925]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Pacifier use at sleep time is associated with a lower SUDI risk through a yet to be determined mechanism. Despite some countries recommending pacifier use for SUDI prevention, NZ does not include pacifier use as part of its safe sleep messages. We found pacifier use more than doubled from 3 weeks of age [9.6%] to 15 weeks, [19%], similar to the 19% of 3 month old infants in this region using pacifiers in 2001/2. This suggests no significant effect of international recommendations on pacifier use in this community, and no broader social effect even though pacifier use is much more common in other countries [32% to 71%].

The suggestion that breastfeeding may be protective against SUDI has been controversial, with many, although not all, studies reporting an association. However, a recent meta-analysis suggests that breastfeeding is protective, and that the effect is even stronger when breastfeeding is exclusive. Eighty-nine percent of infants in the current study were breastfed at 2 months of age, compared to 79% of NZ infants aged approximately 6–9 weeks. Although exclusive breastfeeding is likely to provide greater protection against SUDI, we used "any breastfeeding" at 2 months as the marker for protective breastfeeding behaviour. This was because the only estimate available in the literature of the relative risk of SUDI amongst infants who are breastfed was for "any breastfeeding" at 2 months.

### Predictors of and reasons for pacifier use in first-time mothers: an observational study [^1135GaJo]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Sample

Participants were mothers and infants enrolled in the NOURISH study which has been described elsewhere. NOURISH is a multi-centre, RCT evaluating the efficacy of a community-based intervention that encouraged positive feeding practices that promote healthy infant food preferences and intakes (Australasian Clinical Trials Registration ACTRN 1260800056392). Subjects were recruited in a two-phase process in Adelaide, South Australia and Brisbane, Queensland, Australia (Figure 1). A consecutive sample of eligible mothers was first approached in public and private hospitals, after delivery of their infant from February until June 2008 and September 2008 until March 2009. The first approach requested consent and details for later contact. Consenting mothers were contacted again when their baby reached four to seven months for full enrolment and baseline assessment prior to allocation to the trial. Eligibility criteria included medically healthy primiparous birth, infant born at 37 or more weeks gestation and birth weight of at least 2500 g; mother aged 18 years or more with good written and verbal English skills and residing in (or near) Adelaide or Brisbane. Mother-infant pairs were excluded if the infant was diagnosed with a congenital abnormality or chronic condition that was likely to influence development, including feeding ability, or if the mother self-reported eating or mental health disorders. Approval was obtained from the ethics committees at both Flinders University and Queensland University of Technology, and each recruitment hospital.

Figure 1
Subject Recruitment Flowchart. Figure 1 *causes of ineligibility after initial consent included diagnosis of postnatal depression, or infant health problems, or family moving away from the region.

Data collection

Data collected at first contact from both consenting and, where possible, non-consenting mothers included maternal age and relationship status at infant's birth, highest level of education attained, country of birth and infant gender. Those consenting to full enrolment completed the baseline assessment which included a self-administered questionnaire. A combination of evidence from the literature and expert opinion was used to develop four questions on pacifier use. One open-ended question asked for the age at which the pacifier was first given. Three pre-coded questions considered frequency of pacifier use, who (if anyone) advised the mother to give her infant a pacifier and the reasons for giving a pacifier. An 'other' category was included in the pre-coded questions to ensure that all responses were captured.

### Predictors of and reasons for pacifier use in first-time mothers: an observational study [^1117edRp]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Breastfeeding is known to be the ideal form of infant nutrition, not only because of its direct nutritional benefits to the infant, but also for its immune-protective and numerous other physiological benefits to the infant and mother. In Australia, results of the 2004–2005 National Health Survey indicate that while 87.8% of mothers initiated breastfeeding, only half of infants (50.4%) were being breastfed to some extent at 6 months of age. Pacifier use has been shown to have a strong negative association with decreased exclusive and overall breastfeeding duration. The early introduction of a pacifier rather than pacifier use per se appears to be strongly associated with shortened duration of breastfeeding. One of few randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating this association reported a shorter overall breastfeeding duration in infants introduced to the pacifier by four weeks compared to those introduced from five weeks (adjHR 1.22; 95% CI 1.03–1.44). Similarly, a longitudinal study from Australia found shorter duration of breastfeeding to be associated with pacifier introduction prior to but not after 10 weeks of age. A dose-related effect has been observed in four observational studies, where frequent pacifier use shows a stronger negative association with breastfeeding duration than occasional or infrequent use.

### Does pacifier use in infancy decrease the risk of obesity? [^112r8rhn]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Nonnutritive sucking using a finger or pacifier is a natural reflex for infants. We hypothesized that infants may overfeed if the bottle or breast is constantly offered. Our goal was to determine whether pacifier use in early infancy is associated with lower incidence of obesity at later age.

Methods

Parents of 399 infants, 9 to 15 months old, were interviewed and asked whether a pacifier was used consistently for ≥ 9 months. Body mass indexes at birth, 6 months, and on the day of interview were calculated.

Results

In all, 204 (51%) infants used a pacifier, and 195 (49%) were nonusers. More infants in the nonuser group were either overweight-40 (21%)-or obese-32 (16%)-than in the user group-22 (11%) and 22 (11%), respectively (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Pacifier use in infancy was associated with lower incidence of obesity at 9 to 15 months of age. Offering a pacifier can be protective against infantile obesity.
