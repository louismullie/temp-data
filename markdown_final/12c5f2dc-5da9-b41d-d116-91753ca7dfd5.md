## Question

Biktavy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Biktarvy (bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify labeled indications and key exclusions. Next, I will review dosing by weight and special populations, including pregnancy and renal/hepatic impairment. After that, I need to check safety, adverse effects, and boxed warnings. I will then examine drug–drug interactions and administration pearls. Finally, I should consider pediatric-specific guidance, resistance considerations, and real-world or case-based context, and close with a concise clinical summary and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and mechanism. Biktarvy is a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, both NRTIs, providing a complete once-daily regimen for HIV-1 treatment in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg, with bictegravir inhibiting integrase to prevent proviral integration and FTC/TAF inhibiting reverse transcriptase via chain termination [^3065de23] [^90585d1f].

> I need to verify the labeled indications and exclusions. Biktarvy is indicated as a complete regimen for HIV-1 in treatment-naïve patients, in treatment-experienced patients not virologically suppressed provided there is no resistance to INSTIs, FTC, or tenofovir, and as a switch strategy in virologically suppressed patients with no resistance to bictegravir or tenofovir; importantly, it is not indicated for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, and I should double-check that I don't inadvertently imply PrEP use here, which would be incorrect [^3065de23] [^1d8bc462].

> Next, I should review dosing by weight and special populations. For adults and pediatrics weighing at least 25 kg, the dose is 50 mg bictegravir/200 mg emtricitabine/25 mg tenofovir alafenamide once daily with or without food; for children 14 kg to less than 25 kg, the lower-strength tablet is 30 mg/120 mg/15 mg once daily, and tablets can be split if needed with all parts ingested within about 10 minutes, but crushing is not recommended due to bioequivalence concerns and potential underexposure to FTC and TAF [^bafb4c62] [^30f030be] [^b61bfbd9].

> Hold on, I should verify renal and hepatic restrictions. Biktarvy is not recommended in severe renal impairment (eGFR 15–29 mL/min) or in end-stage renal disease not on chronic hemodialysis, and is not recommended in severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C); in virologically suppressed adults on chronic hemodialysis, use is supported with post-dialysis dosing, but this is not a blanket endorsement for all ESRD contexts, so I need to be precise here [^299148df] [^bafb4c62].

> I will now examine pregnancy considerations. Wait, let me verify exposure changes and monitoring. During pregnancy, bictegravir exposure is lower, particularly in the third trimester, yet exposures remain above the protein-adjusted IC90; no dose change is indicated, but viral load should be monitored closely due to reduced exposure, and placental transfer is high with no signal for increased teratogenicity in available data [^c8218518] [^299148df].

> Next, I should review safety and adverse effects. Common adverse reactions include diarrhea, nausea, and headache, with low discontinuation rates in trials; laboratory signals include mild bilirubin increases and creatine kinase elevations, and weight gain has been reported and may carry cardiometabolic implications with long-term use; rare events include insomnia or anxiety leading to discontinuation in pediatric cohorts, and isolated case reports of rhabdomyolysis and pancreatitis exist, though causality is uncertain and multifactorial in many cases [^b21f1d9b] [^6fb62f10] [^bbcd4f2e].

> But wait, what about boxed warnings and serious risks. I should confirm the hepatitis B warning. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B can occur after discontinuation of products containing FTC or tenofovir, including Biktarvy; patients with HBV coinfection require close hepatic monitoring for several months after stopping therapy and consideration of anti-HBV therapy if indicated, which is a critical counseling point to prevent decompensation [^790daa0b] [^e922abd2].

> I need to check drug–drug interactions carefully. Biktarvy is contraindicated with dofetilide due to OCT2/MATE1 inhibition increasing dofetilide levels and with rifampin due to induction lowering bictegravir exposure and risking resistance; strong CYP3A/UGT1A1 inducers can reduce bictegravir levels, whereas strong inhibitors can increase them, and TAF is a P-gp/BCRP substrate, so coadministration with strong P-gp/BCRP inhibitors or inducers can alter TAF exposure; antacids and divalent cations can chelate bictegravir and reduce absorption, so spacing is required when given on an empty stomach, though coadministration with food mitigates this issue [^2f1fd024] [^c083acd6] [^1022f2d9].

> Let me consider pediatric-specific guidance and formulation handling. Biktarvy is preferred initial therapy for children weighing at least 14 kg who can swallow pills, with two weight-based strengths and the option to split tablets; crushing is discouraged due to loss of bioequivalence for FTC and TAF, and for children under 14 kg or under 2 years, safety and efficacy are not established, with studies ongoing; in adolescents, simplicity and small pill size support adherence, which is crucial for sustained virologic suppression [^aede64d3] [^94be747a] [^91e1aa59] [^e4c1a165].

> Hold on, I should verify resistance and switching nuances. Biktarvy has a high barrier to resistance, but it is not currently recommended in settings with documented raltegravir or elvitegravir resistance due to limited clinical data; in patients with prior NRTI resistance, including M184V, Biktarvy may still be appropriate if there are no mutations to bictegravir or tenofovir, and some pediatric guidance allows consideration even with M184V in select contexts, underscoring the need for genotypic testing before switching or initiating in treatment-experienced patients [^125552fe] [^3e232206] [^1eaef32a].

> I should double-check real-world and case-based context to ensure clinical relevance. Case reports document successful virologic outcomes with Biktarvy in advanced HIV presentations, including cerebral toxoplasmosis, and inpatient studies highlight that single-tablet INSTI regimens reduce certain types of medication errors compared with multi-tablet regimens, though errors still occur and pharmacist oversight remains essential; these data reinforce the value of regimen simplicity and structured inpatient protocols [^c4c93c9e] [^b2b70c72].

> Let me synthesize a concise clinical summary. Biktarvy is a once-daily, single-tablet, complete HIV-1 regimen with a high barrier to resistance and a favorable safety profile, suitable for treatment-naïve patients, appropriately selected treatment-experienced patients without resistance to its components, and as a switch strategy in virologically suppressed patients; key exclusions include severe renal or hepatic impairment, rifampin coadministration, and HBV coinfection without a plan to monitor for post-treatment flares; pediatric use is weight-based with two tablet strengths, and pregnancy requires no dose change but closer viral load monitoring due to lower third-trimester exposures [^3065de23] [^299148df] [^c8218518].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical counseling points are explicit. Advise patients not to stop Biktarvy without clinician supervision, especially if HBV coinfection is present; review all prescription, OTC, and herbal products for interactions, particularly rifampin, antacids, and divalent cation supplements; reinforce adherence to avoid resistance; and instruct caregivers on proper tablet splitting if needed, avoiding crushing to preserve exposure, with administration with food to mitigate cation chelation when appropriate [^e922abd2] [^1022f2d9] [^30f030be].

Biktarvy (bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) is a **once-daily, single-tablet regimen** for HIV-1 in adults and children ≥ 14 kg, including treatment-naïve patients, those switching from suppressed regimens, and some treatment-experienced patients without resistance to its components [^3065de23] [^1d8bc462]. It is **not for PrEP** and is contraindicated with dofetilide or rifampin [^2f1fd024]. Common adverse effects are diarrhea, nausea, and headache; monitor for renal and hepatic function, and use caution with HBV coinfection due to risk of severe flare on discontinuation [^b21f1d9b] [^790daa0b]. Dosing is weight-based in pediatrics, with two strengths available, and no dose adjustment is needed in mild renal or hepatic impairment [^bafb4c62] [^1c4ad04f].

---

## Composition and mechanism of action

Biktarvy combines three agents: **bictegravir**, an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) that blocks HIV DNA integration; **emtricitabine**, an NRTI that inhibits reverse transcriptase; and **tenofovir alafenamide**, an NRTI prodrug with high intracellular active metabolite levels and a favorable renal and bone safety profile compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^90585d1f] [^dfcc7eb6].

---

## Indications and approved use

Biktarvy is indicated as a **complete regimen** for HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing ≥ 14 kg:

- **Treatment-naïve patients**: No prior ART history [^3065de23].
- **Virologically suppressed patients**: Switch from a stable regimen with no resistance to bictegravir or tenofovir [^3065de23].
- **Treatment-experienced patients**: Not virologically suppressed, with no known or suspected resistance to INSTIs, emtricitabine, or tenofovir [^3065de23].

Biktarvy is **not indicated for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)** [^notfound].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Biktarvy demonstrates **high efficacy** across diverse populations:

- **Treatment-naïve adults**: In trials 1489 and 1490, Biktarvy achieved high rates of virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) at 144 weeks, comparable to dolutegravir-based regimens [^notfound].
- **Virologically suppressed adults**: Switch studies (trials 1844, 1878, 4030) showed non-inferiority to continuing prior regimens, maintaining suppression through 48 weeks [^da0ef400].
- **Pediatric patients**: In IMPAACT 2019, Biktarvy maintained suppression in children and adolescents, with safety and exposure similar to adults [^notfound].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Biktarvy is **generally well tolerated**. Common adverse effects include:

| **Adverse effect** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Diarrhea | Common |
| Nausea | Common |
| Headache | Common |
| Fatigue | Common |
| Insomnia | Common |

---

Serious adverse effects are rare and include **renal impairment**, **lactic acidosis**, and **hepatic steatosis**. Weight gain has been reported, particularly in combination with other INSTIs [^6fb62f10].

---

## Drug interactions

Biktarvy has **few clinically significant interactions** but key contraindications and precautions apply:

- **Contraindications**: Dofetilide (increased plasma concentrations, risk of arrhythmias) and rifampin (reduced bictegravir exposure, risk of resistance) [^2f1fd024].
- **Caution**: Coadministration with drugs that affect renal function or compete for renal tubular secretion (e.g. aminoglycosides, high-dose NSAIDs) [^e922abd2].
- **Antacids and supplements**: Separate dosing by at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after antacids, iron, calcium, magnesium, or zinc to avoid chelation and reduced absorption [^1022f2d9].

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Biktarvy is considered safe during pregnancy, with no dose adjustment required. Exposure is reduced in the third trimester, so viral load should be monitored closely [^c8218518] [^299148df].
- **Pediatrics**: Approved for children ≥ 14 kg, with weight-based dosing (30/120/15 mg for 14– < 25 kg; 50/200/25 mg for ≥ 25 kg) [^bafb4c62] [^1d8bc462].
- **Elderly**: No dose adjustment is required, but renal function should be monitored [^b2f54379].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Not recommended in severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease not on dialysis [^299148df].
- **Hepatic impairment**: Not recommended in severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [^299148df].
- **HBV coinfection**: Risk of severe acute exacerbation upon discontinuation; monitor hepatic function and consider anti-HBV therapy if indicated [^790daa0b].

---

## Comparison with other antiretroviral regimens

Biktarvy is **preferred over many alternatives** due to its once-daily dosing, high efficacy, favorable safety profile, and minimal drug interactions. Compared with dolutegravir-based regimens, Biktarvy offers similar efficacy with fewer pills and no requirement for pharmacokinetic boosters. Compared with protease inhibitor-based regimens, Biktarvy has fewer metabolic and gastrointestinal side effects.

---

Biktarvy is a **highly effective, well-tolerated, once-daily single-tablet regimen** for HIV-1, suitable for a broad range of patients, including treatment-naïve individuals, those switching from suppressed regimens, and some treatment-experienced patients without resistance to its components. It is not for PrEP and requires caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment or HBV coinfection.

8.5	Geriatric Use

Clinical trials in virologically-suppressed participants (Trials 4449, 1844, and 1878) included 111 participants aged 65 years and over who received BIKTARVY, including 86 patients from an open-label, single-arm trial of participants aged 65 years and over who were switched from their previous antiretroviral regimen to BIKTARVY [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Of the total number of BIKTARVY-treated patients in these trials, 100 (90%) were 65 to 74 years of age, and 11 (10%) were 75 to 84 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly participants and adults between 18 and less than 65 years of age, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

14.3 Use in Individuals with an Antiretroviral Treatment History and Not Virologically-Suppressed

Use of BIKTARVY in those with an antiretroviral treatment history and not virologically suppressed is supported by a scientific rationale that this population is expected to have similar virologic response rates to those with no history of antiretroviral treatment provided that the virus is susceptible to the individual components of the regimen. Because limited clinical trial data are available supporting the efficacy of BIKTARVY in patients with baseline INSTI resistance substitutions, this indication states use in individuals with an antiretroviral treatment history and who are not virologically suppressed with no evidence of known or suspected substitutions associated with resistance to the INSTI class, rather than only to bictegravir. Additionally, this indication states the individuals should have no known or suspected substitutions associated with resistance to emtricitabine, or tenofovir [see Clinical Studies (14.2 and 14.5)].

14.4	Clinical Trial Results in Adults with Virologically-Suppressed HIV-1 Who Switched to BIKTARVY

In Trial 1844, the efficacy and safety of switching from a regimen of DTG + ABC/3TC or ABC/DTG/3TC to BIKTARVY were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind trial of virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) HIV-1 infected adults (N = 563, randomized and dosed). Participants must have been stably suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on their baseline regimen for at least 3 months prior to trial entry and had no history of treatment failure. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either switch to BIKTARVY (containing 50 mg of BIC, 200 mg of FTC, and 25 mg of TAF) at baseline (N = 282), or stay on their baseline antiretroviral regimen (N = 281). Participants had a mean age of 45 years (range 20–71), 89% were male, 73% were White, and 22% were Black. 17% of participants identified as Hispanic/Latino. The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 723 cells per mm³(range 124–2444).

1	INDICATIONS AND USAGE

BIKTARVY is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg:

with no antiretroviral treatment history, or
with an antiretroviral treatment history and not virologically suppressed, with no known or suspected substitutions associated with resistance to the integrase strand inhibitor class, emtricitabine, or tenofovir, or
to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no known or suspected substitutions associated with resistance to bictegravir or tenofovir [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

BIKTARVY is a three-drug combination of bictegravir (BIC), a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), and emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), both HIV-1 nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg:

with no antiretroviral treatment history or
with an antiretroviral treatment history and not virologically suppressed, with no known or suspected substitutions associated with resistance to the integrase strand inhibitor class, emtricitabine, or tenofovir, or

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of BIKTARVY have been established as a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg:

who have no antiretroviral treatment history, or
with an antiretroviral treatment history and not virologically suppressed, with no known or suspected substitutions associated with resistance to the integrase strand inhibitor class, emtricitabine, or tenofovir, or
to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no known or suspected resistance to bictegravir or tenofovir [see Indications and Usage (1), and Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

Use of BIKTARVY in pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg is supported by the following:

trials in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.3)]
an open-label trial in three age-based cohorts of virologically-suppressed pediatric participants [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]
Cohort 1: 12 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 35 kg receiving BIKTARVY through Week 48 (N = 50),
Cohort 2: 6 to less than 12 years of age and weighing at least 25 kg receiving BIKTARVY through Week 24 (N = 50), and
Cohort 3: at least 2 years of age and weighing at least 14 to less than 25 kg through Week 24 (N = 22). No pediatric participants 2 years of age were enrolled; of the 6 pediatric participants who were 3 years of age at enrollment, 3 participants weighed between 14 to less than 15 kg.

The safety and efficacy of BIKTARVY in these pediatric participants were similar to that in adults, and there was no clinically significant change in exposure for the components of BIKTARVY [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Safety and effectiveness of BIKTARVY in pediatric patients weighing less than 14 kg have not been established.

Dosing — splitting, dissolving, or crushing Biktarvy tablets — For children unable to swallow a whole tablet, the tablet can be split and all parts ingested within approximately 10 minutes; dissolving BIC/FTC/TAF tablets may be an alternative, but crushing tablets is not recommended. In a Phase 1 open‑label, single‑dose, three‑period crossover randomized trial of 18 adults without HIV, dissolved Biktarvy (BIC 50 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 25 mg) had AUC considered bioequivalent for all ARV components; dissolved Cmax was bioequivalent for BIC and FTC, but the TAF Cmax 90% lower confidence limit was not (dissolved vs. solid ratio, 96% [90% CI, 74% to 124%]). For crushed tablets mixed with applesauce, the BIC component was considered bioequivalent for AUC and Cmax.

2.1	 Testing When Initiating and During Treatment with BIKTARVY

Prior to or when initiating BIKTARVY, test patients for hepatitis B virus infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Prior to or when initiating BIKTARVY, and during treatment with BIKTARVY, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein in all patients as clinically appropriate. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

2.2 	Recommended Dosage in Adults and Pediatric Patients Weighing at Least 25 kg

BIKTARVY is a three-drug fixed dose combination product containing bictegravir (BIC), emtricitabine (FTC), and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). The recommended dosage of BIKTARVY is one tablet containing 50 mg of BIC, 200 mg of FTC, and 25 mg of TAF taken orally once daily with or without food in [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]:

adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 25 kg with an estimated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL/min; or
virologically-suppressed adults with an estimated creatinine clearance below 15 mL/min who are receiving chronic hemodialysis. On days of hemodialysis, administer the daily dose of BIKTARVY after completion of hemodialysis treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 	Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients Weighing at Least 14 kg to Less than 25 kg

Clinical Trials in Adults with Virologically-Suppressed HIV-1

The safety of BIKTARVY in virologically-suppressed adults was based on Week 48 data from 282 participants in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial (Trial 1844) in which virologically-suppressed participants were switched from either DTG + ABC/3TC or ABC/DTG/3TC to BIKTARVY; Week 48 data from 290 participants in an open-label, active-controlled trial in which virologically-suppressed participants were switched from a regimen containing atazanavir (ATV) (given with cobicistat or ritonavir) or darunavir (DRV) (given with cobicistat or ritonavir) plus either FTC/TDF or ABC/3TC, to BIKTARVY (Trial 1878); and Week 48 data from a randomized, double-blind active-controlled trial in which 284 virologically-suppressed participants were switched from DTG plus either FTC/TAF or FTC/TDF, to BIKTARVY (Trial 4030). Overall, the safety profile in virologically-suppressed adult participants in Trials 1844, 1878, and 4030 was similar to that in participants with no antiretroviral treatment history [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

4	CONTRAINDICATIONS

BIKTARVY is contraindicated to be co-administered with:

dofetilide due to the potential for increased dofetilide plasma concentrations and associated serious and/or life-threatening events [see Drug Interactions (7.5)].
rifampin due to decreased BIC plasma concentrations, which may result in the loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance to BIKTARVY [see Drug Interactions (7.5)].

BIKTARVY is contraindicated to be co-administered with:

dofetilide. (4)
rifampin. (4)

7.1	Other Antiretroviral Medications

Because BIKTARVY is a complete regimen, coadministration with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is not recommended [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Comprehensive information regarding potential drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications is not provided because the safety and efficacy of concomitant HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy is unknown.

7.2	Potential for BIKTARVY to Affect Other Drugs

BIC inhibits organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 (MATE1) in vitro. Coadministration of BIKTARVY with drugs that are substrates of OCT2 and MATE1 (e.g., dofetilide) may increase their plasma concentrations (see Table 3).

7.3	Potential Effect of Other Drugs on One or More Components of BIKTARVY

BIC is a substrate of CYP3A and UGT1A1. A drug that is a strong inducer of CYP3A and also an inducer of UGT1A1 can substantially decrease the plasma concentrations of BIC which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of BIKTARVY and development of resistance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The use of BIKTARVY with a drug that is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A and also an inhibitor of UGT1A1 may significantly increase the plasma concentrations of BIC.

TAF is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Co-administration of drugs that inhibit P-gp and BCRP may increase the absorption and plasma concentrations of TAF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Co-administration of drugs that induce P-gp activity are expected to decrease the absorption of TAF, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of TAF, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of BIKTARVY and development of resistance (see Table 3).

The primary safety assessment of BIKTARVY was based on data from two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials, Trial 1489 and Trial 1490, that enrolled 1274 adult participants with HIV-1 and no antiretroviral treatment history through Week 144. After Week 144, participants received open-label BIKTARVY in an optional extension phase for an additional 96 weeks (end of study). A total of 634 and 1025 participants received one tablet of BIKTARVY once daily during the double-blind (Week 144) and extension phases, respectively [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

The most common adverse reactions (all Grades) reported in at least 5% of participants in the BIKTARVY group in either Trial 1489 or Trial 1490 were diarrhea, nausea, and headache. The proportion of participants who discontinued treatment through Week 144 with BIKTARVY, abacavir [ABC]/dolutegravir [DTG]/ lamivudine [3TC]), or DTG + FTC/TAF, due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 1%, 2%, and 2%, respectively. Table 1 displays the frequency of adverse reactions (all Grades) greater than or equal to 2% in the BIKTARVY group.

Additional adverse reactions (all Grades) occurring in less than 2% of participants administered BIKTARVY in Trials 1489 and 1490 included vomiting, flatulence, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, rash, and depression.

Suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and depression suicidal occurred in 2% of participants administered BIKTARVY; these events occurred primarily in participants with a preexisting history of depression, prior suicide attempt or psychiatric illness.

The majority (84%) of adverse events associated with BIKTARVY were Grade 1.

Adverse reactions in the open-label extension phases of Trials 1489 and 1490 were similar to those observed in participants administered BIKTARVY in the Week 144 analysis.

2.4	Recommended Dosage in Pregnant Individuals

The recommended dosage of BIKTARVY in pregnant individuals is one tablet containing 50 mg of BIC, 200 mg of FTC, and 25 mg of TAF taken orally once daily with or without food in pregnant individuals who are virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no known substitutions associated with resistance to any of the individual components of BIKTARVY. Lower exposures of BIKTARVY were observed during pregnancy; therefore, viral load should be monitored closely [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5 Not Recommended in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment

BIKTARVY is not recommended in patients with [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]:

severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance of 15 to below 30 mL/min); or
end stage renal disease (ESRD; estimated creatinine clearance below 15 mL/min who are not receiving chronic hemodialysis; or
no antiretroviral treatment history and ESRD who are receiving chronic hemodialysis.

17	PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Post-treatment Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Participants with HBV

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients with HBV and HIV-1 who have discontinued products containing FTC and/or TDF, and may likewise occur with discontinuation of BIKTARVY [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Advise the patient to not discontinue BIKTARVY without first informing their healthcare provider.

Drug Interactions

BIKTARVY may interact with certain drugs; therefore, advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other prescription or non-prescription medication or herbal products including St. John's wort [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately of any symptoms of infection, as in some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Renal Impairment

Advise patients to avoid taking BIKTARVY with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic agents. Postmarketing cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure, have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with use of drugs similar to BIKTARVY. Advise patients that they should stop BIKTARVY if they develop clinical symptoms suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Missed Dosage

Inform patients that it is important to take BIKTARVY on a regular dosing schedule with or without food and to avoid missing doses as it can result in development of resistance [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Tablet Splitting

Advise caregivers that, for children unable to swallow a whole tablet, the tablet can be split and each part taken separately as long as all parts are ingested within approximately 10 minutes [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Pregnancy Registry

Inform patients that there is an antiretroviral pregnancy registry to monitor fetal outcomes of pregnant individuals exposed to BIKTARVY [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Biktarvy adverse effects — frequency and notable events list more common diarrhea, nausea, and headache, and report that in two clinical trials, total bilirubin increased by up to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal in 12% of adults who received Biktarvy, with increases that were mild and did not lead to drug discontinuations in these trials. BIC may cause an increase in creatine kinase concentration. Rare events cited include one participant out of 201 in a postmarketing observational study in adults with thrombocytopenia and 1 participant out of 100 in a prospective cohort study in children and adolescents with insomnia/anxiety leading to drug discontinuation. Weight gain has been reported in adults who were receiving Biktarvy, with an associated increased risk of cardiometabolic complications.

In Trial 1878, the efficacy and safety of switching from either ABC/3TC or FTC/TDF (200/300 mg) plus ATV or DRV (given with either cobicistat or ritonavir) to BIKTARVY (containing 50 mg of BIC, 200 mg of FTC, and 25 mg of TAF) were evaluated in a randomized, open-label study of virologically-suppressed HIV-1 infected adults (N = 577, randomized and dosed). Participants must have been stably suppressed on their baseline regimen for at least 6 months, must not have been previously treated with any INSTI, and had no history of treatment failure. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either switch to BIKTARVY (N = 290) or stay on their baseline antiretroviral regimen (N = 287). Participants had a mean age of 46 years (range 20–79), 83% were male, 66% were White, and 26% were Black. 19% of participants identified as Hispanic/Latino. The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 663 cells per mm³(range 62–2582). Participants were stratified by prior treatment regimen. At screening, 15% of participants were receiving ABC/3TC plus ATV or DRV (given with either cobicistat or ritonavir) and 85% of participants were receiving FTC/TDF plus ATV or DRV (given with either cobicistat or ritonavir).

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^e4c1a165]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Practical and clinical considerations for initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in adolescents emphasize adherence support and regimen simplicity; clinicians should provide the education and support that caregivers and adolescents need to administer or take ARVs correctly and adhere to the ART regimen, and adolescents may have difficulty adhering to daily oral medications, with the number of pills and the pill size being important considerations. When selecting an initial regimen, the clinician should understand whether the adolescent will be supervised or is expected to take treatment independently; preferred initial therapy with a single tablet dosed once daily helps maintain adherence and viral suppression, and Biktarvy is one of the smallest FDC single‑tablet regimens currently available. Additional issues include confidentiality and insurance barriers: some adolescents live with caregivers who are not aware of their diagnosis and may use a parent or caregiver's insurance, communications can compromise confidentiality and result in accidental disclosure, clinicians and social workers need to work around this and may assist in establishing access to HIV drugs and/or health insurance, and some adolescents may be emancipated and need access to affordable health insurance.

Biktarvy drug interactions — antacids and divalent cations explain that administering BIC concurrently with antacids lowers the plasma concentrations of BIC due to formation of complexes in the gastrointestinal tract, and chelation by high concentrations of divalent cations such as iron decreases absorption of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), including elvitegravir and BIC. For this reason, Biktarvy should be administered at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after antacids and supplements or multivitamins that contain iron, calcium, aluminum, magnesium, and/or zinc when Biktarvy is given on an empty stomach, and Biktarvy and antacids or supplements that contain calcium or iron can be taken together with food.

Methods

Procedures

The study employed a methodology adapted from Morath et al. which examined drug-related information provided by ChatGPT via three independent raters. Across June and July 2023, 38 question prompts were input into four AI-based platforms (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4.0, Google Bard, and HIV.gov Chatbot) on the same day of the week, once a week, for four weeks. Each question prompt was individually input in a new chat, and all questions and responses were collected and recorded verbatim by platform and by week. This process culminated in 608 responses (38 prompts × 4 platforms × 4 weeks). For this study, questions were designed to examine the safety, efficacy, and side effects of antiretroviral medications to prevent and treat HIV. Questions focused on: (i) general information on antiretroviral medication safety (e.g. " Is Biktarvy® safe? "), (ii) the efficacy of antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV (e.g. " How well does Biktarvy ® work? "), (iii) the efficacy of antiretroviral medications for the prevention of HIV (" How well does Descovy ® work for PrEP? "), and (iv) general information on antiretroviral medication side effects (e.g. " What are the side effects of Descovy ® for PrEP? "). This study focused on tenofovir-based drugs, and prompts included both generic and brand names for the five most commonly used drugs (Biktarvy ®, Descovy ®, Genvoya ®, Odefsey ®, Truvada ®), based on global pharmaceutical sales data.

### Severe rhabdomyolysis and acute asymptomatic pancreatitis following the concomitant use of biktarvy in the setting of hyperosmolar diabetic crisis [^bbcd4f2e]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Biktarvy (bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafemanide), which has been recently approved for the treatment of HIV, is a single-pill regimen that associates bictegravir and a novel integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) with a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafemanide. Among treatment complications, rhabdomyolysis has been reported in association with some NRTI and INSTI but never with bictegravir. Acute pancreatitis has also been reported recently with another INSTI, dolutegravir. We report here a 62-year-old man with diabetes and HIV infection, and receiving Biktarvy for 1month. He presented to the emergency department for muscular pain and fatigue. He was on treatment with Descovy (tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine) and Viramune (nevirapine) for 2years but he recently asked for a regimen simplification. Severe rhabdomyolysis and acute pancreatitis were diagnosed. Although the aetiology of these events could be multifactorial, it cannot be ruled out that this episode could be linked to a potential side effect of bictegravir.

Pediatric HIV virologic failure with resistance — regimen options require at least two fully active agents, and if nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are not fully active, options include a second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) plus TAF/FTC or TDF/XTC if able to take TAF or TDF, a second-generation INSTI plus two NRTIs with a boosted protease inhibitor (PI), or a second-generation INSTI with a boosted PI based on resistance results. Consider etravirine (ETR) or rilpivirine (RPV) based on resistance results, age, and weight, consider maraviroc (MVC) if additional active drug(s) are needed, and consider off-label use of approved agents or enrollment in clinical trials for novel antiretroviral treatments. When modifying antiretroviral (ARV) regimens in children with chronic hepatitis B/HIV coinfection, the new regimen must contain agents active against hepatitis B. In adolescents, the possibility of planned and unplanned pregnancy should be considered when selecting an antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen. Regarding INSTI selection, raltegravir (RAL), a first-generation INSTI, has a low barrier to resistance and requires twice-daily dosing in children and adolescents, whereas the second-generation INSTIs bictegravir (BIC) and dolutegravir (DTG) have a higher barrier to resistance and only require once-daily dosing, and many members of the Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living With HIV recommend the single tablet regimen BIC/FTC/TAF (Biktarvy) in children with prior treatment failure who have virus with the M184 mutation.

Mechanism of Action

Bictegravir: BIC inhibits the strand transfer activity of HIV-1 integrase (integrase strand transfer inhibitor; INSTI), an HIV-1 encoded enzyme that is required for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the integration of linear HIV-1 DNA into host genomic DNA, blocking the formation of the HIV-1 provirus and propagation of the virus.

Emtricitabine: FTC, a synthetic nucleoside analog of cytidine, is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate. Emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate inhibits the activity of the HIV-1 RT by competing with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate and by being incorporated into nascent viral DNA which results in chain termination. Emtricitabine 5′-triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α, β, Ɛ, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.

Tenofovir Alafenamide: TAF is a phosphonamidate prodrug of tenofovir (2′-deoxyadenosine monophosphate analog). Plasma exposure to TAF allows for permeation into cells and then TAF is intracellularly converted to tenofovir through hydrolysis by cathepsin A. Tenofovir is subsequently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV-1 replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV RT, which results in DNA chain-termination. Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases that include mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ and there is no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in cell culture.

### HIV prevention and treatment information from four artificial intelligence platforms: a thematic analysis [^c22de33b]. AIDS and Behavior (2025). Medium credibility.

Descriptive information about HIV medications. This theme centered around information directly related to specific aspects of the medications, such as the medication's composition, class, or the pharmaceutical company that produces the medication. Descriptions regarding the individual compounds that comprise the referenced medications were most common. These responses ranged from providing a list of the internal chemical composition (e.g. bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir) to full explanations of the purpose of each component in preventing or treating HIV. The least commonly referenced medication information was the drug manufacturer and additional information about the drug's development and testing. Information regarding the medication's dosing information was also more commonly presented by Google Bard.

Information about medication usage. Many responses contained in-depth information about the medication's intended purpose to either prevent HIV for populations at-risk of contracting HIV or for treatment among those living with HIV. Additionally, for PrEP-focused responses there was often a reference to the medication's target population (e.g. men who have sex with men) and transmission type (e.g. injection drug use or sexual contact). Less commonly referenced were any additional factors that influenced the medication's intended dosing information (e.g. weight range).

Safety and efficacy. Across AI platforms there was consistent agreement that HIV medications are safe for the purposes of both treatment and prevention. Notably, each platform was also uniform in its recommendations to consult additional resources in the form of medical professionals or reputable health organizations. These recommendations were present in response to questions about HIV medication safety broadly as well as questions about the safety of specific medications.

All AI platforms agreed that medications to prevent and treat HIV are generally safe, effective, and are crucial for managing HIV. Additionally, AI platforms agreed that Truvada and Descovy were highly effective in preventing HIV transmission when used as prescribed. However, there were multiple instances in which Biktarvy ®, Genvoya ®, and Odefsey ® were mistakenly identified as medications that had been approved and could be prescribed for PrEP. Table 2 provides examples of the variable presentation of safety information across platforms.

### Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling combined with Swiss HIV cohort study data supports No dose adjustment of bictegravir in elderly individuals living with HIV [^5dcbe2b7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Uncertainty exists whether the dose of the novel integrase inhibitor bictegravir would need to be adjusted based on the age of the treated individual.

Our clinical data demonstrated an unchanged drug exposure in the elderly compared with the young PLWH group, which confirms sparse clinical data mentioned in the Biktarvy label. 5 The exposure of other anti‐HIV drugs, such as dolutegravir, were also demonstrated to be unchanged with advanced age. 20 However, one general limitation of clinical studies in the elderly is that usually two age groups (young vs. elderly) are compared, but aging is a continuous process. 7 Longitudinal data with each subject as an own control would be necessary, which is not practical or feasible. We used a verified PBPK modeling approach to overcome these hurdles, for which the predictive performance was verified with clinically observed data from the SHCS.

Clinically observed data of bictegravir were generally within the 95% CI except for dosing regimens with 5 mg and 600 mg. The underprediction and overprediction of C max at different doses can be explained by nonlinear absorption process, 6 which was not implemented into the model due to a lack of available in vitro data. Only empirical simulations would be possible, which is against the primary aim of this work to predict bictegravir pharmacokinetics with advanced age. As it can be seen from Table S2, the model predicts dose‐escalation of bictegravir between 25 and 300 mg within 1.5‐fold of clinically observed data, which was judged sufficient to scale the model to the elderly. Furthermore, the dose does not change in elderly individuals to below 25 mg or above 300 mg, so that age‐related changes in the nonlinearity of the absorption of bictegravir will likely not play a role. Importantly, our bictegravir model predicted the interindividual variability of bictegravir concentration in young and elderly PLWH within the 95% CI (Figure 1) and thus, the model performance was considered appropriate to predict the continuous effect of advanced aging on bictegravir pharmacokinetics.

Practical and clinical considerations — formulations and administration for pediatric initial regimens: The availability of FDC formulations and method of administration are important considerations in the selection of a Preferred initial regimen. BIC/FTC/TAF (Biktarvy) is a single-tablet regimen for children weighing ≥ 14 kg; the tablet may not be crushed or dissolved; however, it can be split in half prior to dosing for ease of swallowing, and it is available in two formulations for children able to swallow pills, including BIC 30 mg/FTC 120 mg/TAF 15 mg for children weighing ≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg and BIC 50 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 25 mg for children weighing ≥ 25 kg. ABC/DTG/3TC (Triumeq PD) is a dispersible tablet that can be used in children weighing < 25 kg and should be dissolved in water; each tablet contains all three drugs and the number of tablets per dose is based on a child's weight. ABC/DTG/3TC (Triumeq) is a nondispersible, single-tablet regimen option for children weighing ≥ 25 kg who are able to swallow whole pills; however, a disadvantage is the larger pill size, which can make swallowing challenging compared with the other recommended options. DTG plus FTC/TAF is dosed once daily; DTG is available as dispersible tablets (Tivicay PD) and as a film-coated tablet (Tivicay), and FTC/TAF (Descovy) is available in two different strengths as a single tablet to be swallowed.

### Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling to support the clinical management of drug-drug interactions with bictegravir [^0a891da3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Bictegravir is a novel integrase inhibitor that was approved in 2018 in the Unites States and Europe. The combination of bictegravir with the two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine (Biktarvy) is recommended as an initial treatment regimen for most people living with HIV (PLWH) by the US and European guidelines.

One general concern with HIV treatment is drug–drug interactions (DDI) with other concomitant drugs, which can lead to drug adverse events or loss of efficacy. Bictegravir has no known inhibitory or inducing effect on drug metabolizing enzymes. Coadministration of bictegravir with substrates of the active organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and the multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 (MATE1) may increase their plasma concentration as bictegravir was shown to inhibit both transporters in vitro. The metabolism of bictegravir is mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A and uridine diphosphate‐glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1, and therefore bictegravir exposure can be altered by inhibitors and inducers of both enzymes. Only limited DDI studies were conducted during the clinical development of bictegravir, including the typical strong paradigm inhibitors (e.g. voriconazole and atazanavir) and inducers (e.g. rifampicin) to investigate the "worst case" scenarios. However, the effect of weak or moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A and UGT1A1 on bictegravir exposure is difficult to extrapolate from the existing DDI data. Furthermore, the effect of concomitant drugs with mutually interacting effects on bictegravir exposure is unknown. However, it is of tremendous importance to assess the likelihood and magnitude of any DDI to understand the clinical significance of a given DDI and whether the DDI can be safely managed by dose modifications.

### Oral glucose tolerance test: an informative endpoint or an added burden in metformin drug-drug interaction studies? [^a7192f17]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

As of February 2, 2022, there were a total of 17 metformin DDI studies that included OGTT assessments reported in the University of Washington DIDB (Table S1). Five of these 17 studies reported somewhat altered metformin pharmacokinetics as a result of interactions with the evaluated drugs, but no effect on metformin's OGTT response. Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Biktarvy) increased metformin exposure by ~ 40% but had no effect on the OGTT response in healthy volunteers. Despite the lack of OGTT effect in healthy volunteers, bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide's United States prescribing information (USPI) refers to metformin's prescribing information for assessing the benefit and risk of concomitant use of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide with metformin. Rifampin increased metformin exposure by 13% with no impact on metformin's OGTT response in healthy volunteers. The USPI of rifampin recommends using rifampin with caution in patients with DM, as diabetes management may be more difficult with rifampin concomitant use because rifampin is known to alter blood glucose concentrations. Whether an OGTT is performed or not in healthy volunteers, it seems that the pharmacokinetic DDI or other known relevant pharmacodynamic impact ends up being the driver of the label language, and lack of an effect on OGTT in healthy volunteers does not seem to contribute to informing the label. The other three studies showed small changes in exposure of metformin by the perpetrator drugs, and no effect on the OGTT response was observed. As expected, neither the pharmacokinetic nor the OGTT results are described in the respective drug labels.

The study that suggested altered metformin OGTT response without a change in metformin systemic exposure was with verapamil as a perpetrator. Verapamil was reported to inhibit the ability of metformin to reduce maximum blood glucose concentrations (ΔG max) by 62.5% and decreased the area under the glucose concentration–time curve (ΔAUC gluc) by 238%. Verapamil‐metformin pharmacodynamic interaction (OGTT) is not currently described in verapamil's USPI.

Overall, caution needs to be taken whenever a perpetrator increases metformin systematic exposure and conclusions based on metformin's OGTT response in healthy volunteers that do not seem to have an impact in informing the drug labels.

### Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling combined with Swiss HIV cohort study data supports No dose adjustment of bictegravir in elderly individuals living with HIV [^18eb11b1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Bictegravir, a novel integrase inhibitor against HIV, was approved in 2018 in the United States and Europe. 1, 2 The US and European HIV guidelines recommend the combination of bictegravir, tenofovir alafenamide, and emtricitabine (tradename: Biktarvy) as an initial treatment for most people living with HIV (PLWH). 3, 4 Bictegravir is metabolized equally by CYP3A and UGT1A1, has no inhibitory or inducing potential, and is well tolerated. 5, 6 Thus, bictegravir would be well‐suited for aging PLWH; however, it is mostly uncertain if bictegravir pharmacokinetics change to a clinically relevant extend to justify a dose adjustment based on the age of the treated individual.

Physiological and biological changes characterize the aging process, which alter drug pharmacokinetics. The most significant changes with aging are the decline in hepatic and renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, which result in reduced drug clearance. 7, 8 The activity of metabolizing enzymes and active drug transporters appear to remain unchanged in elderly compared with young individuals. 7, 9

Physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is an accepted approach by the regulatory authorities to investigate clinical scenarios that cannot easily or ethically be studied. 10, 11 Virtual populations inform the PBPK model, which are based on measured organ weights, regional blood flows, and other physiological parameters important to predict drug pharmacokinetics. 7 A combination of measured in vitro and clinically observed in vivo data are used to simulate drug disposition in virtual individuals. 12 Simulation results are compared against clinically observed data to verify the developed model before extrapolating to unknown scenarios of interest.

The aim of the present study was to analyze bictegravir pharmacokinetics in aging PLWH ≥ 55 years using our previously developed PBPK model 12 and to verify bictegravir simulations with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data from PLWH enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS).

### Trends in proportion of Medicare part D claims subject to 340B discounts, 2013–2020 [^f01db0e8]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Manufacturers' issuance of restrictions in the provision of 340B-discounted products to contract pharmacies was found by the Health Resources and Services Administration in violation of the 340B statue and challenged in court. Several cases are pending resolution in appellate courts. If appellate courts, or ultimately the Supreme Court, were to side with manufacturers, as the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit did in early 2023, the 340B program would see a major reversal in the trends observed in this study period. If, however, the agency's interpretation of the 340B statute was upheld, the proportion of claims eligible to 340B discounts would soon approximate that estimated in the latter years of the present study period.

At the therapeutic class level, the distribution of 340B eligibility is consistent with prior research, where antiviral therapies and cancer therapies have the greatest 340B eligibility and ophthalmic agents have the least. This distribution likely stems from the practice location associated with different morbidities — HIV and cancer are more likely to be treated in specialty clinics or hospital outpatient departments that are 340B eligible, while ocular conditions may be treated by general practitioners or ophthalmologists in private, nonhospital-affiliated offices. This distribution is also seen at the drug level among the highest-spend Part D drugs, where the antiretroviral bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Biktarvy [Gilead]) and the cancer therapies imbrutinib (Imbruvica [AbbVie]) and enzalutamide (Xtandi [Astellas]) have the greatest 340B prescribing and fill rates. Notably, following changesto the limited distribution mechanism in 2018, the share of 340B-eligible imbrutinib prescriptions that were filled at a 340B pharmacy increased, suggesting that the change in the distribution chain may have affected how and where prescriptions were dispensed.

Results for Top-Spending Drugs

Figure 3 and eTable 2 in Supplement 1 show trends in 340B prescribing and filling for the top 10 drugs by Medicare Part D spending in 2020. The HIV treatment bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Biktarvy) was the only top-spend drug with more than 50% of claims prescribed by 340B-affiliated clinicians (Figure 3 A). The next top-spend drugs with the largest proportion of claims prescribed by 340B-affiliated clinicians were the cancer therapies imbrutinib (Imbruvica) and enzalutamide (Xtandi). For the remaining top-spending drugs, rates of 340B prescribing increased following the trend observed for the overall sample, from around 9% to 11% in 2013 to 18% to 23% in 2020.

Figure 3.
Trends in 340B Claim Eligibility, Fill Rates at 340B Pharmacies, and Overall 340B Share in Medicare Part D for High-Spend Drugs, 2013–2020

Calculated from a 5% sample of Medicare Part D claims data and a 340B covered entity database. Included drugs are the top 10 drugs by undiscounted Medicare Part D spending in 2020, as reported in the Medicare Part D dashboard. The 2018 discontinuity for Imbruvica (AbbVie) in the rate at which 340B-eligible claims were filled at 340B pharmacies may be attributable to changes in the formulation and limited distribution mechanism introduced that year.

With the exception of imbrutinib, which was the top-spend drug with the largest capture of claims by 340B pharmacies (73.9% in 2020), rates of prescription filling by 340B pharmacies increased following the results observed for the overall sample, from 18% to 20% in 2013 to 46% to 62% in 2020 (Figure 3 B). As a consequence of these trends in 340B prescribing and capture, the HIV treatment bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide was the top-spend drug with the highest proportion of 340B claims subject to a discount (31.4% in 2020), followed by imbrutinib and enzalutamide (Figure 3 C). With the exception of these 3 drugs, rates of claims subject to 340B discounts increased following the trends observed for the overall sample, from 1% to 2% in 2013 to 9% to 12% in 2020.

### Estimates of medicaid and non-medicaid net prices of top-selling brand-name drugs incorporating best price rebates, 2015 to 2019 [^a2e67cd7]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Including all of the Medicaid estimated rebates, the rebate-related net price discount was 62% of gross price in 2015 per 30-day supply, growing to 70% of gross price in 2019. After accounting for estimated discounts under all federal rebates, Medicaid net spending for this sample was $1.4 billion in 2015, growing 119% to $3.0 billion in 2019. All estimates of gross and net spending in Table 1 are weighted by Medicaid gross spending by product at the NDC-11 level during 2015 to 2019.

We found wide variation in the Medicaid estimated rebate adjustment across drugs. As a percent of gross price per 30-day supply (estimated by AMP), the estimated discounts in 2015 ranged from 23% (Genvoya, Ibrance, and Keytruda) to 83% for the combination inhaler budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort). The 2019 estimated discounts ranged from 24% (Biktarvy) to 100% for apixaban; although surprisingly, 100% discounts can occur. Rebates increased over time for all the study drugs, except for budesonide/formoterol.

Components of Medicaid Rebate-Related Discounts

The largest Medicaid rebates for this study sample were derived from the inflation-linked rebate, which grew from an average of $838 per 30-day supply in 2015 to $1566 in 2019. This reduced the average gross price per 30-day supply by an estimated 42.7% ($1566 of $3667) overall in 2019, with a high of 67.2% ($3297 of $4905) for etanercept (Enbrel). During the study period, only the anticoagulant apixaban (Eliquis) triggered the total rebate cap of 100% of estimated AMP in 2017 to 2019.

Compared with the basic rebate of 23.1% of AMP, the best price provision increased the basic rebate by $46 per 30-day supply in 2015 (1.7% of AMP), rising to $106 per 30-day supply in 2019 (2.9% of AMP). The Medicaid best price provision applied to fewer drugs than did the inflation-linked rebate; however, the best price provision was substantial for several drugs, including apixaban (Eliquis), ustekinumab (Stelara), and empagliflozin (Jardiance).

### An organometallic approach to the synthesis of heteropolycyclic compounds from benzenes [^6279a5fa]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Many of the top-selling pharmaceuticals contain tri-, or tetracyclic molecules with carbon stereocenters incorporated in the polycyclic core. Examples include steroids (e.g. Symbicort, Trelegy, Relvar, Zytiga, Seretide, Mirena, Flixotide, Pulmicort, Premarin, Avodart, Breztri, Faslodex, and Medrol), tri- and tetracyclics incorporating nitrogen heterocycles (e.g. Biktarvy, Tivicay, Triumeq, Latuda, Dovato, Ingrezza, Austedo, Juluca, Cialis, Cabenuva), tetracycline antibiotics, (e.g. Vibramycin, Arestin, Xerava, Seysara, Nuzyra), taxol derivatives (e.g. Abraxane, Jevtana), and tri- and tetracyclic antidepressants (e.g. Ludiomil, Tolvan, Remeron, Coaxil). Other appearances of tricyclic nitrogen cores include the stemonaand lycorinealkaloid families, many of which include the all-cis [6/6/5] coreanalogous to 44 or the all-cis-[6/7/5] coreanalogous to 43. Yet remarkably, synthetic routes to the [6/6/5], [7/6/5], [8/6/5], [6/6/6], [6/6/5/5], [6/7/5/5], [6/6/6/5], and [6/6/6/6] cyclic skeletons (CSK)(regardless of atom type) shown in Figs. 5 and 6 with all-cis ring junctures are practically absent in the chemical literature, likely owing in part to the lack of general methods to prepare them. An important exception is the lycorine family of compounds, for which numerous synthetic approaches have been reported. In particular, Baudoin et al have demonstrated an attractive synthesis of γ-lycorane in which a benzene precursor was hydrogenated to generate the required all-cis stereochemistry. Over- and mis-hydrogenation were competing reactions, and the synthesis of the aromatic precursor required a challenging double Pd-catalyzed C(sp²)-H/C(sp³)-H arylation. In comparison, the one-pot double cyclization methodology described herein is more modular and does not rely on precious metal catalysts. Specifically, we recently synthesized γ-lycorane from the tungsten benzene complex in six steps (25% overall yield). However, the polycyclic cores that have not yet been prepared in a lab or found in nature are the most exciting potential targets for this methodology.

Gross and Net Medicaid Spending

Medicaid gross spending on the 18 top-selling brand-name drugs was $3.6 billion in 2015, growing 173% to $9.9 billion in 2019 (Table 1). The growth in Medicaid gross spending for the 18 brand-name drugs was led by adalimumab at $810 million in 2015 and growing to $2.2 billion in 2019 (Table 2). The next 2 top spending drugs were bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Biktarvy), which first became available in 2018, and in 2019, accounted for $1.0 billion in spending, and lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), which in 2019 accounted for $974 million in spending. The Medicaid market share of total gross spending for these drugs was approximately 8%.

Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) may be more likely to have drug–drug interactions than TDF, yet higher intracellular TFV-DP with TAF/emtricitabine given with rifampin than with TDF alone suggests that TAF may be given together with rifampin-containing TB treatment without dose adjustment. Neither TDF nor TAF has been fully evaluated with rifabutin, though one small study reported sustained HIV virologic suppression during TAF‑rifabutin coadministration. In a study of TAF (as part of Biktarvy) with daily high‑dose rifapentine and isoniazid (1HP) for LTBI, plasma tenofovir concentration was similar to TAF alone, suggesting that TAF can be taken with rifapentine for short periods of time for prevention of TB.

### HIV prevention and treatment information from four artificial intelligence platforms: a thematic analysis [^d7cb0c23]. AIDS and Behavior (2025). Medium credibility.

In large part, AI platforms accurately described the purpose of HIV medications. However, a few instances were observed in which platforms misrepresented and misclassified the purpose of a medication as HIV prevention when the drug was, in fact, solely designed to treat HIV in individuals already living with HIV. These inaccurate generated statements have been described as "AI hallucinations", referring to instances when LLMs present statements that are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or inconsistent with established knowledge. This phenomenon has led researchers to publish warnings about the use of AI in healthcare and for which interventions are being researched.

The findings of this study revealed consistency across AI platforms regarding the safety and efficacy of medications to treat and prevent HIV. ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4.0, Google Bard, and the HIV.gov Chatbot all consistently stated that medications to treat and prevent HIV were considered safe and efficacious. These findings are encouraging, as they indicate an alignment between AI-generated health information and previously established research on the safety and efficacy of Descovy ®, Truvada ®, Biktarvy ®, Genvoya ®, and Odefsey ®.

Although both ChatGPT models and Google Bard generated in-depth, comprehensive information regarding HIV medications for prevention and treatment, Google Bard was the least consistent across time regarding the information it generated. In other words, Google Bard demonstrated the largest variability in its coverage of various healthcare topics. These AI platforms provided the most comprehensive information about the purpose and side effects of each HIV medication and consistently provided recommendations to consult with healthcare professionals. In contrast, the HIV.gov Chatbot provided the shortest responses, covered far fewer topics, and provided the most limited and narrow scope of information across healthcare topics compared to ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4.0, and Google Bard, which could be attributed to the robust LLMs that make both ChatGPT models and Google Bard advanced platforms for large language processing. This finding is consistent with research by Al-Ashwal et al. in which multiple AI platforms demonstrated variable ability to identify and discuss key information when asked about medication interactions.

### Comparison of error incidence between single-tablet versus multiple-tablet INSTI-based regimens in the inpatient setting [^b2b70c72]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Even when removing incorrect dose from the total incidence of errors, a higher numerical error rate occurred in the MTR group which, while likely multifactorial, still warrants attention. Interestingly, the STR arm had a higher numerical incidence of incorrect regimen, primarily due to omitted dose, not ordered or not administered. It is unclear how to explain this finding (chance, enteral access issues in the STR arm, operational workflow with Biktarvy following initial formulary approval) but deserves further exploration. Overall composite error incidence per patient encounter was ~27%, which is comparable with previously reported ART error rates (approximately 16.7% to 54.7% of patient admissions). In addition, our breakdown of error types is similar to prior studies, with incorrect regimen most commonly reported and incorrect schedule least commonly reported. Among patient encounters with at least one error identified, the average number of errors per encounter were similar to outcomes in existing literature, which demonstrated a range of 1.5 to 2.4. The lower error incidence per patient encounter in this study is likely attributable to differences in ART component type. Studies evaluating error incidence specifically among INSTI-based regimens are lacking with one small study reporting a 13% error rate in 20 patients receiving raltegravir. Similar to our study, their most common error types were omitted order (50%) and incorrect dose (45%); however, fewer DDIs were identified. Despite NRTIs and INSTIs leading to significantly fewer errors compared with higher-risk components, like PIs, this study demonstrates the need for caution as INSTI-based regimens remain a significant risk for errors in inpatient settings. Median time to error correction just exceeded 24 hours, and while this length of time is comparable across studies, it suggests remaining opportunities for improvement. Pharmacist involvement in error resolution was identified in only 21% of errors; however, this rate may be falsely low as our process for identifying pharmacist involvement excluded an additional platform where many interventions are documented and may have missed interventions made verbally or without formal documentation.

### Comparison of error incidence between single-tablet versus multiple-tablet INSTI-based regimens in the inpatient setting [^08a4da9a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

A multicenter, retrospective observational study was conducted for adult PWH admitted to an Ascension Seton hospital from January 1, 2017, through September 1, 2022, and receiving an ART regimen consisting of either bictegravir-based STR or dolutegravir-based STR. This study was approved by the Ascension Seton Institutional Review Board. Encounters from 9 hospital sites were evaluated, including community-based practice sites and 1 academic teaching hospital. All hospital sites have access to a comprehensive local guideline with a verification checklist for pharmacists including renal and hepatic dosing, guidance on assessing patient compliance, DDIs, and formulary management. In addition, all patient encounters with active ART orders are flagged for evaluation and reviewed by a floor-based clinical pharmacist daily.

Encounters of hospitalized patients were included if patients were ≥ 18 years, had a diagnosis of HIV prior to admission, were prescribed a bictegravir-based or dolutegravir-based STR prior to admission, and had inpatient orders for either a bictegravir-based STR (Biktarvy) or a dolutegravir-based MTR as a substitute for dolutegravir and lamivudine (Dovato) or dolutegravir, lamivudine, and abacavir (Triumeq) (Figure 1). This study intentionally excluded the dolutegravir-rilpivirine STR (Juluca) as it has notable differences that could unfairly bias the outcomes of the study (eg, contains NNRTI rather than NRTI and additional food and DDI concerns). The study period for patients in the MTR arm was from January 1, 2017, through September 1, 2022; however, all patient encounters included in the STR arm were admitted after May 1, 2020, following the formulary addition of bictegravir-based STR. Patients were excluded if pregnant, incarcerated, not taking ART prior to admission, or admitted for < 24 hours and discharged prior to receiving any ART doses. Patients may have had multiple encounters throughout the study period, as each admission was individually evaluated.

### Fulminant diffuse cerebral toxoplasmosis as the first manifestation of HIV infection [^c4c93c9e]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Individuals with HIV may present to the emergency department with HIV-related or HIV-unrelated conditions, toxicity associated with antiretroviral therapy or primary HIV infection (seroconversion). In individuals with HIV infection, central nervous system toxoplasmosis occurs from reactivation of disease, especially when the CD4+ count is < 100cells/μL, whereas in those taking immunosuppressive therapy, this can be either due to newly acquired or reactivated latent infection. It is a rare occurrence in immune-competent patients. Vertical transmission during pregnancy can manifest as congenital toxoplasmosis in the neonate and is often asymptomatic until the second or third decade of life when ocular lesions develop. Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii and causes zoonotic infection. It can cause focal or disseminated brain lesions leading to neurological deficit, coma and death. Typical radiological findings are multiple ring-enhancing lesions. Histopathological examination demonstrating tachyzoites of T. gondii and the presence of nucleic material in the spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) confirms the diagnosis. The authors present the case of a 52-year-old male UK resident, born in sub-Saharan Africa, with a 3-week history of visual hallucinations. He attended the emergency department on three occasions. Laboratory investigations and a CT head were unremarkable. He was referred to psychological medicine for further evaluation. On his third presentation, 2months later, a CT head showed widespread lesions suggestive of cerebral metastasis. Dexamethasone was initiated and he developed rigours. An MRI head showed multiple ring-enhancing lesions disseminated throughout his brain parenchyma. CSF analysis and serology confirmed the diagnosis of HIV and toxoplasmosis, respectively. His CD4 count was 10 and his viral load (VL) was 1245003. He was then initiated on Biktarvy 50mg/200mg/25mg, one tablet daily, which contains 50mg of bictegravir, 200mg of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate equivalent to 25mg of tenofovir alafenamide. After 3 months of antiretroviral therapy, his HIV VL reduced to 42. However, his abbreviated mental test remained at 2/10. Despite presenting with neurocognitive impairment and being born in a HIV prevalent region, an HIV test was not offered. This case highlights missed opportunities to request HIV serology and raises awareness that cerebral toxoplasmosis can occur as the first manifestation of HIV. Prompt diagnosis and early initiation of antiretroviral therapy reduces morbidity and mortality in this patient cohort.

### When to start antiretroviral therapy: the need for an evidence base during early HIV infection [^18d9620e]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The DHHS guidelines use observational data to support initiating ART > 500 cells/μl and their recommendation is BIII. The rating of 'III' seems appropriate, but as noted above, the findings from the four observational studies are inconsistent, so in our opinion the full rating should be CIII, not BIII. The credibility of expert opinion would be enhanced if the authors of the four observational studies reconciled their differences and reported their consensus on the findings. Of note, in the WHO guidelines, no critical appraisal of the currently available data supporting (or not) ART initiation in treatment-naive symptomless HIV+ with CD4 > 350 cells/μl was made. No new critical data have been published since the release of the WHO guidelines in 2010, and hence we must assume that the WHO remains committed to this appraisal of the evidence.

### Evaluation of CRP SNV rs2808630 and acute proinflammatory biomarkers in patients with CKD and PLHIV with CKD: a case-control study [^8f01a0ac]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study group are summarized in Table 1. Significant age differences were observed between the groups. Additionally, the PLHIV with CKD group had a higher percentage of men (91.1%), reflecting the predominant demographic risk for this condition. Also, significant differences were found in glucose, creatinine, and urea levels, with higher concentrations observed in the CKD group. Additionally, microalbumin and uACR levels were significantly elevated (> 300 mg/g) in 73.6% of CKD patients and 42.3% of PLHIV with CKD. Furthermore, the CKD group showed a higher prevalence of T2D (52.7%) and HTN (80%) than the other groups.

All PLHIV with CKD were on ART regimens and had undetectable viral loads. At the onset of the infection, they had a median nadir CD4 + T cell count of 112 (30.5–276.5) cells/µL. Currently, their median CD4 + T cell count is 485 (323–707) cells/µL, indicating adequate immune reconstitution following ART initiation. The average time living with HIV infection and ART treatment was 12 ± 8 years. Of these, 67.65% were on Biktarvy (composed of 3 drugs: an integrase inhibitor and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), including tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)), and to a lesser extent, Kivexa (composed of two NRTIs: abacavir and lamivudine) accompanied by Dolutegravir (DTG).

### Effective treatment of HIV-associated kaposi sarcoma in the setting of immune-reconstitution inflammatory syndrome using intralesional bleomycin [^302422b5]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 30-year-old man with a history of HIV (diagnosed in 2016), syphilis, and stroke (in the setting of Moyamoya disease) was previously on ART with Complera (emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir) in 2016 but stopped his medications and did not reestablish care until roughly 2019. In April 2021, his CD4 count was 184, and his viral load was < 20, and in May 2021, he was started on ART, Biktarvy (bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide).

In June 2021, he presented with 2 violaceous nodules on the right thigh (Fig 1, A), and a biopsy revealed KS (Fig 2). He also had leg swelling, in which computed tomography (CT) angiography for pulmonary embolism was done and showed enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes. At that time, the CD4 count was 251 and the viral load was < 20.

Hematoxylin and eosin stain demonstrate plump spindled cells admixed with blood vessels in the dermis. These cells are stained with antibodies against human herpesvirus 8. (Hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnification: ×20).

Three months after starting ART, positron emission tomography/CT showed mild to moderately hypermetabolic bilateral axillary, external iliac chain, inguinal, and left popliteal fossa lymph nodes. Three weeks later, new skin lesions appeared on the right thigh (grouped pink to slightly violaceous papules to nodules, ranging in size from 5 mm-1.3 cm). It was recommended to start IL bleomycin in the setting of IRIS KS.

### When to start antiretroviral therapy: the need for an evidence base during early HIV infection [^09bf8b87]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Table 2
Impact of immediate vs deferred initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on mortality: data from randomized controlled trials involving ART-naïve HIV+ persons

a Early ART initiation defined as start of ART at CD4 > 350 cells/μl.

b Deferred ART initiation defined as start of ART at CD4 < 200 or < 250 cells/μl.

The recommendation to begin ART when the CD4 count declines to 350 cells/μl comes from observational studies. In this regard, the four observational studies are consistent. For example in Cain et al. hazard ratios (HRs) for AIDS or death were 1.37 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.57) and 1.20 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.38) for CD4 thresholds of 200 and 250 cells/μl versus 350 cells/μl. Corresponding HRs for death, which were not significant, were 1.18 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.46) and 1.07 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.34). Using the rating system employed by the group writing guidelines for the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (see below), we believe this recommendation should be rated BII.

### Synergistic effect of biejia-ruangan on fibrosis regression in patients with chronic hepatitis B treated with entecavir: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^ce93ed9b]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

A major limitation of the present study is that the outcomes of interest are restricted to observations at treatment week 72. A longer follow-up of observation will allow us to explore the long-term safety and efficacy and the risk of HCC development. In addition, the underlying mechanisms for the benefit of this combination therapy have not yet been explored, and the specific medicinal components of BR responsible for the antifibrotic effects remain unknown. From our experience, however, it is clear that BR in liver disease has potential benefits, without significant toxicity, and is worthy of future clinical study.

In conclusion, adding BR to current standard antiviral treatment may increase the regression of liver fibrosis in CHB patients and challenges the conventional perspective that regression of liver fibrosis in CHB can only be achieved by long-term antiviral treatment with NAs. This study suggests that an antifibrotic agent as a supplement to the current etiology-targeted treatment can further improve the regression of liver fibrosis and overall outcomes in various chronic liver diseases. Further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies may be necessary to elucidate the effect of BR on increasing blood or intrahepatic levels of entecavir.

### Molecular structure and function analysis of bikunin on down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression in activated neutrophils [^ad00d41a]. Cytokine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We performed a detailed molecular analysis of bikunin-mediated anti-inflammation (suppressive effect of cytokine release, MAP kinase activation, and nuclear translocation of NF-kB) using a truncated form of bikunin.

Materials and Methods

We obtained bikunin derivatives that contained O-glycoside-linked N-terminal glycopeptide (Bik-m1), N-glycoside-linked C-terminal tandem Kunitz domains (Bik-m2), bikunin lacking O-glycoside (Bik-c), asialo bikunin (Bik-a), bikunin lacking N-glycoside (Bik-n), and purified C-terminal Kunitz domain II (kII) of bikunin (HI-8). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot were carried out to measure secreted TNF-alpha and MAP kinase activation.

Results

We examined the TNF-alpha secretion in control and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated neutrophils and did not see any changes of its protein levels in the cells pretreated with Bik-m1, Bik-m2, Bik-c, or HI-8. In all of the derivatives tested, only the derivatives that lacked N-glycoside side chain showed a significant suppression of TNF-alpha secretion by LPS. Only a small (21 amino acids) deletion of the N-terminal portion of bikunin (which corresponds to Bik-m2) abolished its suppressing activity of TNF-alpha secretion, thus suggesting that the N-terminal 21 amino acids play a critical role in anti-inflammation. Bik-m1 alone failed to show anti-inflammatory response. Bikunin failed to inhibit ionomycin-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinases.

Conclusion

These data allow us to conclude that the cytokine expression was inhibited only by the O-glycoside-linked core protein without the N-glycoside side chain. Our results also suggest a possible role of bikunin for receptor-dependent MAP kinase activation.

Switching antiretroviral therapy (ART) due to drug–drug interactions in transplant candidates — to minimize immediate interactions in the post-transplant period, whenever possible, any necessary ARV drug switches should be completed several weeks before the transplant (BIII). Waiting at least five half-lives would allow for adequate elimination of any interacting ARV drugs and/or PK booster prior to transplant, and switching ART by at least several weeks before transplant also allows clinicians to assess the tolerability and efficacy of the new regimen.

NNRTI-based regimens — initial therapy role and agent-specific considerations are as follows: NNRTI-based regimens are not recommended for initial therapy in most people with HIV, but selected regimens may be useful in some circumstances, and the Panel currently recommends in certain clinical scenarios DOR/TDF/3TC (BII), DOR plus TAF/FTC (BIII), and RPV/TAF/FTC (BII); emergence of drug resistance at virologic failure has been reported with all NNRTIs, which generally have a lower barrier to resistance than INSTIs or boosted PIs. DOR is available both as a single-drug tablet to be used with two NRTIs and as part of an STR with TDF/3TC, was non-inferior to both EFV and DRV/r when either of these drugs was taken in combination with two NRTIs but has not yet been compared against INSTIs, and has fewer central nervous system side effects than EFV, more favorable lipid effects than DRV/r and EFV, fewer potential drug interactions than EFV or RPV, and unlike RPV its virologic efficacy is not compromised in people with high HIV RNA levels and low CD4 counts. RPV has fewer adverse effects than EFV and RPV/TAF/FTC is available as one of the smallest tablet sizes among STRs, but RPV has lower virologic efficacy in people with baseline HIV RNA levels > 100,000 copies/mL and CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm³ and is subject to numerous drug–drug interactions; EFV is no longer recommended for initial therapy due to a relatively high rate of CNS-related side effects, reported suicidality, high rates of drug discontinuation, and numerous drug–drug interactions.

NNRTI plus NRTI regimen failure — second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) options: The Panel recommends that fully active DTG plus two NRTIs, at least one of which is fully active, can be a treatment option after failure of a first-line NNRTI-based therapy (AI). BIC, which is available only in a combination pill with FTC/TAF, also has a high resistance barrier and may have similar activity to that of DTG in this setting, and is also an option (AIII); however, no clinical trial data for this strategy with BIC is available. If at least one fully active NRTI cannot be assured and a clinician wants to avoid using a boosted PI or a drug from other classes, a regimen that includes fully active DTG plus two NRTIs that are estimated to be only partially active (particularly TAF or TDF with 3TC or FTC) can be considered, with caution and close monitoring of viral response (BIII).

### P-CABPPI in the eradication of: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^fe45e41d]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background:

The efficacy and safety of potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) remains controversial when compared with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Objectives:

The current study set out to compare the differences in the eradication rate and adverse reactions between eradication regimens based on P-CAB or PPI drugs and the differences between the vonoprazan-based and the tegoprazan-based regimens to explore the efficacy and safety of different Hp eradication regimens.

Data sources and methods:

Databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and WOS were searched from the inception of these databases up to July 2023, and eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The outcome measures were the eradication rate and the incidence of adverse reactions of different regimens in treating Hp. The results were estimated as relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), and R 4.2.1 software was used to perform the network meta-analysis (NMA).

Results:

A total of 20 studies were included in the analysis, involving 5815 patients with Hp. In terms of eradication rate, the 2-week vonoprazan-based triple regimen (V-Tri-2w) was the best, which was superior to the 2-week PPI-based quadruple regimen [P-Qua-2w, RR = 0.9, 95% CI: (0.85–0.95)] and the 1-week tegoprazan-based triple regimen [T-Tri-1w, RR = 0.79, 95% CI: (0.64–0.97)]; the 2-week tegoprazan-based quadruple regimen (T-Qua-2w) was superior to the 1-week PPI-based triple regimen [P-Tri-1w, RR = 0.82, 95% CI: (0.67–0.99)], and there was no difference between the remaining tegoprazan-based regimens and the PPI-based or vonoprazan-based regimens. In terms of the incidence of adverse reactions, the 2-week vonoprazan-based binary regimen (V-Bi-2w) was lower than that of the 2-week PPI-based quadruple regimen [P-Qua-2w, RR = 1.98, 95% CI: (1.57–2.52)]; there was no significant difference between 1 and 2 weeks for each regimen, such as the vonoprazan-based triple regimen [RR = 1.11, 95% CI: (0.82–1.52)].

Conclusion:

In the eradication treatment of Hp, the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan-based regimens are generally better than those of PPI-based regimens. Among them, the V-Tri-2w regimen has the highest eradication rate and may be the preferred choice for Hp eradication.
