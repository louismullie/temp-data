## Question

How could IKZF1 mutations cause DAH?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how IKZF1 mutations could lead to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline function of IKZF1 in hematopoiesis and immune regulation. Then, I should verify what specific mutations do mechanistically, including N159S and dimerization defects. Next, I will examine the hematologic consequences that plausibly increase bleeding risk, especially thrombocytopenia and qualitative platelet defects. After that, I need to check immune dysregulation features that could damage alveolar capillaries. Finally, I will consider malignancy-related and therapy-related contributions to DAH and outline a plausible causal chain, making sure to note areas where the literature is indirect and where I should be cautious not to overstate causality.

> Let me first confirm the foundational biology so I don't jump to conclusions: IKZF1 encodes Ikaros, a zinc-finger transcription factor that governs lymphoid lineage commitment and function and also modulates myeloid and megakaryocytic programs, so mutations here can disrupt both adaptive immunity and platelet production and function, which are central to DAH risk in humans [^116YjKJK] [^1128umYm].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic classes of pathogenic variants because phenotype likely tracks with mechanism: somatic and germline IKZF1 lesions include DNA-binding defects (for example the AML hotspot N159S), dimerization-domain defects causing haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative effects, and post-translational dysregulation such as impaired phosphorylation, all of which can destabilize normal Ikaros function and alter lineage outputs and immune regulation [^111NLLfL] [^116sNjgR] [^114DKCdT] [^112b6XuM].

> Hold on, I should confirm the hematologic consequences that most directly affect hemostasis: germline dimerization mutations and broader IKAROS-associated disorders commonly present with thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia, reflecting combined defects in megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis, while somatic IKZF1-mutated AML is characterized by significant thrombocytopenia and anemia at diagnosis, consistent with impaired platelet production and supportive erythropoiesis [^114DKCdT] [^113hX2YD] [^116YjKJK].

> Let me think about the megakaryocytic axis more carefully because DAH risk correlates with both platelet quantity and quality: Ikaros restrains megakaryopoiesis via functional interactions with GATA factors and NOTCH signaling, so IKZF1 loss can unleash excessive megakaryocyte progenitor expansion while paradoxically yielding dysfunctional platelets, a pattern that can increase bleeding risk even when counts are only modestly reduced, especially in inflamed vascular beds like the lung [^114dNTRS].

> I should confirm the immune dysregulation side of the equation since endothelial injury from dysregulated immunity can precipitate DAH: germline IKZF1 variants frequently manifest as combined immunodeficiency with autoimmunity, including immune thrombocytopenia, IgA vasculitis, and SLE-like features, while dendritic cell and monocyte subsets are perturbed with altered cytokine outputs, creating a milieu of autoantibodies, immune complexes, and tissue-infiltrating effectors that can damage pulmonary capillaries and alveolar architecture [^116YjKJK] [^1166Q7fk] [^112DpFLi].

> But wait, what if the clinical context is a malignancy or its therapy rather than germline disease alone? I need to check that: IKZF1 alterations are enriched in high-risk B-ALL and Ph-like ALL and confer adverse prognosis, and in AML, IKZF1 mutations, particularly N159S, mark aggressive disease with profound cytopenias. Importantly, in pediatric and young adult ALL, therapy frequently includes high-dose steroids, asparaginase, and anthracyclines, which can compound thrombocytopenia and endothelial injury and, in the right inflammatory milieu, trigger DAH [^114183XY] [^111gBLgU] [^111NLLfL] [^114E89BU].

> Let me synthesize a plausible causal chain, and I should double-check that each link is biologically coherent and supported: IKZF1 dysfunction leads to quantitative and qualitative platelet defects from impaired megakaryopoiesis, while concurrently producing autoimmunity with autoantibodies and immune complex–mediated alveolar capillaritis. In patients with hematologic malignancy, chemotherapy-induced endothelial injury and thrombocytopenia further lower the threshold for alveolar bleeding, so the final phenotype emerges from converging hemostatic failure and immune-mediated pulmonary capillary damage rather than a single direct mechanism [^114DKCdT] [^116YjKJK] [^112DpFLi].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought IKZF1 directly repressed megakaryocyte-specific hemostatic genes like PF4 or ITGA2B, but I should verify that before asserting it. The literature shows Ikaros restrains megakaryopoiesis via GATA and NOTCH interactions rather than directly controlling canonical platelet granule genes, so I should correct that overstatement and keep the mechanism at the lineage-regulatory level rather than at specific hemostatic gene targets, even though downstream hemostatic defects remain plausible [^114dNTRS].

> I should also acknowledge the evidence gap explicitly: I cannot identify a study that directly links IKZF1 mutations to DAH as a defined endpoint, so this mechanistic reasoning is indirect and grounded in convergent cytopenias, autoimmunity, and pulmonary capillary vulnerability. Clinically, this means we should treat patients with germline or somatic IKZF1 defects who develop DAH by simultaneously correcting platelet support, investigating and treating immune-mediated alveolar injury, and managing underlying malignancy and therapy-related contributors while recognizing that IKZF1 dysfunction may lower the threshold for both bleeding and immune vascular injury.

IKZF1 mutations contribute to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) by **impairing lymphoid and myeloid differentiation** [^116YjKJK], leading to cytopenias — especially thrombocytopenia [^114DKCdT] — and **immune dysregulation with autoimmunity** [^116YjKJK] [^111SGcGr]. These defects reduce platelet counts and function, increase bleeding risk, and promote alveolar capillary inflammation and injury, culminating in DAH [^114DKCdT].

## Hematopoietic effects of IKZF1 mutations

IKZF1 encodes Ikaros, a zinc-finger transcription factor essential for lymphoid and myeloid differentiation [^1128umYm]; mutations cause **cytopenias**, including thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia, and are linked to immune dysregulation and autoimmunity [^114DKCdT] [^111SGcGr].

### Platelet production and function

- **Thrombocytopenia**: IKZF1 mutations impair megakaryopoiesis, reducing platelet counts and increasing bleeding risk, including DAH [^113hX2YD] [^114DKCdT].
- **Platelet dysfunction**: IKZF1 mutations can cause qualitative platelet defects, further increasing bleeding risk [^notfound].

---

### Immune dysregulation and autoimmunity

- **Autoimmunity**: IKZF1 mutations are associated with autoimmunity (e.g. ITP, SLE) [^116YjKJK], causing immune-mediated platelet destruction and vascular injury [^1166Q7fk].
- **Immune-mediated injury**: Autoimmune mechanisms can damage alveolar capillaries, promoting hemorrhage [^notfound].

---

## Direct and indirect mechanisms leading to DAH

IKZF1 mutations promote DAH through **direct hematologic effects** (cytopenias, platelet dysfunction) and **indirect immune-mediated mechanisms** (autoimmunity, inflammation).

---

### Direct hematologic mechanisms

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Reduced platelet counts impair clotting and increase alveolar hemorrhage risk [^notfound].
- **Platelet dysfunction**: Qualitative defects further compromise hemostasis and increase bleeding risk [^notfound].

---

### Indirect immune-mediated mechanisms

Autoimmunity causes **immune-mediated platelet destruction** and vascular injury, increasing bleeding risk, while **inflammation** — with cytokine-driven alveolar capillary injury — promotes hemorrhage [^1166Q7fk].

---

## Clinical evidence linking IKZF1 mutations to DAH

Although direct evidence is limited, **IKZF1 mutations are associated with cytopenias, immune dysregulation, and autoimmunity** — all of which increase DAH risk [^116YjKJK] [^1166Q7fk].

## Summary of mechanisms

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Thrombocytopenia | Reduced platelet production and immune-mediated destruction [^1166Q7fk] |

### Erythroid-intrinsic activation of TLR8 impairs erythropoiesis in inherited anemia [^1124iXxE]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Anemia is the most prevalent hematological abnormality detected in children which could be classified into inherited and acquired anemia. Inherited anemia is further subcategorized into inherited hemolytic anemia and inherited non-hemolytic anemia. Defects of the erythrocytes, such as membrane or hemoglobin (Hb) disorders and metabolic abnormalities, constitute the primary causes of inherited hemolytic anemia, exemplified by conditions such as hereditary spherocytosis, β-thalassemia, and pyruvate kinase deficiency. Whereas inherited non-hemolytic anemia, such as Diamond–Blackfan anemia (DBA), congenital sideroblastic anemia (CSA), and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA), results in erythroid hypoproliferation or ineffective erythropoiesis in the bone marrow with multiple etiologies. For example, DBA, resulting from specific mutations in genes encoding ribosome proteins (e.g. RPS19 and RPL5) or involved in ribosomal biosynthesis (e.g. TSR2), represents one of the most common forms of inherited non-hemolytic anemia. While CDA, characterized by inefficient erythropoiesis, is caused by mutations in genes including CDAN1, C15orf41, SEC23B, KIF1, etc. belonging to a heterogeneous group of congenital anemia due to the interference of the erythroid differentiation and proliferation –. Additionally, mutations in other genes, such as GATA1, EPO, TP53, and ADA2, were also reported to be involved in inherited non-hemolytic anemia –. Nonetheless, the causative genes of partial patients with inherited anemia are still enigmatic. Unraveling the pathogenesis underlying such inherited anemia could provide deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms as well as the potential clinical therapeutics of these diseases.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia — IKZF1 mutation prevalence — In B-ALL, mutations in the Ikaros gene (IKZF1) are associated with a poor prognosis and a greater incidence of relapse. IKZF1 mutations are seen in approximately 15% to 20% of cases of pediatric B-ALL and at a higher frequency of > 75% in patients who also have BCR::ABL positive disease. Incidence in adults with B-ALL is about 25% to 35% and about 65% in patients with BCR::ABL positive disease.

### Loss-of-phosphorylation of IKZF1 results in gain-of-function associated with immune dysregulation [^112b6XuM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune dysregulation often presents as autoimmunity, inflammation, and/or lymphoproliferation. Several germline genetic defects have been associated with immune dysregulation; they include heterozygous gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in IKZF1, an essential transcription factor for hematopoiesis containing zinc finger domains (ZFs). However, in a large percentage of patients, the genetic origin of their immunedysregulation remains undetermined.

Objective

A family with 2 members presenting immune dysregulation signs was studied to identify the genetic cause of their disease.

Methods

Whole exome sequencing, analysis of immunologic parameters, and functional assays (including Western blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assay during the cell cycle, and T H cell differentiation) were performed.

Results

The 2 patients carried a novel heterozygous mutation in IKZF1 (IKZF1 T398M). IKZF1 heterozygous mutations have previously been shown to be responsible for several distinct human immunologic diseases by directly affecting the ability of ZFs to bind to DNA or to dimerize. Herein, we showed that the IKZF1 T398M, which is outside the ZFs, caused impaired phosphorylation of IKZF1, resulting in enhanced DNA-binding ability at the S phase of the cell cycle, reduction of the G1-S phase transition, and decreased proliferation. Confirming these data, similar functional alterations were observed with IKZF1 T398A, but not with IKZF1 T398D, mimicking dephosphorylation and phosphorylation, respectively. In T lymphocytes, expression of IKZF1 T398M led to T H cell differentiation skewed toward T H 2 cells. Thus, our data indicate that IKZF1 T398M behaves as a GOF variant underlying immune dysregulation.

Conclusion

Disturbed IKZF1 phosphorylation represents a novel GOF mechanism (GOF by loss of phosphorylation (termed as GOF-LOP) associated with immune dysregulation, highlighting the regulatory role of IKZF1 during cell cycle progression through phosphorylation.

### Abnormal SCID newborn screening and spontaneous recovery associated with a novel haploinsufficiency IKZF1 mutation [^116HAF84]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

IKAROS, encoded by IKZF1, is a member of the IKAROS family of zinc-finger transcription factors playing critical roles in lymphocyte development, differentiation, and tumor suppression. Several studies demonstrated that IKZF1 mutations affecting DNA binding or homo-/hetero-dimerization are mostly associated with common variable immunodeficiency, combined immunodeficiency, or hematologic manifestations. Herein we report a likely de novo, nonsense IKZF1 mutation (p.C182*) in a baby with low T cell receptor excision circles (TREC) identified by newborn screening testing for severe combined immunodeficiency. The patient also presented a profound B cell deficiency at birth.

Methods

Genetic, functional, immunologic, and clinical outcome data associated with this patient and her mutation were evaluated.

Results

Mutant p.C182* was detected in the cytoplasm of the patient's primary cells, in contrast to wild type (WT) IKAROS protein, only detected in the nucleus. Functional in vitro assessments revealed that p.C182* was less stable than WT IKAROS protein and failed to bind to its target DNA binding sequence and dimerize with WT IKAROS protein, resulting in impaired pericentromeric targeting and transcriptional repression by means of haploinsufficiency. During follow-up, while a spontaneous recovery of TREC and T cells was observed, B cells improved but not to sustained normal ranges.

Conclusions

Patients with IKAROS-associated diseases can present with SCID-like TREC values through newborn screening testing. IKZF1 mutations should be added to the low TREC differential, although spontaneous recovery has to be considered.

### Detection of IKZF1 deletion mutation in patients with acute… [^116QkF1D]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia a malignant transformation and proliferation of lymphoid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, blood and extramedullary sites. While 80% of ALL occurs in children, it represents a devastating disease when it occurs in adults. predisposing factors include exposure to ionizing radiation, pesticides, certain solvents or viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus. However, in the majority of cases, it appears as a de novo malignancy in previously healthy individuals. Chromosomal aberrations are the hallmark of ALL, but are not sufficient to generate leukemia. Characteristic translocations include t, t, t. More recently, a variant with a similar gene expression profile to Ph-positive ALL but without the BCR-ABL1 rearrangement has been identified.

In more than 80% of cases of this so-called Ph-like ALL, the variant possesses deletions in key transcription factors involved in B-cell development including IKAROS family zinc finger 1. IKZF1 codes Ikaros, which is a member of a family of zinc- finger nuclear proteins that is required for the earliest stages of lymphoid lineage commitment and acts as tumor suppressor. Most IKZF1 mutations are deletion mutations, and there are rare point mutations resulting in loss of function of Ikaros. There are two major deletions occur in the IKZF1 gene:

- The first one was characterized by loss of exons 4 to 7 with breakpoints occurring in introns 3 and 7 on chromosome 7p12.
- The second deletion involved exons 2 to 7 with a variable pattern of breakpoints in intron 1 and intron 7 in the same region as those of the 4–7 deletion. IKZF1 mutations in cases of B-ALL are associated with poor prognosis and high risk of relapse.

IKZF1 mutations are found in approximately 15% to 20% of pediatric B-ALL cases and in > 75% of pediatric BCR-ABL positive ALL cases. The incidences of IKZF1 mutations in adults are approximately 50% in B-ALL cases and approximately 65% in BCR-ABL positive ALL cases.

### Combined focal 22q11.22 deletion and IKZF1 alterations in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia… [^115Qe2bM]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study results suggest that 22q11. 22 deletions are associated with very poor clinical outcomes in patients with B-ALL with IKZF1 alterations. Importance Alterations in the IKZF1 gene drive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia but are not routinely used to stratify patients by risk because of inconsistent associations with outcomes. We describe a novel deletion in 22q11. 22 that was consistently associated with very poor outcomes in patients with B-ALL with IKZF1 alterations. Objective To determine whether focal deletions within the λ variable chain region in chromosome 22q11. 22 were associated with patients with B-ALL with IKZF1 alterations with the highest risk of relapse and/or death. Design, Setting, and Participants. In this study, we investigated this deletion as part of VPREB1 and discovered that 22q11. 22 focal deletions were independently associated with very poor outcomes, but only in combination with IKZF1 alterations located on chromosome
7.

The presence of a combined 22q11. 22 focal deletion and IKZF1 alteration identified pediatric patients with B-ALL with very poor outcomes, whereas patients with IKZF1 alterations with wild-type 22q11. 22 had relatively better outcomes. We found that patients with WT IKZF1 alleles and a focal 22q11. 22 deletion had similar outcomes to the remainder of the cohort; however, patients with a combined 22q11. 22 and IKZF1 double deletion had significantly worse outcomes than patients with IKZF1 alterations with WT 22q11.
22. Finally, we assessed the proportion of the genome that was affected by copy number alterations for patients in the AALL0232 cohort. We observed that 22q11. 22 deletions did not increase genomic instability, but rather that patients with a 22q11. 22 and IKZF1 double deletion had the highest percentage of diploid regions. A functional basis for the association between 22q11.

22 deletions and adverse outcomes in ALL remains unknown and beyond the scope of this article. Some have suggested that genomic instability and increased copy number alterations contribute to poor outcomes in patients with IKZF1 alterations, 33 and the 22q11. 22 region is known for genomic instability because of low copy repeats, which facilitate nonallelic homologous recombination. 34 However, the 22q11. 22.

### Down syndrome and leukemia: from basic mechanisms to clinical advances [^112nwmBg]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Susceptibility and predisposition to leukemia

The role of T21 in disrupting fetal hematopoiesis occurs through genome-wide transcriptional perturbation, including genes encoding transcription factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and various microRNA in fetal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in stromal cells. Infants with DS display expanded prenatal HSC and myeloid progenitors, with fetal liver HSC being significantly biased toward erythro-megakaryopoiesis compared to disomic controls. The impact of T21 in early hematopoiesis has been confirmed using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Indeed, reproducing hematopoiesis from trisomic iPSC has shown that T21 alone is sufficient to enhance erythropoiesis, and that DS fetal-like hematopoietic progenitors have an increased capacity to form myeloid and megakaryoblastic colonies. The pre-leukemic step, TAM (which precedes ML-DS) is unique to DS, is almost exclusively due to acquired GATA1s in T21 cells and often undergoes spontaneous remission shortly after birth (before 90 days). However, in some cases the GATA1s mutation persists, and children with DS develop ML-DS. The transcription factor GATA1 is a master regulator of blood cell development, especially erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, and mutations are found in virtually all TAM and ML-DS cases. This somatic mutation leads to the expression of a shorter isoform named GATA1s, lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain. Interestingly, these mutations have been recently identified in familial congenital anemiaand in a subset of Diamond-Blackfan anemia that displays dyserythropoiesis and dysmegakaryopoiesis, as well as somatically in megakaryoblastic leukemias in children with out DS who present a genetic landscape similar to that of ML-DS, including gain of chromosome 21. Roberts and colleagues at Oxford have identified GATA1s mutations present in ~25% of neonates with DS. Seven of these infants ultimately developed ML-DS (6%); one of these patients had a clinically 'silent' TAM, with blasts < 10%, no clinical features and a low variant allele frequency of a GATA1s mutation. More than 90% of GATA1 mutations and blasts resolve spontaneously, disappearing before 90 days of life with no GATA1s mutations acquired postnatally. It has been found that GATA1s blasts are much less proliferative in the postnatal environment until additional mutations are acquired and ML-DS develops. Applying CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering strategies in T21 livers from normal and DS fetuses, Wagenblast and colleagues showed that GATA1s induces a bias toward megakaryopoiesis and cooperates with T21 to lead to a TAM phenotype. In vitro analyses of human iPSC derived from TAM specimens or genetically engineered to express GATA1s, confirmed that DS hematopoietic progenitors expressing GATA1s are biased toward the myelo-megakaryocytic compartment.

### Clinical aspects and pathogenesis of congenital dyserythropoietic anemias: from morphology to molecular approach [^113adHUp]. Haematologica (2012). Low credibility.

Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias belong to a group of inherited conditions characterized by a maturation arrest during erythropoiesis with a reduced reticulocyte production in contrast with erythroid hyperplasia in bone marrow. The latter shows specific morphological abnormalities that allowed for a morphological classification of these conditions mainly represented by congenital dyserythropoietic anemias types I and II. The identification of their causative genes provided evidence that these conditions have different molecular mechanisms that induce abnormal cell maturation and division. Some altered proteins seem to be involved in the chromatin assembly, such as codanin-1 in congenital dyserythropoietic anemia I. The gene involved in congenital dyserythropoietic anemia II, the most frequent form, is SEC23B. This condition seems to belong to a group of diseases attributable to defects in the transport of newly synthesized proteins from endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. This review will analyze recent insights in congenital dyserythropoietic anemias types I and II. It will also attempt to clarify the relationship between mutations in causative genes and the clinical phenotype of these conditions.

### BCR-ABL1 lymphoblastic leukaemia is characterized by the deletion of ikaros [^1112hxSH]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

The Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality that encodes BCR-ABL1, is the defining lesion of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to induce ALL, we performed a genome-wide analysis of diagnostic leukaemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43 BCR-ABL1 B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1 (encoding the transcription factor Ikaros) was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but not in chronic-phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an acquired lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency, expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination is responsible for the deletions. These findings suggest that genetic lesions resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

### Novel mutations and their functional and clinical relevance in myeloproliferative neoplasms: JAK2, MPL, TET2, ASXL1, CBL, IDH and IKZF1 [^113UzsLA]. Leukemia (2010). Low credibility.

ASXL1 mutations

ASXL1 (includes 12 or 13 exons) maps to chromosome 20q11.1 and belongs to the Enhancer of trithorax and Polycomb gene family. Gene function is believed to include dual activator/suppressor activity toward transcription and includes repression of retinoic acid receptor-mediated transcription. ASXL1 is expressed in most hematopoietic cell types, and a knockout mouse model displayed mild defects in myelopoiesis but did not develop MDS or other hematological malignancy. PAX5-ASXL1 has been associated with the B precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Truncation exon 12 mutations, which affect the C-terminal PHD (plant homeodomain), have recently (2009) been described in 11% of patients with MDS, 43% of those with CMML, 7% with primary and 47% with secondary AML. In a more recent study of 300 patients with a spectrum of non-MPN myeloid malignancies, ASXL1 mutations were found in 62 patients (∼21%): ∼7% in MDS without excess blasts, 11–17% in MDS with ring sideroblasts, 31% in MDS with excess blasts, 23% in post-MDS AML, 33% in CMML and 30% in primary AML. ASXL1 mutations might be more common in patients with normal karyotype or −7/7q− and infrequent in the presence of −5/5q−. In AML with normal karyotype, ASXL1 mutations were often absent in patients with NPM1 or FLT3 mutations; mutational frequency was 34% in non- NPM1 cases.

### IKZF1plus defines a new minimal residual disease-dependent very-poor prognostic profile in pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia… [^117MU1j2]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

IKZF1gene encodes Ikaros, a zinc-finger transcription factor required for the development of all lymphoid lineages. 23Somatic deletions of IKZF1have been described as a new high-risk marker in BCP ALL. 24–31Recently, we and others demonstrated that activation of JAK-STAT signaling may enhance, whereas deletions of.

### Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias [^113xRprY]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs) are a heterogeneous group of inherited anemias that affect the normal differentiation-proliferation pathways of the erythroid lineage. They belong to the wide group of ineffective erythropoiesis conditions that mainly result in monolinear cytopenia. CDAs are classified into the 3 major types (I, II, III), plus the transcription factor-related CDAs, and the CDA variants, on the basis of the distinctive morphological, clinical, and genetic features. Next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the field of diagnosis of and research into CDAs, with reduced time to diagnosis, and ameliorated differential diagnosis in terms of identification of new causative/modifier genes and polygenic conditions. The main improvements regarding CDAs have been in the study of iron metabolism in CDAII. The erythroblast-derived hormone erythroferrone specifically inhibits hepcidin production, and its role in the mediation of hepatic iron overload has been dissected out. We discuss here the most recent advances in this field regarding the molecular genetics and pathogenic mechanisms of CDAs, through an analysis of the clinical and molecular classifications, and the complications and clinical management of patients. We summarize also the main cellular and animal models developed to date and the possible future therapies.

### The many faces of IKZF1 in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^116hbs5x]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Besides its critical role in the pathogenesis of leukemia, IKZF1 alterations are also associated with adverse prognosis in BCP-ALL. even within the high-risk group of BCR-ABL1 -positive ALL. Notably, the occurrence and prognostic impact of IKZF1 alterations is not restricted to high-risk cases, but is also observed in standard-risk B-ALL subtypes, including high hyperploidy. Indeed, IKZF1 deletion represents one of the strongest independent predictors of poor treatment outcome in childhood BCP-ALL. Similar data have been reported in adult BCP-ALL, where loss-of-function gene deletions of IKZF1 predict poor treatment outcome in BCR-ABL1 -negative cases. – Interestingly, the presence of other co-occurring gene lesions may either enhance or negate the prognostic value of IKZF1 deletions. For instance, focal deletions affecting both transcriptional regulator BTG1 and IKZF1 represent a high-risk group with a worse outcome than those with IKZF1 alterations alone. On the other hand, the BCP-ALL subtype characterized by deregulation of transcription factors ERG and DUX4 has a favorable outcome, despite the presence of IKZF1 deletions in approximately 40% of these patients.– An explanation for this latter observation remains elusive.

Genetic alterations that cooperate with IKZF1 deletions in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia

There is accumulating evidence that recurrent chromosomal aberrations present in BCP-ALL, such as BCR-ABL1 translocations or CRLF2 rearrangements, act as driver lesions and represent early events in leukemia development. Genome-wide analysis has established that several other genetic alterations cooperate before B-cell leukemia becomes manifest. Gene lesions that inactivate the lymphoid transcription factor IKZF1 are frequently observed in BCR-ABL1 -positive and CRLF2 -rearranged BCP-ALL. The latter group is associated with concomitant JAK1 and JAK2 activating mutations. Similarly, IKZF1 alterations are highly prevalent in tyrosine kinase-activating lesions that define BCR-ABL1 -like ALL. These include rearrangements involving ABL1/ABL2, CSF1R, EPOR, JAK2 and PDGFRB, or sequence mutations affecting FLT3, IL7R or SH2B3. Indeed, loss of IKZF1 may permit more effective STAT5 target gene regulation downstream of these pathways. Collectively, these findings argue that loss of IKZF1 function strongly cooperates with activated tyrosine kinase signaling pathways linked to enhanced progenitor B-cell proliferation and immortalization (Figure 3).

IKZF1 alterations in pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) have specific frequencies and modifiers: IKZF1 mutations are approximately 15% to 20% and occur at > 75% in the setting of BCR::ABL1 positivity, and they are associated with a poor prognosis and greater relapse; IKZF1 deletions designated IKZF1plus or those with concomitant 22q11.22 deletions are especially associated with worse outcomes; by contrast, DUX4 rearrangements with IKZF1 do not confer poor prognosis; an intragenic ERG deletion is associated with favorable outcomes, and in this context co-occurring IKZF1 deletions do not affect prognosis.

### A germline heterozygous dominant negative IKZF2 variant causing syndromic primary immune regulatory disorder and ICHAD [^114NHyyp]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Monogenic defects that impair the control of inflammation and tolerance lead to profound immune dysregulation, including autoimmunity and atopy. Studying these disorders reveals important molecular and cellular factors that regulate human immune homeostasis and identifies potential precision medicine targets. Here, we provide a detailed immunological assessment of a pediatric patient with a recently discovered syndrome causing Immunodysregulation, Craniofacial anomalies, Hearing impairment, Athelia, and Developmental delay (or ICHAD syndrome). The immunodysregulation resulted in autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and atopic dermatitis. The patient carried a de novo germline heterozygous c.406+540_574+13477dup; p. Gly136_Ser191dup variant in IKAROS family zinc finger 2 (IKZF2), which encodes HELIOS. This variant led to reduced HELIOS protein expression and dominant interference of wild-type HELIOS-mediated repression of the IL2 promoter. Multi-parameter flow cytometry analyses of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed strongly impaired natural killer cell differentiation and function, and increased CD8 + T cell activation and cytokine secretion. Strikingly, patient CD4 + T cells were hyperactive, produced elevated levels of nearly all T helper (T H) cytokines, and readily proliferated in response to stimulation. Patient regulatory T cells (Tregs) developed normally but aberrantly produced high levels of many T H cytokines. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed largely normal Tregs (albeit mostly memory), but naïve CD4 + T cells that were more enriched in genes related to activation, proliferation, metabolism, and T H differentiation. This work describes the immunological phenotype of one of the first reported cases of germline dominant negative HELIOS deficiency, expands our understanding of the pathogenesis of AIHA on a single cell level, and provides valuable insights into HELIOS function in a variety of lymphocyte subsets.

### Normal and pathological erythropoiesis in adults: from gene regulation to targeted treatment concepts [^111tXU8X]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Pathological erythropoiesis with consequent anemia is a leading cause of symptomatic morbidity in internal medicine. The etiologies of anemia are complex and include reactive as well as neoplastic conditions. Clonal expansion of erythroid cells in the bone marrow may result in peripheral erythrocytosis and polycythemia but can also result in anemia when clonal cells are dysplastic and have a maturation arrest that leads to apoptosis and hinders migration, a constellation typically seen in the myelodysplastic syndromes. Rarely, clonal expansion of immature erythroid blasts results in a clinical picture resembling erythroid leukemia. Although several mechanisms underlying normal and abnormal erythropoiesis and the pathogenesis of related disorders have been deciphered in recent years, little is known about specific markers and targets through which prognosis and therapy could be improved in anemic or polycythemic patients. In order to discuss new markers, targets and novel therapeutic approaches in erythroid disorders and the related pathologies, a workshop was organized in Vienna in April 2017. The outcomes of this workshop are summarized in this review, which includes a discussion of new diagnostic and prognostic markers, the updated WHO classification, and an overview of new drugs used to stimulate or to interfere with erythropoiesis in various neoplastic and reactive conditions. The use and usefulness of established and novel erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for various indications, including myelodysplastic syndromes and other neoplasms, are also discussed.

### Insights into germline predisposition to pediatric lymphoid malignancies [^111GWPMQ]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

IKZF1 -associated predisposition

IKAROS, encoded by IKZF1 on chromosome 7p12.2, is the founding member of the Ikaros family of transcription factors. IKAROS features four N-terminal DNA-binding zinc finger motifs and two C-terminal C2H2 zinc-fingers that mediate DNA binding or dimerization with self or other IKAROS family members. Widely expressed in hematopoietic cells, IKAROS undergoes alternative splicing to generate multiple isoforms essential for regulation of pro-B to pre-B cell and CD4 T cell differentiation. The existence of loss of function or dominant negative IKZF1 somatic mutations in high-risk B-ALL highlights IKAROS as an essential lymphoid tumor suppressor. IKZF 1 somatic alterations are also present in 1.2% of pediatric and 2.6–4.8% adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases, underscoring its role in myeloid cancers.

### Novel mutations and their functional and clinical relevance in myeloproliferative neoplasms: JAK2, MPL, TET2, ASXL1, CBL, IDH and IKZF1 [^1137VkCt]. Leukemia (2010). Low credibility.

As is the case with JAK2 mutations, MPL 515 mutations are stem cell-derived events that involve both myeloid and lymphoid progenitors. MPL mutant-induced oncogenesis also results in constitutive JAK-STAT activation and might require specific MPL mutant variants (such as MPL W515)and receptor residues (such as Y112). Some patients with ET or PMF display multiple MPL mutations and others a low allele burden JAK2 V617F clone together with a higher allele burden MPL mutation. Homozygosity for MPL mutations is also ascribed to acquired uniparental disomy, as is the case with JAK2 V617F.

MPL -mutated ET has been associated with older age, lower hemoglobin level, higher platelet count, microvascular symptoms and a higher risk of post-diagnosis arterial thrombosis. The presence of MPL mutation did not appear to affect survival, fibrotic or leukemic transformation. MPL -mutated PMF has been associated with the female gender, older age, lower hemoglobin level and a higher likelihood of becoming transfusion dependent. This set of findings suggests a phenotype-modifying effect that is different from that seen with a JAK2 mutation.

### Identification of germline monoallelic mutations in IKZF2 in patients with immune dysregulation [^113dAtqK]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Helios, encoded by IKZF2, is a member of the Ikaros family of transcription factors with pivotal roles in T-follicular helper, NK- and T-regulatory cell physiology. Somatic IKZF2 mutations are frequently found in lymphoid malignancies. Although germline mutations in IKZF1 and IKZF3 encoding Ikaros and Aiolos have recently been identified in patients with phenotypically similar immunodeficiency syndromes, the effect of germline mutations in IKZF2 on human hematopoiesis and immunity remains enigmatic. We identified germline IKZF2 mutations (one nonsense (p.R291X)- and 4 distinct missense variants) in six patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, immune thrombocytopenia or EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Patients exhibited hypogammaglobulinemia, decreased number of T-follicular helper and NK cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing of PBMCs from the patient carrying the R291X variant revealed upregulation of proinflammatory genes associated with T-cell receptor activation and T-cell exhaustion. Functional assays revealed the inability of HeliosR291X to homodimerize and bind target DNA as dimers. Moreover, proteomic analysis by proximity-dependent Biotin Identification revealed aberrant interaction of 3/5 Helios mutants with core components of the NuRD complex conveying HELIOS-mediated epigenetic and transcriptional dysregulation.

### Mutated IKZF1 is an independent marker of adverse risk in acute myeloid leukemia [^116SAxuX]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

In our large cohort of 1606 adult AML patients, we found heterozygous SNVs to be the most common mode of alteration while we observed only four frame-shift mutations and only one small deletion of IKZF1. In accordance with previous results, we also identified a mutational hotspot in the second N-terminal zinc finger domain at p.N159S, which was present in 19 cases (42.2%). Furthermore, in our cohort alterations were restricted to exons 5–8 while no alterations were detected in exons 1–3. Interestingly, in the majority of cases, we found IKZF1 to be altered in dominant clonal constellations suggesting these mutations to be earlier events in leukemogenesis. With regard to the co-mutational landscape, we found alterations of IKZF1 to be associated with alterations in RUNX1, GATA2, KRAS, KIT, SF3B1, and ETV6 while concomitant alterations in NPM1, TET2 as well as FLT3 -ITD and normal karyotypes were less frequent. The high co-occurrence of alterations in RUNX1 and GATA2 hints at a synergistic pathway in leukemogenesis, arguably converging on NOTCH signaling, with possible dysregulation of lineage determination and perturbance of erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis as well as survival regulation in myeloid progenitors. Co-occurring mutations in SF3B1 have also been described by Zhang et al. however, they also reported a significantly increased rate of concomitant biallelic alterations of CEBPA. Although we also observed a substantial number of CEBPA -mutant patients (n = 10), this association did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, most patients with IKZF1 mutations in the CEBPA -cohort had mutations outside exon 5. IKZF1 -mutated AML patients less frequently had de novo AML, however, the rates of sAML or tAML were not significantly increased in our cohort. Jäger et al. found deletions of IKZF1 to occur in ~20% of AML cases that arose secondary to myeloproliferative neoplasms suggesting a differential role of deletions and mutations in myeloid leukemogenesis.

### Deciphering the molecular complexity of the IKZF1genomic profile using optical genome mapping [^113ivVUG]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the genuine prognostic relevance of the IKZF1 plus profile relative to patients solely harboring an IKZF1 deletion, we analyzed the outcome omitting those patients harboring HeH, ETV6::RUNX1, iAMP21, and gene fusions (Figure 3E, F). The disparity in 5-year EFS between IKZF1 plus and IKZF1 del was then negligible (0.68 ± 0.09 vs. 0.77 ± 0.09). In addition, the observed tendency for a higher likelihood of relapse in the IKZF1 plus group (0.25 ± 0.09 vs. 0.15 ± 0.06) did not reach statistical significance.

Among the 36 IKZF1 del and 28 IKZF1 plus patients without known prognostic markers (HeH, ETV6::RUNX1, iAMP21, gene fusion excluded), 4 IKZF1 del and 11 IKZF1 plus were categorized MRD standard risk, 25 IKZF1 del and 12 IKZF1 plus as medium risk, and 5 IKZF1 del and 4 IKZF1 plus as high risk. For 3 patients, MRD data was unavailable. Given the restricted sample size within each group, a statistical analysis of EFS and CIR was not conducted.

### Modeling IKZF1 lesions in B-ALL reveals distinct chemosensitivity patterns and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities [^114E89BU]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1) alterations represent a diverse group of genetic lesions that are associated with an increased risk of relapse in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Due to the heterogeneity of concomitant lesions, it remains unclear how IKZF1 abnormalities directly affect cell function and therapy resistance, and whether their consideration as a prognostic indicator is valuable in improving outcome. CRISPR/Cas9 strategies were used to engineer multiple panels of isogeneic lymphoid leukemia cell lines with a spectrum of IKZF1 lesions to measure changes in chemosensitivity, gene expression, cell cycle, and in vivo engraftment that can be linked to loss of IKAROS protein. IKZF1 knockout and heterozygous null cells displayed relative resistance to a number of common therapies for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, including dexamethasone, asparaginase, and daunorubicin. Transcription profiling revealed a stem/myeloid cell-like phenotype and JAK/STAT upregulation after IKAROS loss. A CRISPR homology-directed repair strategy was also used to knock-in the dominant-negative IK6 isoform into the endogenous locus, and a similar drug resistance profile, with the exception of retained dexamethasone sensitivity, was observed. Interestingly, IKZF1 knockout and IK6 knock-in cells both have significantly increased sensitivity to cytarabine, likely owing to marked downregulation of SAMHD1 after IKZF1 knockout. Both types of IKZF1 lesions decreased the survival time of xenograft mice, with higher numbers of circulating blasts and increased organ infiltration. Given these findings, exact specification of IKZF1 status in patients may be a beneficial addition to risk stratification and could inform therapy.

### Transcriptional regulation of the ikzf1 locus [^111rCiQv]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Ikaros is a critical regulator of lymphocyte development and homeostasis; thus, understanding its transcriptional regulation is important from both developmental and clinical perspectives. Using a mouse transgenic reporter approach, we functionally characterized a network of highly conserved cis-acting elements at the Ikzf1 locus. We attribute B-cell and myeloid but not T-cell specificity to the main Ikzf1 promoter. Although this promoter was unable to counter local chromatin silencing effects, each of the 6 highly conserved Ikzf1 intronic enhancers alleviated silencing. Working together, the Ikzf1 enhancers provided locus control region activity, allowing reporter expression in a position and copy-independent manner. Only 1 of the Ikzf1 enhancers was responsible for the progressive upregulation of Ikaros expression from hematopoietic stem cells to lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors to T-cell precursors, which are stages of differentiation dependent on Ikaros for normal outcome. Thus, Ikzf1 is regulated by both epigenetic and transcriptional factors that target its enhancers in both redundant and specific fashions to provide an expression profile supportive of normal lymphoid lineage progression and homeostasis. Mutations in the Ikzf1 regulatory elements and their interacting factors are likely to have adverse effects on lymphopoiesis and contribute to leukemogenesis.

Haematopoiesis - the process by which pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells choose to become lymphocytes, myeloid cells, red blood cells or platelets - has long been a useful model to study cellular commitment and differentiation. Each cell type is defined by lineage-specific patterns of gene expression. The DNA binding protein Ikaros is an important regulator of haematopoiesis and recent work promises to shed light on how Ikaros itself is regulated.

### New strategies in acute lymphoblastic leukemia: translating advances in genomics into clinical practice [^117NdwHR]. Clinical Cancer Research (2011). Low credibility.

B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy and remains a leading cause of death in children and young adults. Current therapeutic approaches involve intensive combination chemotherapy, which fails in up to one quarter of patients. New treatment approaches directed against rational therapeutic targets are required. Recent genomic profiling of ALL has identified several genetic alterations associated with a high risk of treatment failure. Deletion or sequence mutation of the lymphoid transcription factor gene IKZF1 (IKAROS) is associated with a high rate of leukemic relapse, and testing for IKZF1 alterations at diagnosis may aid risk stratification. A subset of B-ALL patients with IKZF1 alterations have a transcriptional profile similar to BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, and these patients commonly have novel rearrangements and mutations resulting in aberrant cytokine receptor signaling and activation of kinase signaling cascades, including rearrangement of CRLF2 and activating mutations of Janus kinases (JAK1 and JAK2). JAK inhibitor therapy is under investigation in children with relapsed and refractory malignancies, including leukemia.

### Identification of germline monoallelic mutations in IKZF2 in patients with immune dysregulation [^116PQP4u]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helios (encoded by IKZF2) is a member of the Ikaros transcription factor family characterized by 4 highly conserved N-terminal C2H2 zinc finger domains involved in DNA binding and 2 C-terminal C2H2 zinc fingers required for homodimeric and heterodimeric protein interactions with other family members, such as Ikaros or Aiolos. Helios has been shown to control lymphocyte development and T follicular helper (Tfh)– and natural killer (NK)–cell differentiation and to maintain the suppressive function of regulatory T (Treg) cells and is frequently deleted in hypodiploid B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).

Monoallelic germline mutations in Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3) have been associated with combined immunodeficiency, common variable immunodeficiency, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) as well as leukemia predisposition, with incomplete penetrance. Here, we identify patients with germline monoallelic mutations in IKZF2 presenting with features of immune dysregulation, including ITP, SLE, and susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus–driven complications. We determine the detrimental effects of these mutations on Helios function, illustrating the key role of Helios in maintaining immune homeostasis.

### IKAROS-associated diseases in 2020: genotypes, phenotypes, and outcomes in primary immune deficiency / inborn errors of immunity [^116YjKJK]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

IKAROS, encoded by IKZF1, is a zinc finger transcription factor and a critical regulator of hematopoiesis. Mutations in IKZF1 have been implicated in immune deficiency, autoimmunity, and malignancy in humans. Somatic IKZF1 loss-of-function mutations and deletions have been shown to increase predisposition to the development of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and associated with poor prognosis. In the last 4 years, germline heterozygous IKZF1 mutations have been reported in primary immune deficiency/inborn errors of immunity. These allelic variants, acting by either haploinsufficiency or dominant negative mechanisms affecting particular functions of IKAROS, are associated with common variable immunodeficiency, combined immunodeficiency, or primarily hematologic phenotypes in affected patients. In this review, we provide an overview of genetic, clinical, and immunological manifestations in patients with IKZF1 mutations, and the molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to their disease as a consequence of IKAROS dysfunction.

### Congenital pancytopenia and absence of B lymphocytes in a neonate with a mutation in the ikaros gene [^117KnZ2V]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital pancytopenia is a rare and often lethal condition. Current knowledge of lymphoid and hematopoietic development in mice, as well as understanding regulators of human hematopoiesis, have led to the recent discovery of genetic causes of bone marrow failure disorders. However, in the absence of mutations of specific genes or a distinct clinical phenotype, many cases of aplastic anemia are labeled as idiopathic, while congenital immune deficiencies are described as combined immune deficiency.

Procedure

We describe the case of a 33-week gestation age male with severe polyhydramnios, hydrops, and ascites who was noted to be pancytopenic at birth. Bone marrow examination revealed a hypocellular marrow with absent myelopoiesis. An immune workup demonstrated profound B lymphopenia, near absent NK cells, and normal T cell number. Due to the similarity of the patient's phenotype with the IKAROS knockout mouse, studies were performed on bone marrow and peripheral blood to assess a potential pathogenic role of Ikaros.

Results

DNA studies revealed a point mutation in one allele of the IKAROS gene, resulting in an amino acid substitution in the DNA-binding zinc finger domain. Functional studies demonstrated that the observed mutation decreased Ikaros DNA-binding affinity, and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed aberrant Ikaros pericentromeric localization.

Conclusions

Our report describes a novel case of congenital pancytopenia associated with mutation of the IKAROS gene. Furthermore, these data suggest a critical role of IKAROS in human hematopoiesis and immune development.

Fig. 1
Localizations of deduced amino acid changes and co-mutational profile of IKZF1 alterations in acute myeloid leukemia.

IKZF1 was mutated in 45/1606 AML patients. Schematic representation of the IKZF1 protein (A). IKZF1 has four N-terminal zinc finger (ZF) domains (blue) and two C-terminal ZF domains (green). The x -axis represents amino acid positions with specific annotations for amino acids forming the ZF domains. The hotspot mutation p.N159S was present in 42.2% of cases (n = 19). This domain and locus are highly conserved across species (B). Median variant allele frequency (VAF) for IKZF1 was 44% (C). Alterations were predominantly missense rather than truncating mutations (C). AML patients bearing mutated IKZF1 had a median of four overall mutations (C). Compared to wildtype patients, patients with altered IKZF1 harbored significantly higher rates of co-occurring alterations in RUNX1, GATA2, KRAS, KIT, SF3B1, and ETV6 while co-occurrence of NPM1, FLT3 -ITD, and TET2 were rare (D). For detailed information on frequency and statistical significance of associated co-mutations, please see Table S2.

### The many faces of IKZF1 in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^111CtG3f]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

To further delineate the function of the individual zinc-fingers within the DNA-binding domain of IKZF1 in B-lymphopoiesis, Ikzf1 mouse mutants have been generated with targeted deletion of exon 4, which encodes zinc-finger 1 (Ikzf1 ΔF1/ΔF1), or exon 6 encoding zinc-finger 4 (Ikzf1 ΔF4/ΔF4). Germline deletion of either exon 4 or 6 results in decreased B-cell precursors with a stronger developmental block in Ikzf1 ΔF1/ΔF1 mice, especially at the pre-B-cell stage. In contrast, the fraction of large pre-B cells is strongly increased in Ikzf1 ΔF4/ΔF4 mice as compared to wild-type control animals. Interestingly, deletion of zinc-finger 4, but not zinc-finger 1, accelerates the onset of BCR-ABL1 -mediated B-cell leukemia. Conditional deletion of exon 5 (Ikzf1E5 Δ/Δ), which encodes zinc-fingers 2 and 3, at the stage of common lymphoid progenitors also results in an expansion of large pre-B cells within the bone marrow compartment, which is followed by a subsequent block in the transition to small pre-B cells. These findings indicate that N-terminal zinc-fingers 2, 3 and 4 of IKZF1 limit cell proliferation and survival at the time of active pre-B-cell receptor signaling, while zinc-fingers 1, 2 and 3 are absolutely required for the transition to the pre-B-cell stage.

### Mutated IKZF1 is an independent marker of adverse risk in acute myeloid leukemia [^113hX2YD]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

Genetic lesions of IKZF1 are frequent events and well-established markers of adverse risk in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, their function in the pathophysiology and impact on patient outcome in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains elusive. In a multicenter cohort of 1606 newly diagnosed and intensively treated adult AML patients, we found IKZF1 alterations in 45 cases with a mutational hotspot at N159S. AML with mutated IKZF1 was associated with alterations in RUNX1, GATA2, KRAS, KIT, SF3B1, and ETV6, while alterations of NPM1, TET2, FLT3-ITD, and normal karyotypes were less frequent. The clinical phenotype of IKZF1-mutated AML was dominated by anemia and thrombocytopenia. In both univariable and multivariable analyses adjusting for age, de novo and secondary AML, and ELN2022 risk categories, we found mutated IKZF1 to be an independent marker of adverse risk regarding complete remission rate, event-free, relapse-free, and overall survival. The deleterious effects of mutated IKZF1 also prevailed in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (n = 519) in both univariable and multivariable models. These dismal outcomes are only partially explained by the hotspot mutation N159S. Our findings suggest a role for IKZF1 mutation status in AML risk modeling.

### The many faces of IKZF1 in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^1128umYm]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

IKZF1 is essential for normal lymphopoiesis

Studies performed in both constitutive and conditional Ikzf1 knockout mouse models have demonstrated that IKZF1 function is not only required at different stages of lymphopoiesis, but also for normal myeloid, megakaryocyte and erythroid differentiation. – Ikzf1 -deficient mice (Ikzf1 null/null) lack all B cells, natural killer cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells and fetal T cells, (Figure 2). Nonetheless, post-natal Ikzf1 -null mice harbor early T lineage progenitors within the thymus and export mature T cells to the periphery. Mice homozygous mutant for a hypomorphic allele of Ikzf1 (Ikzf1 L/L) show reduced B-cell progenitors in the bone marrow compartment, but still generate normal counts of mature B2 cells. These splenic B cells display alterations in isotype selection during immunoglobulin class switch recombination and a hyperproliferation phenotype upon antigenic stimulation. Although spontaneous progression to B-cell ALL is not observed in Ikzf1 L/L mice, haplodeficient Ikzf1 L/+ animals demonstrate an accelerated onset of B-cell leukemia in combination with a BCR-ABL1 transgene. Moreover, all Ikzf L/L mice develop thymic lymphoma within a period of 10 months through activation of the Notch pathway. Ikzf1 mutant mice expressing dominant-negative isoforms of IKZF1 (Ikzf1 DN/DN and Ikzf1 Plstc/Plstc) demonstrate a widespread failure of hematopoiesis, highlighting the importance of IKAROS transcription factors in hematolymphoid differentiation. Notably, heterozygous Ikzf1 mutant mice develop T-cell malignancies with very high penetrance and short latency in the case of the dominant-negative isoforms, while this phenotype is less obvious in Ikzf1 +/− mice.

### Novel potential therapeutics to modify iron metabolism and red cell synthesis in diseases associated with defective erythropoiesis [^117H13Xf]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Diseases associated with abnormal red cell synthesis and their pathophysiology

Erythropoiesis can be altered by genetic mutations that impair red cell production, such as in congenital anemias or polycythemia vera (PV), or by conditions that perturb normal iron metabolism, such as iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA). Conditions associated with chronic inflammation, such as chronic kidney disease, are also characterized by reduced red cell production and survival. In this review, we focus on diseases that illustrate key pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for altered red cell production, the role of iron metabolism, and strategies targeting these mechanisms that may serve as potential novel treatment approaches. Anemia is a consequence of inadequate functional red cells in circulation, which can result from reduced red cell production, increased red cell destruction, or a combination of these two processes. Diseases associated with genetic mutations that directly alter red cell production are generally characterized by defects at the erythroid cell-differentiation stage at which the mutated genes exert their functions. These mutations may also affect the quality and lifespan of surviving mature red cells.

### Abnormal hematopoiesis and autoimmunity in human subjects with germline IKZF1 mutations [^1166Q7fk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Ikaros, which is encoded by IKZF1, is a transcriptional factor that play a critical role in hematopoiesis. Somatic IKZF1 alterations are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of leukemia in human subjects. Recently, immunodeficiency caused by germline IKZF1 mutation has been described.

Objective

We sought to describe the clinical and immunologic phenotypes of Japanese patients with heterozygous IKZF1 mutations.

Methods

We performed whole-exome sequencing in patients from a dysgammaglobulinemia or autoimmune disease cohort and used a candidate gene approach in 4 patients. Functional and laboratory studies, including detailed lymphopoiesis/hematopoiesis analysis in the bone marrow, were performed.

Results

Nine patients from 6 unrelated families were identified to have heterozygous germline mutations in IKZF1. Age of onset was 0 to 20 years (mean, 7.4 years). Eight of 9 patients presented with dysgammaglobulinemia accompanied by B-cell deficiency. Four of 9 patients had autoimmune disease, including immune thrombocytopenic purpura, IgA vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Nonautoimmune pancytopenia was observed in 1 patient. All of the mutant Ikaros protein demonstrated impaired DNA binding to the target sequence and abnormal diffuse nuclear localization. Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow revealed reduced levels of common lymphoid progenitors and normal development of pro-B to pre-B cells.

Conclusions

Germline heterozygous IKZF1 mutations cause dysgammaglobulinemia; hematologic abnormalities, including B-cell defect; and autoimmune diseases.

Recent advances have re-drawn this map, separating lymphoid and myeloid from erythroid programs early in development. Subsequently, the fate restriction of both the lympho-myeloid and the erythro-megakaryocyte progenitors is dependent on Ikaros and its associated chromatin regulators. Genetic studies of this family of nuclear factors are now providing unique insight into the functional molecular signatures that bestow plasticity to the hematopoietic stem cell and its early progeny.

### Loss-of-function but not dominant-negative intragenicdeletions are associated with an adverse prognosis in adult-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^111ZUXN1]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

In animal studies, double IKZF1 knock-out mice show a total absence of B cells. Mice with only IKZF1 deletions did not develop BCP ALL, but haploinsufficiency of IKZF1 in BCR-ABL -transgenic mice significantly accelerated the development of BCP ALL. Current evidence suggests that IKZF1 alterations alone are not sufficient to cause leukemia in humans but are an important co-factor or secondary event in the development and acceleration of ALL disease.

It may seem unexpected that the loss of one IKZF1 allele without apparent functional alteration of the other allele should have such a significant prognostic effect. However, this is supported by the above mentioned mouse model of Virely et al. The observation that loss-of-function IKZF1 deletions frequently occur in a small fraction of cells, but only seem to have an impact on prognosis if they are found in a large fraction, requires some explanation. A hypothetical explanation is the assumption that RAG-mediated IKZF1 deletions occur sporadically during all stages of B-cell maturation because of the ongoing process of VDJ recombination. However, only those IKZF1 aberrations occurring at a very early maturation stage are thought to result in a cell phenotype with the full capacity of self-renewal, i.e. a "leukemia stem cell phenotype". IKZF1 alterations occurring at later stages of B-cell maturation should result in low deletion load aberrations.

### Inborn errors of IKAROS and AIOLOS [^116wztdP]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

IKAROS is a pioneer protein of the IKZF family of transcription factors that plays an essential role in lymphocyte development. Recently, inborn errors of IKAROS have been identified in patients with B cell deficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia, and these patients often present with recurrent sinopulmonary infection. Autoimmunity and hematologic malignancies are other characteristic complications seen in the patients with IKAROS deficiency. Missense mutation involving asparagine at the 159th position results in combined immunodeficiency, often presenting with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Inborn errors of AIOLOS, HELIOS, and PEGASUS have also been reported in patients with B cell deficiency, Evans syndrome, and hereditary thrombocytopenia, respectively. Here, we briefly review the phenotype and genotype of IKZF mutations, especially IKAROS.

### Ikaros gene expression and leukemia [^113qNDKW]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2002). Low credibility.

The Ikaros (Ik) protein, or LyF1, was initially described as a protein binding to regulatory sequences of a number of genes expressed in murine lymphoid cells. Ikaros is a critical regulator of normal hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, as evidenced by dramatic defects in the lymphoid compartments, in homozygous animals with gene inactivation. Because differential splicing produces multiple isoforms with potentially different functions, Ikaros provides a unique model to study how post-transcriptional mechanisms may be involved in neoplastic processes. Indeed, several groups including ours have underlined evidences that expression of different Ikaros isoforms vary among different types of leukemias. The predominance of short isoforms in certain subsets is intriguing. Here, additional observations reinforced the hypothesis that Ikaros expression may be deregulated in human leukemias. Whether this is a cause or a consequence of the leukemic process remains speculative. Other human diseases however, provide examples of abnormal post-transcriptional regulations that have been further characterized.

### Identification of germline monoallelic mutations in IKZF2 in patients with immune dysregulation [^115yZaki]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Germline mutations in IKZF1 and IKZF3 predispose to B-ALL and B-cell lymphoma, respectively. Dysfunctional Helios has been implicated in sporadic hematopoietic malignancies; in adult T-cell lymphoma, deletions leading to aberrant splicing have been observed. Similar short isoforms lead to T-cell lymphoma in mice as a result of a dominant-negative effect with loss of DNA binding activity of the mutant protein. Furthermore, deletions affecting Helios are a hallmark of low hypodiploid B-ALL observed in 52.9% of patients. Although we did not observe malignancy in our cohort of patients, future studies will need to determine whether such IKZF2 germline mutations confer an increased risk of malignancy and whether close monitoring and potential preemptive therapy may be indicated.

### Neutrophilic dermatosis in a patient with an IKZF1 variant and a review of monogenic autoinflammatory disorders presenting with neutrophilic dermatoses [^114GCcHE]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Monogenic diseases of immune dysregulation should be considered in the evaluation of children presenting with recurrent neutrophilic dermatoses in association with systemic signs of inflammation, autoimmune disease, hematologic abnormalities, and opportunistic or recurrent infections. We report the case of a 2-year-old boy presenting with a neutrophilic dermatosis, found to have a novel likely pathogenic germline variant of the IKAROS Family Zinc Finger 1 (IKZF1) gene; the mutation likely results in a loss of function dimerization defective protein based on reports and studies of similar variants. IKZF1 variants could potentially lead to aberrant neutrophil chemotaxis and development of neutrophilic dermatoses. Long-term surveillance is required to monitor the development of hematologic malignancy, autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, and infection in patients with pathogenic IKZF1 germline variants.

### Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113kipQV]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia — leukemia predisposition syndromes states that patients who have leukemia predisposition syndromes have an increased risk of treatment-related toxicity and secondary malignancy and require close surveillance. It is important for the treating clinician to conduct a thorough physical exam for features of an underlying genetic syndrome and to obtain a thorough family history for others with hematologic or other malignancies, with or without antecedent cytopenias; additional considerations include low hypodiploidy, which could indicate the presence of a germline TP53 mutation, and, for individuals that undergo genomic testing, tumor variants of potential germline relevance such as PAX5, ETV6, and IKZF1. If there is a concern for a leukemia predisposition syndrome, consider referral to a genetic counselor or geneticist to identify appropriate clinical testing.

### Deletions of the transcription factor ikaros in myeloproliferative neoplasms [^114BZxKC]. Leukemia (2010). Low credibility.

Transformation to acute leukemia is a major complication of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), however, the genetic changes leading to transformation remain largely unknown. We screened nine patients with post-MPN leukemia for chromosomal aberrations using microarray karyotyping. Deletions on the short arm of chromosome 7 (del7p) emerged as a recurrent defect. We mapped the common deleted region to the IKZF1 gene, which encodes the transcription factor Ikaros. We further examined the frequency of IKZF1 deletions in a total of 29 post-MPN leukemia and 526 MPN patients without transformation and observed a strong association of IKZF1 deletions with post-MPN leukemia in two independent cohorts. Patients with IKZF1 loss showed complex karyotypes, and del7p was a late event in the genetic evolution of the MPN clone. IKZF1 deletions were observed in both undifferentiated and differentiated myeloid cell types, indicating that IKZF1 loss does not cause differentiation arrest but rather renders progenitors susceptible to transformation, most likely through chromosomal instability. Induced Ikzf1 haploinsufficiency in primary murine progenitors resulted in elevated Stat5 phosphorylation and increased cytokine-dependent growth, suggesting that reduced expression of IKZF1 is sufficient to perturb growth regulation. Thus, IKZF1 loss is an important step in the leukemic transformation of a subpopulation of MPN patients.

### Novel mutations and their functional and clinical relevance in myeloproliferative neoplasms: JAK2, MPL, TET2, ASXL1, CBL, IDH and IKZF1 [^111vWkKM]. Leukemia (2010). Low credibility.

IKZF1 mutations

IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1; 7p12) encodes for Ikaros transcription factors, which are important regulators of lymphoid differentiation. IKZF1 gene (seven translated exons) transcription is characterized by multiple alternatively spliced transcripts with common C- (inter-Ikaros protein dimerization) and N-terminal (DNA-binding) domains. IKZF1 is believed to modulate expression of lineage-specific genes through a mechanism that involves chromatin remodeling and results in effective lymphoid development and tumor suppression. Loss-of-function animal models develop severe B, T and NK cell defects (homozygous gene deletions) or lymphoblastic leukemia (heterozygous for a dominant-negative allele). IKZF1 mutations and overexpression of dominant-negative isoforms are prevalent in ALL, including blast-phase CML or BCR - ABL1 -positive ALL, suggesting a pathogenetic contribution to leukemic transformation. A recent study demonstrated that IKZF1 deletions were rare in chronic-phase MPN but were detected in approximately 19% of patients with blast-phase MPN. The occurrence of IKZF1 mutations in MPN is particularly relevant, as part of their functional consequence might include JAK–STAT activation.

### The IKZF1 N159S mutation is associated with poor outcome and a distinct molecular profile in adult patients with AML [^1169E7VF]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

IKZF1 mutations are recurrent alterations in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and hotspot point mutation, N159S, has recently been associated with unique gene expression and adverse risk. To better understand the molecular and clinical associations of IKZF1 N159S‐mutated AML, we performed a pooled analysis of 4136 AML patients. IKZF1 N159 mutations were found in 39 patients (0.94%) in a dominant clonal constellation, indicating early genetic events. N159S mutations were associated with aberrant karyotype, significantly higher rates of myelodysplasia‐related gene mutations, ELN2022 adverse risk and a particularly poor outcome, supporting the classification of IKZF1 N159S‐mutated AML as a rare molecular subtype with adverse prognosis.

### Awakening lineage potential by ikaros-mediated transcriptional priming [^113UCiDE]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Bioinformatic studies on a revised hierarchy of hematopoietic progenitors have provided a genome-wide view of lineage-affiliated transcriptional programs directing early hematopoiesis. Unexpectedly, lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid gene expression programs were primed with similar frequency at the multipotent progenitor stage indicating a stochastic nature to this process. Multilineage transcriptional priming is quickly resolved upon erythroid lineage restriction with both lymphoid and myeloid transcriptional programs rapidly extinguished. However, expression of lymphoid and myeloid factors remains active past nominal lymphoid and myeloid lineage restrictions, revealing a common genetic network utilized by both pathways. Priming and resolution of multilineage potential is dependent on the activity of the DNA binding factor Ikaros. Ikaros primes the lymphoid transcriptional program in the HSC and represses the stem cell and other disparate transcriptional programs downstream of the HSC. Loss of Ikaros removes the lymphoid leg of the immune system and may confer aberrant self-renewing properties to myeloid progenitors.

### Clinical impact of ABL1 kinase domain mutations and IKZF1 deletion in adults under age 60 with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph +) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): molecular analysis of CALGB (alliance) 10001 and 9665 [^115txspC]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2016). Low credibility.

Recent studies have identified oncogenic lesions in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and ABL1 kinase mutations that confer resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We sought to determine the prevalence and clinical impact of these lesions in patients on CALGB 10001, a previously reported Phase II study of imatinib, chemotherapy, and hematopoietic cell transplant in adult Ph+ALL. Of the 58 enrolled, 22 relapsed. By direct sequencing, an ABL1 kinase mutation known to induce imatinib resistance was present at relapse in 13 of 20. Using quantitative PCR assays, the mutations were detectable at diagnosis or early during treatment in most (62%) relapsed patients. Aberrations in IKZF1, CDKN2A/B, and PAX5 were assessed in 28 samples using SNP arrays and genomic DNA sequencing. Of these, 22 (79%) had IKZF1 deletion. The combination of IKZF1 deletion and p210 BCR-ABL1 (p < 0.0001), high white blood cell count (p = 0.021), and minimal residual disease (p = 0.013) were associated with worse disease-free survival.

### An allele of IKZF1 (ikaros) conferring susceptibility to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia protects against type 1 diabetes [^114ovP6i]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

IKZF1 encodes Ikaros, a zinc-finger transcription factor with a regulatory role in lymphopoiesis and the maintenance of cytokine expression in mature lymphocytes. Mice with a null mutation in IKZF1 (Ikaros −/−) display complete penetrance of leukemia, increased CD4 + to CD8 + T-cell ratios, and defects in T-cell maturation, including decreased T-cell receptor signaling thresholds during central tolerance. Mice heterozygous for the null mutation in IKZF1 (Ikaros +/−) exhibit milder features, but abnormalities including reduced B-cell precursors, a highly increased proliferative response to T-cell receptor engagement, and high rates of T-cell leukemia and lymphomas have been observed.

Human studies suggest a specific role for Ikaros in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (C-ALL). Development of C-ALL is linked to somatically acquired mutations that add to inherited cancer susceptibility alleles. In 2009, deletions of IKZF1 were reported in 28.6% of C-ALL affected adults and in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 C-ALL patients examined. Combined, the human and murine studies suggest that diminished expression of IKZF1 interrupts lymphocyte development, creating conditions that maintain the rapidly dividing lymphoblasts that characterize ALL.

### VPS4A mutations in humans cause syndromic congenital dyserythropoietic anemia due to cytokinesis and trafficking defects [^111nuG95]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

The Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia (CDA) Registry was established with the goal to facilitate investigations of natural history, biology, and molecular pathogenetic mechanisms of CDA. Three unrelated individuals enrolled in the registry had a syndrome characterized by CDA and severe neurodevelopmental delay. They were found to have missense mutations in VPS4A, a gene coding for an ATPase that regulates the ESCRT-III machinery in a variety of cellular processes including cell division, endosomal vesicle trafficking, and viral budding. Bone marrow studies showed binucleated erythroblasts and erythroblasts with cytoplasmic bridges indicating abnormal cytokinesis and abscission. Circulating red blood cells were found to retain transferrin receptor (CD71) in their membrane, demonstrating that VPS4A is critical for normal reticulocyte maturation. Using proband-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we have successfully modeled the hematologic aspects of this syndrome in vitro, recapitulating their dyserythropoietic phenotype. Our findings demonstrate that VPS4A mutations cause cytokinesis and trafficking defects leading to a human disease with detrimental effects to erythropoiesis and neurodevelopment.

### A novel IKAROS haploinsufficiency kindred with unexpectedly late and variable B-cell maturation defects [^112nKfPH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

The multilevel central B-cell developmental block observed in this IKZF1 family appears later than observed in previously published IKAROS-haploinsufficient cases. First, early hematopoiesis in subjects I:2 and II:3 showed a partial arrest at the multipotent progenitor and B-lineage stages, whereas 2 patients reported by Hoshino et alexhibited blockages at the earlier hematopoietic stem cell and common lymphoid progenitor stages in addition to the B-lineage block. Second, within B-lineage cells, symptomatic patient II:3 exhibited arrests at the pre-B and mature B-cell stages, whereas the Hoshino et al patients showed normal composition of the B-lineage, and 2 patients described by Kuehn et alhad a block at the earlier pro-B cell stage. Whether these differences are linked to the genotype of our patients remains to be established because all 4 previously reported patients harbored missense mutations in the second zinc finger motif of IKZF1, whereas our patients have a loss of IKAROS protein caused by a frameshift mutation.

To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports on central B-cell development in asymptomatic IKZF1 mutation carriers. In subject I:2 the absence of clinical involvement was reflected in a quasinormal peripheral B-cell development. However, considering the important reduction in central B-lineage cells and the recently documented specific antibody deficiency, the B-cell compartment is clearly affected, and the subject might still become symptomatic at a later age. Interestingly, a Kaplan-Meier curve for onset of symptoms generated based on 45 reported symptomatic and asymptomatic cases suggests that all germline IKZF1 mutation carriers might eventually go on to develop symptoms (see Fig E4 in this article's Online Repository at). Although Kaplan-Meier estimates at the utmost ends of a time interval need to be interpreted with caution, from a clinical perspective, this warrants longitudinal follow-up of asymptomatic subjects. Peripheral B-cell numbers seem to be a suitable marker for monitoring disease progression, whereas serum IgG levels have been shown to remain normal for years after development of B-cell lymphopenia.

### The many faces of IKZF1 in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^114183XY]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

An interesting feature is the strongly increased prevalence of IKZF1 deletions and mutations in high-risk BCP-ALL cases with an activated tyrosine kinase profile, particularly BCR-ABL1 -positive ALL (~85%), and BCR-ABL1 -like ALL (~70%), which is characterized by a range of genetic alterations driving cytokine receptor and kinase signaling.– Similarly, IKZF1 deletions and mutations are highly abundant in chronic myeloid leukemia that has progressed to lymphoid blast crises, but IKZF1 alterations are virtually absent in chronic-phase and myeloid blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia. IKZF1 deletions are also rarely detected in ETV6-RUNX1 -positive BCP-ALL (3%), TCF3 -rearranged (~3%) and MLL -rearranged (~5%) B-cell ALL. The distribution of IKZF1 deletions among the remaining subtypes, including hyperdiploid and B-other leukemia, ranges from 15%-20%.

IKZF1 acts as a critical tumor suppressor in mouse T-lymphoid malignancies, but IKZF1 gene lesions are not very prevalent in T-ALL. Copy number alterations and mutations affecting the IKZF1 gene can be detected in ~4% of T-ALL. Notably, IKZF1 alterations occur in ~13% of early T-cell precursor ALL, a high-risk subtype of T-ALL characterized by recurrent mutations activating tyrosine kinases (FLT3, JAK1, JAK3) and cytokine signaling (IL7R). IKZF1 alterations have also been reported in myeloproliferative neoplasms, and both pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia harbor IKZF1 deletions that affect its function. Thus, the tumor suppressive activity of IKZF1 is not uniquely restricted towards the lymphoid lineage and extends to a broader range of hematologic malignancies.

### Somatic mutations in children with-associated myelodysplastic syndrome who lack other features of GATA2 deficiency [^116aRv9b]. Blood Advances (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately 10% of children with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have germ line GATA2 mutations, leading to the proposal that all children with primary MDS and certain cytogenetic findings, including monosomy 7, be tested for germ line GATA2 mutations regardless of family history or other clinical features associated with GATA2 deficiency. In adults with familial GATA2 -MDS, those with somatic mutations in ASXL1 experience rapid disease progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and poor prognosis after stem cell transplantation; however, the prevalence of somatic mutations in primary pediatric GATA2 -MDS is unclear. Here, we studied a cohort of 8 pediatric patients with MDS and lacking additional GATA2 -associated clinical features or significant family history and identified heterozygous germ line GATA2 mutations in 5 patients, including 1 with a normal karyotype. For those with GATA2 -MDS, we screened for somatic mutations in genes with prognostic relevance in AML/MDS, using a targeted next-generation sequencing panel. Although no somatic mutations in ASXL1 were observed, somatic mutations were found in RUNX1, SETBP1, IKZF1, and CRLF2. One subject with deleterious mutations in RUNX1, SETBP1, and IKZF1 rapidly progressed to AML with disease that was refractory to treatment. Our findings confirm the importance of GATA2 testing in primary pediatric MDS, even in the absence of other clinical features of GATA2 deficiency. Further, similar to what has been observed in adults with GATA2 -MDS, somatic mutations with potential prognostic effect occur in children with MDS associated with mutations in GATA2.

### Mutated IKZF1 is an independent marker of adverse risk in acute myeloid leukemia [^111hencn]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

In summary, we found IKZF1 mutations to be recurrent events in a large multicenter cohort of adult AML patients with a hotspot lesion at N159S. AML with mutated IKZF1 displayed a distinct co-mutational pattern hinting at synergistic and convergent pathways contributing to leukemogenesis and resulting in clinical phenotypes associated with cytopenia. Further, we identified mutated IKZF1 to be an independent marker of adverse outcomes in multivariable analyses demonstrating a substantially decreased CR rate and shortened EFS, RFS, and OS, which can only partially be attributed to the hotspot lesion N159S. These findings warrant the further evaluation of IKZF1 mutation status for clinical decision making as well as the development of therapeutic strategies to alleviate the dismal outcomes of IKZF1 -mutated AML, for example, using combinatorial strategies including IMiDs.

### Ikaros family zinc finger 1 regulates dendritic cell development and function in humans [^112DpFLi]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Prompted by the knowledge that murine pDC development is dependent upon Ikzf1, here we investigate whether IKZF1 mutation or inhibition with lenalidomide causes pDC deficiency in humans, using phenotypic and functional analyses performed on patients with IKZF1 haploinsufficiency, those receiving lenalidomide, or on progenitor cell cultures exposed to lenalidomide in vitro. In addition to pDC deficiency, we observe a relative increase in cDC1 in vivo and in vitro and a loss of non-classical monocytes in vivo. In the presence of IKZF1 deficiency, pDCs produce less IFN-α, pDCs and monocytes secrete less tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and cDC1, although increased, produce less IL-12. These results extend the known functions of IKZF1 to include the regulation of human DC haematopoiesis.

### A germline heterozygous dominant negative IKZF2 variant causing syndromic primary immune regulatory disorder and ICHAD [^115nudhe]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

P1 CD19 + B Cells Show Largely Normal Development but Increased TNF-α Production

HELIOS silencing is thought to maintain B cell function as ectopic expression leads to B cell hyperresponsiveness and lymphomagenesis. We therefore studied the development and function of P1 B cells. In general, B cell development was largely normal (Fig. S3 A), with intact naïve (Fig. S3 B), switched memory [SM] (Fig. S3 D), and plasmablasts (Fig. S3 G-H). However, we did observe significantly increased non-switched memory [NSM] (Fig. S3 C) and decreased transitional B cells (Fig. S3 E-F), while HELIOS was lowly expressed in all B cell populations from both P1 and controls (Fig. S3 I). In response to stimulation, patient B cells produced significantly more TNF-α than controls (Fig. S3 J) across NSM (Fig. S3 K), SM (Fig. S3 L), and naïve (Fig. S3 M) subsets.

### Novel mutations and their functional and clinical relevance in myeloproliferative neoplasms: JAK2, MPL, TET2, ASXL1, CBL, IDH and IKZF1 [^1129jCxs]. Leukemia (2010). Low credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) originate from genetically transformed hematopoietic stem cells that retain the capacity for multilineage differentiation and effective myelopoiesis. Beginning in early 2005, a number of novel mutations involving Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), Myeloproliferative Leukemia Virus (MPL), TET oncogene family member 2 (TET2), Additional Sex Combs-Like 1 (ASXL1), Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene (CBL), Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1) have been described in BCR-ABL1 -negative MPNs. However, none of these mutations were MPN specific, displayed mutual exclusivity or could be traced back to a common ancestral clone. JAK2 and MPL mutations appear to exert a phenotype-modifying effect and are distinctly associated with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis; the corresponding mutational frequencies are ∼99, 55 and 65% for JAK2 and 0, 3 and 10% for MPL mutations. The incidence of TET2, ASXL1, CBL, IDH or IKZF1 mutations in these disorders ranges from 0 to 17% these latter mutations are more common in chronic (TET2, ASXL1, CBL) or juvenile (CBL) myelomonocytic leukemias, mastocytosis (TET2), myelodysplastic syndromes (TET2, ASXL1) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia, including blast-phase MPN (IDH, ASXL1, IKZF1). The functional consequences of MPN-associated mutations include unregulated JAK-STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) signaling, epigenetic modulation of transcription and abnormal accumulation of oncoproteins. However, it is not clear as to whether and how these abnormalities contribute to disease initiation, clonal evolution or blastic transformation.

### Detection of molecular residual disease for stage I to III colorectal cancer via circulating tumor DNA methylation… [^114t5G81]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Positive rates of 6 targets are shown. BCAN indicates brevican; BCAT1, branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1; IKZF1, ikaros family zinc finger 1; Septin9_1, septin 9 locus 1; Septin9_2, septin 9 locus 2; and VAV3, vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3. A, Kaplan-Meier estimates of recurrence-free survival for patients who completed definitive treatment, stratified by the first time point at postdefinitive treatment ctDNA status. After curative treatment, ctDNA positivity was associated with a strikingly reduced RFS compared with ctDNA negativity. At postoperative month 1, ctDNA-positive patients were 17. 5 times more likely to relapse than were ctDNA-negative patients. The integration of ctDNA and carcinoembryonic antigen tests showed risk stratification for recurrence with an HR of 19.
0.

Postdefinitive treatment analysis detected CRC recurrence earlier than radiologically confirmed recurrence, with a median lead time of
3. 3 months. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cohort study suggest that longitudinal assessment of ctDNA methylation may enable the early detection of recurrence, potentially optimizing risk stratification and postoperative treatment of patients with CRC. As early as postoperative month 1, the sensitivity to detect relapse was 78. 0%, with
90. 2% specificity, which was consistent across different stages. All patients with recurrence and ctDNA-positive test results had ctDNA detected earlier than radiologically confirmed recurrence, with a median lead time of 3. 3 months.

Unexpectedly, 10 of 12 adjuvant chemotherapy–treated patients showed ctDNA positivity before the start of adjuvant chemotherapy, indicating a high-risk subgroup.

### Insights into germline predisposition to pediatric lymphoid malignancies [^116q37Ps]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Germline variation in IKZF1 was initially described to modulate the risk of pediatric B-ALL through large genome-wide association studies which identified two common intronic variants. Subsequently in 2018, Churchman et al. identified heterozygous germline IKZF1 variants co-segregating with disease in the members of a family characterized by autosomal dominant predisposition to B-ALL, B-lymphopenia and/or hypogammaglobulinemia and found a 0.9% prevalence of germline IKZF1 variants in a large cohort of presumed sporadic B-ALL cases. Altogether, 28 unique IKZF1 variants were identified in 45 individuals, raising the possibility that IKZF1 represented a novel B-ALL predisposing gene. Carriers of IKZF1 pathogenic variants exhibit clinical features including immunological dysregulation (e.g. autoimmunity, immunodeficiency) with ~65–70% penetrance and a 10% risk of developing lymphoid malignancies, particularly B-ALL, by age 20 years and less commonly, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). IKZF1 germline variants are distributed across the IKAROS functional domains and lead to dysregulated transcriptional activity and inefficient lymphoid maturation through haploinsufficiency, dimerization defects, dominant-negative, or gain-of-function effects. Recently, one new and two previously identified loci in IKZF1 were found enriched among Hispanic/Latino children with B-ALL compared to children of predominantly European ancestry. It is possible that these variants contribute to the disproportionately higher incidence of B-ALL among Hispanic/Latino children. Finally, the significance of germline variation in the Ikaros proteins for hematological phenotypes is highlighted by identifying germline pathogenic variants in the DNA-binding zinc fingers of IKZF5, which is linked to hereditary thrombocytopenia. Taken together, these findings highlight the multifaceted role of IKZF1 and Ikaros family proteins in hematopoiesis, immune regulation, and leukemogenesis.

### A novel IKAROS haploinsufficiency kindred with unexpectedly late and variable B-cell maturation defects [^112qK4Wg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

IKAROS haploinsufficiency shares important genetic aspects with other recently identified primary immunodeficiencies of haploinsufficiency. Notable are nuclear factor k B1, cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated antigen 4, and GATA-2 haploinsufficiencies, disorders that also affect the B-cell compartment and are characterized by incomplete penetrance, as well as variable expressivity and a highly variable age of onset in manifesting subjects. The molecular basis of incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity is poorly understood. Murine models have implicated an important role for IKAROS at nearly every step of B-cell development and function. Besides the more obvious defects in hematopoietic progenitor cell development, impaired IKAROS function during recombination of immunoglobulin gene segments and peripheral B-cell responses might provide a link with the antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases seen in patient II:4 and previously reported cases and with the specific polysaccharide antibody deficiency detected in the asymptomatic mother (subject I:2), respectively. Furthermore, the largely different B-cell profile in the reported mutant subjects despite similarly low IKAROS protein levels might suggest the presence of compensatory mechanisms at multiple levels capable of (partially) surmounting the IKAROS defect. The actions of modifier genes, epigenetic changes, and/or environmental exposures might affect these compensatory mechanisms in different ways, which could, in part, explain the phenotypic heterogeneity in IKAROS-haploinsufficient patients. Disease-influencing mechanisms in IKZF1 -associated immunodeficiency await further study.

In conclusion, we report on the first truncating IKZF1 mutation associated with IKAROS haploinsufficiency and illustrate an unexpectedly late and variable block in central and peripheral B-cell development in 2 patients and their asymptomatic mother. Given the observed immunologic abnormalities, we recommend close follow-up of asymptomatic IKZF1 mutation carriers.

To the Editor

IKAROS, encoded by the IKAROS family zinc finger protein 1 (IKZF1) gene, is a hematopoietic zinc finger transcription factor essential in human hematopoiesis and B-cell development. Somatic changes in IKZF1 have been associated with B-cell leukemia. Germline IKZF1 mutations have been identified recently as a cause of common variable immunodeficiency and dysgammaglobulinemia through IKAROS haploinsufficiency. They are autosomal dominantly inherited or appear de novo.–Eleven of 42 germline IKZF1 mutation carriers were clinically asymptomatic at the time of publication, suggesting incomplete penetrance.–However, since age of onset ranged from infancy to the sixth decade, younger asymptomatic subjects might still develop disease later in life. Symptomatic subjects mainly presented with bacterial infections, especially of the respiratory tract. In addition, some patients had antibody-mediated autoimmune manifestations or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Affected subjects typically showed a (progressive) decrease of peripheral B-cell numbers accompanied by a (progressive) reduction in at least one major immunoglobulin isotype. Total T-cell numbers were not decreased, but patients often displayed quantitative changes in various T-cell subsets. Here we report an autosomal dominant kindred with a novel truncating mutation in IKZF1 and describe new insights in B-cell maturation in 2 symptomatic and 1 asymptomatic family members.

### The IKZF1 N159S mutation is associated with poor outcome and a distinct molecular profile in adult patients with AML [^111NLLfL]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

IKZF1 mutations are recurrent alterations in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and hotspot point mutation, N159S, has recently been associated with unique gene expression and adverse risk. To better understand the molecular and clinical associations of IKZF1 N159S-mutated AML, we performed a pooled analysis of 4136 AML patients. IKZF1 N159 mutations were found in 39 patients (0.94%) in a dominant clonal constellation, indicating early genetic events. N159S mutations were associated with aberrant karyotype, significantly higher rates of myelodysplasia-related gene mutations, ELN2022 adverse risk and a particularly poor outcome, supporting the classification of IKZF1 N159S-mutated AML as a rare molecular subtype with adverse prognosis.

### Ikaros inhibits megakaryopoiesis through functional interaction with GATA-1 and NOTCH signaling [^114dNTRS]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

The transcription factor Ikaros regulates the development of hematopoietic cells. Ikaros-deficient animals fail to develop B cells and display a T-cell malignancy, which is correlated with altered Notch signaling. Recently, loss of Ikaros was associated with progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to acute myeloid leukemia and increasing evidence shows that Ikaros is also critical for the regulation of myeloid development. Previous studies showed that Ikaros-deficient mice have increased megakaryopoiesis, but the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we show that Ikaros overexpression decreases NOTCH-induced megakaryocytic specification, and represses expression of several megakaryocytic genes including GATA-1 to block differentiation and terminal maturation. We also demonstrate that Ikaros expression is differentially regulated by GATA-2 and GATA-1 during megakaryocytic differentiation and reveal that the combined loss of Ikzf1 and Gata1 leads to synthetic lethality in vivo associated with prominent defects in erythroid cells and an expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors. Taken together, our observations demonstrate an important functional interplay between Ikaros, GATA factors, and the NOTCH signaling pathway in specification and homeostasis of the megakaryocyte lineage.

### Congenital anemia reveals distinct targeting mechanisms for master transcription factor GATA1 [^1137YJQe]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Master regulators, such as the hematopoietic transcription factor (TF) GATA1, play an essential role in orchestrating lineage commitment and differentiation. However, the precise mechanisms by which such TFs regulate transcription through interactions with specific cis-regulatory elements remain incompletely understood. Here, we describe a form of congenital hemolytic anemia caused by missense mutations in an intrinsically disordered region of GATA1, with a poorly understood role in transcriptional regulation. Through integrative functional approaches, we demonstrate that these mutations perturb GATA1 transcriptional activity by partially impairing nuclear localization and selectively altering precise chromatin occupancy by GATA1. These alterations in chromatin occupancy and concordant chromatin accessibility changes alter faithful gene expression, with failure to both effectively silence and activate select genes necessary for effective terminal red cell production. We demonstrate how disease-causing mutations can reveal regulatory mechanisms that enable the faithful genomic targeting of master TFs during cellular differentiation.

### Ikaros family zinc finger 1 regulates dendritic cell development and function in humans [^115piQHk]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Finally, IKZF1 and pDC are connected in a number of other conditions. IKZF1 is a susceptibility locus in systemic lupus erythematosus, notable for a type I IFN signature and dysregulated pDC function (reviewed in ref.). In BPDCN, frequently involving deletion or loss of function mutations of IKZF1, increased CD56 expression is a hallmark of the neoplastic pDC phenotype. In the studies described here, increased CD56 expression is seen to arise directly from IKZF1 deficiency.

In summary, our data demonstrate that in addition to its critical role in B-cell differentiation, IKZF1 is required for human pDC development and function. Together with the parallel expansion of cDC1s and reduction of non-classical monocytes, this comprehensively defines the cellular signature of IKZF1 haploinsufficiency. DC dysregulation is highly likely to have pathological consequences for immunity in germline IKZF1 mutation but confer additional therapeutic benefit in lenalidomide treatment of plasma cell dyscrasias. In common with other haematopoietic TFs, germline deficiency reveals multi-level and multi-lineage roles in immune cell development and function with effects in B-cell, T-cell, DC and monocyte lineages.

Extrapolating from these findings, up to 55% of patients may be able to avoid an unnecessary bone marrow aspiration when genetic analysis is performed earlier in the diagnostic pathway. In addition, time to diagnosis is notoriously long for patients with rare disorders and the delay between onset of symptoms and a formal diagnosis has been reported to be 12 years in some cases of CDA‐I (Fujino et al, 2013). A German CDA Registry reported the age of the 21 patients at the time of initial diagnosis of CDA‐I ranged between 0.1 and 45 years (median 17.3 years) and that 11 of 21 cases were previously misdiagnosed as congenital haemolytic anaemia (Heimpel et al, 2006). This underscores the utility of genetic testing to provide an accurate molecular diagnosis.

Introduction

IKAROS family transcription factors have been identified as key players in lymphopoiesis. – Alterations of IKZF1 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were first described in isolated cases in the early 1990s, but it took several years to recognize the important role of IKZF1 in ALL development. The crucial role of IKZF1 in ALL development has also recently been underlined by the finding that certain non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms in IKZF1 predispose to B lineage ALL development in later life. –

The first larger studies on the incidence and role of IKZF1 alterations in ALL were exclusively conducted on pediatric patients and revealed a prevalence of 15–30% of IKZF1 alterations in BCR-ABL -negative ALL, compared with a particularly large fraction in BCR-ABL -positive ALL (more than 60%). IKZF1 -alterated BCR-ABL -negative pediatric ALL patients were reported to have an adverse prognosis,– although this is still a subject of dispute. The negative prognostic effect was even found within BCR-ABL -positive pediatricand adult, patients.

### Mutated IKZF1 is an independent marker of adverse risk in acute myeloid leukemia [^1171vX2L]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

Genetic lesions of IKZF1 are recurrent events in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) conferring poor prognosis. In pediatric Ph-negative B-ALL, deletions of IKZF1 are reported in ~15% of cases while this frequency rises to 30% in high risk pediatric populations. In adult B-ALL, the frequency of IKZF1 deletions reach 30–50%, while the highest prevalence of up to 80% is found in Ph+ ALL. Numerous studies have reported deletions of IKZF1 to be an independent marker of adverse risk in ALL adjusting for age and cytogenetic ALL subtype, resulting in higher risk of relapse and substantially shortened survival.

While its frequency and impact on patient outcome are well established in ALL, the clinical significance of IKZF1 alterations is less clear in AML. Previous studies have reported the frequency of altered IKZF1 in AML to range between 1.2% in a pediatric cohort of 258 patients and 2.6% to 4.8% in three adult cohorts including 193, 475, and 522 patients, respectively. Given the overlapping functions of IKZF1 in the regulation of both lymphatic and myeloid differentiation, an investigation into the clinical implications of altered IKZF1 in AML in a large scale study seems warranted.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^111XJ1t4]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Since the discovery of CDAN1 as a causative gene for CDA‐I in 2002, the genes for the three main types of CDA have been identified. Approximately 90% of CDA‐I cases are caused by bi‐allelic mutations in CDAN1 or C15orf41 (Dgany et al, 2002; Babbs et al, 2013), CDA‐II is caused by biallelic mutations in SEC23B (Schwarz et al, 2009) and CDA‐III is a dominant disorder caused by the P916R mutation of KIF23 (Liljeholm et al, 2013). Identification of the causative genes has shed light on the pathogenesis of these disorders, opened new avenues for research, allowed accurate molecular diagnosis and carrier testing of family members and impacted disease management. Variants of CDA have also been described, for example the dominantly inherited E325K mutation of KLF1 causing an anaemia termed CDA‐IV and X‐linked forms caused by GATA1 mutations (Nichols et al, 2000; Singleton et al, 2009; Arnaud et al, 2010). Further CDA subtypes have been suggested, however, the extent to which these are distinct entities will become clearer as our understanding of their molecular pathogenesis improves.

The abnormal cellular morphology and phenotypic abnormalities in CDA‐I are reviewed elsewhere (Wickramasinghe, 1997, 1998; Shalev et al, 2002; Heimpel, 2004; Tamary et al, 2005; Wickramasinghe & Wood, 2005; Heimpel et al, 2006, 2010; Iolascon & Delaunay, 2009; Renella & Wood, 2009; Iolascon et al, 2011, 2012, 2013; Gambale et al, 2016). Therefore, this review will focus on recent advances in the understanding of the diagnosis, management and pathogenesis of CDA‐I.

As with many rare disorders, establishing an accurate estimate of incidence and prevalence of CDA‐I is difficult. Over 300 cases have been reported (Iolascon et al, 2013). Most are sporadic cases from diverse regions such as Western Europe, North Africa and Asia, (Iolascon & Delaunay, 2009) while some series are accounted for by a founder effect, particularly in the Middle East (Tamary et al, 2005). The lack of reported cases from Sub‐Saharan Africa or South America may reflect ascertainment bias (Heimpel et al, 2010).

Pathogenesis

Rare diseases (defined as those affecting < 1:2000 of the population) have been estimated to number between 6000–8000, collectively affecting some 30 million European Union citizens. However, the study of rare diseases has an impact reaching far beyond affected individuals alone: for example, research into the molecular basis behind Fanconi anaemia, a congenital bone marrow failure syndrome affecting ~1000 individuals worldwide, has provided critical insights into the link between genomic instability and malignancy, has significantly advanced our understanding of DNA repair mechanisms (Schindler & Hoehn, 2007) and has led directly to the development of therapeutic agents for patients with BRCA1 / 2 mutations (Fong et al, 2009).

CDA‐I is an example of a rare disease which has the potential to inform about general cellular processes. Codanin‐1 (CDAN1) and C15orf41 expression levels are extremely low in all cell types, yet are widely expressed, and loss of either protein is incompatible with life. Both proteins are likely to play a critical role in DNA repair and/or chromatin assembly following DNA replication and understanding their function will elucidate universal cellular processes. A number of fundamental questions remain unanswered about the biology and pathology of CDA‐I (Fig 5). The main hurdle to advancing our understanding of the function of CDA‐I proteins is the lack of molecular reagents, including antibodies, appropriate cell lines and access to primary material, although attempts have been made to address this by generating erythroid cell lines with engineered tags at the endogenous loci (Moir‐Meyer et al, 2018).

Erythroblast abnormalities

Characterisation of the cellular abnormalities in CDA‐I erythroblasts could shed light on the function of the two genes involved. Analysis of cell cycle distribution in cultured erythroblasts showed an increase in cells in S‐phase in CDA‐I, which are, paradoxically, not actively synthesising DNA when tested, suggesting an S‐phase arrest in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe & Pippard, 1986). This points to a problem with DNA replication, but needs to be refined using a larger number of patients. Unrepaired DNA lesions act as physical barriers to replication fork progression and nicks, gaps and stretches of ssDNA can be both sources and symptoms of stress (Zeman & Cimprich, 2014). Because C15orf41 is predicted to be an endonuclease it may be that there are more unrepaired lesions in CDA‐I patients and therefore more stalled replication forks, underlying the proposed S‐phase arrest. Alternatively, replication intermediaries that are usually cleared by C15orf41 may underlie some of the nuclear abnormalities seen in CDA‐I erythroblasts. Given that these events are stochastic and would also be likely to be affected by genetic background, this may go some way to explaining the variability between patients. It would be very informative to distinguish these possibilities (blocked replication vs. unresolved replication intermediates).

Elucidating the nature of the electron‐lucent areas in the heterochromatin seen by SEM (Fig 3) would shed light on the underlying pathology of CDA‐I, especially as resolving this abnormality is associated with improved Hb levels in patients treated with IFNa (Lavabre‐Bertrand et al, 1995, 2004). The differentiating stain used in SEM is osmium tetroxide, however, why this differentially binds the heterochromatin in affected nuclei is unclear. It may be that the "holes" contain protein, lipids or improperly packaged heterochromatin affecting its transcriptional status.

Do the mutations in either CDAN1 or C15orf41 represent different entities? It has been suggested that CDA‐I arising from mutations of C15orf41 may be more severe (Gambale et al, 2016). In our clinical and laboratory experience, at the time of writing there are insufficient data to draw this distinction with certainty. Given that CDA‐I with specific chromatin abnormalities arises from mutation of either gene, we propose that this disease simply be termed CDA‐I until new insights on genotype/phenotype correlations are obtained.

### Mutated IKZF1 is an independent marker of adverse risk in acute myeloid leukemia [^111FCAkj]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

With regard to clinical phenotypes, we found patients with IKZF1 -mutated AML to show a significantly lower Hb and platelet count upon initial diagnosis, possibly corresponding to the suggested dysregulation of erythro- and megakaryopoiesis. In our cohort, patients with IKZF1 -mutated AML were more frequently categorized within the ELN2022 adverse risk group. While deletions of IKZF1 are a well-established marker of adverse outcomes in ALL portraying substantially higher relapse rates and shortened survival, evidence on the impact of IKZF1 alterations in AML is sparse. In pediatric AML, de Rooij et al. found no differences between focal deletions of IKZF1 or monosomy 7 compared to non-affected patients. In the studies by Zhang et al. the adverse effect of IKZF1 was limited to high VAF and only demonstrated for overall survival. In a comprehensive study of multiple genetic lesions, Milosevic et al. did not find any significant effects of del(7p) or deletions of IKZF1 on overall survival in 203 AML cases.

### The many faces of IKZF1 in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^114BA2Cc]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Transcription factor IKZF1 (IKAROS) acts as a critical regulator of lymphoid differentiation and is frequently deleted or mutated in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. IKZF1 gene defects are associated with inferior treatment outcome in both childhood and adult B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and occur in more than 70% of BCR-ABL1 -positive and BCR-ABL1 -like cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Over the past few years, much has been learned about the tumor suppressive function of IKZF1 during leukemia development and the molecular pathways that relate to its impact on treatment outcome. In this review, we provide a concise overview on the role of IKZF1 during normal lymphopoiesis and the pathways that contribute to leukemia pathogenesis as a consequence of altered IKZF1 function. Furthermore, we discuss different mechanisms by which IKZF1 alterations impose therapy resistance on leukemic cells, including enhanced cell adhesion and modulation of glucocorticoid response.

Although several mechanisms underlying normal and pathological red cell production in the bone marrow have been identified in recent years, little is known about disease-related markers and targets through which prognostication and therapy may be improved in anemic or polycythemic patients. In order to discuss novel markers, targets and mechanisms as well as new therapeutic approaches and strategies in various erythroid disorders, a workshop was organized in Vienna in April 2017 (April 28–29). The discussion in this meeting focused on pathological (neoplastic) erythropoiesis in adults. The outcomes of this workshop are summarized in this review.

### Genetic disarray follows mutant KLF1-E325K expression in a congenital dyserythropoietic anemia patient [^113Y3jgR]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Two sets of observations in the mouse are particularly informative for the present study. One is from studies of the monoallelic mouse neonatal anemia (Nan) mutation that resides at the same amino acid of KLF1, albeit with an aspartate substitution (E339D). These mice exhibit a lifelong anemia due to a distorted erythroid transcriptional output. The E339D mutation not only yields a variant with a more circumscribed binding specificity compared to wild type (WT), but also one that recognizes a novel, more degenerate target sequence uniquely recognized by Nan-KLF1. The second observation is that, unlike the Nan mutant, mouse erythroid cells totally ablated in KLF1 do not enucleate, but instead stall at the orthochromatic erythroblast stage. Many of these cells are also bi-nucleated. As a result, mutant expression or insufficient levels of KLF1 can separately contribute to defective erythroid expression and phenotypic properties.

Although the CDA type IV red cell cellular and phenotypic properties have been described, the molecular mechanism/details by which the KLF1-E325K mutation exerts its effect and causes these significant changes has not been previously addressed. A limitation of studying this disease has been the paucity of starting material due to its rarity. As a result, we directed our efforts towards analysis of derived erythroid cells from the peripheral blood of our published patient.

### The genomics of inherited bone marrow failure: from mechanism to the clinic [^114h4GK2]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

The inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) typically present with significant cytopenias in at least one haematopoietic cell lineage that may progress to pancytopenia, and are associated with increased risk of cancer. Although the clinical features of the IBMFS are often diagnostic, variable disease penetrance and expressivity may result in diagnostic dilemmas. The discovery of the genetic aetiology of the IBMFS has been greatly facilitated by next-generation sequencing methods. This has advanced understanding of the underlying biology of the IBMFS and been essential in improving clinical management and genetic counselling for affected patients. Herein we review the clinical features, underlying biology, and new genomic discoveries in the IBMFS, including Fanconi anaemia, dyskeratosis congenita, Diamond Blackfan anaemia, Shwachman Diamond syndrome and some disorders of the myeloid and megakaryocytic lineages.

### Genetic disarray follows mutant KLF1-E325K expression in a congenital dyserythropoietic anemia patient [^114xE9N4]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type IV is caused by a heterozygous mutation, Glu325Lys (E325K), in the KLF1 transcription factor. Molecular characteristics of this disease have not been clarified, partly due to its rarity. We expanded erythroid cells from a patient's peripheral blood and analyzed its global expression pattern. We find that a large number of erythroid pathways are disrupted, particularly those related to membrane transport, globin regulation, and iron utilization. The altered genetics lead to significant deficits in differentiation. Glu325 is within the KLF1 zinc finger domain at an amino acid critical for site specific DNA binding. The change to Lys is predicted to significantly alter the target site recognition sequence, both by subverting normal recognition and by enabling interaction with novel sites. Consistent with this, we find high level ectopic expression of genes not normally present in the red cell. These altered properties explain patients' clinical and phenotypic features, and elucidate the dominant character of the mutation.

### Widespread failure of hematolymphoid differentiation caused by a recessive niche-filling allele of the ikaros transcription factor [^1156ZhSj]. Immunity (2003). Low credibility.

A central issue in understanding the hematolymphoid system is the generation of appropriate mutant alleles in mice to reveal the function of regulatory genes. Here we describe a mouse strain, Plastic, with a point mutation in a zinc finger of Ikaros that disrupts DNA binding but preserves efficient assembly of the full-length protein into higher order complexes. Ikaros(Plastic) homozygosity is embryonically lethal with severe defects in terminal erythrocyte and granulocyte differentiation, excessive macrophage formation, and blocked lymphopoiesis, while heterozygotes display a partial block in lymphocyte differentiation. The contrast with more circumscribed effects of Ikaros alleles that ablate the full-length protein highlights the importance in mammals of generating recessive niche-filling alleles that inactivate function without creating a void in multimolecular assemblies.

### Inborn errors of human IKAROS: LOF and GOF variants associated with primary immunodeficiency [^111SGcGr]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

IKAROS/IKZF1 plays a pivotal role in lymphocyte differentiation and development. Germline mutations in IKZF1, which have been shown to be associated with primary immunodeficiency, can be classified through four different mechanisms of action depending on the protein expression and its functional defects: haploinsufficiency, dimerization defective, dominant negative, and gain of function. These different mechanisms are associated with variable degrees of susceptibility to infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, allergic diseases, and malignancies. To date, more than 30 heterozygous IKZF1 germline variants have been reported in patients with primary immunodeficiency. Here we review recent discoveries and clinical/immunological characterization of IKAROS-associated diseases that are linked to different mechanisms of action in IKAROS function.

The first study on IDH mutations in AML included 188 patients with primary AML and reported IDH1 but not IDH2 mutations in 16 (∼9%) cases: R132C in 8, R132H in 7 and R132S in 1. In a subsequent AML study of 493 adult Chinese patients,27 (∼6%) expressed IDH1 mutations (37% R132C, 26% R132H, 19% R132S, 15% R132G and 4% R132L). In both studies, IDH1 mutations clustered with normal karyotype, NPM1 mutations and trisomy 8. More recently, IDH2 exon 4 mutations, affecting R172 or R140, were also shown to occur in primary AML. In one of these studies, 18 (23%) of 78 patients displayed either IDH1 (n = 6; ∼8%) or IDH2 (n = 12; ∼15% 7 R140Q and 5 R172K) mutations. AML patients with IDH2 mutations were also less likely to carry FLT3, NPM1 or ASXL1 mutations, whereas the above-mentioned study from Chinareported the coexistence of IDH1 mutations and RUNX1, PTPN11, NRAS, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD or MLL-PTD mutations. In general, survival in primary AML did not seem to be affected by the presence of IDH mutations.

### A novel IKAROS haploinsufficiency kindred with unexpectedly late and variable B-cell maturation defects [^115xi4r5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Whole-exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous frameshift mutation in IKZF1 (NM_006060: c.136delA, p.S46Afs*14) in the 2 affected siblings (patients II:3 and II:4) and asymptomatic mother (subject I:2; Fig 1, A). The mutation is not reported in public or in-house databases. The frameshift introduces a premature stop codon before the first zinc finger motif in all IKZF1 transcripts (Fig 1. B). Although nonsense-mediated mRNA decay was predicted in silico, mutant transcripts were detected at cDNA level (see Fig E2 in this article's Online Repository at), and patients had normal levels of IKZF1 cDNA (Fig 1, C), suggesting mutant transcripts escape nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Nonetheless, IKAROS protein expression levels were, on average, 40% lower in all 3 mutant subjects compared with the wild-type family members and healthy control subjects (Fig 1, D). The latter suggests that the mutant transcript encodes an unstable truncated protein that is rapidly degraded. Alternatively, the truncated protein might not be recognized by the antibody; however, epitope details are lacking. Either way, our findings indicate a molecular diagnosis of IKAROS haploin-sufficiency in patients II:3 and II:4 and their asymptomatic mother (subject I:2). Because the mutation was also present in the clinically asymptomatic 43-year-old subject I:2, we performed indepth immunologic testing, which revealed mildly reduced serum IgM levels, as well as marginally inadequate antibody responses to a polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (see Table E1).

### Germline IKAROS dimerization haploinsufficiency causes hematologic cytopenias and malignancies [^114DKCdT]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

IKAROS is a transcription factor forming homo- and heterodimers and regulating lymphocyte development and function. Germline mutations affecting the IKAROS N-terminal DNA binding domain, acting in a haploinsufficient or dominant-negative manner, cause immunodeficiency. Herein, we describe 4 germline heterozygous IKAROS variants affecting its C-terminal dimerization domain, via haploinsufficiency, in 4 unrelated families. Index patients presented with hematologic disease consisting of cytopenias (thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia)/Evans syndrome and malignancies (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Burkitt lymphoma). These dimerization defective mutants disrupt homo- and heterodimerization in a complete or partial manner, but they do not affect the wild-type allele function. Moreover, they alter key mechanisms of IKAROS gene regulation, including sumoylation, protein stability, and the recruitment of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex; none affected in N-terminal DNA binding defects. These C-terminal dimerization mutations are largely associated with hematologic disorders, display dimerization haploinsufficiency and incomplete clinical penetrance, and differ from previously reported allelic variants in their mechanism of action. Dimerization mutants contribute to the growing spectrum of IKAROS-associated diseases displaying a genotype-phenotype correlation.

### IKAROS family zinc finger 1-associated diseases in primary immunodeficiency patients [^114A77MJ]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Ikaros zinc finger 1 (IKZF1 or Ikaros) is a hematopoietic zinc finger DNA-binding transcription factor that acts as a critical regulator of lymphocyte and myeloid differentiation. Loss-of-function germline heterozygous mutations in IKZF1 affecting DNA-binding were described as causative of 2 distinct primary immunodeficiency (PID)/inborn error of immunity diseases. Mutations acting by haploinsufficiency present with a common variable immune deficiency-like phenotype mainly characterized by increased susceptibility to infections. Mutations acting in a dominant negative fashion present with a combined immunodeficiency phenotype with high prevalence of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Pathophysiology and manifestations of IKAROS-associated diseases in patients with PID are reviewed here.

### Germline genetic IKZF1 variation and predisposition to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^114aYDWh]. Cancer Cell (2018). Low credibility.

Somatic genetic alterations of IKZF1, which encodes the lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS, are common in high-risk B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are associated with poor prognosis. Such alterations result in the acquisition of stem cell-like features, overexpression of adhesion molecules causing aberrant cell-cell and cell-stroma interaction, and decreased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Here we report coding germline IKZF1 variation in familial childhood ALL and 0.9% of presumed sporadic B-ALL, identifying 28 unique variants in 45 children. The majority of variants adversely affected IKZF1 function and drug responsiveness of leukemic cells. These results identify IKZF1 as a leukemia predisposition gene, and emphasize the importance of germline genetic variation in the development of both familial and sporadic ALL.

### IKZF1 deletions in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia: still a poor prognostic marker? [^117DM7Lt]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Improved personalized adjustment of primary therapy to the perceived risk of relapse by using new prognostic markers for treatment stratification may be beneficial to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here, we review the advances that have shed light on the role of IKZF1 aberration as prognostic factor in pediatric ALL and summarize emerging concepts in this field. Continued research on the interplay of disease biology with exposure and response to treatment will be key to further improve treatment strategies.
