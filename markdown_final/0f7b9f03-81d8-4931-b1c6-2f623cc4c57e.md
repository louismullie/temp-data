## Question

Does albumin increase blood pressure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether albumin increases blood pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the acute hemodynamic effects of intravenous albumin. Then, I should consider how endogenous serum albumin levels relate to population blood pressure. Next, I need to check for confounding and disease-specific physiology that can modify or obscure any relationship. After that, I should distinguish serum albumin from urinary albumin as a vascular-renal risk marker. Finally, I will align the synthesis with guideline-backed clinical scenarios and provide a cautious, clinically useful conclusion, anchoring this in randomized data, guidelines, and observational cohorts.

> Let me first confirm the acute hemodynamic logic. Albumin, by increasing colloid oncotic pressure, should recruit interstitial fluid into the intravascular space, increase preload, and potentially raise mean arterial pressure via Frank-Starling mechanisms. In a randomized post–cardiac/vascular surgery study, colloids including 5% albumin produced greater plasma volume expansion and a larger rise in cardiac index than saline over 90 minutes; that pattern would be expected to support a BP increase, although, wait, let me verify — arterial pressure itself was not the primary reported endpoint, so I should not over-interpret surrogates as guaranteed MAP elevation. In dialysis and ultrafiltration settings, albumin is used to mitigate intradialytic hypotension by promoting plasma refilling, yet clinical trials show realized volume expansion is often less than predicted by simple oncotic theory, which tempers expectations for a reliable BP rise [^1113Rgcd] [^1144aKTP] [^115VYHyv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. The clinical context matters: in vasodilated states or critical illness, fluid boluses (including albumin) may not translate into sustained BP improvement and can even be harmful. Re-analyses of the FEAST trial in severely ill children linked bolus therapy, including albumin, to adverse cardiorespiratory trajectories and higher mortality, reminding me that "more intravascular volume" does not universally equal "better BP control" or outcomes. Mechanistically, both saline and 5% albumin boluses can reduce the strong ion difference and contribute to hyperchloremic acidosis, worsening respiratory and neurological function, which can offset hemodynamic gains; in kidney replacement therapy populations, there is additional concern — albeit with weak evidence — about hyperoncotic albumin and AKI in sepsis, so I need to be cautious in extrapolating any BP benefit across settings [^112wGYWq] [^1163uVB2] [^1144aKTP].

> Next, I should review population-level associations. Let me consider whether higher endogenous serum albumin correlates with higher BP. A large cross-sectional cohort demonstrated a consistent positive association across ages and sexes, with albumin within physiological ranges tracking modestly higher systolic and diastolic pressures. But wait, I should confirm the limitations — cross-sectional design cannot establish causality, and albumin is a negative acute-phase reactant that falls with inflammation and illness; thus, higher serum albumin may simply be a proxy for better health status rather than a direct pressor, so causal inference here would be unreliable [^112SxV33] [^111nSY5Z].

> I will now examine disease-specific contexts where the albumin–BP relationship is easily misread. In CKD and maintenance hemodialysis, hypoalbuminemia tracks with intradialytic hypotension and mortality, and dynamic studies show that declines in serum albumin and systolic BP commonly precede death, supporting the idea that low albumin reflects systemic catabolism, inflammation, and hemodynamic instability rather than directly causing hypotension. Let me double-check temporality — multi-region dialysis cohorts document albumin and SBP drifting down together months before death, which reinforces the confounded, non-causal nature of this association [^1144aKTP] [^1131gNW6].

> Let me consider cirrhosis, where physiology is dominated by splanchnic vasodilation and reduced effective arterial volume. Guidelines recommend IV albumin to prevent circulatory dysfunction after large-volume paracentesis, to reduce AKI and mortality in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and as an adjunct with vasoconstrictors for hepatorenal syndrome; these uses expand effective arterial volume and can support BP in that specific context. I should confirm dosing and cautions: EASL and BASL/BSG endorse 8 g/L after paracentesis and weight-based dosing in SBP, while the AGA advises against albumin for uncomplicated ascites, and ICTMG advises against repeated albumin solely to push serum albumin above 30 g/L in decompensated cirrhosis, underscoring that the goal is targeted volume expansion and complication prevention, not generic BP augmentation [^113cgVjx] [^1136RXKN] [^113zw6Nc] [^116eVdrM] [^112mZwUA] [^111NKKKY].

> Hold on, I should distinguish serum albumin from urinary albumin. Albuminuria reflects glomerular and systemic endothelial injury and consistently predicts incident hypertension and BP progression even when UACR is below 30 mg/g; that represents vascular risk signaling rather than albumin itself raising BP. I need to ensure proper measurement — KDIGO recommends confirming positive screens with quantitative ACR, preferably using a first-morning sample, to avoid misclassification that could blur risk interpretation [^116thpkP] [^113CYbc6] [^1152B1sY] [^1175ZuJn].

> Before I synthesize, let me reconsider a potential pitfall. Earlier I implied that greater plasma volume and cardiac index with albumin must raise BP; however, in vasodilatory states with low systemic vascular resistance, MAP may remain unchanged unless vascular tone is restored. Consistent with this, some critical care guidance recommends avoiding albumin for volume replacement or to raise serum levels in ARDS and certain neonatal scenarios, emphasizing how context-dependent any BP effect of albumin truly is [^113u35pK] [^111uWbBQ] [^114XnUnA].

> Putting this together, I should conclude carefully. There is no robust evidence that albumin itself directly increases blood pressure in a causal, generalizable way; rather, any acute BP rise from IV albumin occurs via intravascular volume expansion and is often modest, transient, and highly context dependent, with potential harm in some settings. Higher serum albumin correlates with slightly higher BP in population studies, but this likely reflects confounding by health status and inflammation, not a direct pressor effect. Low serum albumin usually signals illness severity and hemodynamic instability, while elevated urinary albumin marks vascular-kidney injury that predicts future hypertension. Clinically, albumin is not a reliable antihypotensive drug except in guideline-supported scenarios such as large-volume paracentesis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome, where it is used to restore effective arterial volume rather than as a direct BP-raising agent [^1113Rgcd] [^1144aKTP] [^112SxV33] [^116thpkP] [^112wGYWq] [^113cgVjx] [^1136RXKN].

---

Yes, albumin can acutely raise blood pressure [^1113Rgcd] when administered intravenously by expanding plasma volume and increasing cardiac output, but the effect is typically modest and short-lived [^1144aKTP] [^115VYHyv]. In chronic settings, higher serum albumin is associated with higher blood pressure, likely reflecting shared risk factors rather than a direct causal effect [^112SxV33]. Albumin is not recommended for routine blood pressure management and should be used cautiously in patients at risk of fluid overload or hypertension [^115VYHyv].

---

## Physiological mechanisms linking albumin and blood pressure

Albumin is the primary contributor to plasma oncotic pressure, which retains fluid intravascularly and maintains effective circulating volume [^115VYHyv]. Intravenous albumin raises oncotic pressure, draws interstitial fluid into the vasculature, expands plasma volume, and increases preload and cardiac output [^1113Rgcd] — changes that can acutely raise blood pressure [^1144aKTP].

---

## Clinical evidence of albumin's effect on blood pressure

### Acute effects of intravenous albumin administration

Clinical studies show that intravenous albumin can acutely increase blood pressure, particularly in hypovolemia or hypotension [^115VYHyv]. After cardiac or major vascular surgery, colloid loading (including albumin) increased plasma volume, preload, and cardiac output more than saline, with a modest rise in blood pressure [^1113Rgcd]. In dialysis, albumin is sometimes used to prevent intradialytic hypotension by promoting plasma refilling [^115VYHyv], but its effectiveness remains limited and controversial [^1144aKTP].

---

### Chronic association between serum albumin and blood pressure

Observational data suggest a positive association between serum albumin and blood pressure within the physiological range. In the Oslo Health Study, each standard deviation increase in serum albumin corresponded to a 1–3 mmHg rise in systolic and diastolic pressure [^112SxV33]. However, this likely reflects shared risk factors (e.g. obesity, metabolic syndrome) rather than a direct causal relationship.

---

## Clinical scenarios where albumin administration affects blood pressure

Albumin is used in specific clinical scenarios in which its volume-expanding properties can influence blood pressure:

- **Large-volume paracentesis**: Albumin is recommended after removal of > 5 L ascites to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction and hypotension [^113zw6Nc] [^113cgVjx].

- **Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)**: Albumin is used with vasoconstrictors [^112ibAZK] to improve effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion, potentially increasing blood pressure [^112YsWPL].

- **Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)**: Albumin is recommended to reduce renal impairment and mortality, partly by stabilizing hemodynamics [^1136RXKN] [^113hz4jE].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

While albumin can acutely raise blood pressure, it carries risks, particularly in patients prone to fluid overload or hypertension:

- **Fluid overload and pulmonary edema**: Albumin can cause or worsen fluid overload, particularly in heart failure or renal impairment [^115VYHyv].

- **Hypertension**: Albumin can acutely increase blood pressure, potentially exacerbating hypertension or causing hypertensive complications [^1113Rgcd].

- **Cost and resource utilization**: Albumin is expensive and resource-intensive, limiting routine use [^115VYHyv] [^1144aKTP].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend albumin for specific indications (e.g. large-volume paracentesis, HRS, SBP) but do not support routine use for blood pressure management [^113zw6Nc] [^112ibAZK] [^115VYHyv]. Albumin should be used cautiously in patients at risk of fluid overload or hypertension, with close monitoring of hemodynamics and fluid status [^112mZwUA].

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical scenario** | **Effect on blood pressure** | **Clinical recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Intravenous albumin administration | Acute increase in blood pressure due to plasma volume expansion [^1113Rgcd] | Recommended in specific scenarios (e.g. large-volume paracentesis, HRS, SBP) [^1136RXKN] |
| Chronic serum albumin levels | Positive association with blood pressure, likely due to shared risk factors [^112SxV33] | No recommendation for routine albumin administration to manage blood pressure [^115VYHyv] |
| Hypoalbuminemia | Associated with lower blood pressure and poor outcomes [^113psvTu] | Albumin administration may be considered in specific clinical contexts [^112ibAZK] |

---

Albumin can acutely raise blood pressure via plasma volume expansion [^1113Rgcd], but the effect is modest and transient [^1144aKTP]. Chronic associations between albumin and blood pressure likely reflect shared risk factors rather than causality [^112SxV33]. Albumin should not be used routinely for blood pressure management and should be used cautiously in patients at risk of fluid overload or hypertension [^115VYHyv].

### Intravenous albumin for mitigating hypotension and augmenting ultrafiltration during kidney replacement therapy [^1144aKTP]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Among its many functions, owing to its oversized effect on colloid oncotic pressure, intravascular albumin helps preserve the effective circulatory volume. Hypoalbuminemia is common in hospitalized patients and is found especially frequently in patients who require kidney replacement therapy (KRT) either for acute kidney injury (AKI) or as maintenance hemodialysis. In such patients, hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with morbidity, intradialytic hypotension, and mortality.

Intravenous albumin may be administered in an effort to prevent or treat hypotension or to augment fluid removal, but this practice is controversial. Theoretically, intravenous albumin administration might prevent or treat hypotension by promoting plasma refilling in response to ultrafiltration. However, clinical trials have demonstrated that albumin administration is not nearly as effective a volume expander as might be assumed according to its oncotic properties. Although intravenous albumin is generally considered to be safe, it is also very expensive. In addition, there are potential risks to using it to prevent or treat intradialytic hypotension.

Some recent studies have suggested that hyperoncotic albumin solutions may precipitate or worsen AKI in patients with sepsis or shock; however, the overall evidence supporting this effect is weak. In this review, we explore the theoretical benefits and risks of using intravenous albumin to mitigate intradialytic hypotension and/or enhance ultrafiltration and summarize the evidence relating to this practice. This includes studies relevant to its use in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.

### Cardiac response is greater for colloid than saline fluid loading after cardiac or vascular surgery [^1113Rgcd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects on volume expansion and myocardial function of colloids or crystalloids in treating hypovolemic hypotension after cardiac and major vascular surgery.

- **Design and setting**: This was a single-center, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial conducted at the intensive care unit of a university hospital.

- **Patients and methods**: A total of 67 patients were subjected to a 90-minute filling pressure-guided fluid challenge with either saline 0.9% or the colloids gelatin 4%, hydroxyethyl starch 6%, or albumin 5%. Biochemical variables and hemodynamics, measured through transpulmonary thermodilution, were assessed.

- **Results**: An amount of 1800 (1300–1800) mL of saline or 1600 (750–1800) mL of colloid solution (P < 0.005) was infused. The colloid osmotic pressure (COP) decreased in the saline group and increased in the colloid groups (P < 0.001). Plasma volume increased by 3.0% (-18 to 24) in the saline group versus 19% (-11 to 50) in the colloid groups (P < 0.001). The cardiac index increased by a median of 13% (not significant) in the saline group and by 22% in the colloid groups (P < 0.005). The rise in left ventricular stroke work index was greater in the colloid than in the saline groups. The different colloids were equally effective. The rise in cardiac index was related to the rise in plasma volume and global end-diastolic volume, confirming plasma volume and preload augmentation by the fluid loading.

- **Conclusion**: After cardiac or major vascular surgery, the pressure- and time-guided fluid response is dependent on the type of fluid used. Colloid fluid loading leads to a greater increase in preload-recruitable cardiac and left ventricular stroke work index compared to saline.

### Serum albumin and blood pressure: a population-based, cross-sectional study [^112SxV33]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Information about the association between serum albumin and blood pressure is limited. The purpose of the present paper was to investigate this relationship in different age groups in males and females.

- **Methods**: In the cross-sectional Norwegian Oslo Health Study, the concentration of serum albumin and blood pressure was determined in 5,071 men and women aged 30–75 years. The albumin-blood pressure relationship was studied using multiple regression.

- **Results**: In general, men had higher albumin values than women, and young subjects had higher albumin values than older ones. Within all age groups and in both sexes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased with increasing albumin concentration within the physiological range. An increase in the albumin concentration over the physiological range, from approximately 40 to 50 g/l, was associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure between 5 and 11 mmHg in males, depending on age, and between 6 and 17 mmHg in females. Corresponding increases in diastolic blood pressure were between 3 and 7 mmHg in males, and 4 to 9 mmHg in females. Per one standard deviation increment in albumin concentration, the blood pressure increase was 1–3 mmHg.

- **Conclusion**: Within the different age groups, irrespective of sex and age, a positive association was found between serum albumin and blood pressure. Since albumin, in contrast to high blood pressure, is considered to be cardioprotective, the two variables probably affect cardiovascular risk by unrelated mechanisms.

### The effects of dietary patterns on urinary albumin excretion: Results of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Trial [^114Kcxrh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Dietary studies designed to decrease the urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) typically reduce protein by increasing lower protein plant foods and decreasing higher protein animal products. We evaluated AER while increasing protein intake in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Trial, a randomized, parallel group, 8-week controlled feeding study.

- **Setting & participants**: 378 individuals without diabetes, with prehypertension or stage I hypertension.

- **Intervention**: The DASH diet includes 18% energy from protein and emphasizes, among other features, low-fat dairy products. The fruit/vegetable (FV) and control diets each contain 15% energy from protein.

- **Outcome**: AER.

- **Measurements**: AER was measured using immunoassay and covariates at baseline and after 8 weeks.

- **Results**: Baseline AER had a geometric mean value of 4.0 ± 0.2 (SE) mg/24 h. In 285 participants with baseline AER less than 7 mg/24 h, AER was unchanged by diet treatment (geometric mean: 2.5 ± 0.2 mg/24 h in the control diet, 3.0 ± 0.2 mg/24 h in the FV diet, and 2.8 ± 0.2 mg/24 h in the DASH diet). Conversely, in 93 participants with baseline AER of 7 mg/24 h or greater, end-of-feeding AER was lower in the FV diet (6.6 ± 1.0 mg/24 h) than in the control (11.4 ± 1.8 mg/24 h; P = 0.01) or DASH diets (11.7 ± 1.6 mg/24 h; P = 0.005). The DASH and control diets were not different (P = 0.9).

- **Limitations**: Long-term AER change was not studied.

Conclusions drawn indicate that the decrease in AER after 8 weeks occurred only in those with high-normal baseline AER in the FV diet, displaying a distinct pattern.

### Association between urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio within normal range and hypertension among adults in the United States: Data from the NHANES 2009–2018 [^116USfFg]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

The main outcome variable, blood pressure (BP), was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer by trained personnel following standardized protocols. After a 5-minute quiet rest in the seated position, three BP readings were taken consecutively, and the participant's maximum inflation level was determined. If the blood pressure measurement was interrupted or incomplete, a fourth measurement could be taken.

All systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements were taken at the Mobile Examination Center. In the present study, we calculated the average of systolic and diastolic BP readings for further analyses. If participants had only one BP reading, it was considered the final record. Hypertension was defined as a mean SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, a mean DBP ≥ 80 mmHg, or if participants were taking hypertension medication, or had been informed of a hypertension diagnosis by a physician or health professional.

- **Background**: The urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) is an important biomarker in assessing kidney function and risk factors related to cardiovascular health. Recent research conducted by Byrne, supported by the Southampton National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, highlights the significance of a UACR below 30 mg/g as a predictor of both hypertension and cardiovascular mortality.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^115teLsQ]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for portal hypertension, specifically concerning the management of hepatorenal syndrome through therapeutic paracentesis, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend administering albumin with therapeutic paracentesis. This is advised even when a low volume of ascitic fluid is removed in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and tense ascites.

### Use of intravenous albumin: A guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^112mZwUA]. Chest (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of liver cirrhosis, particularly with respect to the management of ascites, the ICTMG 2024 guidelines recommend avoiding the administration of repeated intravenous albumin to increase albumin levels above 30 g/L. This approach aims to reduce the risk of infection, kidney dysfunction, and death in hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis who present with hypoalbuminemia (albumin levels below 30 g/L).

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^1136RXKN]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of portal hypertension, and more specifically in relation to the management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend administering intravenous albumin. The suggested dosage is 1.5 g/kg at diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3 in patients diagnosed with SBP.

### Albumin-to-creatinine ratio predicts change in ambulatory blood pressure in normotensive persons: a 7.5-year prospective study [^1152B1sY]. American Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

The relationship between urinary albumin excretion and blood pressure (BP) has been found to be positive in hypertensive and normotensive subjects. However, it is not known, in a normotensive and nondiabetic sample, whether elevated urinary albumin levels predict future increases in BP.

- **Methods**: In this prospective study, we followed a cohort of 108 individuals who were initially free of hypertension and diabetes for an average of 7.7 years. Urinary albumin excretion was determined at baseline by radioimmunoassay in a 24-hour collection. Ambulatory BP monitoring was used to assess BP at baseline and at the 7.5-year follow-up. Regression models were employed to evaluate the relationship of baseline urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio to both baseline BP and the average rate of change in BP, before and after controlling for several potential confounding variables.

- **Results**: Baseline albumin-to-creatinine ratio was not associated with baseline ambulatory BP, but it was positively associated with change in ambulatory BP. Before and after controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, age, body mass index at baseline, and change in body mass index, the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was found to be a significant independent predictor of change in awake and sleep systolic and diastolic BPs (all P < .05). It also independently predicted hypertension status at follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: In healthy normotensive individuals, the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio predicts changes in ambulatory BPs 7.5 years later. This finding suggests that urinary albumin excretion may be an important marker for processes that impact BP.

### Effects of saline or albumin fluid bolus in resuscitation: Evidence from re-analysis of the FEAST trial [^113JLtDt]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In light of the unresolved questions raised by FEAST, we believed that there was both a need and an obligation to fully use all the available data from the FEAST trial to understand why fluid bolus was associated with increased mortality. We postulated that the increased mortality in bolus recipients resulted from a measurable adverse effect of bolus fluids on cardiovascular function, respiratory function, raised intracranial pressure or neurological function, oxygen carrying capacity, or the biochemical and acid-base status of bolus recipients. To test this hypothesis, we developed composite scores to measure respiratory function, cardiovascular function, and identify raised intracranial pressure, using sequential vital sign data from FEAST, and compared the function of each system, as well as plasma biochemistry and acid-base balance, in the bolus and no bolus groups of FEAST.

### Low-grade albuminuria and the risks of hypertension and blood pressure progression [^113CYbc6]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

It has been postulated that glomerular hyperfiltration and endothelial dysfunction are early features of essential hypertension that may antedate blood pressure elevation. Microalbuminuria, a marker of glomerular hyperfiltration and endothelial dysfunction, has been described in individuals with established hypertension, but its role as a biomarker of preclinical stages of this disease has not been investigated prospectively.

- **Methods and results**: We examined the association between urinary albumin excretion and the risks of hypertension and blood pressure progression in 1,499 nonhypertensive individuals (58% women) without diabetes. During a mean follow-up of 2.9 years, 230 participants (15%) developed hypertension, and 499 (33%) progressed to a higher blood pressure category (defined by the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure). In multivariable logistic regressions that adjusted for known risk factors, the urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) was a significant predictor of incident hypertension (adjusted OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.44, per 1-SD increment in log UACR). Compared with those in the lowest UACR quartile, participants in the highest quartile (men: > 6.66 mg/g; women: > 15.24 mg/g) had an approximately 2-fold risk of developing hypertension (adjusted OR 1.93, P = 0.006) and 1.5-fold risk of blood pressure progression (adjusted OR 1.45, P = 0.03).

- **Conclusions**: Urinary albumin excretion predicts blood pressure progression in nondiabetic, nonhypertensive individuals incrementally.

### Interdialytic weight gain, systolic blood pressure, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein levels change in chronic dialysis patients prior to death [^1131gNW6]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Reports from a United States cohort of chronic hemodialysis patients suggested that weight loss, a decline in pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure, and decreased serum albumin may precede death. However, no comparative studies have been reported in such patients from other countries.

In this study, dynamic changes in these parameters were analyzed in hemodialysis patients, including 3,593 individuals from five Asian countries; 35,146 from 18 European countries; 8,649 from Argentina; and 4,742 from the United States.

In surviving prevalent patients, these variables appeared to have notably different dynamics compared to those who died. While interdialytic weight gain, systolic blood pressure, and serum albumin levels were stable in surviving patients, these indicators began to decline more than a year before death, showing similar dynamics irrespective of gender and geographic region. In European patients, C-reactive protein levels, available on a routine basis, indicated that this acute-phase protein was low and stable in surviving patients but rose sharply before death.

Thus, relevant fundamental biological processes start many months before death in the majority of chronic hemodialysis patients. Longitudinal monitoring of these dynamics may help to identify patients at risk and aid in developing an alert system to initiate timely interventions and improve outcomes.

### Management of hepatorenal syndrome in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^113wu56y]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Albumin constitutes 60% of plasma protein in healthy individuals, and its main physiological function is to maintain colloid osmotic pressure, thereby maintaining intravascular volume. Hypoalbuminemia in cirrhosis is due to both decreased synthesis and increased catabolism. Albumin is used in patients with cirrhosis not only for its volume-expanding effect but also for its antioxidant, immune-modulating, and endothelial-stabilizing properties. The circulating albumin in cirrhotic patients is structurally modified and functionally impaired, thereby unable to perform at full functional capacity.

The normal antioxidant and scavenging properties of albumin, due to the presence of a free cysteine moiety at position 34 (cys-34), help in clearing reactive oxygen species, cytokines, and various bacterial products. These antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of albumin also have beneficial effects on cardiac output in patients with advanced cirrhosis by improving cardiac contractility. However, increased oxidative stress in patients with cirrhosis transforms the albumin to an oxidized state from its normal reduced state. As such, albumin is unable to perform the scavenger and detoxification functions as it cannot bind to the free radicals.

Although a recent study suggests that routine use of albumin in decompensated cirrhosis admitted into the hospital was unable to prevent renal dysfunction, the inflammation suppressing effect of albumin is seen in higher doses. Therefore, a meta-analysis found that a total of 600 g of albumin given over the course of HRS treatment provides beneficial outcomes.

### Elevation of fatty acid-binding protein 4 is predisposed by family history of hypertension and contributes to blood pressure elevation [^1119pNaL]. American Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Intracellular lipid chaperones known as fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are a group of molecules that coordinate lipid responses in cells. FABPs are abundantly expressed 14–15-kDa proteins that can reversibly bind hydrophobic ligands such as saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids with high affinity. FABPs have been proposed to facilitate the transport of lipids to specific compartments in the cell, such as to the endoplasmic reticulum for signaling, trafficking, and membrane synthesis, to the mitochondria or peroxisome for oxidation, to cytosolic or other enzymes to regulate their activity, to the nucleus for lipid-mediated transcriptional regulation, and to lipid droplets for storage. One of the FABPs, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), known as adipocyte FABP (A-FABP) or aP2, is expressed in both adipocytes and macrophages and plays important roles in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and the development of atherosclerosis.

Adipose tissue is now known to secrete a variety of proteins called adipokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α, leptin, and adiponectin, which are implicated in a wide range of biological phenomena. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that FABP4 is secreted from adipocytes and that increased concentration of FABP4 is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and carotid atherosclerosis. However, little is known about the relationship between FABP4 and essential hypertension. Since insulin resistance is involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension, we hypothesized that increase in serum FABP4 induces and/or contributes to the development of this condition.

### Use of intravenous albumin: A guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^117FaemV]. Chest (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, specifically concerning the management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (ICTMG) 2024 recommend considering the administration of intravenous albumin to reduce mortality in patients with SBP.

### Modification of the relationship between blood pressure and renal albumin permeability by impaired excretory function and diabetes [^113r3bdE]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

In animal models, reduced nephron mass impairs renal arteriolar autoregulation, increasing the vulnerability of the remaining nephrons to elevated systemic blood pressure (BP). A feature of the resulting glomerular capillary hypertension is an increase in glomerular permeability. We sought evidence of a similar remnant nephron effect in human chronic kidney disease.

In participants from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1999 to 2010 (N = 23,710), we examined the effect of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on the relationship between brachial artery BP and albumin permeability. Renal albumin permeability increased exponentially with systolic BP > 110 mm Hg, and this association was modified by independent interactions with both excretory impairment and diabetes mellitus.

Each 10 mm Hg increase in systolic BP was accompanied by an increase in fractional albumin excretion of 1.10-, 1.11-, 1.17-, 1.22-, and 1.38-fold for participants with eGFR ≥ 90, 90 > eGFR ≥ 60, 60 > eGFR ≥ 45, 45 > eGFR ≥ 30, and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively, adjusted for age, sex, race, antihypertensive use, eGFR category, diabetes mellitus, smoking, history of cardiovascular disease, body mass index, and C-reactive protein. A 10 mm Hg systolic BP increment was associated with increases in fractional albumin excretion of 1.10- and 1.21-fold in nondiabetic and diabetic participants, respectively. Using urine albumin creatinine ratio as an alternative measure of albumin leak in eGFR-adjusted analyses gave the same conclusions.

Our findings are consistent with the presence of significant relationships between blood pressure and renal albumin permeability mediated by diabetes and impaired excretory function.

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^111nSY5Z]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is largely a function of increased vascular permeability and increased interstitial volume. In this section, we will discuss the role of inflammation in mediating these responses, not only in pathological states but also in life events such as pregnancy, lactation, and cancer growth.

- **Inflammation, increased capillary permeability, and hypoalbuminemia**: Increased vascular permeability for cells and plasma solutes is a universal reaction in trauma, critical illness, chronic disease, life events, multiple or isolated organ failure, and cancer. This response is evident in circumstances including edema in healing wounds and the necessity to maintain intravascular volume by "overhydrating" traumatized or postsurgery patients. Adequately resuscitated patients are maintained in a positive fluid balance of 5–10 liters after clean elective major surgery or other types of trauma. Fluid resuscitation is necessary in these circumstances to avoid hypovolemia and the development of shock. The same happens in children after burns, where fluid balance is positive despite the effort to prevent overhydration. The fact that fluid retention inevitably and visibly occurs in wounds, as well as at the whole-body level after trauma and burns, could reflect that this response is beneficial to some extent, but may become harmful when the inflammatory stimulus cannot be adequately overcome or treated. In wounds, virtually every type of immune cell appears, producing cytokines and growth factors that support the healing process.

Regarding the medical management for liver cirrhosis, specifically in the context of managing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), the BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend administering intravenous albumin. This involves a 1.5 g/kg infusion within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3 for patients with SBP who have increased or rising serum creatinine.

### Effects of saline or albumin fluid bolus in resuscitation: Evidence from re-analysis of the FEAST trial [^112wGYWq]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Fluid resuscitation is the recommended management of shock; however, increased mortality was observed in febrile African children in the FEAST trial. We hypothesized that fluid bolus-induced deaths in FEAST would be associated with detectable changes in cardiovascular, neurological, or respiratory function, oxygen-carrying capacity, and blood biochemistry.

We developed composite scores for respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological function using vital sign data from the FEAST trial. These scores were used to compare participants from FEAST with those from four other cohorts, identifying differences between the bolus (n = 2097) and no bolus (n = 1044) groups of FEAST. We calculated the odds of adverse outcomes for each ten-unit increase in baseline score using logistic regression for each cohort. Within FEAST participants, we also compared hemoglobin and plasma biochemistry between bolus and non-bolus patients. The effects of these factors, along with the vital sign scores on the contribution of bolus to mortality, were assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. Bayesian clustering identified subgroups that differed in response to bolus. The FEAST trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN69856593.

Increasing respiratory (odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI 1.07–1.11), neurological (1.26, 95% CI 1.21–1.31), and cardiovascular scores (1.09, 95% CI 1.05–1.14) were associated with death in FEAST for all p < 0.0001, and with adverse outcomes for specific scores in the four other cohorts. In FEAST, fluid bolus increased respiratory and neurological scores and decreased cardiovascular scores, contributing to mortality.

### Could albumin level explain the higher mortality in hemodialysis patients with pulmonary hypertension [^116Vkigg]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) comprises a group of clinical and pathophysiological entities with similar features due to a great variety of underlying conditions. Chronic renal disease is one of these causes, but the pathogenesis of PH in this group of patients is still unclear. Hemodialysis patients are exposed to continuous pulmonary insults of multifactorial origin, such as hormonal and metabolic derangement associated with end-stage terminal disease, which may induce pulmonary vascular alterations and consequent increased resistance. Additionally, high serum levels of acute phase reactive protein and cytokines, including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, have been demonstrated in this population, suggesting that chronic inflammation might have some role in the pathogenesis of PH in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

On the other hand, PH can cause right ventricular failure with clinical manifestations of systemic venous congestion, pleural effusion, and ascites, which might also result in reduced systemic arterial pressure and intradialytic hypotension. In fact, renal transplantation, by restoring normal renal function, is one of the most effective choices of treatment for PH in end-stage renal disease patients.

PH has been associated with poor survival in hemodialysis patients. However, data regarding the prevalence and the influence of other factors that can affect the survival of PH patients with end-stage renal disease are limited. Hence, the aim of this study is to identify the risk factors associated with the presence of PH in hemodialysis patients and to verify whether albumin levels play a role in mortality.

### Albumin transport and processing by the proximal tubule: Physiology and pathophysiology [^113EDP8G]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Significant epidemiological and clinical trial evidence supports the association between increased urinary albumin excretion, cardiovascular events, and renal failure. An increase in albumin excretion has traditionally been considered to reflect a 'glomerular' leak of protein; however, it is now recognized that significant tubular reabsorption of albumin occurs under physiological conditions. These conditions may be modified by genetic determinants, systemic disease, and drug therapies.

The endocytosis of albumin by the proximal tubule is a highly regulated process depending on protein-protein interactions between several membrane proteins, scaffolding, and regulatory molecules. The elucidation of these interactions is an ongoing research focus. There is also mounting evidence for a transcytotic pathway for the retrieval of albumin from the tubular filtrate. The molecular basis for the role of albuminuria in both interstitial renal disease and cardiovascular pathology continues to be defined. The clinical implications of albuminuria due to a glomerular leak versus reduced tubular reabsorption of albumin are now under consideration. In particular, the prognostic implication of microalbuminuria induced by the more potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors is under study.

The currently defined mechanisms underpinning the tubular reabsorption of albumin, how these are modified by pathology and pharmacology, and the clinical implications are the subject of this review.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^112TLZoF]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for burn injury, particularly fluid resuscitation, the ABA 2024 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence on whether to initiate albumin before or after 12 hours. This timing pertains to reducing the volume of administered fluid, improving urine output, or decreasing edema when albumin is part of the resuscitation plan (not in a rescue situation).

Consider initiating albumin any time in the first 12 hours within the context of a research study, given the uncertainty about the undesirable outcome of pulmonary edema related to early albumin provision and the overall importance of timing.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^117G4PQW]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Albumin therapy has been a topic of ongoing debate, particularly concerning its use in cirrhosis. The multifaceted role of albumin, beyond regulating oncotic pressure, includes acting like a "sponge" by binding to various endogenous and exogenous substances, such as reactive oxygen species and hydroxyl radicals. This binding capability helps mitigate the harmful effects these substances can have on the organism. It's important to note that in conditions involving high oxidative stress or when toxins are present, as seen in decompensated cirrhosis, the quality of albumin declines. This is due to posttranscriptional modifications like cysteinylation or sulfinylation of the cysteine-34 residue, along with truncations and glycosylation, compounded by low albumin levels due to liver dysfunction.

- **Endothelial stabilization and coagulation**: Albumin contributes to endothelial stabilization and reduces endothelial permeability, likely through interactions with the interstitial matrix. In diseases characterized by increased endothelial leakage, higher albumin levels are beneficial as albumin is absorbed by cells, particularly after it has been degraded or oxidized. The antioxidant properties of albumin protect the endothelium, enhancing vascular integrity. Hypoalbuminemia is associated with platelet hyperaggregation, which can lead to a procoagulant state, noted in kidney disease and applicable to cirrhosis. Furthermore, albumin interacts with nitric oxide and eicosanoids, promoting vasodilation. In cirrhosis, both vascular dysfunction and the coagulation system are significant considerations.

### Renin: Friend or foe [^115Ehyge]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Renin maintains blood pressure through vasoconstriction when there is inadequate salt to maintain volume. In populations where blood pressure is more often high than low, and vascular death is more common than hemorrhage or dehydration, therapeutic reductions in renin secretion or response are valuable. Whether long-term benefits are due entirely to blood pressure reduction remains unproved.

The pathway can be blocked at its rate-limiting step (beta blockade or direct renin inhibition), the synthesis of the active product, angiotensin II, or at the receptor for angiotensin. Because renin and sodium are the two main factors in blood pressure control, and renin levels vary inversely with sodium load, blood pressure control requires a combination of natriuresis and blocking the consequential increase in renin activity.

Being a large and stable molecule, renin is among the easiest and cheapest hormone measurements. Understanding the simple biochemistry and physiology of renin permits optimal use of the drugs acting to raise or suppress this hormone.

### Microalbuminuria as a target to improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes [^116Gs5oW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Albuminuria is recognized as a cardiovascular and renal risk factor in patients with diabetes, patients with hypertension, and the general population. Risk increases continuously with rising urinary albumin levels, even at levels once considered normal. This association remains significant after adjusting for numerous other factors. Studies have demonstrated that a decrease in albuminuria results in improved cardiovascular and renal outcomes. These findings suggest that urinary albumin should be routinely measured and treated to provide cardiovascular and renoprotection.

### Effect of modest salt reduction on blood pressure, urinary albumin, and pulse wave velocity in white, black, and Asian mild hypertensives [^111wH631]. Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

A reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure. However, most previous trials were conducted with white participants, with few involving black and Asian individuals. Salt reduction may also reduce other cardiovascular risk factors, such as urinary albumin excretion and arterial stiffness. However, few well-controlled trials have studied these effects.

We carried out a randomized, double-blind crossover trial of salt restriction with slow sodium or placebo, each for six weeks, in 71 whites, 69 blacks, and 29 Asians with untreated mildly raised blood pressure. From slow sodium to placebo, urinary sodium was reduced from 165 ± 58 (± SD) to 110 ± 49 mmol/24 hours (9.7 to 6.5 g/d salt). With this reduction in salt intake, there was a significant decrease in blood pressure from 146 ± 13/91 ± 8 to 141 ± 12/88 ± 9 mm Hg (P < 0.001), urinary albumin from 10.2 (IQR: 6.8 to 18.9) to 9.1 (6.6 to 14.0) mg/24 hours (P < 0.001), albumin/creatinine ratio from 0.81 (0.47 to 1.43) to 0.66 (0.44 to 1.22) mg/mmol (P < 0.001), and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity from 11.5 ± 2.3 to 11.1 ± 1.9 m/s (P < 0.01).

Subgroup analysis showed that the reductions in blood pressure and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio were significant in all groups. The decrease in pulse wave velocity was significant in blacks only. These results demonstrate that a modest reduction in salt intake, approximately the amount recommended by public health guidelines, causes significant falls in blood pressure in all three ethnic groups. Furthermore, it reduces urinary albumin and improves large artery compliance.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic renal disease [^116bJBsk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, development of end-stage renal disease, and all-cause mortality. It affects around 10% of the population worldwide. The prevalence of hypertension in people with CKD ranges from 22% in stage 1 to 80% in stage 4. Elevated arterial blood pressure is one of the major independent risk factors for adverse cardiovascular events. Therefore, reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial but could also increase the risk of adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and CKD remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: Primary: to compare the effects of standard and lower-than-standard blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease on mortality and morbidity outcomes. Secondary: to assess the magnitude of reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the proportion of participants reaching blood pressure targets, and the number of drugs necessary to achieve the assigned target.

- **Search methods**: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, one other database, and two trial registers up to 8 February 2023. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in people with hypertension and CKD that provided at least twelve months' follow-up. Eligible interventions compared lo

### Renal albumin absorption in physiology and pathology [^114LRCTv]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein, serving multiple functions as a carrier of metabolites, hormones, vitamins, and drugs, as an acid/base buffer, as an antioxidant, and by supporting the oncotic pressure and volume of the blood. The presence of albumin in urine is considered to be the result of the balance between glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption. Albuminuria has been accepted as an independent risk factor and a marker for renal as well as cardiovascular disease, and during the past decade, evidence has suggested that albumin itself may cause progression of renal disease. Thus, the reduction of proteinuria and, in particular, albuminuria has become a target in itself to prevent deterioration of renal function.

Studies have shown albumin and its ligands to induce expression of inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators. It has been hypothesized that increased filtration of albumin causes excessive tubular reabsorption, resulting in inflammation and fibrosis, which in turn leads to the loss of renal function. In addition, it is known that tubular dysfunction in itself may cause albuminuria due to decreased reabsorption of filtered albumin. Recently, it has been suggested that significant amounts of albumin fragments are excreted in the urine as a result of tubular degradation.

Thus, although both tubular and glomerular dysfunction influence renal handling of albumin, it appears that tubular reabsorption plays a central role in mediating the effects of albumin on renal function. The present paper will review the mechanisms for tubular albumin uptake and the possible implications for the loss of renal function.

### Urine albumin/creatinine ratio below 30 mg/g is a predictor of incident hypertension and cardiovascular mortality [^113sbsUw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Why is low-grade albuminuria, UACR below 30 mg/g, associated with increased CVD mortality and incident hypertension? Increased albumin excretion is the net result of glomerular filtration and tubular resorption, and it is suggested that in normal physiological conditions there is little filtration. When irreversible increases in albumin excretion occur, it is assumed that there is increased glomerular hydraulic pressure, increased glomerular filtration coefficient, and a change in size and charge selectivity of the glomerular membrane.

The mechanisms linking increased albuminuria and cardiovascular mortality are uncertain. However, it is likely that increased urinary albumin excretion reflects widespread vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, and it is plausible that this might predispose to increased accumulation of atherogenic lipoproteins within the subendothelial cell space. Thus, increased albuminuria might reflect glomerular and/or systemic vascular endothelial dysfunction that precedes the development of hypertension in humans. In previous cross-sectional studies, increased urinary albumin excretion was associated with increased blood pressure in subjects with hypertension and in the general population, suggesting that the increased level of urinary albumin excretion in the present study could be in part due to an increase in blood pressure below levels to diagnose hypertension.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^112YsWPL]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for portal hypertension, specifically in the context of managing hepatorenal syndrome with pharmacotherapy, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend administering albumin solution (20%) at a dose of 20–40 g/day. It is advisable to consider obtaining serial measurements of central venous pressure or other means of assessing central blood volume, in addition to routine monitoring, to prevent circulatory overload by optimizing fluid balance and adjusting the albumin dose accordingly.

### Drug insight: The role of albumin in the management of chronic liver disease [^114xAjJj]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in circulation, with its main physiologic function being the maintenance of colloid osmotic pressure. A better understanding of albumin's other physiologic functions has expanded its application beyond the maintenance of intravascular volume. In patients with cirrhosis, albumin has been used as an adjunct to diuretics to improve the diuretic response. It has also been used to prevent circulatory dysfunction after large-volume paracentesis.

Newer indications in cirrhotic patients include preventing hepatorenal syndrome in those with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and treating established hepatorenal syndrome in conjunction with vasoconstrictor therapies. The use of albumin for many of these indications is controversial, mostly due to the paucity of well-designed, randomized controlled trials. The cost of albumin infusions, the lack of clear-cut benefits for survival, and the fear of transmitting unknown viruses add to the controversy.

The latest indication for albumin use in cirrhotic patients is extracorporeal albumin dialysis, which has shown promise for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Its role in hepatorenal syndrome or acute-on-chronic liver failure has not been established. Efforts should be made to define the indications for albumin use, the dose of albumin required, and predictors of response, so that patients gain the maximum benefit from its administration.

### Serum albumin concentration as an independent prognostic indicator in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115Es1m3]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum albumin is a strong prognostic indicator for many disease processes, yet limited data exist regarding its prognostic relationship in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Our study aims to assess the relationship of hypoalbuminemia with disease severity and mortality in this population.

- **Hypothesis**: Serum albumin concentrations are a predictor of outcomes in PAH.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of all patients with World Health Organization group 1 PAH evaluated between March 2001 and August 2008 was performed. Patients were stratified into groups based on serum albumin concentration ≤ 3.3 g/dL (hypoalbuminemia) vs > 3.3 g/dL. Clinical, hemodynamic, and survival comparisons were compared between groups using the Student's t-test and χ² test, followed by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression.

- **Results**: A total of 163/273 (59.7%) patients had a documented serum albumin concentration. Hypoalbuminemia was present in 41 (25.2%) patients, and serum albumin ≤ 3.3 g/dL represented the lowest quartile of serum albumin. Patients with hypoalbuminemia had higher rates of renal dysfunction (26.8% vs 9.8%, P = 0.0069) and hepatic dysfunction (29.3% vs 6.6%, P < 0.001), and lower hemoglobin levels (11.6 vs 13.4 g/dL, P < 0.001). Hemodynamic and functional capacity assessments were comparable between groups. Independent predictors of mortality included low albumin levels (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.485, P = 0.008), high right atrial systolic area (HR: 1.062, P = 0.003), low Fick-derived cardiac index (HR: 1.465, P = 0.016), and high New York Heart Association functional class.

### Could albumin level explain the higher mortality in hemodialysis patients with pulmonary hypertension [^113BGCgW]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Although some authors have demonstrated that the site and type of vascular access influence pulmonary pressure, we did not find differences regarding this matter. Also, the association of mineral bone renal disease markers with pulmonary hypertension (PH) was not observed in our study. This differs from Havlucu et al, who found elevated parathyroid hormone levels in patients with increased systolic pulmonary arterial pressure. On the contrary, in accordance with other authors, our PH and non-PH groups were homogeneous concerning calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone levels.

The tendency toward lower albumin levels in the PH group could be explained by two mechanisms: hemodilution or inflammation. The PH group presented markers of volume overload, such as higher extracellular volume, evaluated by bioimpedance, and a larger left atrium, while the C-reactive protein levels were similar in both groups. As C-reactive protein levels did not differ between groups, we can suppose that albumin was not decreased by microinflammation. Consequently, dilution is the strongest hypothesis to explain the lower albumin levels in the PH group.

Besides, we emphasize a statistically significant correlation between extracellular fluid/total body water (ECF/TBW) and albumin (r = 0.41, p < 0.01). Therefore, these findings point to hemodilution as the presumable mechanism to explain the propensity for lower albumin levels in the PH group. Thus, we speculate that volume overload participates in the genesis of increased pulmonary arterial pressure in hemodialysis patients. This physiopathological mechanism of PH might be a peculiarity of chronic kidney disease.

### Increase in nocturnal blood pressure and progression to microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetes [^113tr55w]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria often have elevated blood pressure while they are asleep, but it is not known whether the elevation develops concomitantly with microalbuminuria or precedes it.

- **Methods**: We monitored 75 adolescents and young adults who had type 1 diabetes with normal urinary albumin excretion and blood pressure for more than five years. Ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring was used to assess blood pressure at the initial evaluation and about two years later, at which time all subjects had normal urinary albumin excretion. Subsequently, subjects were monitored for the development of microalbuminuria.

- **Results**: Microalbuminuria developed in 14 subjects, whereas the other 61 continued to have normal urinary albumin excretion. The mean (± SD) systolic pressure during sleep increased significantly in the subjects who ultimately had microalbuminuria (from 109.9 ± 11.3 to 114.9 ± 11.7 mm Hg, P = 0.01) but not in the subjects with normal albumin excretion (from 106.0 ± 8.8 to 106.4 ± 14.8 mm Hg). The risk of progression to microalbuminuria was examined in relation to the ratio of systolic pressure during sleep to systolic pressure in the daytime. A ratio of 0.9 or lower, used to define a normal fall in nocturnal pressure, had a negative predictive value of 91 percent for the development of microalbuminuria. Moreover, the risk of microalbuminuria was 70 percent lower (95 percent confidence interval, 44 to 110 percent) in subjects with a ratio of 0.9 or less than in those with a ratio higher than 0.9 (P = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: The study demonstrates a significant association between elevated nocturnal blood pressure and the progression to microalbuminuria in individuals with type 1 diabetes, highlighting the potential predictive value of systolic pressure ratios.

### Effects of saline or albumin fluid bolus in resuscitation: Evidence from re-analysis of the FEAST trial [^1163uVB2]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Bolus fluid reduces haemoglobin concentration, resulting in decreased tissue oxygenation and increasing anaerobic metabolism and metabolic acidosis. According to the Stewart model, maintenance of normal plasma pH is controlled by the strong ion difference (i.e. charge difference between strong cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, and strong anions like Cl– and lactate–), pCO2, and charge from weak acids (such as phosphate and albumin). Bolus of normal saline or 5% albumin, which have similar electrolyte content, caused hyperchloraemia and dilution of bicarbonate, resulting in a reduction in the strong ion difference.

Hyperchloraemic acidosis increases the need for respiratory compensation through increased carbon dioxide excretion to maintain pH. Worsening of respiratory function due to the bolus results in hypoxia, as evidenced by low oxygen saturation and increased respiratory score. This outcome, together with an inability to increase respiratory rate, impairs excretion of carbon dioxide. Increasing carbon dioxide causes cerebral vasodilation, resulting in increased intracranial pressure. Fluid bolus might also directly cause cerebral oedema.

The combination of adverse effects on haemoglobin concentration, acidosis, and respiratory and neurological function induced by modest albumin or saline fluid boluses might overwhelm compensatory mechanisms in the most severely ill patients, resulting in increased mortality.

### Renal handling of albumin: A critical review of basic concepts and perspective [^114WgVFF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Biochemical and physiological processes that underlie the mechanism of albuminuria are completely reassessed in this article in view of recent discoveries that filtered proteins undergo rapid degradation during renal passage, and the resulting excreted peptide fragments are not detected by conventional urine protein assays. This means that filtered protein and/or albumin levels in urine have been seriously underestimated.

The concept that albuminuria is a result of changes in glomerular permeability is questioned in light of these findings. This occurs also in terms of a critical examination of charge selectivity, shunts, or large-pore formation, and hemodynamic effects. The glomerulus appears to function merely in terms of size selectivity alone, and for albumin, this does not change significantly in disease states. Intensive albumin processing by a living kidney occurs through cellular processes distal to the glomerular basement membrane. Failure of this cellular processing primarily leads to albuminuria.

This review brings together recent data about urinary albumin clearance and knowledge of receptors known to process albumin in both health and disease states. We conclude with a discussion of topical and controversial issues associated with the proposed new understanding of renal handling of albumin.

### Interdialytic weight gain, systolic blood pressure, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein levels change in chronic dialysis patients prior to death [^113GY2Fv]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

This international study may contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiological phenomena occurring before death in this highly vulnerable group of patients. The main message for the clinical practitioner is that the temporal evolutions of albumin, SBP, IDWG, and CRP are as important to follow as their absolute levels. This insight should also serve as a wake-up call for dialysis providers, as they may need to implement information systems that allow physicians to follow not only the absolute levels of variables but also their dynamics.

Although a decline in albumin levels or rises in CRP usually alerts healthcare providers, a consistent and unintended decline of SBP by more than 2–5 mm Hg per quarter or an IDWG drop by more than 0.2% per quarter may go unnoticed. On an operational level, the identification of temporal patterns can be supported by patient reports that depict both absolute levels and trends of variables. Moreover, the results of our study offer guidance for the development of predictive models.

We speculate that it might be possible to construct multivariate algorithms by combining IDWG, SBP, and serum albumin levels that may be more predictive of death risk than each individual parameter. Such models may appreciate even subtle intraindividual dynamics, such as mild drops of SBP over the course of months and a decline of serum albumin even within the normal range, which are likely to escape notice in a busy clinical setting. Paradoxically, some of these changes in key indicators may be welcomed as the result of successful interventions.

### Worldwide trends in blood pressure from 1975 to 2015: A pooled analysis of 1479 population-based measurement studies with 19.1 million participants [^115jTC87]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

The estimated number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1.13 billion in 2015 (figure 7), comprising 597 million men and 529 million women. At the global level, this increase was attributable to population growth and ageing, offset partly by falling age-specific prevalence.

In the high-income western super-region, the absolute number of people with raised blood pressure has decreased steadily since 1975 because the steep decrease in prevalence outweighed the effect of population growth and ageing. Nonetheless, 141 million adults in the constituent countries had raised blood pressure in 2015. Similarly, in central and eastern Europe, the number of people with raised blood pressure peaked in 1988 and went below its 1975 levels in 2002, driven by decreasing prevalence. In high-income Asia Pacific, the number of people with raised blood pressure has decreased since 2007 but is still higher than it was in 1975.

In other low-income and middle-income super-regions, the number of people with raised blood pressure is still increasing. In Latin America and the Caribbean, and central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, this rise is a net effect of increases due to population growth and ageing, and decreases due to lower age-specific prevalence. In Oceania, South Asia, East and Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, three-quarters or more of the rise is attributable to population growth and ageing, with the remainder due to an increase in prevalence (figure 7). In 2015, 258 million (23%) of the 1.13 billion adults with raised blood pressure lived in these regions.

### Binding and detoxification efficiency of albumin decline after haemodialysis [^111maLtF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

Human serum albumin is the most abundant plasma protein. It is necessary for maintaining oncotic pressure and serves as a transport protein for a variety of substances, such as fatty acids, hormones, and drugs. In addition, albumin can be used therapeutically in various ways, such as infusion or in extracorporeal procedures. Albumin is specifically used in albumin dialysis procedures, such as the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS), to remove albumin-bound toxins, which is an established treatment in liver failure.

In contrast to patients with liver failure, findings on albumin structure and function in haemodialysis patients are rare so far, even though there is a similarly large therapeutic potential. Albumin is an important scavenger of protein-bound uraemic toxins, including indoxyl sulfate and hippuric acid. Due to its multifaceted binding properties, albumin represents a target structure for both drug and physicochemical therapeutic approaches to eliminate uraemic toxins more efficiently and to better understand drug pharmacokinetics. Also, albumin is a target structure to control inflammation in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The potential of targeted removal of albumin-bound substances has been little exploited in CKD in general and in relation to haemodialysis in particular. A prerequisite for this is the understanding of albumin structure and function in haemodialysis patients and whether, and how, these properties of albumin are affected by the treatment or treatment modalities in particular. Knowledge of these aspects is crucial to advance therapeutic strategies.

### Interdialytic weight gain, systolic blood pressure, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein levels change in chronic dialysis patients prior to death [^113psvTu]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Reports from a United States cohort of chronic hemodialysis patients suggest that weight loss, a decline in pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure, and decreased serum albumin may precede death. However, no comparative studies have been reported in such patients from other countries. Here, we analyzed dynamic changes in these parameters in hemodialysis patients and included 3,593 individuals from 5 Asian countries; 35,146 from 18 European countries; 8,649 from Argentina; and 4,742 from the United States.

In surviving prevalent patients, these variables appeared to have notably different dynamics than in patients who died. While in all populations the interdialytic weight gain, systolic blood pressure, and serum albumin levels were stable in surviving patients, these indicators declined starting more than a year ahead in those who died, with the dynamics being similar irrespective of gender and geographic region. In European patients, C-reactive protein levels were available on a routine basis and indicated that levels of this acute-phase protein were low and stable in surviving patients but rose sharply before death.

Thus, relevant fundamental biological processes start many months before death in the majority of chronic hemodialysis patients. Longitudinal monitoring of these dynamics may help to identify patients at risk and aid the development of an alert system to initiate timely interventions to improve outcomes.

### Worldwide trends in blood pressure from 1975 to 2015: A pooled analysis of 1479 population-based measurement studies with 19.1 million participants [^116C9cdJ]. Lancet (2017). High credibility.

Raised blood pressure is the leading global risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. One of the global non-communicable disease (NCD) targets adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2013 is to lower the prevalence of raised blood pressure by 25% compared with its 2010 level by 2025, defining raised blood pressure as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. Consistent global information is needed to understand how countries compare on blood pressure levels and trends, and where interventions to curtail the rise in blood pressure are most needed.

The prevalence of raised blood pressure measures the number of high-risk people irrespective of treatment status and is the indicator used in the global NCD target. However, blood pressure has a log-linear association with cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease that continues well below the threshold for raised blood pressure, and treatment provides similar proportional risk reductions irrespective of pretreatment blood pressure. Trends in mean population blood pressure measure how blood pressure distribution has shifted over time.

We pooled population-based data to estimate national, regional, and global trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and in the prevalence of raised blood pressure, for adults aged 18 years and older in 200 countries and territories. We also estimated trends in the number of adults with raised blood pressure and calculated how much these trends are attributable to changes in prevalence.

### Obesity modulates the association between systolic blood pressure and albuminuria [^116czKVj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Obesity is associated with albuminuria and incident kidney disease. The increased vulnerability of the glomerular microcirculation to elevated systemic blood pressure is believed to contribute to the adverse effects of obesity on the kidney. We hypothesized that obesity would modulate the association between systolic blood pressure (sBP) and albuminuria.

- **Methods**: The relationship between obesity and albuminuria [fractional albumin excretion (FEalb) or albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR)] was modeled using linear/logistic regression in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2010 cohorts (N = 23,710). Associations between sBP and albuminuria were examined across strata of waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) using interaction terms.

- **Results**: Obesity was associated with albuminuria through an interaction with sBP. Among participants in the 4th/5th quintiles of waist circumference, each 10 mmHg increase in sBP was accompanied by approximately double the increment in FEalb observed among those in quintile 2 (14% versus 7%), with P < 0.01. In quintile 5 of waist circumference, FEalb increased with sBP > 110 mmHg; in quintile 2, FEalb did not increase until sBP was > 130 mmHg. Findings were consistent when defining obesity by BMI or waist circumference and when quantifying albuminuria by ACR or FEalb. Assessing albuminuria as the odds ratio of ACR > 30 mg/g also yielded similar results.

- **Conclusion**: The interaction between sBP and obesity supports the notion that obesity exacerbates the effect of elevated blood pressure on kidney damage.

### Genetic bases of urinary albumin excretion and related traits in hypertension [^114HWXTC]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Epidemiological and animal studies have identified the potential role of genetic factors in the development of microalbuminuria and related traits, such as renal insufficiency, end-stage renal disease, and nephroangiosclerosis, in hypertension. To uncover genetic variants of susceptibility, candidate gene analysis, linkage studies, and genome-wide scan analyses have been employed. Despite significant efforts in this field, comprehensive knowledge about the major genetic variants causing susceptibility to renal damage in hypertension remains limited, as many associations were not replicated or were only observed in certain subgroups of patients.

Linkage and genome-wide scans, initially focusing on genes within the most crucial physiological pathways of blood pressure regulation, have also identified genes involved in lipid metabolism and protein components of glomerular structures as potential candidate genes.

Well-designed, large-scale genome-wide analyses and replication studies with substantial cohorts are essential for clarifying the genetic bases of renal damage in hypertension in the future. Combined strategies can contribute to a better understanding of the genetic basis of urinary albumin excretion and renal damage in hypertension.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^113cgVjx]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of portal hypertension, particularly in the context of managing ascites, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend administering albumin (8 g/L of ascites removed) for plasma volume expansion in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis of more than 5 liters of ascites.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^1175ZuJn]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, specifically the evaluation of albuminuria, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend using more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected through less precise methods:

- **Confirm reagent strip-positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria**: Do this by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible. Quantify the albumin-to-creatinine ratio or protein-to-creatinine ratio if initial semiquantitative tests are positive.

- **Confirm albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol)**: Use a random untimed urine sample followed by a subsequent first morning void.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: Expert review [^111NKKKY]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cirrhosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. It progresses through compensated, decompensated, and further decompensated stages, with median survival times of more than 15 years, 2 years, and 9 months for each stage, respectively. As the disease advances, there is a progressive worsening of portal hypertension and a vasodilatory-hyperdynamic circulatory state, leading to a reduction in effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion.

Vasoconstrictors play a critical role in reducing portal pressure through splanchnic vasoconstriction and are utilized in managing variceal hemorrhage. Intravenous (IV) albumin serves to increase effective arterial blood volume and is employed to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI) and death after large-volume paracentesis, as well as in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The combination of vasoconstrictors and albumin is essential for reversing hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI), the most lethal complication of cirrhosis.

Recent developments include the approval of the potent vasoconstrictor terlipressin by the US Food and Drug Administration and emerging trials on the use of IV albumin in various conditions. Consequently, a best practice update is deemed necessary regarding the use of vasoactive drugs and IV albumin in three specific scenarios: variceal hemorrhage, ascites and SBP, and HRS.

- **Methods**: This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on best practices.

### Albuminuria: An underappreciated risk factor for cardiovascular disease [^111Ps4Zb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Albumin is a small, negatively charged protein that represents 10% of total body protein and 50% of total plasma protein. The physiological role of albumin is to maintain plasma oncotic pressure and to transport various endogenous and exogenous ligands through the bloodstream to target cells. In healthy individuals, the endothelial layer of the glomerulus serves as a barrier that minimizes albumin movement from the blood into the urine. A urine albumin level of < 30 mg in a 24-hour urine sample is considered normal. Pathologic albuminuria (≥ 30 mg in a 24-hour urine sample) involves structural damage in the glomerulus, which is associated with an increased risk for undesirable cardiovascular and kidney outcomes.

- **Cardiovascular and kidney health**: Cardiovascular and kidney disease share many risk factors and pathological processes that can lead to albuminuria. Albuminuria is often detected in hypertension and diabetes, both of which are also risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although it is primarily mentioned in the context of diabetic kidney disease, albuminuria has a strong, independent association with hypertension.

Among 9198 patients in a primary care setting, microalbuminuria (based on test strips that detect ≥ 20 mg/L urine albumin concentrations) was found in 43% of patients with hypertension only and 51% of patients with diabetes only. Patients with both conditions had the highest prevalence of microalbuminuria (58%).

- **Mechanisms**: Reciprocal mechanisms of cardiac and renal disease lead to albuminuria. Injury to the glomerulus resulting in albuminuria is seen in cardiovascular disease.

### Worldwide trends in blood pressure from 1975 to 2015: a pooled analysis of 1479 population-based measurement studies with 19.1 million participants [^117Q4McV]. Lancet (2017). High credibility.

Raised blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure and the prevalence of, and number of people with, raised blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher.

- **Methods**: For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure.

- **Findings**: We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19.1 million adults. Global age-standardised mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127.0 mm Hg (95% credible interval 125.7–128.3) in men and 122.3 mm Hg (121.0–123.6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78.7 mm Hg (77.9–79.5) for men and 76.7 mm Hg (75.9–77.6) for women. Global age-standardised prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24.1% (21.4–27.1) in men and 20.1% (17.8–22.5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income Western and Asia Pacific countries, moving these countries from having some of the highest levels to showing significant decreases in blood pressure levels.

### Use of intravenous albumin: A guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^115VYHyv]. Chest (2024). High credibility.

Albumin is administered in a wide spectrum of clinical scenarios, including complications of cirrhosis, intradialytic hypotension, volume resuscitation, and priming of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. Iso-oncotic albumin is often used to maintain intravascular volume in patients with hypovolemia, assuming that crystalloid resuscitation will be ineffective given its shorter intravascular half-life. Hyperoncotic albumin is used to correct low serum albumin levels or to mobilize extravascular fluid.

Hypoalbuminemia is common in acute and chronic illness. Hospitalized patients with hypoalbuminemia are described as having greater morbidity compared to patients with preserved albumin levels, which promotes the use of IV albumin. During the postoperative period, serum albumin levels decrease precipitously by 10 to 15 g/L. Hypoalbuminemia is thought to result from suppressed synthesis by inflammatory cytokines and transcapillary loss. In addition to its use in patients with hypoalbuminemia, edema, or both, albumin is also used for the prevention and treatment of hypovolemia, particularly after administering large volumes of IV crystalloid solutions.

Practice audits describing the use of albumin show highly variable practices among regions. Albumin is manufactured from large volumes of plasma and is expensive (approximately $130/25 g United States dollars; warehouse acquisition cost of albumin), with the acquisition cost likely being a fraction of the total health care expenditure. Albumin can also be associated with adverse consequences, including fluid overload and hypotension.

### Accelerated or out of control: The final months on dialysis [^112dJcTe]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Mortality rates in dialysis patients are as high as 20% per year. Recent epidemiologic evidence indicates common patterns in biological and clinical indicators before death. Blood pressure, serum albumin levels, C-reactive protein, body weight, and other indicators change, at a population level, at an accelerated rate months before death. The escalation of inflammation, as indicated by a surge of C-reactive protein, appears to be a central event. The etiology of blood pressure decline before death is unclear. Although progressive heart failure is well documented in dialysis patients and a potential cause for blood pressure decline, adaptive functional changes need to be considered. In the general population, an inverse relationship between body weight and blood pressure is well described, and it is reasonable to hypothesize that the blood pressure decline before death is an adaptive response to a decline in body weight. Comparable trajectories of biological indicators before death are also documented in nonrenal illnesses, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and certain malignancies.

Descriptive analysis of clinical and laboratory variables clearly indicates an accelerated time course in most instances, pointing toward a loss of regulatory functions in a number of physiological subsystems. Two potential reasons for this include:

- **Impairment of control loops**: Important control loops may be damaged by the long-term effects of the disease, preventing the system from reacting appropriately to perturbations.

### Hypoalbuminemia in acute illness: Is there a rationale for intervention? A meta-analysis of cohort studies and controlled trials [^111Nt5EN]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

To determine whether hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in the acutely ill, and to assess the potential of exogenous albumin administration for improving outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients, a study was conducted. Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor outcomes in acutely ill patients, but whether this association is causal has remained unclear. Trials investigating albumin therapy to correct hypoalbuminemia have proven inconclusive.

A meta-analysis was conducted of 90 cohort studies with 291,433 total patients, evaluating hypoalbuminemia as an outcome predictor by multivariate analysis and, separately, of nine prospective controlled trials with 535 total patients on correcting hypoalbuminemia.

Hypoalbuminemia was found to be a potent, dose-dependent independent predictor of poor outcomes. Each 10-g/L decline in serum albumin concentration significantly raised the odds of mortality by 137%, morbidity by 89%, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay by 28% and 71%, respectively, and increased resource utilization by 66%. The association between hypoalbuminemia and poor outcomes appeared to be independent of both nutritional status and inflammation. Analysis of dose-dependency in controlled trials of albumin therapy suggested that complication rates may be reduced when the serum albumin level attained during albumin administration exceeds 30 g/L.

Hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Further well-designed trials are needed to characterize the effects of albumin therapy in hypoalbuminemic patients.

### C-reactive protein modifies the relationship between blood pressure and microalbuminuria [^116t5oGi]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) and microalbuminuria reflect intimately related components of the atherosclerotic disease process. Epidemiological studies found only modest associations between CRP and microalbuminuria. Blood pressure, one of the components of the metabolic syndrome in the general population, is the main determinant of microalbuminuria in diabetes and hypertension. We questioned whether CRP modifies the relationship of blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors with microalbuminuria in a cross-sectional study in 8592 inhabitants from Groningen, The Netherlands.

The crude data showed an increase in the prevalence of microalbuminuria with increasing CRP quartiles (4.8%, 9.6%, 14.5%, and 18.6%). This was especially observed when diastolic blood pressure exceeded 90 mm Hg (prevalence: 6.7%, 13.6%, 20.4%, 25.1%; P < 0.0001). Controlling for other risk factors in multivariate analyses, the positive interaction persisted (P = 0.0004). No significant interactions between other risk factors and CRP with respect to the risk of microalbuminuria were encountered. Thus, CRP modifies the relation between blood pressure and microalbuminuria.
