## Question

Will steroid help hand foot and mouth

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether steroids help hand-foot-and-mouth disease and in what situations, if any, they should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease context and standard of care. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about steroids. Next, I will examine the evidence for systemic steroids in mild versus severe disease, including any harms. After that, I should review scenarios where topical steroids might be reasonable. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note any exceptions or uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and baseline management. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is a self-limited viral illness caused by enteroviruses, most commonly coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71, with typical resolution in 7–10 days and management centered on supportive care, hydration, and weight-based acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and pain; oral lidocaine is not recommended, and there is no approved antiviral therapy for routine cases [^f9afb323] [^da130cc6].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on steroids before jumping to conclusions. The American Academy of Family Physicians rapid review explicitly recommends supportive care only and does not endorse steroids for HFMD, which sets a strong default against routine steroid use in typical cases [^da130cc6] [^f9afb323].

> I will now examine the evidence for systemic steroids in mild disease. A case-control study from China found that glucocorticoid treatment was associated with a greater incidence of severe HFMD, suggesting harm rather than benefit when used early in uncomplicated cases; this aligns with the principle that immunosuppression can worsen viral infections, so I should be cautious about extrapolating this to all settings, but it reinforces avoiding steroids in mild disease [^f06b012f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severe disease. I initially thought steroids might be contraindicated across the board, but I need to check the severe end of the spectrum. In severe EV71-associated disease with CNS involvement, some regional protocols and case series describe methylprednisolone alongside IVIG and supportive measures, yet these are not based on randomized trials and reflect practice patterns rather than proven benefit; importantly, a large retrospective analysis showed no mortality benefit from methylprednisolone, whereas early IVIG and mechanical ventilation did improve outcomes, so steroids cannot be considered standard for severe HFMD either [^c7b6e547] [^9d6c5958] [^227a73bc].

> Let me consider topical steroids for symptomatic relief of mucocutaneous lesions. There are no robust RCTs for topical steroids in HFMD, but case-based reports describe using topical corticosteroids for severe oral or genital ulcers to reduce inflammation and pain, including a case of adult genital ulcers managed with oral prednisone and wound care, and ocular complications treated with frequent topical steroids; these are low-level evidence and should be reserved for select, severe mucocutaneous disease after weighing risks and benefits, not for routine use [^c7b6e547] [^c7b6e547] [^b432d4f7].

> I should double-check the mechanistic rationale and potential harms. Steroids suppress host immune responses, which can theoretically facilitate viral replication or dissemination, and in other viral illnesses such as arboviral diseases, WHO advises avoiding corticosteroids in both non-severe and severe disease; while not HFMD-specific, this biological plausibility supports a conservative stance on steroids in viral infections unless there is a compelling, evidence-based indication [^1f5e054e] [^db2b254e].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or mimics another dermatosis. Atypical HFMD, particularly with coxsackievirus A6, can produce bullae, eczema herpeticum–like eruptions, or extensive desquamation; in such cases, clinicians may consider short courses of topical steroids for inflamed skin if pain and function are severely impacted, recognizing that this is off-label and based on case-level experience rather than trials, and ensuring close follow-up for secondary infection or delayed healing [^1491cd82] [^35e4c67b].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For uncomplicated HFMD, do not use steroids; prioritize hydration, antipyretics/analgesics, and supportive oral care. For severe disease with CNS or cardiopulmonary involvement, do not rely on steroids; instead, follow regional protocols that emphasize early recognition, ICU-level supportive care, and consider IVIG in the appropriate window, acknowledging that IVIG evidence is limited and not universally mandated. For severe mucocutaneous pain from ulcers, consider short, carefully monitored courses of topical steroids on a case-by-case basis, avoiding systemic steroids whenever possible [^da130cc6] [^9d6c5958] [^227a73bc].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is clear: steroids do not help typical HFMD and may worsen outcomes in mild disease; they are not recommended by major guidelines for routine HFMD, and even in severe disease they are not proven beneficial and should not replace evidence-aligned supportive strategies. Reserve any steroid use for exceptional scenarios with specialist input and close monitoring [^da130cc6] [^f06b012f] [^9d6c5958].

---

Steroids are **not recommended** for routine management of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) because there is **no evidence of benefit** and potential harm, including increased risk of severe disease and complications [^f06b012f]. Steroids should be **avoided in mild cases**; supportive care with acetaminophen or ibuprofen is sufficient [^da130cc6]. In severe cases with CNS or cardiopulmonary involvement, steroids may be considered only in specialized settings with close monitoring, but evidence is limited and inconsistent [^227a73bc] [^9d6c5958]. Topical steroids may be used for severe mucosal pain, but systemic steroids are not advised for routine HFMD care [^fcba9d6d].

---

## Clinical evidence on steroid use in HFMD

### Mild cases

In mild cases, a case-control study found glucocorticoid treatment was associated with a **greater incidence of severe HFMD**, so steroids should be avoided [^f06b012f]. Routine steroid use is **not recommended**; supportive care with acetaminophen or ibuprofen suffices [^da130cc6].

---

### Severe cases

In severe cases, evidence for systemic steroids is **limited and inconsistent**; some reports suggest possible benefit in severe neurologic or cardiopulmonary disease, but high-quality data are lacking [^227a73bc] [^9d6c5958]. A large retrospective analysis showed **no mortality benefit** from methylprednisolone in severe HFMD, whereas early IVIG and mechanical ventilation improved outcomes [^9d6c5958].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of steroid use in HFMD

Steroids can **suppress the immune system**, potentially increasing viral replication and worsening infection [^a13b812f]. They also carry risks of secondary bacterial infections, delayed healing, and other complications, especially in children [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend routine steroid use** for HFMD; supportive care remains the standard [^da130cc6]. Steroids may be considered only in severe cases with CNS or cardiopulmonary involvement, and even then, evidence is limited and inconsistent [^227a73bc] [^9d6c5958].

---

## Alternative treatments and supportive care

Supportive care — including hydration, antipyretics, and topical analgesics — is the **mainstay of HFMD management** [^da130cc6]. Topical steroids may be used for severe mucosal pain, but systemic steroids are not advised for routine care [^5de03e8d].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Steroids are **not recommended** for routine HFMD management due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^f06b012f]. They should be avoided in mild cases; supportive care suffices [^da130cc6]. In severe cases, steroids may be considered only in specialized settings with close monitoring, but evidence is limited and inconsistent [^227a73bc] [^9d6c5958]. Topical steroids may be used for severe mucosal pain, but systemic steroids are not advised for routine HFMD care [^5de03e8d].

### Risk factors for critical disease and death from hand, foot and mouth disease [^f06b012f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There has been a high mortality and morbidity rate of critical and fatal patients from hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in China in recent. Causes for development of critical and fatal disease remain unclear.

Methods

We performed a case-control study to assess the association between use of drugs and development of critical disease and death from HFMD.

Results

We found that glucocorticoids treatment was associated with a greater incidence of severe HFMD, whereas andrographolides treatment was associated with a protective effect when they are used for treatment within 48 hours after onset or before being diagnosed as critical.

Conclusions

We recommend that glucocorticoids should not be used for mild HFMD and andrographolides should undergo clinical trials for treatment of enterovirus 71 infections.

### Nonsexually transmitted genital ulcer secondary to hand, foot, and mouth disease [^5de03e8d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Genital ulcers that are not the result of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are uncommon, and case reports predominantly feature pubertal girls.

Case

A 38-year-old monogamous, nulliparous woman acutely developed painful vaginal ulcers 7 days after babysitting a child who was subsequently diagnosed with hand, foot, and mouth disease. The patient developed nonspecific systemic symptoms followed by painful and rapidly expanding genital ulcers. Laboratory test results for herpes, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and Epstein-Barr virus were all negative. The patient was treated with brief inpatient observation, oral prednisone, meticulous wound care, and debridement. The ulcers resolved over a 3-week period.

Conclusion

Although typically associated with pubertal girls, genital ulcers that are not the result of STIs can affect adults as well. The cornerstone of management regardless of age is supportive care, debridement and wound care, and treatment with steroids.

PPES

Prevention strategies for PPES include prophylactic removal of hyperkeratotic areas, application of moisturizing cream containing urea ≥ 10%, pedicures, and cushioning of callused areas using soft or padded shoes [48]. Other preventive tactics include avoidance of activities that cause force or rubbing on the hands and feet during the first 6 weeks of treatment and limiting contact with harsh chemicals and sources of heat, such as sitting in saunas or the sun.

Management of PPES consists of keratolytic agents such as urea ≥ 10% for grade ≥ 1 PPES, with addition of high‐potency topical steroids such as fluocinonide 0.05% for grade ≥ 2 symptoms.

Stomatitis

Preventive strategies include undertaking dental work aimed at eliminating existing tooth and gum disease before the start of treatment and education regarding the importance of thorough and frequent cleaning of the oral cavity. Avoidance of salty, spicy, or citrus‐based foods, as well as hot beverages, may help prevent stomatitis.

Upon emergence of grade 1 or 2 stomatitis, dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5 mL elixir is recommended; an augmented betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% gel applied to gauze and held against the affected surface may also assist in alleviating symptoms.

Dry Skin

Patients should be advised to moisturize skin to minimize the risk of skin adverse events and to avoid excessive exposure to detergents and soaps containing fragrances. Urea preparations have been shown to prevent transepidermal water loss, and salicylic acid preparations are helpful for their keratolytic, bacteriostatic, and fungicidal effects [50]. Exfoliation of scaly areas of xerosis is recommended. For more severe grade 3 xerosis, which results in asteatotic dermatitis, treatment can be initiated with low‐potency topical steroids such as hydrocortisone 2.5% cream/ointment or triamcinolone 0.1% cream.

Dry Mouth/Xerostomia

Patient education is an important component of dry mouth prevention. The importance of good oral hygiene, regular dentist visits, and other strategies for preventing oral disease should be stressed.

Treatment may include systemic and topical salivary stimulants, such as cevimeline and pilocarpine, and intraoral topical agents, such as chewing gums and saliva stimulants and substitutes [59]. High‐fluoride toothpaste is also recommended to prevent cavities.

### Enterovirus 71 related severe hand, foot and mouth disease outbreaks in south-east Asia: current situation and ongoing challenges [^dce06935]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

In early 2012, doctors in Cambodia noticed high numbers of infants and young children presenting with a severe and unusual illness. The striking features of the disease were an initial encephalitic presentation followed by a rapidly fatal destructive alveolar pneumonia, alarming experienced clinicians. Between April and July 2012 a total of 78 children were affected, 54 of whom died. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) was identified as the causative organism, possibly aggravated by malnutrition and uncontrolled use of steroids.EV71 is one of the pathogens associated with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). It was responsible for large HFMD outbreaks in Taiwan (1.5 million cases) and Malaysia (Sarawak, 2628 cases) in the late 1990s. In 2008 and 2011 large outbreaks were also described in China (490 000 cases) and Vietnam (110 000 cases). The recent Cambodian outbreak further demonstrates the emergence and spread of serious EV71 related disease in the South-East Asian region over the last two decades.

### Prevalence and management of severe hand, foot, and mouth disease in xiangyang, China from 2008–2013 [^9d6c5958]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic strategies for severe hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) are currently either inconsequent or deficient in evidence. We retrospectively surveyed HFMD outbreaks in Xiangyang from June 2008 to December 2013. HFMD is staged form I to V according to clinical severity and the case with central nervous system involvement is defined as a severe one. We analyzed risk factors for fatality of severe cases and compared the efficiency and outcome of some therapies by binary logistic regression. The overall HFMD cases included 637 (1.26%) severe cases, 38 fatalities (0.75‰). Analysis indicates that age (< 3 y), enterovirus 71 (+), autonomic nervous system dysregulation, pulmonary edema/hemorrhage, CRP (> 40 mg/L) and cardiac troponin I (> 0.04 ng/mL) are risk factors for fatality (all P < 0.05). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and mechanical ventilation applied only in early stage IV significantly improved HFMD progression (both P < 0.05) with odds ratios of 0.24 (95% CI: 0.10–0.57) and 0.01 (95% CI: 0.00–0.10), respectively. Neither methylprednisolone nor milrinone administered in any stage made any significant difference on mortality (all P > 0.05). Precise recognition of the severe HFMD cases in early stage IV and prompt IVIG and mechanical ventilation application may decrease mortality. Mechanical ventilation training programs and dispatching specialists to county-level or district hospitals when there is no chance of transfer critical HFMD cases to a superior hospital are two key successful administrative initiatives.

### Atypical cutaneous findings of hand-foot-mouth disease in children: a systematic review [^1491cd82]. Pediatric Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood infectious disease. Atypical skin findings of HFMD, often associated with coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6), were first reported in 2008, with increasing reports worldwide since. Atypical lesions of HFMD often involve sites beyond the palms and soles and tend to have unusual, polymorphic morphology.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted on clinical features and outcomes of pediatric HFMD with atypical cutaneous manifestations.

Results

Eighty-five studies were included, representing 1359 cases with mean age 2.4years and a male predominance of 61%. The most reported morphologies were vesicles (53%), papules (49%), and bullae (36%). Other morphologies included eczema herpeticum-like (19%), purpuric/petechial (7%), and Gianotti Crosti-like (4%). Common atypical sites included the arms and/or legs (47%), face (45%), and trunk (27%). CVA6 was identified in 63% of cases. Symptoms resolved in a mean of 10days. Overall, 16% of cases received treatment, most commonly with acyclovir, intravenous antibiotics, or topical steroids. The most common complications were nail changes (21%) and desquamation (4%) which occurred a mean of 3 and 2weeks after symptoms, respectively.

Conclusion

Due to unusual morphologies resembling other conditions, HFMD with atypical cutaneous findings may be misdiagnosed, leading to inappropriate and unnecessary investigations, hospitalization, and treatment. Greater awareness of atypical presentations of HFMD is warranted to improve patient care and counseling on infection control precautions.

### Innovative management of severe hand dermatitis [^fa48cb54]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

The successful treatment of hand dermatitis (HD) depends less on the selection of the proper topical steroid or a particular systemic agent than on addressing any underlying cause or perpetuating factor. Thus, innovative treatment is based on comprehensively addressing the patient's problem. Aggressive approaches may be required for the most severe forms of HD.

Future Plans

A full protocol for a multinational, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial will be developed by using the recommendations from this workshop. Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia are the most likely sites for the trial to be able to enroll participants, and representatives of sites in these countries will be approached to request participation. Pharmaceutical companies that distribute IVIg in the region will also be contacted regarding their products and possibilities of placebo production. The protocol will subsequently be submitted to funding bodies for consideration.

### Exacerbation of bullous pemphigoid after hand, foot, and mouth disease treated with rituximab [^d2abb713]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Case report

A 56-year-old white man with a history of asthma, chronic renal failure, and stable BP presented with complaints of worsening pruritic vesicles over the course of 2 months. These lesions developed 2 months after contracting a severe case of HFMD diagnosed by his primary care physician. His diagnosis was based on his high fevers and severe blistering on his hands, feet, and mouth, and he was confined to bed for 2 weeks amid a coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) breakout in the summer of 2012. His primary care physician prescribed prednisone, 40 to 60 mg orally daily, which resulted in mild-to-moderate control of his blisters.

Before his CVA6 infection, his BP was in complete remission on a regimen of prednisone, 10 mg orally every other day. He presented to our dermatology clinic with his post–CVA6-induced flare, at which time his physical examination found 40% to 50% of his body surface area covered with tense bullae, erosions, and crust located on his face, neck, chest, abdomen, back, buttocks, genitalia, and bilateral upper and lower extremities, with sparing of the oral mucosa (Fig 1, A and B). In addition, his laboratory, histopathology, and direct immunofluorescence findings all supported a diagnosis of BP at that time. Results of a paraneoplastic pemphigus panel were normal, and the pemphigoid panel found an elevated BP 230 IgG antibody level (106 U; normal < 9 U) and slightly elevated BP 180 IgG antibody level (25 U; normal < 9 U; ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, Utah).

### Exacerbation of bullous pemphigoid after hand, foot, and mouth disease treated with rituximab [^d44bc9e0]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

He was prescribed prednisone, 60 mg orally daily, doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice a day, and mycophenolate mofetil, 1500 mg tablet orally daily with repeated attempts to taper prednisone. However, because of frequent flaring and inability to taper prednisone over the course of 6 months, we initiated rituximab, 1000 mg intravenously on days 1 and 15, followed by 500 mg/m² intravenously monthly for 2 doses. With this regimen, his prednisone was tapered down to 10 mg and mycophenolate mofetil down to 500 mg. In total, the patient received 4 doses of rituximab infusions (375 mg/m² per infusion). With each infusion, he experienced acute onset of pruritus followed by significant clearing of lesions over several days. Complete metabolic panel, complete blood count, and pemphigoid panels were followed up with closely. He currently remains asymptomatic with downward trending BP titers with a maintenance regimen of prednisone, 10-mg tablet orally daily, mycophenolate mofetil, 500-mg tablet orally twice a day, and doxycycline, 100-mg tablet orally daily (Figs 2 and 3).

### Pseudomembranous conjunctivitis with hand, foot and mouth disease in a pregnant woman: a case report [^b432d4f7]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

After 3 weeks, the patient's conjunctival injection had improved, and a pseudomembrane was not observed. However, punctate corneal erosion was seen in both eyes (Fig. 4). The topical steroids were changed to fluorometholone and were administered every 6 h. Artificial tears and ophthalmic ointment were continuously used. After 2 months, the punctate corneal erosion had improved, and after 3 months, had completely resolved (Fig. 4).

### Exacerbation of bullous pemphigoid after hand, foot, and mouth disease treated with rituximab [^963a4421]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a chronic autoinflammatory, blistering disease typically affecting the elderly. It is the most common disorder within the pemphigoid group and represents the most frequent autoimmune blistering disease in general. The etiopathogenesis involves the induction of an inflammatory cascade that is hypothesized to include many triggering factors, one of which includes infections. Here we present a man with a history of stable BP and subsequent severe flaring of his disease after contracting hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). We also discuss rituximab as an adequate therapy in treating refractory BP.

### Pseudomembranous conjunctivitis with hand, foot and mouth disease in a pregnant woman: a case report [^c7b6e547]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common systemic infection that is caused by an enterovirus, normally Coxsackie A16. Generally, it affects children or immunocompromised adults. Only a few reports have described pseudomembranous conjunctivitis associated with HFMD. We aim to describe the clinical outcomes and ocular findings of a 37-year-old female with HFMD and concurrent severe pseudomembranous conjunctivitis, who was 28 weeks pregnant.

Case presentation

A female patient who was 28-weeks pregnant was referred for an ophthalmological review due to pain and injection in both eyes. The patient was hospitalized under obstetrics and gynecology and evaluated for Behcet's disease with oral and perineal ulcers. In an ophthalmic examination, both eyes were observed to have a conjunctival injection. Behcet's disease-associated conjunctivitis was diagnosed. Topical steroids and antibiotics were administered every 6 h. Two days after her presentation, a maculopapular eruption occurred on her palms. Enterovirus type 71 was detected in a serum virus antibody test, and the patient was diagnosed with HFMD. After 7 days, severe pseudomembranous conjunctivitis and corneal epithelial defects occurred in both eyes. Topical steroids were administered every 3 h, and the pseudomembrane was removed every 2 to 3 days. The pseudomembrane did not occur after 3 weeks, but corneal erosion persisted. After 3 months, the corneal erosion had completely resolved.

Conclusions

HFMD-associated conjunctivitis is a rare complication in adults, however it can appear as a severe pseudomembranous conjunctivitis. In this case, the removal of the pseudomembrane and topical steroids helped improve the symptoms.

### Hand-foot-and-mouth disease: rapid evidence review [^f9afb323]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is caused by human enteroviruses and coxsackieviruses. Outbreaks can occur in the spring to fall and are common in North America, and most cases occur in patients younger than 10 years. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is transmitted by fecal-oral, oral-oral, and respiratory droplet contact. Patients present with a low-grade fever, a maculopapular or papulovesicular rash on the hands and soles of the feet, and painful oral ulcerations. Lesions usually resolve in seven to 10 days; however, in rare cases, patients may have neurologic or cardiopulmonary complications. The differential diagnosis for childhood rashes and oral enanthems is broad and includes erythema multiforme, herpes, measles, and varicella. Treatment is supportive and directed toward hydration and pain relief as needed with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Oral lidocaine is not recommended, and antiviral treatment is not available. The best methods to prevent the spread of hand-foot-and-mouth disease are handwashing and disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces and fomites.

### Effects of glucocorticoids on radiological progression in rheumatoid arthritis [^66a6df14]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Glucocorticoid use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is widespread. Two Cochrane Reviews have been published examining the short term clinical benefit of low dose glucocorticoids compared to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and demonstrate good short term and medium term clinical benefits. The possibility that glucocorticoids may have a fundamental 'disease modifying' effect in RA, which would be seen by a reduction in the rate of radiological progression, has been raised by several authors.

Objectives

To perform a systematic review of studies evaluating glucocorticoid efficacy in inhibiting the progression of radiological damage in rheumatoid arthritis.

Search Strategy

A search of MEDLINE (from 1966 to 22 February 2005) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was undertaken, using the terms 'corticosteroids' and 'rheumatoid arthritis' expanded according to the Cochrane Collaboration recommendations. Identified abstracts were reviewed and appropriate reports obtained in full. Additional reports were identified from the reference lists and from expert knowledge.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled or cross-over trials in adults with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis in which prednisone or a similar glucocorticoid preparation was compared to either placebo controls or active controls (i.e. comparative studies) and where there was evaluation of radiographs of hands, or hands and feet, or feet by any standardised technique. Eligible studies had at least one treatment arm with glucocorticoids and one without glucocorticoids.

Data Collection and Analysis

Standardised data extraction obtain the mean and standard deviation (SD) of change in erosion scores over 1 year or 2 years. (Where SD for change was not given a conservative estimate was taken from baseline data.) At least two authors selected the studies and extracted the data. Radiographic erosion scores were expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score for the method used. The results were pooled after weighting in a random effects model to provide a standardised mean difference (SMD).

Main Results

The initial search produced 217 citations, and 15 were added from experts, abstracts and review of reference lists. Authors of 4 trials being prepared for publication (and subsequently published) kindly shared their data. After application of eligibility criteria 15 studies and 1,414 patients were included. The majority of trials studied early RA (disease duration up to 2 yrs), and the mean cumulative dose of glucocorticoid was 2,300 mg prednisone equivalent (range 270 mg - 5,800 mg) over the first year. Glucocorticoids were mostly added to other disease modifying anti-rheumatoid drug (DMARD) treatment. The standardised mean difference in progression was 0.40 in favour of glucocorticoids (95% CI 0.27, 0.54). In studies lasting 2 years (806 patients included), the standardised mean difference in progression in favour of glucocorticoids at 1 year was 0.45 (0.24, 0.66) and at 2 years was 0.42 (0.30, 0.55). All studies except one showed a numerical treatment effect in favour of glucocorticoids. The beneficial effects of glucocorticoids were generally achieved when used in conjunction with other DMARD treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Even in the most conservative estimate, the evidence that glucocorticoids given in addition to standard therapy can substantially reduce the rate of erosion progression in rheumatoid arthritis is convincing. There remains concern about potential long-term adverse reactions to glucocorticoid therapy, such as increased cardiovascular risk, and this issue requires further research.

### Pseudomembranous conjunctivitis with hand, foot and mouth disease in a pregnant woman: a case report [^09ab4791]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 37-year-old female who was 28 weeks pregnant, was referred to our clinic due to a conjunctival injection and eye pain. The patient was admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology department with a perineal ulcer. Vesicular rashes occurred on her tongue and labial mucosa. She was diagnosed with Behcet's disease and treated conservatively. One week before the onset of her symptoms, she visited a swimming pool. The patient was healthy, with no history of immunosuppression. On admission, the patient had a body temperature of 36.6 ◦C, a pulse of 78 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 111/63 mmHg.

On initial ophthalmological examination, a bilateral bulbar and palpebral conjunctival injection was observed (Fig. 1). A pseudomembrane and follicle were not observed. The patient's intraocular pressures and anterior segment examination findings were normal in both eyes. Behcet's disease with ocular involvement was diagnosed.

### Pseudomembranous conjunctivitis with hand, foot and mouth disease in a pregnant woman: a case report [^fcba9d6d]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Enterovirus 71 can be found in the saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, and stools. The virus quickly spreads through close contact between individuals, droplets in the air, or by touching contaminated objects. Less commonly, HFMD can be transmitted by swallowing water in a swimming pool that has been contaminated with a stool containing the virus. In this case, the patient was likely infected by contaminated water, as the symptoms appeared 7 days after going to a swimming pool.

Herpangina symptoms, including oral ulcers, are caused by viral particles traveling to secondary sites of replication after viremia. Conjunctival inflammation and pseudomembranes can also be estimated as a result of viral replication. Pseudomembranous conjunctivitis is caused by inflammation of the conjunctiva and is characterized by mucopurulent discharge and pseudomembrane formation, which is mainly composed of mucus and fibrin. Management is aimed at reducing ocular inflammation with topical steroids and hydrating the ocular surface with artificial tears and lubricants. Removing the pseudomembrane can help improve symptoms and wound healing. Conjunctival goblet cell loss occurs in ocular surface inflammatory diseases, and this can cause long-term symptoms of dry eye disease. Similarly, in this case, corneal punctate erosion improved after 3 months of treatment. Therefore, when an ocular complication occurs due to HFMD, it is necessary to evaluate and treat long-term dry eye disease.

Specifically, the patient, in this case, was pregnant. In rare cases, HFMD can result in serious infections regardless of pregnancy. According to Giachè et al. 41% of HFMD-infected pregnant females were symptomatic, and only 15.5% developed mucosal ulceration, such as oral aphthae. These findings suggest that HFMD in pregnancy is usually asymptomatic or mild. Therefore, it can be assumed that it is very rare that a serious mucocutaneous lesion occurred, as in this case.

An important differential diagnosis of HFMD is erythema multiforme major. Erythema multiforme major is an acute, self-limiting mucocutaneous disease characterized by the abrupt onset of red papules that evolve to target or bull's eye-like lesions on the dorsal and acral surfaces of the hands and feet as well as the extensor surfaces of the extremities. In this case, the patient was positive for Enterovirus A71. Additionally, the eruption was limited to her palms, and the lesion was not shaped like a target. Therefore, the patient is more likely to have had ocular complications associated with HFMD.

### Workshop on use of intravenous immunoglobulin in hand, foot and mouth disease in southeast Asia [^f35daeb4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

HFMD is a serious public health threat and burden to health care systems across Southeast Asia and associated regions. In the absence of region-wide vaccination coverage, systematic study of severe HFMD is needed, including proper assessment of the current interventions in use. IVIg is one of the most commonly used interventions but is expensive and has potentially severe side effects, so its use should be a primary subject of these assessments. During a 2-day workshop, guidelines and clinical management in different countries were discussed, and suggestions for the design of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were made. These suggestions will serve as the foundation for protocol development and further funding applications for a trial of IVIg use for treatment of severe HFMD.

Clinical Grading and Management of HFMD

Most HFMD management guidelines, including the 2011 WHO guidelines, use a clinical grading system that measures the severity and stage of illness. Although there are several large differences, all are largely similar in the sense that they all describe 4 stages (in order of increasing severity): 1) uncomplicated HFMD/herpangina, 2) with CNS involvement, 3) with autonomic dysregulation, and 4) with cardiopulmonary failure. Supportive measures and interventions are dictated by the grade of severity.

Clinical management of HFMD is largely supportive in nature; no specific antiviral drug treatments are recognized. Children with uncomplicated HFMD are best treated at home. Children who have warning signs or frank signs and symptoms of CNS involvement should be hospitalized and closely monitored for further complications that may require intensive care and supportive measures. Severity and duration of fever are independent risk factors for CNS involvement. Vomiting, lethargy, agitation, and irritability have also been shown to be associated with CNS involvement. More specific neurologic signs, such as myoclonic jerks (usually observed during the early stage of sleep but also seen in severe cases when patients are awake), limb weakness, truncal ataxia, and "wandering eyes" (rotary eye movement without fixation), are commonly observed in children in the early stage of severe disease. Other warning signs are irregular breathing pattern, dyspnea (labored breathing effort), tachypnea (increased breath rate), and mottled skin.

Although exact indications differ among countries in the region, IVIg is usually given to prevent further progression of illness in children with severe HFMD in the early stages of CNS involvement or autonomic dysregulation. The Technical Appendix highlights the relevant features of studied guidelines from the region.

### Enterovirus 71 related severe hand, foot and mouth disease outbreaks in south-east Asia: current situation and ongoing challenges [^dcc825bf]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

Management, public health and prevention

In 2011, WHO published guidelines for clinical diagnosis and management of HFMD. Individual countries that have experienced large outbreaks (Taiwan, China, Vietnam) have developed their own guidelines. All the guidelines are based primarily on expert opinion with little evidence base. Most describe a staging or grading system with uncomplicated febrile HFMD designated as Grade 1, high or prolonged fever and/or neurological manifestations such as myoclonus, aseptic meningitis or encephalitis designated as Grade 2, while clear evidence of autonomic nervous system dysregulation classifies the patient as having Grade 3 disease, and cardiopulmonary compromise as Grade 4 disease.

Interventions are tailored to the severity of the disease, and consist of antipyretics, sedatives, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), milrinone, haemofiltration and, occasionally, provision of respiratory support. IVIG is widely used, particularly in Vietnam; it is a very costly intervention with potential risks, and currently there is no evidence to support its use. Milrinone has been shown to reduce mortality in severe cases with cardiopulmonary collapse through a small randomised controlled open-label trial. It is believed that controlling autonomic dysfunction may avoid progression of disease to cardiopulmonary failure. One novel therapy under investigation is intravenous magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate, long used in the management of pre-eclampsia, promotes cardiovascular stability through a combination of vasodilatation and negative chronotropicity. It also inhibits catecholamine release, and may reduce autonomic dysfunction in tetanus. A randomised placebo controlled trial of magnesium sulfate in children with autonomic dysfunction is in progress in Vietnam to address the potential benefit of this cheap, accessible therapy. (Clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT01940250.) The WHO Western Pacific Region Office provides updates on HFMD cases notified through local public health systems in Japan, Singapore, China, Vietnam, The Philippines and Thailand. Outbreak control measures are targeted at interrupting virus transmission from person to person, as well as through contact with contaminated surfaces (such as toys) or fomites. Therefore health education messages focus on personal hygiene and good sanitation, including recommendations for frequent hand washing, proper disposal of soiled diapers and regular disinfection of soiled surfaces. The transmission of EVs is most efficient in crowded settings, and therefore during outbreaks most countries in the region have adopted social distancing measures, such as closures of childcare facilities and schools and cancellation of public functions involving children. Little systematic research has been done to assess the effectiveness of such measures, but one study from Singapore seemed to show some benefit. However, the optimal timing for implementation of these measures is unclear — early, as soon as a HFMD is reported, or later following confirmation of EV71 as the causative agent. In addition, the effectiveness of distancing measures, which have substantial socioeconomic implications, is uncertain. If EV71 is like other directly transmissible viruses, such controls may decrease the peak incidence of disease during an outbreak/epidemic, and blunt the burden on the healthcare system, which can be of great value. However, it could thereby also prolong the outbreak and the total numbers would be similar. In addition, school closure could cause relocation to other geographical areas.

### Hand-foot-and-mouth disease: rapid evidence review [^83584cfb]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hand-foot-and-mouth disease:

- **Definition**: HFMD is a common viral illness caused by enteroviruses, primarily affecting infants and children, although it can occasionally occur in adults.
- **Pathophysiology**: HFMD is caused by enteroviruses, most commonly Coxsackievirus A16 and Enterovirus 71. It transmitted through direct contact with the saliva, nasal mucus, blister fluid, and feces of infected individuals.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of HFMD in China is estimated at 197 per 100,000 person-years. HFMD shows seasonal variation, with a peak in cases typically occurring in spring and early summer, and possesses the potential to escalate to epidemic levels.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for HFMD include young age, having close contact with infected individuals, being in group settings like schools or daycare centers, the summer and early fall seasons, and poor hygiene practices.
- **Disease course**: The clinical manifestations of HFMD typically include fever, sore throat, and a characteristic skin rash that presents as small, red, painful papules progressing to blisters on the hands, feet, and sometimes in the mouth, which can subsequently develop into ulcers.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The disease course is generally self-limiting, with symptoms resolving within a week without specific treatment. However, in rare cases, severe cardiac and neurologic complications can occur.

### Workshop on use of intravenous immunoglobulin in hand, foot and mouth disease in southeast Asia [^7d8ec5b9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The South East Asia Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network convened subject matter experts at a workshop to make consensus recommendations for study design of a clinical trial for use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in severe hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). HFMD is a highly contagious emerging infection among children in the region, a small proportion of whom develop neurologic and cardiopulmonary complications with high case-fatality rates. The use of IVIg for treatment of severe disease is widespread and a part of local, national, and international guidelines, but no clinical evidence warrants the use of this drug, which is expensive and has potentially serious side effects. During a 2-day workshop in March 2014, a group of HFMD experts reviewed the current evidence related to use of IVIg in HFMD and discussed potential study design, feasibility, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, primary and secondary endpoints, and subsidiary studies for a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

### Workshop on use of intravenous immunoglobulin in hand, foot and mouth disease in southeast Asia [^0279a426]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is typically a benign, self-limiting illness among young children and infants that is characterized by fever; ulcerating vesicles in the mouth; and lesions, usually maculo- or papulovesicular, on hands, feet, and buttocks. Lesions usually occur on the palms and soles. Outbreaks occur worldwide and are often associated with daycare centers, kindergartens, and elementary schools. HFMD is caused by enteroviruses belonging to the species Enterovirus A (serotypes coxsackievirus A 2–8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 and enterovirus [EV] 71, 76, and 89–92) and, rarely, Enterovirus B. Enterovirus A and Enterovirus B species can also cause herpangina, which may overlap clinically with HFMD. Since the late 1990s, EV71 has been associated with large outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region. Young children (median age < 2 years) are affected, and some experience severe illness that may lead to neurologic and cardiopulmonary complications and even death.

### A case report of a teenager with severe hand, foot, and mouth disease with brainstem encephalitis caused by enterovirus 71 [^a1ea620c]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute viral infection occurring mostly in infants and children. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection mostly occurs in children < 5 years of age. Severe cases, however, are usually encountered in children under the age of 3 years, and exceedingly rare in teenagers > 14 years and adults.

Case presentation

We report a rare case of HFMD in a 16-year-old male teenager residing in Chonqing, China. The clinical presentation was typical of HFMD and included vesicular lesions and oral mucosal ulcers, macular and vesicular lesions on palms and soles. He developed severe neurological complications that were suggestive of brainstem encephalitis. EV71 RNA was detected in the patient's faecal samples by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Specific IgM antibody to EV71 was detected in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid by ELISA. Gamma immunoglobulin therapy at 25 g/day was administered for 2 days, along with methylprednisolone, mannitol, ganglioside, and creatine phosphate sodium. The patient showed neurological improvement and recovered completely in 1 month.

Conclusions

This case indicates that EV71 infection may cause HFMD in teenagers with potentially severe neurological involvement. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of HFMD occurring in adults and teenagers as prompt treatment could be life-saving in these patients.

### Coxsackievirus B5 associated with hand-foot-mouth disease in a healthy adult [^4c8d15bc]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Because treatment is mainly supportive, recognition and prevention play a vital role in limiting spread of HFMD and decreasing outbreaks. One way physicians can help is to identify affected patients and educate them on preventive measures. Enteroviruses are shed in the stool for many weeks after initial infection, so good hand hygiene should be made a mandatory practice, especially in health care settings, daycare centers, and other places where outbreak is common. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionrecommend all affected patients and their close contacts to practice the following: frequent hand washing, especially after changing diapers and using the restroom; frequent disinfection of commonly used surfaces and objects; avoiding close contact with infected individuals. These recommendations are simple tasks that play an important role in preventing further spread of infection.

Multiple viruses in the Picornaviridae family are responsible for causing HFMD in persons of all ages. Although infection and illness is most commonly seen in young children and immunocompromised adults, there has been an unexpected increase in the amount of affected healthy adults. This could be because of reinfection with an unusual or more virulent strain as well as improper utilization of preventive measures by affected patients and close contacts. Because HFMD has the potential to reach epidemic levels in the United States, dermatologists and primary physicians need to be aware of the potential complications that can result. In addition, identification of the signs and symptoms of HFMD in a broader demographic should be a goal set by all physicians to prevent further disease spread, and thus, decrease the risk of future epidemics.

Neuroinvasion and Severe Illness

EV71-associated HFMD is distinct from non-EV71 HFMD in clinical manifestations that are more severe in a minority of patients. Data from mouse studies suggest that, after initial replication in the gut and the reticuloendothelial system, EV71 can invade the central nervous system (CNS) through retrograde axonal spread along cranial or peripheral nerves.

EV71 can cause aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, encephalitis, and other rare manifestations. Myoclonic jerks are seen more often in cases of EV71 infection than during infections with other enteroviruses and could be an early indicator of neurologic involvement, particularly in the brainstem. Brainstem encephalitis with autonomic dysregulation and associated neurogenic pulmonary edema has been the hallmark of the severe end of the spectrum of EV71 CNS infection in Asia since the late 1990s. After 3–5 days of prodromal HFMD and high fevers, acute and rapidly progressing cardiorespiratory failure develops in children, beginning with symptoms of shock and pulmonary edema or hemorrhages. Postmortem studies of human EV71 infections have shown limited viral infection of neuronal cells of the central parts of the brain and inflammation in the spinal cord, medulla, pontine tegmentum, midbrain, hypothalamus, and subthalamic and dentate nuclei. The exact mechanism for autonomic dysfunction and pulmonary edema in EV71 encephalitis is unclear, but neurogenic mechanisms secondary to brainstem invasion and inflammation, especially of the vagus nucleus, seem to be important.

### Hirsutism, amphetamines, COVID-19 viral shedding, hand-foot… [^ac6bdcb7]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

What systemic treatments are effective for hirsutism in women. Combined oral contraceptives are first-line therapy for women with hirsutism who are not trying to conceive and in whom cosmetic measures are ineffective. If patient-important hirsutism persists after six months of therapy with combined oral contraceptives, the addition of an antiandrogen should be considered. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists should be avoided for the treatment of hirsutism except in patients with severe hyperandrogenism, in whom combined oral contraceptives and antiandrogens are ineffective. Insulin-lowering drugs are not recommended to treat hirsutism. Are amphetamines safe and effective in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Amphetamines provide a clinician-rated 30% or greater reduction in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms when compared with placebo, according to one Cochrane review.

Adverse effects leading to withdrawal included anxiety, depressed mood, nausea/vomiting, headache, fatigue, insomnia, increased blood pressure, flushing, and affective dullness. Most reported adverse effects are considered mild to moderate. They found no correlation between coronavirus disease 2019 severity and amount of shedding; however, patients with more severe disease shed for longer durations. The virus can be detected for up to one week after the resolution of symptoms, although they mention a single case of persistent shedding for 49 days. The report describes issues related to the accuracy of various tests and which viral antigen is used for antibody response. Their best "guesses" are that IgM can be detected a median of five days after onset of symptoms and IgG can be detected 10 to 18 days after symptom onset. How should hand-foot-and-mouth disease be diagnosed and treated.

The diagnosis of hand-foot-and-mouth disease should be based on presentation of a maculopapular or papulovesicular rash on the hands and soles of the feet and painful oral ulcerations. Supportive care should be used to treat hand-foot-and-mouth disease. Weight-based acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be used to treat fever and pain, but oral lidocaine is not recommended. Handwashing decreases the risk of transmission.

Treating the inflammation by combining antimicrobial therapy with either a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (ibuprofen 400 mg 4 times daily (qid) for 5 days) or systemic corticosteroids significantly hastens clinical improvement compared with antimicrobial therapy alone; in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 108 adult nondiabetic patients, an 8-day course of oral corticosteroids with antimicrobial therapy led to a significantly more rapid clinical resolution of cellulitis, and long-term follow-up showed no difference in relapse or recurrence.

Question 3: Which of the following statements regarding the management of this condition is true?
A. This condition responds well to antiviral therapies.
B. A gluten-free diet helps manage disease severity.
C. Antiseptic solutions and topical antibiotics may exacerbate the symptoms of this condition.
D. Retinoids, corticosteroids, keratolytics, and vitamin D3 derivatives are potential treatment options.
E. Surgical intervention and laser treatments do not have any role in managing the lesions.

Answers:
A. This condition responds well to antiviral therapies – Incorrect. There is no evidence of a viral infection being present. Reported cases with similar presentations have been misdiagnosed as recalcitrant, recurrent herpes zoster, and subsequently mistreated.
B. A gluten-free diet helps manage disease severity – Incorrect. Specific foods or diets are not known to affect the disease's course.
C. Antiseptic solutions and topical antibiotics may exacerbate the symptoms of this condition – Incorrect. These agents are effective in reducing secondary bacterial colonization.
D. Retinoids, corticosteroids, keratolytics, and vitamin D3 derivatives are potential treatment options – Correct. Different treatment options for Darier disease include retinoids (topical and systemic), topical steroids, topical keratolytics, calcineurin inhibitors, and vitamin D3 derivatives.
E. Surgical intervention and laser treatments do not have any role in managing the lesions – Incorrect. Surgical treatment may be used in cases of persistent, localized Darier disease resistant to conventional therapies. Laser ablation is a promising alternative treatment for this disease.

### Workshop on use of intravenous immunoglobulin in hand, foot and mouth disease in southeast Asia [^b8011004]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Use of Normal IVIg

Normal or polyclonal (as opposed to hyperimmune) IVIg is used for 3 purposes in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases:

Supplementation therapy for immunocompromised patients with agammaglobulinaemia, severe combined or common variable immune disorders.
Passive immunization after measles or hepatitis A or B exposure
As a panacea to treat infectious diseases for which there are no or insufficient antimicrobial drugs available. With the exceptions of Kawasaki disease, which is thought to be an infectious disease; Guillain-Barré syndrome, which is a postinfectious complication of an infectious disease; and some toxin-mediated infectious syndromes, little evidence exists for the benefit of IVIg treatment in infectious disease. This treatment method is used primarily when treatment alternatives are lacking.

IVIg use for HFMD started during large epidemics in which young children were dying and no antimicrobial drugs were available. Historic evidence for benefit of IVIg in enteroviral illnesses came from its use in infants with agammaglobulinemia and children with chronic enteroviral meningitis. In these cases, the drug was given as supplementation therapy and to suppress viral replication through neutralization by enteroviral antibodies. Patients often relapsed, however, when treatment was stopped and needed several courses of IVIg, intrathecal infusion, or chronic treatment. Some in vitro benefit (higher neutralizing titers, lower viral loads) was observed in neonates with enteroviral sepsis, but no differences in outcome were found

In vitro data from HFMD patients showing a decrease of chemokine and cytokine titers and suggesting an immunomodulatory effect of IVIg are limited. IVIg may have a direct antiviral effect through neutralizing activity of enteroviral antibodies. However, many patients already produce anti-enteroviral IgM at the start of illness, and a lack of neutralizing antibodies is not expected to be the cause of the severe phenotype of disease that will develop in only a small proportion of children.

### Workshop on use of intravenous immunoglobulin in hand, foot and mouth disease in southeast Asia [^f8cdb4d8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Sample Size Justification

The exact proportions of patients receiving IVIg and not receiving IVIg who progress to a more severe stage of disease is not known. Sample size calculations used detailed data from > 10,000 patients (including severity grade at admission, highest severity grade during hospitalization, and IVIg timing) collected at Children's Hospital 2, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, during April 2011–December 2012. The estimated rate of progression to more severe disease of children eligible to receive IVIg treatment was 17%–36% in Vietnam.

Because establishing efficacy of IVIg is the primary research aim, a 1:1 randomized superiority trial would be the design of choice. However, because there are countries where IVIg is standard of care, establishing noninferiority of placebo might also be desirable. Sample size requirements for both scenarios with different absolute risk increases are displayed in Tables 1 and 2. We assumed that 17% was the most realistic estimate of progression in the IVIg group because this was the estimate obtained after excluding patients who received IVIg at a time when they had already reached a more severe stage of disease, similar to our exclusion criteria/primary clinical endpoint. (That is, we assumed illness in these children progressed too quickly to receive IVIg timely, so they would also meet exclusion criteria before being enrolled into the proposed trial.) The required total sample sizes for demonstrating superiority of IVIg (assuming the percentage with IVIg progression is 17% and ensuring ability to show the difference with placebo if the progression rate is 5% higher on placebo) at the 2-sided 5% significance level would be 1,970 or 2,636 participants for a desired power of 80% or 90%, respectively. A sample size of 2,636 would also have 80% power to detect an increase in the risk of progression from 17% to 23%, 24%, and 27% for subgroups of 60%, 40%, and 20% of the total population, respectively (e.g. age groups, PCR-confirmed EV71, or individual sites)

### Dupilumab (Dupixent) [^cdab91e7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Atopic Dermatitis

The safety and effectiveness of DUPIXENT have been established in pediatric patients 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe AD, whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable.

Use of DUPIXENT in this age group is supported by data from the following clinical trials:

AD-1526 which included 251 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe AD. Of the 251 subjects, 82 were treated with DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W (< 60 kg) or 300 mg Q2W (≥ 60 kg) and 85 were treated with matching placebo
AD-1652 which included 367 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age with severe AD. Of the 367 subjects, 120 were treated with DUPIXENT 300 mg Q4W + TCS (15 to < 30 kg) or 200 mg Q2W + TCS (≥ 30 kg) and 123 were treated with matching placebo + TCS
AD-1539 which included 162 pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD. Of the 162 subjects, 83 were treated with DUPIXENT 200 mg Q4W + TCS (5 to < 15 kg) or 300 mg Q4W + TCS (15 to < 30 kg) and 79 subjects were assigned to be treated with matching placebo + TCS
AD-1434, an open-label extension study that enrolled 275 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older treated with DUPIXENT ± TCS, 368 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age treated with DUPIXENT ± TCS, and 180 pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age treated with DUPIXENT ± TCS
Liberty-AD-HAFT which included 27 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with atopic dermatitis with moderate-to-severe hand and/or foot involvement treated with DUPIXENT (N = 14) or matching placebo (N = 13)

The safety and effectiveness were generally consistent between pediatric and adult patients. In addition, hand-foot-and-mouth disease was reported in 9 (5%) pediatric subjects and skin papilloma was reported in 4 (2%) pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age treated with DUPIXENT ± TCS in AD-1434. These cases did not lead to study drug discontinuation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Safety and effectiveness of DUPIXENT have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 months of age with AD.

Management and Follow-Up

Patients with meningoencephalitis or rhomboencephalitis and substantial somnolence or incipient bulbar clinical signs received intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) (400 mg/kg 1×/d for 5 d). Patients with signs of bulbar or medullary involvement or with lesions suggestive of rhomboencephalitis seen on MR images received methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg 1×/d for 3–5 d) and fluoxetine (0.3 mg/kg 1×/d for 14 d). Each patient underwent a follow-up examination at 1 and 3 months after hospital admission. To stratify the severity of illness, we used the World Health Organization (WHO) Guide to Clinical Management and Public Health Response for Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease. The 6 clinical conditions classified by WHO are aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, brainstem encephalitis (rhomboencephalitis), encephalomyelitis, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and cardiopulmonary failure.

Statistical Analyses

We report descriptive statistics in terms of absolute frequencies and percentages. For data comparisons of categorical variables, we used Pearson χ² or Fisher exact tests when appropriate. We describe continuous nonnormal distributed variables as median values and interquartile ranges (IQRs) and compared them by using the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 22.0 software. We considered p < 0.05 as statistically significant.

### Clinicopathologic analysis of atypical hand, foot, and mouth disease in adult patients [^35e4c67b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a contagious viral infection usually affecting children. A resurgence of cases in adults, mainly caused by coxsackievirus A6 and with an atypical and more severe presentation, has taken place.

Objective

The goal was to examine the clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical features of this disease in adults.

Methods

This is a retrospective study on documented cases of adult hand, foot, and mouth disease from France's Dermatology Department of Strasbourg University Hospital and Bel-Air Hospital in Thionville.

Results

Six patients with severe and atypical presentation were included, 4 caused by coxsackievirus A6. The histologic features were: spongiosis, neutrophilic exocytosis, massive keratinocyte necrosis, shadow cells in the upper epidermis, vacuolization of basal cells, necrotic cells in follicles and sweat glands, dense superficial dermal infiltrate of CD3 + lymphocytes, and strong granulysin expression.

Limitations

This is a retrospective case series.

Conclusion

In adult patients presenting with atypical hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus A6, biopsy specimens show distinctive changes in the epidermis but also in adnexal structures. The inflammatory infiltrate is made of T cells with a cytotoxic profile, with numerous granulysin-positive cells, as observed in severe drug-induced eruption with necrosis of keratinocytes.

### Workshop on use of intravenous immunoglobulin in hand, foot and mouth disease in southeast Asia [^015bbb10]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background of the Workshop

On March 4–5, 2014, in Bangkok, Thailand, the South East Asia Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network (SEAICRN) convened subject matter experts at a workshop to make consensus recommendations for study design of a clinical trial for use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in severe HFMD. During earlier teleconferences, SEAICRN members had discussed the widespread use of IVIg in severe HFMD, as had been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and local ministries of health, despite the lack of evidence for its benefit to patients. Members discussed the need for a study of the efficacy of IVIg to prevent progression of disease severity and safety concerns surrounding use of this treatment and agreed that a randomized, placebo-controlled trial is needed. The following potential hurdles for a multicenter multinational trial were identified:

National and local guidelines for management of severe HFMD use different grading systems and have different indications for various interventions, including IVIg.
Different brands of IVIg are used in the various countries in the region, and there are no parameters of efficacy on which a rational choice could be based because the mechanism of action of IVIg is unknown.
Because IVIg is part of some national guidelines, is considered standard of care, and/or is covered by national health insurance schemes, some countries may not be able to participate in a placebo-controlled trial because it would contravene standard-of-care.

As alternatives, a matched control design or a purely observational study was discussed. The latter potentially could be run as an additional arm to the trial, to allow participation of centers in countries where a trial would not be feasible because of ethical constraints; in this instance, clinical data and samples would be collected using the same platform as a placebo-controlled trial, enabling pooling and simultaneous analysis of data.

Before the workshop, participants were asked to submit (translations of) their national or local guidelines. These were summarized (Technical Appendix), and main similarities and differences were highlighted and discussed during the workshop and follow-up teleconferences. Participants were also asked to submit details regarding the brand and dosage of IVIg used in their country/center. The purpose of the workshop was to discuss these differences and to reach consensus on trial design. The meeting started with short introductions and presentations from the participants about their centers, numbers of cases, management guidelines, and IVIg indications and use in their centers and in each country generally.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^1178db9b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common, serious, painful complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory properties, and might be beneficial. This is an update of a review first published in 2008, and previously updated in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Methods

We updated the searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registers (June 2022). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials, contacted authors, and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs involving corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes for people of all ages, with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset, compared with no treatment or placebo, but not with other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified potential articles, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of each trial, and the certainty of the evidence. Disagreement was resolved by discussion among the co-authors. We followed standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We identified five trials with a total of 787 participants that met our inclusion criteria. No new studies were identified for this update. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group studies. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of corticosteroids given orally during an acute herpes zoster infection in preventing postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of herpes (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.99; 2 trials, 114 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision)). The three other trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria were not included in the meta-analysis because they did not provide separate information on the number of participants with PHN at six months. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported in all five included trials. There were no observed differences in serious (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.29; 5 trials, 755 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision)), or non-serious adverse events (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.87; 5 trials, 755 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and serious imprecision)) between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. One of these trials was at high risk of bias because of incomplete outcome data, two were at unclear risk of bias, and the other was at low risk of bias. The review was first published in 2008; no new RCTs were identified for inclusion in subsequent updates in 2010, 2013, and 2023.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the current available evidence, we are uncertain about the effects of corticosteroids given orally during an acute herpes zoster infection on preventing postherpetic neuralgia. Corticosteroids given orally or intramuscularly may result in little to no difference in the risk of adverse events in people with acute herpes zoster. Some researchers have recommended using corticosteroids to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of the disease. If further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life, as well as updated measures of pain.

Gender dysphoria/gender incongruence — pubertal suppression timing and reversibility: We therefore advise starting suppression in early puberty to prevent the irreversible development of undesirable secondary sex characteristics, and Thus, Tanner stage 2 is the optimal time to start pubertal suppression. Early puberty suppression will limit the growth of the penis and scrotum with a potential effect on future surgical treatments; suppression can also be used in later pubertal stages to stop menses in transgender males and prevent facial hair growth in transgender females, but physical sex characteristics such as more advanced breast development in transgender boys and lowering of the voice and outgrowth of the jaw and brow in transgender girls are not reversible. Clinicians can use pubertal LH and sex steroid levels to confirm sufficient progression before starting suppression, noting that reference ranges for sex steroids by Tanner stage may vary depending on the assay used and that ultrasensitive sex steroid and gonadotropin assays will help clinicians document early pubertal changes. Irreversible and, for GD/gender-incongruent adolescents, undesirable characteristics listed include female breasts and female body habitus (and in some cases relative short stature) and, in male puberty, a prominent Adam's apple, low voice, male bone configuration such as a large jaw, big feet and hands, tall stature, and male hair pattern on the face and extremities.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^7fb7808b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia is a common, serious painful complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and might be beneficial. This is an update of a review first published in 2008 and previously updated in 2010.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Methods

We updated the searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (16 April 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2012), LILACS (January 1982 to April 2012), and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (1978 to 2012). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials, contacted authors and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs involving corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes for people of all ages with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset, compared with no treatment or placebo but not with other treatments. We did not include quasi-RCTs (trials in which a systematic method of randomisation such as alternation or hospital number was used).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors identified potential articles, extracted data, and independently assessed the risk of bias of each trial. Disagreement was resolved by discussion among the co-authors.

Main Results

Five trials were included with 787 participants in total. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of two trials (114 participants) and the results gave moderate quality evidence that oral corticosteroids did not prevent postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of herpes (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.99). One of these trials was at high risk of bias because of incomplete outcome data, the other was at low risk of bias overall. The three other trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria were not included in the meta-analysis because the outcomes were reported at less than one month or not in sufficient detail to add to the meta-analysis. These three trials were generally at low risk of bias. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported in all five included trials. There were no significant differences in serious or non-serious adverse events between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. There was also no significant difference between the treatment groups and placebo groups in other secondary outcome analyses and subgroup analyses. The review was first published in 2008 and no new RCTs were identified for inclusion in subsequent updates in 2010 and 2012.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate quality evidence that corticosteroids given acutely during zoster infection are ineffective in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. In people with acute herpes zoster the risks of administration of corticosteroids do not appear to be greater than with placebo, based on moderate quality evidence. Corticosteroids have been recommended to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of disease. If further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life.

### A double blind, randomised placebo controlled trial of topical 2% viscous lidocaine in improving oral intake in children with painful infectious mouth conditions [^f444e5f5]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Painful infectious mouth conditions are a common presentation to paediatric emergency departments. These are usually viral conditions such as gingivostomatitis (herpetic and non herpetic), ulcerative pharyngitis, herpangina and hand foot and mouth disease. Most of the paediatric literature concerns primary herpetic gingivostomatitis (PHGS) caused by infection with the herpes simplex virus. Although self limiting, there is considerable morbidity from decreased oral intake. Amir et al found that 89% of patients with PHGS drank less than normal. The oral lesions can persist for 7 to 18 days with the risk of dehydration. The presence of extra-oral lesions in addition to intra-oral lesions is highly indicative of PHGS, and may be used to differentiate PHGS from other ulcerative mouth conditions of children: mainly herpangina and hand foot and mouth disease (both caused by the coxsackie virus). In herpangina, lesions are typically seen on the posterior portion of the oral cavity and palate, with an absence of extra-oral lesions. Hand foot and mouth disease typically has both intra-oral and extra-oral lesions and the distribution of characteristic lesions on the hands and feet distinguishes it from PHGS. These findings are particularly valuable as the majority of PHGS cases are diagnosed on clinical findings alone. Treatment for such conditions is generally symptomatic and therefore a precise diagnosis is not critical as such.

### Increase of a wide range of bioactive substances in an active phase of neuro-sweet disease [^ba524b4f]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 55-year-old Japanese man presented with a painful ulcer of the tongue 3 weeks before admission. His past illness and family history were unremarkable. His left eye was congested due to dendritic keratitis, which improved with a topical steroid. He showed no findings of uveitis. One week before his admission, furred tongue and glossalgia developed, and he had difficulty eating. He took an antifungal agent due to a suspicion of candida stomatitis, but the medication had no effect. Two days before admission, he developed a fever of 38°C and painful skin rashes on his trunk and limbs, which did not respond to antimicrobials. He had joint pain in his elbow and shoulder.

He visited an emergency room because eating and drinking were difficult for him due to high fever and mouth pain. He was hospitalised with a suspicion of viral infection such as hand-foot-and-mouth disease and received fluid replacement and treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; however, he showed no improvement, and at 1 week after admission, he developed drowsiness. The next day, his consciousness disturbance has progressed, and he was unable to speak. His body temperature rose to 39.4°C, and his Glasgow Coma Scale Score was E1V2M4. Many oral ulcers and glossitis were observed. He had soft lymph node swelling (1 cm diameter) in his neck. Elevated erythematous plaques with crusts were present on his left forearm (figure 1), on the back of his left hand, and on his right toe. Mild paresis was observed in his left upper and lower limbs; there were no pathological reflexes. Acyclovir was started at 1800 mg/day empirically with a suspicion of herpes encephalitis, but there was no response to acyclovir.

BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This trial is a single-center, single-arm, phase 2 study. This protocol was reviewed and approved by the certified Clinical Research Review Board of the University of Tokyo (approval number: 2021512SP). This clinical trial was conducted in compliance with the Clinical Trials Act in Japan and registered in the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCT) as jRCTs031220002.

In contrast, the exclusion criteria are: (i) bacterial/fungal/spirochete/virus skin infections, (ii) eczema otitis externa with perforations in the eardrum, (iii) ulcers (excluding Behçet's disease), second-degree or deeper burns/frostbite, (iv) other skin disease, and (v) a history of hypersensitivity to local hydrocortisone.

Adjuvant chemotherapy

Adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin comprise a 2-h intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin (130 mg/m²) on day 1 and oral administration of capecitabine (1000 mg/m², twice daily) from the evening of day 1 to the morning of day 15, repeat every 3 weeks (21 days) for eight or four cycles according to the physician's discretion and patient's consent. Dose interruption, delay, reduction, and discontinuation are allowed, if necessary, at the attending physician's discretion. In principle, capecitabine dose can be reduced by 20% up to 2 levels. In a previous study, the control group was administered celecoxib as the study drug, and the number of cycles to the development of grade 1 and 2 HFS was 4.336. In addition, the cumulative dose of capecitabine, which causes grade 1 or higher HFS in more than 80% of patients, is 100,000 mg/m². Therefore, the minimum cumulative dosage of capecitabine in the present study, considering the dose reduction of the drug, should, in principle, be 100,000 mg/m² to complete 4 cycles or more.

### Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of enterovirus 71 [^e0a31dcb]. The Lancet: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Although poliomyelitis has been mostly eradicated worldwide, large outbreaks of the related enterovirus 71 have been seen in Asia-Pacific countries in the past 10 years. This virus mostly affects children, manifesting as hand, foot, and mouth disease, aseptic meningitis, poliomyelitis-like acute flaccid paralysis, brainstem encephalitis, and other severe systemic disorders, including especially pulmonary oedema and cardiorespiratory collapse. Clinical predictors of severe disease include high temperature and lethargy, and lumbar puncture might reveal pleocytosis. Many diagnostic tests are available, but PCR of throat swabs and vesicle fluid, if available, is among the most efficient. Features of inflammation, particularly in the anterior horns of the spinal cord, the dorsal pons, and the medulla can be clearly seen on MRI. No established antiviral treatment is available. Intravenous immunoglobulin seems to be beneficial in severe disease, perhaps through non-specific anti-inflammatory mechanisms, but has not been tested in any formal trials. Milrinone might be helpful in patients with cardiac dysfunction.

### Workshop on use of intravenous immunoglobulin in hand, foot and mouth disease in southeast Asia [^c37fffe2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The advised total dosage of IVIg for most indications is 2 g/kg body weight. For HFMD, IVIg is usually given in 2 doses of 1 g/kg (total dosage 2 g/kg). The first dose is instilled over 8–12 hours; a second dose is given 24 hours after the start of the first dose, at the discretion of the treating physician. A similar dosing schedule would be used for the proposed clinical trial. Some doctors give higher doses, such as 3 or 4 doses of 1 g/kg); others have reported that a lower dose, such 0.5 or 1 g/kg, has shown effectiveness.

Over the past few years, 14 different preparations of IVIg from companies in Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America had been or were being used in the different centers reporting for the workshop. The attendees agreed that 1 brand of IVIg, produced in large batches of stable quality, would need to be used across all participating centers during the entire proposed trial. This preparation would need to be collected, purified, and checked for pathogens according to international safety guidelines. Although the mechanism of action of IVIg in HFMD is unknown, EV71 titers should be checked to ensure antiviral activity.

### A case report of a teenager with severe hand, foot, and mouth disease with brainstem encephalitis caused by enterovirus 71 [^4b8b171c]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

HFMD occurs mostly in children under the age of 5 years. However, adult cases of HFMD caused by CVA16 virus have been reported at the age of 21, 35, and 37 years.

Severe and critically-ill patients with HFMD caused by EV71 are mostly under the age of 3 years, and are rarely seen in children above the age of 14 years. The patient in this report was 16 years and 8 months old, with a definite history of exposure to HFMD, and exhibited severe symptoms of HFMD. The median duration from onset to diagnosis of HFMD in China has been reported to be 1.5–3.5 days, while median duration from onset to death has been reported to be 3.5 days or 0.5 days after diagnosis of HFMD. In the present report, the patient was diagnosed with HFMD on the fourth day of onset, and developed neurological manifestations on the third day of onset, which is consistent with the progression of HFMD in children in the age-group of 1–3 years.

World Health Organization as well as HFMD epidemic countries have developed guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HFMD, including the staging and classification of HFMD. Different treatments are employed for respective phases of HFMD. According to the above guidelines, in this case, gamma immunoglobulin therapy that was initiated immediately after the onset of severe neurological complications, combined with other treatments, resulted in the rapid improvement of the manifestations. Milrinone is a type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor with both inotropic and vasodilator effects. It was shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe HFMD with cardiopulmonary collapse in a small randomised controlled open-label trial. We also found that in the treatment of severe HFMD, milrinone in combination with hydrochloride esmolol helps reduce the heart rate and maintain cardiopulmonary function.

This case illustrates that EV71 infection may cause HFMD accompanied by severe neurological manifestations in teenagers. The course of the disease and the associated complications in teenagers are similar to those in infants and children. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of HFMD occurring in adults and teenagers, as prompt treatment could be invaluable in reducing complications and saving lives.

### Morbilliform eruptions: differentiating low-risk drug eruptions, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, viral eruptions, and acute graft-versus-host disease [^53572d46]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Differentiating Viral Eruptions

Viral morbilliform eruptions, which include eruptions secondary to measles; rubella; hand, foot, and mouth disease; exanthema subitum; scarlet fever; and infectious mononucleosis, are historically the most frequently observed diseases that should be differentiated from drug-induced morbilliform eruptions. While usually low-risk in nature, most viral eruptions tend to mimic the high-risk morbilliform morphologies. Many location and morphologic clues, such as oral involvement, are similar between high-risk eruptions and viral disease. The most important aspect is recognizing the overlap and, if clinical features of high-risk morbilliform eruptions are identified, then using laboratory and drug-history information to identify the etiology. Typically in this setting, if a patient is on a high-risk drug with recent onset, we do not evaluate further for viral eruptions. Conversely, if a patient is showing high-risk features without supportive drug history, then we consider the potential benefits of viral testing with the patient.

Outbreaks of EV71 in Asia

Currently, EV71-associated HFMD is endemic in large parts of Southeast Asia. Large outbreaks have occurred in Taiwan in 1998 (≈1,500,000 cases and 78 deaths); in China in 2008 and 2009 (490,000 and 1,150,000 cases and 127 and 353 deaths, respectively); in Vietnam in 2011–2012 (260,000 cases and 211 deaths); and in Cambodia in 2012 (unknown total number of cases and > 54 deaths). In the Taiwan outbreak, EV71 was isolated in 49% of patients with uncomplicated infection, in 75% of hospitalized patients, and in 92% of the 78 patients who died; this evidence suggests that EV71 is strongly associated with severe illness and death. A 2–3-year EV71 outbreak pattern has been described in Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, and provinces of China, with seasons of less severe HFMD caused by the other enterovirus A types between the EV71 peak years. This pattern is assumed to relate to the presence of birth cohorts of children who have not been exposed to the virus of a size that is large enough to sustain human-to-human transmission. Coxsackievirus A6 and A10 have been dominant in the region recently.

Bell palsy — recommendations for future research: It is unlikely that additional research regarding the efficacy of steroids will change the current estimate of its effect, and large randomized trials comparing outcomes in patients with Bell palsy receiving steroids with or without antivirals would help in determining whether the addition of antivirals to steroid treatment results in a modest benefit. Such trials should be powered to allow pre-specified subgroup analyses, and further research efforts should be directed toward determining the optimal dose and timing of steroids, the effect of other therapeutic modalities, and the identification of the effect of steroids in specific populations, such as in children.

What are the possible side effects of ALVESCO?

ALVESCO may cause serious side effects, including:

Thrush (Candida), a fungal infection of your nose, mouth, or throat. Tell your healthcare provider if you have discomfort or pain in your throat, have hoarseness in your voice or have any redness or white colored patches in your mouth or throat. Rinse your mouth after you use your ALVESCO.
Immune system problems that may increase your risk of infections. You are more likely to get infections if you take medicines that may weaken your body's ability to fight infections. Avoid contact with people who have contagious diseases such as chicken pox or measles while you use ALVESCO. Symptoms of an infection may include:
fever
pain
aches
chills
feeling tired
nausea
vomiting
Adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not make enough steroid hormones. Your healthcare provider will follow you closely if you take steroids by mouth and are having them decreased (tapered) or you are being switched to ALVESCO. People have died while steroids are being decreased and when people have been switched from steroids by mouth to inhaled steroids like ALVESCO. If you are under stress, such as with surgery, after surgery or trauma, you may need steroids by mouth again.

### Can short courses of systemic corticosteroids truly cause osteonecrosis? [^55b665e5]. Dermatologic Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

One of the most feared complications of long-term corticosteroid therapy is osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis, aseptic necrosis). There is, no doubt, a causal role for systemic corticosteroids inducing osteonecrosis with such chronic therapy. The controversy involves whether short-term (< 1 month) courses of systemic corticosteroids can truly induce osteonecrosis. This article presents both the biologic basis and statistical support for why such short-term courses of systemic corticosteroids rarely, if ever, truly induce osteonecrosis. Data from two very large populations (renal transplantation and systemic lupus erythematosus) with overall increased risk for osteonecrosis are carefully examined in view of the aforementioned controversy.
