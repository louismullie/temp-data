## Question

BUN high

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret and manage an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and verifying units and conversion. Then, I should classify the severity and immediately consider life-threatening indications for urgent action. Next, I will evaluate prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal etiologies, including the BUN/creatinine ratio and urine output. After that, I should assess non-renal drivers of BUN elevation. Then, I will integrate prognostic implications and decide on monitoring cadence. Finally, I will outline management principles, including when to consider renal replacement therapy, and close with special populations and a concise synthesis plan.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and verify units, because BUN can be reported in mg/dL or mmol/L and misinterpretation is common. I should double-check the lab report and, if needed, convert using 1 mmol/L BUN ≈ 2.8 mg/dL, so a reported BUN of 40 mmol/L equals about 112 mg/dL, which is markedly elevated and warrants urgent attention, whereas 40 mg/dL is also high but not as extreme, and I need to ensure I'm not mixing these up before proceeding [^7dc92ed1].

> Next, I should review severity thresholds and immediately screen for life-threatening indications. Mild elevation is often 20–40 mg/dL, moderate 40–60 mg/dL, and severe greater than 60 mg/dL. However, I must not anchor on a number alone, because isolated BUN elevation is not itself an indication for dialysis, and I should prioritize emergent indications such as severe hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema from volume overload, or uremic encephalopathy, which mandate urgent renal replacement therapy regardless of the exact BUN value [^3d3715ba] [^370eb991].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I will now examine prerenal causes first, since they are common and often reversible. A BUN/creatinine ratio greater than 20:1 in the right clinical context suggests increased proximal tubular urea reabsorption from hypovolemia, heart failure, cirrhosis, or NSAID use, but I should confirm this against urine output, orthostatics, and volume status, and remember that in critically ill patients a high BUN/creatinine ratio may reflect severity and catabolism rather than a benign prerenal state, so I need to be cautious in the ICU setting [^58b6939a] [^9d84d581].

> I will now examine intrinsic renal causes. Acute kidney injury from ischemia, nephrotoxins, or glomerulonephritis typically shows a BUN/creatinine ratio around 10–20:1, and I should correlate with urine sediment, urine output, and trends in creatinine. Wait, let me verify that I'm not overinterpreting a single BUN value; serial measurements and the clinical trajectory matter more than a snapshot, and I should also consider that BUN itself can track CKD progression risk independent of eGFR, which strengthens its prognostic value in chronic disease contexts [^0b27be66] [^a737c7c2].

> Next, I should review postrenal obstruction. I need to check for oliguria or anuria, flank pain, and a rising creatinine, and I should obtain renal ultrasound promptly if obstruction is suspected, because relieving obstruction can rapidly improve BUN and kidney function. But wait, what if the patient is already anuric and the BUN is extremely high? That strengthens the case for urgent decompression rather than waiting for further labs [^notfound].

> Let me consider non-renal drivers of BUN elevation, because missing these leads to misattribution. Gastrointestinal bleeding, high protein intake or TPN, catabolic states such as sepsis or trauma, and corticosteroids can all raise BUN independent of GFR, and in cirrhosis the urea cycle is impaired, so BUN may be disproportionately low relative to ammonia, which can mask severity if I don't think about the ammonia-to-urea ratio and overall nitrogen handling [^c9530191] [^0b27be66].

> I should double-check prognostic implications now, because BUN carries independent risk signals beyond creatinine. In acute coronary syndromes, BUN above 25 mg/dL is associated with a stepwise increase in mortality even when kidney function is preserved, in acute decompensated heart failure, BUN above 40 mg/dL predicts higher 60-day mortality, and in the ICU, BUN above 40 mg/dL independently predicts short- and long-term mortality even when creatinine is "normal", so I need to communicate these risks and escalate monitoring accordingly [^89e2d710] [^a430f737] [^40f63683].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and what to trend. I need to ensure frequent BUN and creatinine checks in AKI, at least every 24–48 hours initially, alongside strict urine output monitoring, electrolytes, and acid–base status, and I should track the BUN/creatinine ratio dynamically because a falling ratio with improving urine output supports prerenal recovery, whereas a persistently high ratio with oliguria suggests ongoing hypoperfusion or evolving intrinsic injury [^03899f8c].

> Now, I will outline management principles, starting with prerenal optimization. Isotonic crystalloid resuscitation guided by hemodynamics and dynamic markers, withdrawal of nephrotoxins, and correction of volume status are foundational, and in heart failure I should treat congestion while preserving perfusion, recognizing that BUN may paradoxically rise early with aggressive diuresis due to intrarenal hemodynamics before improving as euvolemia is achieved [^03899f8c].

> For intrinsic AKI, I need to ensure supportive care with close electrolyte and acid–base management, avoidance of further nephrotoxins, and early nutrition to mitigate catabolism, and I should reassess frequently for indications to start renal replacement therapy rather than relying on a BUN threshold alone, because timing should be driven by life-threatening indications and the broader clinical context rather than a single number [^3d3715ba] [^370eb991].

> But wait, what if the BUN is extremely high, for example above 100 mg/dL, and the patient is otherwise stable? I should confirm that isolated BUN elevation is not itself an indication for dialysis, and I should avoid premature RRT that exposes patients to procedural risks without proven benefit, reserving RRT for standard indications such as refractory hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, pulmonary edema, or uremic complications, while continuing close observation and addressing reversible drivers [^3d3715ba] [^370eb991].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and contexts. In cirrhosis, I should interpret BUN cautiously and pair it with ammonia and clinical status because urea synthesis is impaired, in pregnancy with AKI I should maintain a lower threshold for RRT and consider obstetric collaboration, in pediatrics BUN is a validated predictor of severe acute pancreatitis and should inform escalation, and in COVID-19, elevated BUN tracks with severity and AKI risk, so I should monitor closely and anticipate complications [^c9530191] [^b491fa24] [^20d8ffcf] [^6e16df46].

> Let me reconsider the BUN/creatinine ratio one more time, because overreliance on a single cutoff can mislead. While a ratio above 20:1 can suggest prerenal physiology, it performs poorly as a standalone diagnostic test in mixed ICU and ED populations, so I should integrate it with urine output, volume assessment, and response to fluids rather than using it in isolation to classify AKI [^9d84d581] [^0c152410].

> In summary, I should confirm the BUN value and units, classify severity but prioritize life-threatening indications, differentiate prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal causes with the BUN/creatinine ratio and urine output, account for non-renal BUN drivers, communicate prognostic risk, monitor trends closely, and manage with volume optimization, nephrotoxin withdrawal, and timely RRT for standard indications, remembering that BUN is a powerful prognostic marker but a poor sole trigger for dialysis decisions [^3d3715ba] [^370eb991].

A high BUN reflects **reduced GFR** or **increased urea production** from protein catabolism, GI bleeding, or high protein intake. Prerenal causes (hypovolemia, heart failure, NSAIDs) are most common, with intrinsic renal disease and postrenal obstruction as differentials. Evaluate with **history, exam, urine output, and labs** (creatinine, electrolytes, urinalysis, BUN/Cr ratio), and treat by correcting volume, stopping nephrotoxins, and relieving obstruction. BUN > 60 mg/dL signals severe disease and higher mortality; **trend BUN and creatinine** to guide management and dialysis decisions [^03899f8c] [^3d3715ba].

---

## Physiological basis of BUN elevation

BUN is a **marker of renal function** and protein metabolism; elevated levels reflect reduced clearance or increased production [^01abbccb]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR)**: Impaired renal clearance increases BUN [^0b27be66].
- **Increased protein catabolism**: Sepsis, trauma, GI bleeding, or high protein intake raise urea production [^0c152410].
- **Enhanced tubular reabsorption**: Hypovolemia or heart failure increases urea reabsorption, raising BUN disproportionately to creatinine [^defc8266].

---

## Common causes of elevated BUN

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Prerenal | - Hypovolemia <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - ACE inhibitors <br/> - Hepatorenal syndrome [^notfound] |
| Intrinsic renal | - Acute tubular necrosis <br/> - Glomerulonephritis <br/> - Interstitial nephritis <br/> - Chronic kidney disease [^notfound] |
| Postrenal | - Urinary obstruction <br/> - Prostatic hypertrophy <br/> - Tumors <br/> - Stones [^notfound] |
| Increased protein catabolism | - Sepsis <br/> - Trauma <br/> - GI bleeding <br/> - High protein intake [^0c152410] |

## Clinical significance of elevated BUN

Elevated BUN is a **marker of disease severity** and prognosis:

- **Severity marker**: BUN > 60 mg/dL indicates severe renal dysfunction or systemic illness [^notfound].
- **Prognostic value**: Higher BUN independently predicts mortality in heart failure, critical illness, and AKI [^a430f737] [^40f63683] [^5c39e949].
- **Guide to therapy**: BUN helps decide on dialysis initiation and monitoring response [^3d3715ba].

---

## Diagnostic approach to elevated BUN

A structured approach is essential:

- **Confirm elevation**: Repeat BUN to exclude lab error; assess trend [^03899f8c].
- **History and exam**: Evaluate volume status, heart failure, GI bleeding, medications, and obstruction [^03899f8c].
- **Laboratory tests**: Creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes, urinalysis, and BUN/creatinine ratio [^03899f8c].
- **Imaging**: Renal ultrasound for obstruction if indicated [^03899f8c].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Prerenal azotemia**: Volume repletion, stop NSAIDs/ACE inhibitors, treat heart failure [^notfound].
- **Intrinsic renal disease**: Remove nephrotoxins, treat underlying cause, consider dialysis if indicated [^3d3715ba].
- **Postrenal obstruction**: Relieve obstruction (catheter, stent, surgery) [^notfound].
- **Increased protein catabolism**: Treat sepsis, control bleeding, adjust protein intake [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic implications

BUN has **strong prognostic value** across settings:

- **Heart failure**: Elevated BUN predicts higher mortality and readmission [^a430f737] [^b9d807b4].
- **Critical illness**: BUN > 40 mg/dL independently predicts mortality [^40f63683].
- **AKI**: Higher BUN at RRT initiation associates with worse outcomes [^5c39e949].

---

## Limitations of BUN as a marker

BUN is **nonspecific** and influenced by non-renal factors (diet, catabolism, volume status), so interpret alongside creatinine, eGFR, and clinical context [^0b27be66].

---

A high BUN reflects **reduced clearance or increased production** of urea; prerenal causes are most common. Evaluate with history, exam, and labs, then treat the cause and monitor trends. BUN is a useful severity and prognostic marker, but interpret in clinical context.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^ef98780c]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

The decision to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) and the optimal timing for commencement is a difficult decision faced by clinicians when treating acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care setting. Without clinically significant ureamic symptoms or emergent indications (electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload) the timing of RRT initiation remains contentious and inconsistent across health providers. Current trends of initiating RRT in the ICU are often based on isolated blood urea levels without clear guidelines demonstrating an upper limit for treatment. Although the appropriate upper limit remains unclear, it is reasonable to conclude that a blood urea level less than 40 mmol/L is not in itself an indication for RRT, especially in the absence of supporting evidence of kidney impairment (anuria, elevated serum creatinine), presenting a welcome reminder to treat the patient and not a number.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^41dc1030]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Without definitive guidelines, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that initiation of RRT in a patient with a urea level less than 40 mmol/L in an otherwise stable clinical context is erroneously exposing them to risks of dialysis without any increased survival benefit. Furthermore, a reasonable argument can be made that even above 40 mmol/L, delaying RRT may be warranted in an otherwise clinically well patient with preserved kidney function.

Correlating clinical symptoms with blood urea levels in the ICU to aid the decision to commence RRT is complicated by many factors that have been identified as contributors to elevated urea levels such as dehydration, increased tubular urea reabsorption, heart failure, glucocorticoid use, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and exogenous protein sources (dietary intake, PEG feeds and colloids). At moderate serum urea levels (21.4 mmol/L) these factors do not appear to elicit ureamic symptoms in isolation from severely impaired kidney function.

Despite reliance on historical data and lack of recent quality evidence, it is plausible that, in the context of established kidney injury, the onset of ureamic symptoms is likely when the blood urea level is greater than 50 mmol/L. However, given the poor correlation with clinical symptoms, the multifactorial nature of AKI and variation in production and excretion, serum urea alone remains a poor indicator of ureamic toxicity, especially in the presence of additional urea-elevating factors, or the absence of other symptomatic or biochemical markers of severe kidney impairment.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^71ce38d4]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Currently there is no well-established upper-limit of serum urea that serves as an indication for initiation of RRT in AKI. Using urea in isolation is difficult and potentially flawed given the variation in base level and production rates amongst different populations as well as it's negligibility as an accurate measure of metabolite toxicity. Furthermore, AKI is a multifactorial condition and it is likely to present earlier with other concerning metabolic or fluid overload abnormalities requiring dialysis rather than isolated elevated blood urea levels. Studies have considered the appropriate timing of initial RRT including early and delayed/late commencement of therapy, with a recent meta-analysis concluding there is no added benefit. Most studies initiated RRT once blood urea level exceeded 40 mmol/L, which is reflected in clinical practice despite evidence to suggest it does not correlate well with onset of uraemic symptoms.

Although the appropriate upper limit remains unclear, it is reasonable to conclude that a blood urea level less than 40 mmol/L is not in itself an indication for RRT therapy, especially in the absence of supporting evidence of kidney impairment (anuria, elevated serum creatinine), presenting a welcome reminder to treat the patient and not a number.

### Serum blood urea nitrogen as an independent marker of subsequent mortality among patients with acute coronary syndromes and normal to mildly reduced glomerular filtration rates [^89e2d710]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

We hypothesized that elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) would be associated with adverse outcomes independent of serum creatinine (sCr)-based estimates of kidney function in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

Background

Although lower glomerular filtration rates (GFR) have prognostic significance among patients with ACS, estimates of GFR based on sCr may perform less accurately among patients with milder kidney dysfunction. In this population in particular, BUN, which can reflect increased proximal tubular reabsorption in addition to decreased GFR, may have independent prognostic value.

Methods

Data were drawn from 9,420 patients with unstable coronary syndromes from Orbofiban in Patients With Unstable Coronary Syndromes-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (OPUS-TIMI)-16, a trial that excluded patients with sCr > 1.6 mg/dl or estimated creatinine clearance < 40 ml/min.

Results

Patients with elevated BUN were older, had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, and had higher heart rates, lower systolic blood pressures, and an abnormal Killip class more often on admission. In univariate analyses, as well as in stratified and multivariable analyses including sCr-based estimates of GFR as a covariate, a stepwise increase in mortality occurred with increasing BUN (multivariable hazard ratio with BUN 20 to 25 mg/dl 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 2.6; with BUN ≥ 25 mg/dl 3.2 [95% confidence interval 2.2 to 4.7]) compared with BUN ≤ 20 mg/dl. A higher BUN was also associated with increased mortality among strata of troponin-I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein concentrations.

Conclusions

Among patients with unstable coronary syndromes and predominantly normal or mildly reduced GFR, an elevated BUN is associated with increased mortality, independent of sCr-based estimates of GFR and other biomarkers.

### Association between the blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio and the risk of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease: a cohort study [^6fa4a19c]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health crisis, affecting more than 10% of the population worldwide and increasing in prevalence. A considerable proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) patients have coexisting CKD, with studies consistently demonstrating a heightened risk of mortality in this population. Therefore, early identification and effective risk stratification of high-risk CKD patients are essential for improving clinical outcomes in ICU settings.

CKD is often accompanied by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and decreased serum albumin, reflecting renal impairment, protein metabolism disturbances, and poor nutritional status. Reduced glomerular filtration leads to BUN accumulation, while damage to the filtration barrier contributes to albumin loss. Limited protein intake, influenced by dietary restrictions, poor appetite, and chronic inflammation, further exacerbate these effects, accelerating albumin breakdown. Previous research has shown a strong association between low serum albumin and increased mortality in CKD patients.

The blood urea nitrogen to albumin ratio (BAR) has been proposed as a novel prognostic marker, with its predictive utility increasingly recognized in various diseases, including coronary artery disease, sepsis, intracerebral hemorrhage, and congestive heart failure. By combining levels of urea nitrogen and albumin, BAR provides a comprehensive reflection of renal function, protein metabolism, and chronic inflammatory status, potentially offering a more holistic risk assessment for ICU patients with CKD. However, there remains a paucity of specific research regarding BAR's utility in predicting 28-day mortality risk among ICU patients with CKD. Thus, this study aims to investigate the association between BAR and 28-day mortality risk in ICU CKD patients, providing a new and simple prognostic tool to optimize the management and treatment strategies for CKD patients in the ICU.

### BIOPRO_J… [^cfcdd299]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2017). Low credibility.

Blood Urea Nitrogen BUN measurements are used in the diagnosis of certain renal and metabolic diseases. The determination of serum urea nitrogen is the most widely used test for the evaluation of kidney function. The test is frequently requested in conjunction with the serum creatinine test for the differential diagnosis of prerenal, renal, and post renal uremia. High BUN levels are associated with impaired renal function, increased protein catabolism, nephritis, intestinal obstruction, urinary obstruction, metallic poisoning, cardiac failure, peritonitis, dehydration, malignancy, pneumonia, surgical shock, Addison's disease, and uremia. Low BUN levels are associated with amyloidosis, acute liver disease, pregnancy, and nephrosis. Normal variations are observed according to a person's age and sex, the time of day, and their diet – particularly in their protein intake. Sodium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.

Total Bilirubin Elevated levels are associated with hemolytic jaundice, paroxysmal hemoglobinuria, pernicious anemia, polycythemia, icterus neonatorum, internal hemorrhage, acute hemolytic anemia, malaria, and septicemia. Low bilirubin levels are associated with aplastic anemia, and certain types of secondary anemia resulting from toxic therapy for carcinoma and chronic nephritis. Total Calcium Calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid disease, bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany. Urinary calcium measurement is used in the. of disappearance of NADH analog is measured at 415 nm, and it is directly proportional to the amount of bicarbonate in the specimen. Blood Urea Nitrogen The method to measure blood urea nitrogen utilizes a coupled enzyme reaction, with measurement of NADH occurring at 340 nm.

### Blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio: a good predictor of in-hospital and 90-day all-cause mortality in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^8d90de5c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Blood urea nitrogen(BUN) is the nitrogen component in urea, the final product of metabolism, which originates from the liver and is excreted by the kidney. Based on previous research findings, and compared with survivors, a higher BUN level was found in those who died in hospital. In this study, our results also showed that the non-survivor group had a higher BUN level than the survivor group during hospitalization. Thus, we suggest that elevated BUN levels reflect the severity of the disease. In addition, BUN was shown to have a predictive effect on the prognosis of the disease. One retrospective cohort study from China performed by Chen et al. found that an elevated BUN level was related to hospital mortality in COPD patients with exacerbations for those who presented at the emergency department. Figure 2 shows that BUN levels could predict hospitalization outcomes of the hospitalized patients with AECOPD (AUC = 0.85, 95% CI 0.77–0.92, P < 0.001). This was similar to previous findings that indicated elevated BUN levels were associated with increased mortality.

### Higher blood urea nitrogen is associated with increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus [^8bbc8523]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Experimental evidence suggests that higher levels of urea may increase insulin resistance and suppress insulin secretion. However, whether higher levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are associated with increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus in humans is not known. To study this, we built a national cohort of 1,337,452 United States Veterans without diabetes to characterize the association of BUN and risk of incident diabetes. Over a median follow-up of 4.93 years, there were 172,913 cases of incident diabetes. In joint risk models of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and BUN. there was no association between eGFR and the risk of incident diabetes in those with a BUN of 25 mg/dl or less. However, the risk was significantly increased in those with a BUN over 25 mg/dl at all eGFR levels, even in those with an eGFR of 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 or more (hazard ratio 1.27; confidence interval 1.24–1.31). The risk of incident diabetes was highest in those with BUN over 25 mg/dL and an eGFR under 15 ml/min/1.73m 2 (1.68; 1.51–1.87). Spline analyses of the relationship between BUN and risk of incident diabetes showed that risk was progressively higher as BUN increased. In models where eGFR was included as a continuous covariate, compared to a BUN of 25 mg/dl or less, a BUN over 25 mg/dl was associated with increased risk of incident diabetes (1.23; 1.21–1.25). Every 10 ml/min/1.73m 2 decrease in eGFR was not associated with risk of incident diabetes (1.00; 1.00–1.01). Two-stage residual inclusion analyses showed that, independent of the impact of eGFR, every 10 mg/dL increase in BUN concentration was associated with increased risk of incident diabetes (1.15; 1.14–1.16). Thus, higher levels of BUN are associated with increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus.

### Emergence of blood urea nitrogen as a biomarker of neurohormonal activation in heart failure [^defc8266]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The nonosmotic release of arginine vasopressin, concurrent with the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, is thought to represent the maladaptive response that is central to the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF). The degree of neurohormonal activation correlates with the severity of the disease and can predict the outcomes. However, quantification of components of neurohormonal axis (e.g., serum arginine vasopressin level) is mainly reserved for research purposes rather than routine practice. The results of several recent HF trials have shed light on the differential role of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine in predicting the outcomes in this setting. These studies suggest that BUN could indeed represent a surrogate marker for "renal response" to neurohormonal activation in this setting, above and beyond its role in the estimation of renal function. In this report, the relevant physiologic mechanisms underlying urea and water transport in the kidney are first reviewed. Then, the activation of the neurohormonal axis and the impact of its components on renal urea transport, independent of changes in renal function, are explained. Finally, the unique role of BUN as a biomarker of neurohormonal activation in the setting of HF is discussed, and the potential clinical implication of this novel concept is emphasized. In conclusion, this review explains the pathophysiologic basis for the emerging role of BUN as a biomarker in HF.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: a prospective observational study [^a737c7c2]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Higher BUN levels were identified as a risk factor for kidney disease progression in patients with moderate to severe CKD, independent of eGFR. Although cSosm levels increased together with BUN levels, they were not independently associated with a poor outcome. Additionally, based on the sensitivity analysis, it is also suggested that BUN levels are associated with adverse renal outcomes, independent of kidney function. Our findings suggest that the measurement of BUN levels may be useful for predicting renal outcomes.

### Urea levels and cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease [^e622ef45]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our analysis of a large prospective cohort of CKD patients not receiving maintenance dialysis attending nephrology outpatient facilities showed that higher serum urea levels were associated with a higher incidence of adverse CV outcomes and a higher all-cause mortality rate. Our findings are in line with the current body of epidemiological evidence on kidney function biomarkers and the risk of CVD, and suggest that urea should be taken into account when seeking to predict and prevent CV disease in patients with CKD.

Several serum biomarkers [such as serum creatinine or urea, or blood urea nitrogen (BUN), which reflects only the nitrogen content of urea], are routinely used in clinical settings to evaluate kidney function. Urea is the main metabolite derived from dietary proteins and tissue protein turnover. The compound is almost exclusively excreted by the kidneys in the urine, after filtration in the glomerulus and a certain degree of reabsorption from the filtrate. Although several nonrenal factors affect the serum urea concentration, reduced urinary elimination of urea (due to CKD) is the main factor that increases serum urea levels. Volume depletion by diuretics or a decrease in the effective circulating volume induced by heart failure might contribute to the elevation of urea levels in our CKD patients. However, the fact that bicarbonate levels were significantly lower in T3 than in T1 (Table 1) tends to rule out volume depletion by diuretics. In contrast, the difference between the tertiles in the prevalence of heart failure suggests that the elevated urea levels could be due (at least in part) to a decrease in the effective circulating volume caused by heart failure.

### Screening with blood urea nitrogen before intravenous contrast [^34747c94]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

In some settings, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values are available well in advance of creatinine values. We wanted to determine whether BUN values can be used to screen for renal insufficiency for the purpose of intravenous contrast administration. From laboratory records, we derived and validated cutpoints for BUN values to detect creatinine values ≥ 2.0 mg/dL. "Sensitive" and "high-yield" cutpoints were derived using records from 5000 consecutive patients and validated using a random set of 2000 patients. BUN ≥ 15 mg/dL, the "sensitive" cutpoint, had sensitivity of 0.997 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.987–1.0) and specificity of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54–0.59). BUN ≥ 20 mg/dL, the "high-yield cutpoint", had sensitivity of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95–0.99) and specificity of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69–0.73). Negative likelihood ratios for these cutpoints were 0.005 and 0.03, respectively. BUN values < 15–20 mg/dL provide strong evidence against renal insufficiency.

### Blood urea nitrogen / creatinine ratio identifies a high-risk but potentially reversible form of renal dysfunction in patients with decompensated heart failure [^54842031]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Identifying reversible renal dysfunction (RD) in the setting of heart failure is challenging. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether elevated admission blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) could identify decompensated heart failure patients likely to experience improvement in renal function (IRF) with treatment.

Methods and Results

Consecutive hospitalizations with a discharge diagnosis of heart failure were reviewed. IRF was defined as ≥ 20% increase and worsening renal function as ≥ 20% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate. IRF occurred in 31% of the 896 patients meeting eligibility criteria. Higher admission BUN/Cr was associated with in-hospital IRF (odds ratio, 1.5 per 10 increase; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–1.8; P < 0.001), an association persisting after adjustment for baseline characteristics (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.8; P = 0.004). However, higher admission BUN/Cr was also associated with post-discharge worsening renal function (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.8; P = 0.011). Notably, in patients with an elevated admission BUN/Cr, the risk of death associated with RD (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45) was substantial (hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6–3.1; P < 0.001). However, in patients with a normal admission BUN/Cr, RD was not associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.67–2.0; P = 0.59; p interaction = 0.03).

Conclusions

An elevated admission BUN/Cr identifies decompensated patients with heart failure likely to experience IRF with treatment, providing proof of concept that reversible RD may be a discernible entity. However, this improvement seems to be largely transient, and RD, in the setting of an elevated BUN/Cr, remains strongly associated with death. Further research is warranted to develop strategies for the optimal detection and treatment of these high-risk patients.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: a prospective observational study [^0b27be66]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urea is the primary metabolite derived from dietary protein and tissue protein turnover. It is freely filtered at the glomerulus but not secreted, and it is reabsorbed by the renal tubules. In addition, as urine flow rates decrease, more urea is reabsorbed. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) measures the nitrogen component of serum urea. BUN levels are inversely correlated with the decline of kidney function and are also affected by extrarenal factors such as protein intake, gastrointestinal bleeding, catabolic states, malnutrition, heart failure, dehydration, use of glucocorticoids, and hepatic urea synthesis.

Under physiologic conditions urea slowly dissociates into cyanate, which is rapidly converted to isocyanate. Isocyanate is a reactive electrophile with high affinity for nucleophilic groups such as primary amines. Carbamylation has been recognized to be a spontaneous post-translational modification of amino acids and proteins mediated by cyanate, leading to biochemical alterations. It has also been demonstrated that urea can exert direct toxicity on various tissues such as the intestinal epithelium, vascular walls, pancreatic β-cells and adipocytes, and indirect toxicity via carbamylation. Notably, BUN levels are associated with mortality among patients with heart failure.

Experimental studies have demonstrated that the release of vasopressin and the activation of the aldose reductase-fructokinase pathway caused by the elevated serum osmolality might be associated with kidney injury. BUN is one of the substances that affects the calculated serum osmolality (cSosm) levels. Therefore, in patients in advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), there is a concomitant rise in cSosm and BUN levels. Furthermore, a recent study showed that higher BUN and cSosm levels were independently associated with the development of CKD, which was defined as a decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in patients with preserved kidney function (average eGFR of 86.7 mL/min/1.73 m 2). However, it remains unclear whether high BUN or cSosm levels are an independent risk factor for kidney disease progression in patients with moderate to severe CKD. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the BUN or cSosm level is associated with adverse renal outcomes in patients with CKD (stages 3–5) independent of the eGFR. Additionally, a previous study demonstrated that eGFR and serum creatinine were associated with kidney disease progression in CKD patients. Thus, we also evaluated whether BUN levels were related to CKD progression, independent of an alternative kidney function marker, serum creatinine.

### Association between the blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio and the risk of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease: a cohort study [^f241b711]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

In CKD patients, the decline in renal function often leads to elevated BUN levels, while hypoalbuminemia can result from inflammation, malnutrition, and protein metabolism disorders. Research has demonstrated that in the ICU, BUN was associated with in-hospital mortality in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Additionally, previous studies identified a close association between hypoalbuminemia, inflammation, and malnutrition in CKD patients. The inflammatory status and malnutrition in CKD patients were associated with an increased mortality risk. Evidence indicated that hypoalbuminemia was significantly linked to higher mortality rates in CKD patients, potentially related to systemic inflammation. Therefore, an increase in the BAR effectively reflected the patient's prognostic risk, and our results validated the significant association between BAR and prognosis in critically ill CKD patients. Nonetheless, once BAR surpassed a certain threshold, the risk of death stabilized and ceased to rise significantly. Further investigation into this phenomenon is essential for future research.

In critically ill CKD patients, the mechanism underlying the association between elevated BAR and increased mortality risk is not fully elucidated, but several biologically plausible explanations exist. On the one hand, factors such as renal hypoperfusion, infection, and surgery can activate the neurohumoral systems such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the sympathetic nervous system, and antidiuretic hormone, which promote passive reabsorption of BUN in the renal tubules and enhance protein catabolism, leading to elevated BUN levels. On the other hand, albumin plays a critical role in maintaining plasma colloid osmotic pressure, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, platelet activation, and the transport of molecules and drugs. Existing studies have confirmed the protective effects of albumin on the heart and kidney due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Low serum albumin levels can impair toxin clearance, reduce intravascular volume, leading to renal hypoperfusion, and worsen kidney injury. Moreover, Low albumin has been associated with increased platelet aggregation and an elevated risk of thrombotic events. Therefore, the elevation of BAR may be the result of multiple pathophysiological processes, reflecting disease severity, and thus being associated with poor prognosis.

### The hidden risk of round numbers and sharp thresholds in clinical practice [^cc6b2312]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

As a first example, we see that harmful effects associated with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been ameliorated. In the oldest version of MIMIC, BUN strongly influenced mortality risk (Fig. 6 a), with a sharp rise in risk from 20–35 mg/dL followed by a plateau from 35–100 mg/dL. In more recent datasets, this sharp rise has diminished, likely due to advancements in treatment protocols and the incorporation of BUN into multi-factor risk measures.

Fig. 6
Clinical practice has changed and produced visible changes in mortality risk curves over time.

The three datasets (MIMIC-II, MIMIC-III, and MIMIC-IV) span three decades of intensive care at a single hospital system, allowing comparisons of the effects of clinical practice over time. The top two rows show mortality risk associated with each risk factor (after correcting for all other observable factors of patient risk, 95% confidence intervals shaded). The bottom row shows treatment likelihood associated with each risk factor in MIMIC-IV (with 95% confidence intervals shaded). Each tick along the horizontal axes denotes ten patients. a An example of successful improvement in clinical practice: the harmful mortality risk attributable to elevated blood urea nitrogen has been ameliorated over time, reducing from large impact in the early 2000s (blue) to a small impact in the 2010s (black). b A second example of successful improvement in clinical practice: the mortality risk attributable to patient age has been smoothed. c, d An example of a persistent counter-causal effect. In all three datasets, the mortality risk attributable to serum sodium (c) decreases at 150 mEq/L. This counter-causal change in mortality risk is associated with an increase in water and electrolyte replacement (Dextrose 5%, Free Water, Potassium Phosphate, Sterile Water, Sodium Chloride 0.45%) (d). e, f As treatment effectiveness has improved over time, some risks have become even more counter-causal. For example, in the most recent version of MIMIC, the mortality risk associated with serum creatinine is maximized for moderately elevated creatinine and decreases sharply for severely elevated creatinine (e). This decrease in risk is associated with increased use of continuous renal replacement therapy (f), suggesting potential for improvements in clinical practice to spread the benefits of this care to a broader set of patients with lower creatinine levels.

### Blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio in the general population and in patients with acute heart failure [^058c4876]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine (BUN/creatinine) ratio has been proposed as a useful parameter in acute heart failure (AHF), but data on the normal range and the added value of the ratio compared with its separate components in patients with AHF are lacking. The aim of this study is to define the normal range of BUN/creatinine ratio and to investigate its clinical significance in patients with AHF.

Methods

In 4484 subjects from the general population without cardiovascular comorbidities, we calculated age-specific and sex-specific normal values of the BUN/creatinine ratio, deriving a higher and lower than normal range of BUN/creatinine ratio (exceeding the 95% prediction intervals). Association of abnormal range to prognosis was tested in 2033 patients with AHF for the outcome of all-cause death through 180days, death or cardiovascular or renal rehospitalisation through 60days and heart failure (HF) rehospitalisation within 60days.

Results

In a cohort of patients with AHF, 482 (24.6%) and 28 (1.4%) patients with HF were classified into higher and lower than normal range groups, respectively. In Cox regression analysis, higher than normal range of BUN/creatinine ratio group was an independent predictor for all-cause death (HR: 1.86, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.66) and death or cardiovascular or renal rehospitalisation (HR: 1.37, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.82), but not for HF rehospitalisation (HR: 1.23, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.86) after adjustment for other prognostic factors including both creatinine and BUN.

Conclusions

In patients with AHF, BUN/creatinine higher than age-specific and sex-specific normal range is associated with worse prognosis independently from both creatinine and BUN. CLINICAL TRIALS: gov identifier NCT00328692 and NCT00354458.

### Association between the blood urea nitrogen-albumin ratio and mortality in critically ill patients with gastrointestinal bleeding: a retrospective cohort study [^580a11e7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a common, high-risk emergency with heterogeneous etiologies. Clinical presentations — including hematemesis, melena, or fecal occult blood — vary depending on the bleeding site and severity. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding has an annual incidence of approximately 67 per 100,000 individuals, significantly higher than lower gastrointestinal bleeding (36 per 100,000). The mortality rate of GIB ranges from 5% to 10%. Advanced age, comorbidities (e.g. liver cirrhosis or renal dysfunction), and physiological derangements such as hypotension or hyperlactatemia are independent predictors of mortality.

Massive hemorrhage carries a significant risk of life-threatening complications, including hypovolemic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI), myocardial ischemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), all requiring prompt resuscitation and intensive care. The management of severe bleeding typically involves a multimodal approach incorporating blood product transfusions, endoscopic hemostasis, vasoactive support, and often prolonged hospitalization, which significantly strains healthcare systems. Given the unpredictable disease progression, early and precise risk stratification is crucial for optimizing clinical outcomes.

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), a routinely assessed parameter of renal function, reflects not only glomerular filtration but also extrarenal influences such as dehydration, protein catabolism, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. In GIB patients, BUN elevation primarily results from intestinal absorption of nitrogenous blood breakdown products and diminished renal perfusion secondary to hypovolemia. Notably, marked BUN increases may predispose patients to AKI. Concurrent hypoalbuminemia exacerbates physiological derangements by reducing intravascular oncotic pressure while activating anti-inflammatory responses and oxidative stress during ischemia-reperfusion injury. These pathological cascades subsequently impair cellular metabolism and accelerate multiple organ dysfunction progression.

The Blood Urea Nitrogen-to-albumin ratio (BAR), integrating both BUN and Albumin (ALB) measurements, has emerged as a reliable prognostic marker across multiple clinical contexts, including acute pancreatitis, sepsis, and pneumonia. Elevated BAR values consistently correlate with worse clinical outcomes, and higher mortality rates in various systemic disorders. Nevertheless, its prognostic utility specifically for GIB patients remains inadequately characterized. This study seeks to (1) assess the prognostic value of BAR in GIB patients, and (2) establish the optimal BAR threshold for early detection and risk stratification of high-risk cases in clinical practice.

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio increased the risk of coronary artery disease in patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114b2575]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In recent years, owing to the environmental factors such as sedentary lifestyles and changing dietary habits, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has gradually become a global health problem. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) report, the age-standardized prevalence rate of diabetes in 2019 is 8.3%, which is expected to reach 9.6% in 2045. In China, T2DM has imposed a heavy economic burden on patients and society, and the total economic burden of T2DM and its complications reached 247.8 billion RMB in 2007. If patients living with T2DM do not take an active role in effectively controlling and treating their diseases, they are prone to a variety of diabetes-related complications that are responsible for the impaired quality of life, disability, and premature death. CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) is a cardiovascular complication of DM. In a systematic evaluation of 4,549,481 patients living with T2DM, the total incidence of macrovascular complications was 32.2%, and CAD was one of the most common cardiovascular diseases (21.2%).

The dysfunction of kidney not only implicates potential pathological changes of the kidney, but could also influence other organs and systems as a result of the impairments of body homoeostasis. Cardiovascular system is one of the most affected systems upon the impairment of renal function. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), a metabolic product of protein, is susceptible to external factors and is a very sensitive indicator of changes in haemodynamic and renal perfusion. Studies have shown that BUN is strongly associated with mortality in patients with heart failure. Haijing Jiang et.al found that a raised level of BUN might be associated with increased risk of incident CAD in Chinese populations. Serum creatinine (SCr) is mainly determined by the glomerular filtration capacity. Previous meta-analysis has observed that an impaired renal function, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate(eGFR) lower than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, was associated with an increased risk of incident CAD, independently of prevalent hypertension and diabetes. Emanuele Di Angelantonio et.al found that there was a moderate increase in CAD risk associated with very low eGFR in the general population. Furthermore, recently, the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (UCR) has emerged as an independent predictor of adverse clinical outcomes in various population settings, such as acute kidney injury, chronic heart failure, and ischemic stroke. However, epidemiological evidence that related UCR to risk of incident CAD in patients living with T2DM was still limited.

### Prognostic value of blood urea nitrogen in patients hospitalized with worsening heart failure: insights from the acute and chronic therapeutic impact of a vasopressin antagonist in chronic heart failure (ACTIV in CHF) study [^a430f737]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is associated with a high postdischarge mortality and readmission rate. The association between baseline blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and clinical outcomes in patients admitted for ADHF was evaluated in a post-hoc analysis of the ACTIV in CHF trial.

Methods and Results

Patients were categorized into quartiles according to baseline BUN. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to test the association between BUN, mortality, and death or readmission within 60 days. Patients in the highest quartile (> 40 mg/dL) had the highest 60-day mortality (14.3%, 9.3%, 4.0%, 0%, respectively; P < .001) and the highest rate of death or heart failure hospitalization (30.0%, 21.3% 18.4%, 8.6%; P < .001). After adjustment for covariates, BUN was a statistically significant predictor of both mortality and the composite endpoint of death or heart failure hospitalization at 60 days after hospital discharge. Serum creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance did not predict mortality after covariate adjustment.

Conclusions

Higher baseline BUN is a powerful predictor of increased postdischarge mortality in patients hospitalized for heart failure, even in the absence of severe renal failure. Even mild to moderate elevations in baseline BUN were predictive. BUN remains an easily accessible risk stratification tool that physicians should closely monitor in the hospital setting.

### Relationship between blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio and short-term mortality among patients from the surgical intensive care unit: a population-based real-world study [^f92ca0d9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

It is well-established that protein catabolism is heightened in critically ill patients, leading to an elevation in BUN levels. Renal reabsorption of urea nitrogen likewise affects the BUN levels of patients. Urea nitrogen is passively reabsorbed with water and sodium in the proximal renal tubule. In the more distal renal units, urea nitrogen reabsorption is also closely related to water reabsorption under the influence of antidiuretic hormone, which in turn is regulated by angiotensin II. When patients are dehydrated or have certain cardiovascular diseases occurring, sympathetic excitation and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system can increase the reabsorption of urea nitrogen by the body. Therefore, high BUN level also reflects the state of renal hypoperfusion caused by hypovolemia or reduction of cardiac output. One study has already reported that BUN levels at admission and at discharge were predictors of prognosis in patients with heart failure, and patients with high BUN levels had a poorer prognosis. Additionally, serum albumin serves as a partial indicator of the organism's nutritional status and fulfills crucial functions such as maintaining plasma colloid osmolality, acting as an antioxidant, eliminating oxygen free radicals, serving as a carrier for various compounds, and inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation. Hypoalbuminemia has linked to decreased overall survival and increased recurrence rates in diverse malignant tumors.

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio increased the risk of coronary artery disease in patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^c4fd82fb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

High Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and high Serum Creatinine (SCr) levels are risk factors for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). However, the relationship between the Blood Urea Nitrogen to Creatinine (BUN/SCr) ratio (UCR) and the risk of CAD in patients living with new-onset diabetes is unclear. This study aimed to examine the relationship between blood UCR and the risk of CAD in patients living with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

We analyzed the data from the cohort of 12,299 patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Primary endpoints were the events of CAD. The ANOVA test (continuous indicators) and χ 2 test (categorical indicators) were used to assess the differences of baseline characteristics across the groups of UCR. In order to understand the correlation between variables, we performed correlation analysis on variables that have significant differences between CAD group and non-CAD group. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to estimate the association of the blood UCR with the risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM. The Kaplan–Meier survival function plotting and the log-rank test were used to evaluate the event-free survival according to the groups of UCR. The restricted cubic spline model was used to show the adjusted association between blood UCR and risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM.

Results

During a median follow-up of 2.66 years, 1173 CAD were recorded with an event rate of 28.49 events per 1000 person-years. In multivariate-adjusted Cox regression models, elevated blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (UCR) was associated with higher risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM [hazard ratio (HR), 1.782; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.237–2.567]. The Kaplan–Meier survival curves indicated that the high group of UCR tended to have a lower event-free survival than the low group and medium group. There was a nonlinear trend toward increasing risk of CAD across the groups of UCR. And cubic spline function graph suggested that the influence of UCR level on HR for CAD increased significantly at UCR levels above 6.67.

Conclusions

An elevated UCR was significantly associated with an increased risk for CAD in patients living with T2DM.

### Blood urea nitrogen elevation is a marker for pediatric severe acute pancreatitis [^20d8ffcf]. Pancreas (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The natural course of patients who develop acute pancreatitis (AP) can range from mild to severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). The aim of this study was to evaluate for early predictors of developing SAP during the first episode of AP in a prospective pediatric cohort.

Methods

Clinical data were prospectively collected and subsequently analyzed for pediatric patients presenting with their first episode of AP between March 2013 and January 2017 to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.

Results

A total of 118 patients were included in the analysis, and 22 (18.6%) developed SAP. Patients who developed SAP had significantly higher values of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (P = 0.007), magnesium (P = 0.04), glucose (P = 0.03), sodium (P = 0.03), and C-reactive protein (P = 0.02). A logistic regression model with BUN as a predictor of SAP was superior to any other combination of variables (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.89; sensitivity, 63%; specificity, 81%; positive predictive value, 43%; negative predictive value, 91%).

Conclusions

This study generated a predictive model using elevated BUN as a significant predictor of SAP. The findings are useful for early identification of pediatric patients at higher risk of developing SAP.

### Blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio: a good predictor of in-hospital and 90-day all-cause mortality in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^e02220f2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Given that BUN/ALB ratio was associated with in-hospital and short-term prognosis in patients with AECOPD. We recommend that BUN/ALB ratio should gain prominence in clinical work. How to quickly and accurately assess the severity of AECOPD in patients and give corresponding intervention measures to improve the prognosis and outcome is crucially important. One research from Zemans et al. showed that combined clinical variables might be more highly predictive of outcomes than individual clinical variables in COPD. BUN/ALB ratio, combined with BUN and ALB, might play a better role in predicting the outcomes of patients with AECOPD (Fig. 2). Mathioudakis et al. summarized novel data on the diagnosis, phenotyping, targeted treatment, and prevention of AECOPD and indicated that the development and validation of accurate biomarkers for early characterization of the different types of COPD exacerbations is still a challenge. Biomarkers should be measurable quickly and simple to perform. In this research, we showed that an elevated BUN/ALB ratio was associated with increased mortality in patients with AECOPD. BUN and ALB measurements are easy to obtain, convenient to use, and are not affected by the evaluator's subjectivity, which is more realistic in clinical work. Therefore, we suggest that BUN/ALB ratio might be a promising indicator for assessment of the severity of AECOPD in patients.

In this study, we also found that CHF was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality (RR = 4.36, 95% CI 1.07–17.85, P = 0.040), which was consistent with previous findings that CHF was a significant and independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in COPD and had an influence on the COPD course. Stratified by the BUN/ALB ratio, compared with the BUN/ALB ratio of < 0.249 group, there were more patients with congestive heart failure in the BUN/ALB ratio of ≥ 0.249 group (44.1% vs. 27.3%, P = 0.012). The pathophysiological mechanism behind the association between elevated BUN/ALB ratios and CHF has been previously described. This might indicate that those combined with CHF have a higher BUN/ALB ratio and more attention should be paid to those with CHF when considering adverse hospitalization outcomes.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: a prospective observational study [^942ae91a]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study demonstrated that higher BUN levels were associated with adverse renal outcomes independent of eGFR in patients with moderate to severe CKD. A recent study reported that both BUN and cSosm were independent risk factors for CKD in patients with preserved kidney function. However, in the present study, a multivariable Cox analysis (Model 3) did not show a significant association between cSosm and poor renal outcomes. These findings suggest that the absolute BUN, rather than serum osmolality, could have predictive value for kidney disease progression. Conversely, in our cohort, higher BUN levels were significantly associated with poor outcomes in the higher but not the lower eGFR group, although there was no significant interaction for renal outcomes between BUN and eGFR levels as shown in Fig. 4. These results might suggest that the impact of the BUN level on kidney disease progression is stronger at earlier stages of CKD.

### The correlation study between blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio and prognosis of patients with sepsis during hospitalization [^0faaa2bc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common critical illness in intensive care unit (ICU) and is characterized by a dysregulated response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. It has been reported that about 1/3 of critically ill patients will develop sepsis. While organ support and guidelines for sepsis management have improved, the rates of morbidity and mortality remain high, which have made sepsis a hot spot in critical care medicine. Therefore, identifying simple and effective clinical indicators to determine prognosis is essential for the management of sepsis patients.

Patients with sepsis generally suffer from elevated protein catabolism and are susceptible to acute kidney injury, which can result in elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Studies have shown that elevated BNU can independently predict prognosis in critically ill patients. Albumin is the most abundant protein in human plasma, and patients with sepsis frequently have hypoalbuminemia. Lower albumin levels are interrelated to severe systemic inflammation and organ failure, resulting in poor outcomes. The ratio of blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin (B/A) is a new form of inflammation marker now being studied. It is calculated from the two indicators of urea nitrogen and albumin, which are easy to detect and inexpensive. Previous studies have reported that B/A has high clinical value in evaluating the prognosis of community-acquired pneumonia, acute pulmonary embolism and chronic heart failure.

However, there is no research report on the correlation between B/A and the prognosis of patients with sepsis. This study was mainly based on B/A, a comprehensive index, to explore its correlation with the prognosis of patients with sepsis during ICU stay.

### Independent prognostic importance of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio in heart failure [^395bd1f0]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine ratio is associated with worse outcomes in acute heart failure (HF) but little is known about its importance in chronic HF.

Methods and Results

We combined individual patient data from clinical trials (HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]: PARADIGM-HF, ATMOSPHERE and DAPA-HF, and HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]: PARAGON-HF and I-PRESERVE). The primary outcome examined was a composite time to first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death; its components and all-cause death were also examined. Each HF phenotype was categorized according to median BUN/creatinine ratio, generating four groups that is, HFpEF ≤ and > median BUN/creatinine ratio and HFrEF ≤ and > median BUN/creatinine ratio. The association between BUN/creatinine ratio and outcomes was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazard models. Overall, 28820 patients were analysed. The median (IQR) BUN/creatinine ratio was 20.1 (Q1-Q3 16.7–24.7) in HFpEF and 18.7 (15.2–22.8) in HFrEF. In both HFpEF and HFrEF, higher BUN/creatinine ratio was associated with older age, female sex, and diabetes, but similar estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The risk of each outcome examined was significantly higher in patients with BUN/creatinine ratio ≥ median, compared to < median, even after adjustment for other prognostic variables, including N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and eGFR.

Conclusion

Higher BUN/creatinine ratio was associated with worse outcomes in patients with chronic HF across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction, independently of eGFR and NT-proBNP. BUN/creatinine ratio may reflect neurohumoral activation (especially increased arginine vasopressin), altered renal blood flow or other pathophysiologic mechanisms not incorporated in conventional prognostic variables.

Figure 4 summarizes adjusted HRs according to subgroups stratified by demographic and clinical characteristics. In all subjects, every 10-mg/dL increase in the BUN level was associated with an increased risk of adverse renal composite outcomes (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04–1.45). In male subjects, higher BUN levels were associated with a significant increase in the risk of adverse renal composite outcomes. In patients with a higher eGFR, lower serum albumin, and higher proteinuria level, the risk of poor renal outcomes significantly increased as the BUN level increased. In addition, in patients taking diuretics, as the BUN level increased, a significant increase in the risk of a poor renal outcome was found. No significant interactions for renal outcomes, except for use of diuretics (P = 0.02), were observed between BUN levels and other baseline clinical characteristics (P for interaction, 0.06–0.88).

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been shown to occur commonly in hospitalized children. AKI is associated with multiple complications, including elevated blood urea nitrogen level, electrolyte dyscrasias, acidosis, and fluid balance disorders. During the past 10 years, multiple multicenter studies have shown that AKI occurs commonly and is associated with adverse outcomes across a variety of populations in pediatrics. This state-of-the-art review provides a detailed overview and update on AKI, including definition, epidemiology, outcomes, differential diagnosis, diagnostics, and management of complications.

### The correlation study between blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio and prognosis of patients with sepsis during hospitalization [^2a595b62]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Sepsis is a syndrome of various pathogenic microorganisms invading the human body and causing systemic inflammatory response. Early fluid resuscitation, infection control, and antibiotic therapy are the cornerstones of sepsis management aimed at correcting the condition of such patients. Although sepsis guidelines have been continuously improved in recent years, and a series of active "rescue" measures have been taken internationally for sepsis, its morbidity and mortality remain high. The mortality rate of sepsis patients hospitalized in ICU was as high as 41.9%. Therefore, how to find an accurate and reliable clinical index, which is convenient for judging the prognosis of sepsis patients during hospitalization, so as to improve the successful rate of treatment, is still a major challenge for clinicians.

BUN is one of the end products of human protein catabolism and is mainly excreted in the kidney. It is an important marker representing renal function, metabolic status and nutritional status. In critically ill patients, protein catabolism is hyperactive and BNU synthesis increases during stress response. In addition, increased renal urea reabsorption leads to elevated blood urea nitrogen level in dehydrated states. In recent years, studies have reported its potential predictive value in poor clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis. In a retrospective cohort study of 12,713 patients with sepsis, there was a non-linear relationship between BUN and 30-day mortality. Serum albumin, which is easily accessible as an indicator of nutritional status, contributes significantly to physiological homeostasis. Patients with sepsis commonly suffer from capillary leakage, reperfusion injury, tissue ischemia, and inflammatory responses, all of which can result in hypoalbuminemia. In patients with severe sepsis, lower albumin level has been linked with poor clinical outcomes and was an independent predictor of prognosis in patients with sepsis and septic shock, according to several studies. Our study showed that the non-survivors had a significantly higher BUN and lower albumin than those who survived during ICU hospitalization, which was in line with the other researches.

### The fallacy of the BUN: creatinine ratio in critically ill patients [^9d84d581]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and is associated with a high mortality rate. Pre-renal azotemia, suggested by a high blood urea nitrogen to serum creatinine (BUN:Cr) ratio (BCR), has traditionally been associated with a better prognosis than other forms of AKI. Whether this pertains to critically ill patients is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational study of two cohorts of critically ill patients admitted to a single center: a derivation cohort, in which AKI was diagnosed, and a larger validation cohort. We analyzed associations between BCR and clinical outcomes: mortality and renal replacement therapy (RRT).

Results

Patients in the derivation cohort (N = 1010) with BCR > 20 were older, predominantly female and white, and more severely ill. A BCR > 20 was significantly associated with increased mortality and a lower likelihood of RRT in all patients, patients with AKI and patients at risk for AKI. Patients in the validation cohort (N = 10228) with a BCR > 20 were older, predominantly female and white, and more severely ill. A BCR > 20 was associated with increased mortality and a lower likelihood of RRT in all patients and in those at risk for AKI, BUN correlated with age and severity of illness.

Conclusions

A BCR > 20 is associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients. It is also associated with a lower likelihood of RRT, perhaps because of misinterpretation of the BCR. Clinicians should not use a BCR > 20 to classify AKI in critically ill patients.

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen level as a predictor of mortality in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure [^b9d807b4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hospitalization for decompensated heart failure is associated with high mortality after discharge. In heart failure, renal function involves both cardiovascular and hemodynamic properties. We studied the relation between renal dysfunction and mortality in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure.

Methods

The prognostic importance of four measures of renal function-blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio, and estimated creatinine clearance-was evaluated in 541 patients (mean [± SD] age, 63 ± 14 years; 377 men [70%]) with a previous diagnosis of heart failure (96% with New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms) who were admitted for clinical decompensation.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 343 ± 185 days, 177 patients (33%) died. In multivariable Cox regression models, the risk of all-cause mortality increased with each quartile of blood urea nitrogen, with an adjusted relative risk of 2.3 in patients in the upper compared with the lower quartiles (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 to 4.1; P = 0.005). Creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance were not significant predictors of mortality after adjustment for other covariates. Blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio yielded similar prognostic information as blood urea nitrogen (adjusted relative risk = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.4 to 3.8; P = 0.0007 for patients in the upper compared with the lower quartiles).

Conclusion

Blood urea nitrogen is a simple clinical variable that provides useful prognostic information in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure. In this setting, elevated blood urea nitrogen levels probably reflect the cumulative effects of hemodynamic and neurohormonal alterations that result in renal hypoperfusion.

### Elevation of blood urea nitrogen is predictive of long-term mortality in critically ill patients independent of "normal" creatinine [^40f63683]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We hypothesized that elevated blood urea nitrogen can be associated with all-cause mortality independent of creatinine in a heterogeneous critically ill population.

Design

Multicenter observational study of patients treated in medical and surgical intensive care units.

Setting

Twenty intensive care units in two teaching hospitals in Boston, MA.

Patients

A total of 26,288 patients, age ≥ 18 yrs, hospitalized between 1997 and 2007 with creatinine of 0.80–1.30 mg/dL.

Interventions

None.

Measurements

Blood urea nitrogen at intensive care unit admission was categorized as 10–20, 20–40, and > 40 mg/dL. Logistic regression examined death at days 30, 90, and 365 after intensive care unit admission as well as in-hospital mortality. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated by multivariable logistic regression models.

Main Results

Blood urea nitrogen at intensive care unit admission was predictive for short- and long-term mortality independent of creatinine. Thirty days following intensive care unit admission, patients with blood urea nitrogen of > 40 mg/dL had an odds ratio for mortality of 5.12 (95% confidence interval, 4.30–6.09; p < .0001) relative to patients with blood urea nitrogen of 10–20 mg/dL. Blood urea nitrogen remained a significant predictor of mortality at 30 days after intensive care unit admission following multivariable adjustment for confounders; patients with blood urea nitrogen of > 40 mg/dL had an odds ratio for mortality of 2.78 (95% confidence interval, 2.27–3.39; p < .0001) relative to patients with blood urea nitrogen of 10–20 mg/dL. Thirty days following intensive care unit admission, patients with blood urea nitrogen of 20–40 mg/dL had an odds ratio of 2.15 (95% confidence interval, 1.98–2.33; < .0001) and a multivariable odds ratio of 1.53 (95% confidence interval, 1.40–1.68; p < .0001) relative to patients with blood urea nitrogen of 10–20 mg/dL. Results were similar at 90 and 365 days following intensive care unit admission as well as for in-hospital mortality. A subanalysis of patients with blood cultures (n = 7,482) demonstrated that blood urea nitrogen at intensive care unit admission was associated with the risk of blood culture positivity.

Conclusion

Among critically ill patients with creatinine of 0.8–1.3 mg/dL, an elevated blood urea nitrogen was associated with increased mortality, independent of serum creatinine.

### Blood urea nitrogen levels to verify estimated glomerular filtration rate, as derived from 2 commonly used equations [^c20aeef7]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR) of 20 or greater indicates various physiological conditions. Whether glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimates obtained using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) study equations are affected by a high BCR remains unknown.

Methods

Patients who underwent urine creatinine clearance (CrCl) and serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine assessments on the same day were enrolled in our study. Those with BCR of 20 or greater and less than 20 were categorized into high- and low-BCR groups. The concordance on diagnosing chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages by using urine CrCl level and serum GFR estimates was assessed.

Results

More disagreement in CKD stage diagnosis was observed in the high-BCR group (weighted κ = 0.600 and 0.541 for the MDRD and CKD-EPI study equations, respectively) than in the low-BCR group (weighted κ = 0.816 and 0.758, respectively).

Conclusions

A BCR of 20 or greater caused misestimation of the CKD stage. GFR estimates for patients with high BCR should be interpreted cautiously.

### Urea cycle dysregulation drives metabolic stress and neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease [^4ce8416a]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The direct consequences of excessive activation of the urea cycle also include an increase in the level of the final product urea. Elevated urea levels may extend beyond neurodegenerative pathologies to influence psychiatric disorders. Emerging evidence suggests that high urea levels may act as an independent biological factor in conditions such as depression and anxiety. Mechanistically, urea disrupts neuronal synaptic plasticity, inducing depressive-like behaviors, and promotes abnormal myelin maintenance, which correlates with anxiety-like phenotypes. These findings underscore the broad neurotoxic potential of urea dysregulation, potentially linking metabolic disturbances to both psychiatric and neurodegenerative manifestations.

The systemic nature of urea dysregulation in PD is underscored by clinical evidence showing elevated blood urea and creatinine levels in PD patients, correlate with disease severity and progression. In PD models, we also observed marked motor dysfunction concomitant with elevated urea levels. At the same time, the increase of urea levels can also induce PD-like pathological manifestations in neurons, so urea may be the main factor inducing motor dysfunction in PD. The parallel between urea-induced pathology in models and clinical observations in PD patients, where blood urea levels correlate with disease severity and progression, further supports urea as a primary effector of neurodegeneration. Crucially, experimental induction of urea elevation in neurons recapitulated PD-like pathological features, including dopaminergic neuron loss and α-synuclein aggregation. In addition to the direct effect of urea on the nervous system, these peripheral biomarkers may reflect broader metabolic disruptions, including impaired renal function or altered protein catabolism, which could exacerbate central nervous system pathology.

### Blood urea nitrogen to albumin ratio is a predictor of in-hospital mortality in older emergency department patients [^51f44f7d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the first measured blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/albumin ratio in the emergency department (ED) as a predictor of in-hospital mortality in older ED patients.

Methods

This retrospective observational study was conducted at a university hospital ED. Consecutive patients aged 65 and over who visited the ED in a three-month period were included in the study. The BUN, albumin, creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of patients were recorded. The primary end point of the study was in-hospital mortality.

Results

A total of 1253 patients were included in the statistical analyses of the study. Non-survivors had increased BUN levels (32.9 (23.3–55.4) vs. 20.2 (15.4–28.3) mg/dL, p < 0.001), decreased albumin levels (3.27 (2.74–3.75) vs. 3.96 (3.52–4.25) g/dL, p < 0.001), and increased BUN/albumin ratios (10.19 (6.56–18.94) vs. 5.21 (3.88–7.72) mg/g, p < 0.001) compared to survivors. An increased BUN/albumin ratio was a powerful predictor of in-hospital mortality with an area under the curve of 0.793 (95% CI: 0.753–0.833). Malignancy (OR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.59–3.74, p < 0.001), albumin level < 3.5 g/dL (OR: 2.75; 95% CI: 1.74–4.36, p < 0.001), and BUN/albumin ratio > 6.25 (OR: 2.82; 95% CI: 1.22–6.50, p < 0.015) were found to be independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in older ED patients.

Conclusion

According to our findings, older patients with a BUN level > 23 mg/dL, an albumin level < 3.5 g/dL, and a BUN/albumin ratio > 6.25 mg/g in the ED have a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Additionally, the BUN/albumin ratio is a more powerful independent predictor of in-hospital mortality than the BUN level, albumin level, creatinine level, and eGFR in older ED patients.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: a prospective observational study [^489da9db]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is one of the substances that affects the calculated serum osmolality (cSosm). A previous study demonstrated that BUN and cSosm were independently associated with the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with preserved kidney function. In advanced CKD stages, there is a concomitant increase in cSosm and BUN levels. However, it remains unclear whether BUN or cSosm levels are related to renal outcomes in patients with moderate to severe kidney dysfunction. The aim of this study was to clarify whether the BUN or cSosm level is associated with kidney disease progression in patients with advanced CKD.

Methods

In this prospective study, we enrolled 459 patients with CKD (stages 3–5). The composite renal endpoint was end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death, and ESRD alone was added as an alternative outcome. A Cox proportional hazards model was utilized to determine the risk factors for a poor renal outcome. We adjusted for covariates including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The cSosm (mOsm/kg) was calculated using the following formula: (2 × sodium) + (BUN/2.8) + (glucose/18).

Results

During a median follow-up of 25.8 months, the renal endpoint was observed in 210 patients. Multivariable Cox analysis determined the hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for the composite renal outcome in the second, third, and fourth BUN quartiles were 1.36 (0.72–2.58), 1.87 (0.95–3.66), and 2.66 (1.23–5.76) (P for trend < 0.01), respectively compared with the first BUN quartile. Conversely, by multivariable Cox analysis, the HRs (95% CIs) for poor outcomes in the second, third, and fourth cSosm quartiles, compared with the first cSosm quartile, were 1.13 (0.69–1.87), 0.95 (0.58–1.55), and 1.26 (0.78–2.03), respectively (P for trend = 0.39). In addition, with regard to the renal outcome of ESRD alone, higher BUN quartiles had a significantly increased risk for the outcome, but cSosm levels were not associated with the outcome.

Conclusions

Higher BUN levels, but not cSosm levels, were associated with adverse renal outcomes independent of the eGFR, suggesting that BUN may be a useful marker for predicting kidney disease progression.

Role of UCR as a catabolic marker and indicator for persistent critical Illness

The following table provides an overview of studies that have examined the role of UCR (urea-to-creatinine ratio) as a catabolic marker and indicator for persistent critical illness. The table focuses on UCR and the most relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria; other possible study outcomes unrelated to UCR are not described. The table reports whether the studies used blood urea nitrogen to creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratios or urea-to-creatinine ratios, both of which are encompassed under the term UCR. Furthermore, in the event of a reported value, the unit of measurement utilised in the UCR is explicitly stated (mg/dL: mg/dL or mmol/L: mmol/L). For details regarding unit conversion, see Fig. 4.

### Blood urea nitrogen-to-serum albumin ratio predicts fatal outcomes in severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome patients [^ef0a381d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Blood urea nitrogen is an essential index reflecting complicated interactions between patients' nutrition, protein metabolism, and renal status. The literature links elevated BUN levels to fatalities in various diseases, such as pulmonary diseases, pancreatitis, sepsis, and COVID-19. Here, elevated BUN levels confirmed acute kidney injury or protein metabolism impairment in SFTSV-infected patients. Albumin, a major component of plasma proteins produced by the liver, is considered a biomarker of malnutrition and inflammation. The existing literature shows that ALB has been used as a prognostic factor of infection, and it was correlated with a risk of death in patients with SFTS in a meta-analysis. The association between decreased ALB levels and fatal outcomes from SFTS may have several explanations: Hepatic injury induced by SFTSV resulted in reduced albumin production, and a renal injury resulted in increased albumin filtration or decreased reabsorption. Interestingly, increased BUN and decreased ALB levels were observed in neonates with hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, severe cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and fatal cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. However, BUN and ALB were not independent hazards for SFTS patients in this study, suggesting that their efficacy alone for early identification of adverse outcomes is less than ideal. To amplify the inverse relationship between levels of BUN and ALB after SFTSV infection, the BAR, a simple index, was applied.

Per our understanding, this investigation represents an inaugural attempt to evaluate the predictive efficacy of the BAR among patients with SFTS. The results indicate that the mortality rate in patients with a high BAR (> 6.712) was more than eight times greater than the rate in those with low BAR (< 6.712). Because patients with chronic kidney or liver disease were excluded, this association may have been due to SFTSV-associated inflammation and direct effects of SFTSV on the liver and kidneys. The ROC examination for foreseeing SFTS mortality demonstrated that the AUC value (AUC = 0.913) and odds ratio derived from the BAR were significantly higher than those derived from BUN (AUC = 0.862) and ALB (AUC = 0.688) levels. Moreover, the CAR and PAR, which effectively recognized patients at an elevated risk of SFTS, and the AISI, which has been linked to the risk and mortality of infectious illnesses, were also evaluated. The results indicate that the BAR outperformed the CAR, AISI, BUN, and ALB in predicting prognosis in SFTS patients, in accordance with previous studies.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^5c39e949]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury — timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation — observational cohorts link higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at start and later initiation from intensive care unit (ICU) admission with higher mortality. In PICARD, initiation at higher BUN (> 76 mg/dl [blood urea ≥ 27.1 mmol/l]) had increased risk of death (RR 1.85; 95% CI 1.16–2.96) among 243 patients at five sites. In a multicenter cohort across 54 ICUs in 23 countries, timing by serum urea (median 24.2 mmol/l [BUN 67.8 mg/dl]) showed no mortality difference, but late RRT by time from ICU admission (more than 5 days) had greater crude mortality (72.8% late vs. 62.3% delayed vs. 59% early, P = 0.001) and higher covariate-adjusted mortality (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.30–2.92; P = 0.001), with late RRT also associated with longer RRT duration, longer hospital stay, and greater dialysis dependence. In surgical ICU acute kidney injury, late initiation defined as RIFLE-I or -F was an independent predictor of mortality (HR 1.846; CI 1.07–3.18).

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^066131f8]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR) has been used since the early 1940s to help clinicians differentiate between prerenal acute kidney injury (PR AKI) and intrinsic AKI (I AKI). This ratio is simple to use and is often put forward as a reliable diagnostic tool. Indeed many textbooks of internal medicine, nephrology and critical care continue to advocate the use of BCR even though its usefulness in the diagnosis and clinical management of AKI remains unclear.

Under normal conditions, BCR is less than 100 (with urea and creatinine concentrations expressed in mmol/L). In states of renal hypoperfusion with intact tubular function, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is considered to rise out of proportion to plasma creatinine concentration, due to avid urea reabsorption by the proximal tubule, the BCR typically becoming > 100.

One of the first to put forward this tool was Fishberg in 1939 when he observed that " an increase in urea content of the blood may be considerable before the creatinine value rises in prerenal azotemia". However, as soon as 1947, other investigators found no such relationship. Since then, very few studies (human or animal) have addressed the question and their results are conflicting. These studies consisted of small series of patients, essentially from intensive care units, the largest of which included only 103 patients and this study was not specifically aimed at investigating BCR.

AKI is common in Emergency Departments (ED). It can be challenging to differentiate prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in this setting. Indeed, the ED physician has a short time frame to make decisions, he may not have access to current medication or baseline creatinine, have incomplete medical history and doesn't have by definition the responsiveness to a fluid challenge.

The BCR is one of the diagnostic tools recommended to ED physicians for differentiating between PR and I AKI, yet it has never been specifically studied in this setting.

The aim of this study was to determine whether BCR is a reliable parameter for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic AKI in a population of patients admitted to hospital via the ED.

### NHANES 2015–2016: standard biochemistry profile data documentation, codebook, and frequencies… [^cc7b52e7]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2017). Low credibility.

Blood Urea Nitrogen BUN measurements are used in the diagnosis of certain renal and metabolic diseases. The determination of serum urea nitrogen is the most widely used test for the evaluation of kidney function. The test is frequently requested in conjunction with the serum creatinine test for the differential diagnosis of prerenal, renal, and post renal uremia. High BUN levels are associated with impaired renal function, increased protein catabolism, nephritis, intestinal obstruction, urinary obstruction, metallic poisoning, cardiac failure, peritonitis, dehydration, malignancy, pneumonia, surgical shock, Addison's disease, and uremia. Low BUN levels are associated with amyloidosis, acute liver disease, pregnancy, and nephrosis. Normal variations are observed according to a person's age and sex, the time of day, and their diet – particularly in their protein intake. Sodium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.

Total Bilirubin Elevated levels are associated with hemolytic jaundice, paroxysmal hemoglobinuria, pernicious anemia, polycythemia, icterus neonatorum, internal hemorrhage, acute hemolytic anemia, malaria, and septicemia. Low bilirubin levels are associated with aplastic anemia, and certain types of secondary anemia resulting from toxic therapy for carcinoma and chronic nephritis. Total Calcium Calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid disease, bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany. Urinary calcium measurement is used in the. Blood Urea Nitrogen The DxC800 modular chemistry is used to quantitatively determine the concentration of blood urea nitrogen in serum or plasma by means of the enzymatic conductivity rate method. A precise volume of sample is injected into the urease reagent in a reaction cup containing an electrode that responds to changes in solution conductivity.

Electronic circuits determine the rate of increase in conductivity, which is directly proportional to the concentration of urea in the sample. Albumin in g/dL was converted to g/L by multiplying by 10 LBXSBU conversion to LBDSBUSI Blood urea nitrogen in mg/dL was converted to mmol/L by multiplying by.

### Blood urea nitrogen, blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio and incident stroke: the dongfeng-tongji cohort [^838f0393]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

It remains unclear whether extreme levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and BUN to creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) can increase future risk of stroke. We conducted this study to investigate the associations of BUN and BUN/Cr with incident stroke and its subtypes.

Methods

A total of 26,835 and 26,379 participants with a mean follow-up of 7.9 years were included to investigate the associations of BUN and BUN/Cr with incident stroke, respectively. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident stroke and its subtypes.

Results

Compared with participants in the third quintile of BUN, the adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for participants in the lowest quintile were 1.21 (1.04–1.40), 1.41 (1.18–1.68) and 1.36 (0.97–1.91) for total, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, respectively; while for those in the highest quintile, the corresponding HRs (95% CIs) were 1.16 (1.01–1.32), 1.30 (1.11–1.53), and 1.24 (0.90–1.71). The associations remained robust when restricting the analyses to participants within clinically normal range of BUN. For BUN/Cr, compared with participants in the third quintile, participants in the lowest quintile had significant higher risks of stroke (HRs [95% CIs] were 1.19 [1.04–1.37], 1.26 [1.07–1.48], and 1.22 [0.90–1.67] for total, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke).

Conclusions

Both high and low levels of BUN were associated with higher risks of total and ischemic stroke. Low level of BUN/Cr was associated with excess risks of total and ischemic stroke.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: a prospective observational study [^895b7da5]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

This study had some limitations. First, patients who were admitted to a single regional hospital were recruited in this cohort; as a result, this study had relatively small sample size, old patients, and the number of male patients more than twice that of female patients. Accordingly, selection bias may exist in this population. In the stratified analyses (Fig. 4), higher BUN levels were independently associated with adverse renal outcomes in male subjects, but not in female subjects. In addition, a significant association was observed in the higher age group but not in the lower age group. Second, we did not examine uremic toxins, such as indoxyl sulfate and p -cresyl sulfate, which are associated with kidney disease progression. Third, we did not evaluate protein intake before admission or precise volume status at admission, which could have affected baseline BUN levels. A previous report suggested that left atrial diameter could be considered a marker of volume status in dialysis patients. We assessed left atrial diameter in each patient and it was slightly increased in the higher BUN quartiles (Table 1). This suggests that higher BUN levels did not reflect volume depletion. Fourth, the follow-up period in the present study was relatively short. Finally, it might be considered that a single BUN measurement does not provide sufficient accuracy for predicting the renal outcome.

### Relation of blood urea nitrogen to long-term mortality in patients with heart failure [^b6e27018]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease and heart failure (HF) have been shown to be at higher risk for major adverse cardiovascular events and death. Recent studies have demonstrated that blood urea nitrogen (BUN) might serve as a powerful predictor of mortality in acutely decompensated HF. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of BUN on long-term mortality in patients with stage B and C HF. Our retrospective analysis included patients undergoing percutaneous intervention with a calculated left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 50%. Patients on dialysis or with technically inadequate left ventriculograms were excluded. Chart review was performed and mortality data were obtained. Our population included 444 patients with a mean ejection fraction of 38 ± 10%, mean age of 59 ± 11 years, median BUN of 14 mg/dl, and median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 81 ml/min/1.73 m(2); 31% had stage C HF, and 33% died during follow-up. Patients with increased BUN (≥ 17 mg/dl) and decreased GFR (≤ 69 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) had significantly increased long-term mortality on Kaplan-Meier analysis (8-year mortalities of 57% and 55%, respectively). In patients with stage C HF, mortalities at 8 years were 69% and 73% with abnormal BUN and GFR, respectively. Proportional hazard regression analysis demonstrated that BUN and stage C HF were independently associated with increased mortality, whereas GFR was not. In conclusion, we demonstrated that BUN is strongly associated with mortality in patients with stage B and C HF and may serve as a better biomarker than GFR for prognostication.

### Reconsidering the lack of urea toxicity in dialysis patients [^4d739911]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Urea is an old uremic toxin which has been used for many years as a global biomarker of CKD severity and dialysis adequacy. Old studies were not in favor of its role as a causal factor in the pathogenesis of complications associated with the uremic state. However, recent experimental and clinical evidence is compatible with both direct and indirect toxicity of urea, particularly via the deleterious actions of urea-derived carbamylated molecules. Further studies are clearly needed to explore the potential relevance of urea-related CKD complications for patient management, in particular the place of new therapeutic strategies to prevent urea toxicity.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^f43a4796]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy — postdialysis urea rebound and sampling implications — If the blood sample is drawn immediately upon completion of dialysis, just-dialyzed blood that has recirculated into the access will dilute the sample, leading to a falsely decreased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) value and artificially elevated Kt/V and URR, and thus overestimation of delivered dialysis. Early urea rebound (≤ 3 minutes after dialysis) may be viewed as a 2-component process in which rebound from recirculation begins immediately upon completion of hemodialysis (HD) and resolves in less than 1 minute, usually within 20 seconds, while the CAPR component begins approximately 20 seconds after stopping HD and is completed 2 to 3 minutes after slowing or stopping the blood pump; the late phase (> 3 minutes) is completed within 30 to 60 minutes after cessation of dialysis.

### The importance of low blood urea nitrogen levels in pregnant patients undergoing hemodialysis to optimize birth weight and gestational age [^b491fa24]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Most published reports indicate that intensified hemodialysis results in better pregnancy outcomes. Here we studied clinical characteristics and the outcomes of 28 pregnant women receiving hemodialysis. We found an association between maternal blood data and birth weight, and gestational age and outcomes. There were 18 surviving infants who were followed up for one year. In the others there were 4 spontaneous abortions, 1 stillbirth, 3 neonatal deaths and 2 deaths after birth. Analysis of blood chemistry for 20 pregnancies from 12 weeks of gestation until delivery showed that the average hemoglobin level was significantly higher in the group that successfully delivered than in the unsuccessful group. There were significant negative relationships between the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level and the birth weight or gestational age in the latter cohort. A birth weight equal to or greater than 1500 g or a gestational age equal to or exceeding 32 weeks corresponded to BUN levels of 48–49 mg/dl or less. Whether the low BUN is the direct cause of the improved outcome remains to be examined.

### Who's at risk? A prognostic model for severity prediction in pediatric acute pancreatitis [^d6d1d50c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

The aim of the study was to validate and optimize a severity prediction model for acute pancreatitis (AP) and to examine blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level changes from admission as a severity predictor.

Study Design:

Patients from 2 hospitals were included for the validation model (Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters and Children's National Hospital). Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center data were used for analysis of BUN at 24 to 48 hours.

Results:

The validation cohort included 73 patients; 22 (30%) with either severe or moderately severe AP, combined into the all severe AP (SAP) group. Patients with SAP had higher BUN (P = 0.002) and lower albumin (P = 0.005). Admission BUN was confirmed as a significant predictor (P = 0.005) of SAP (area under the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60–0.86). Combining BUN (P = 0.005) and albumin (P = 0.004) resulted in better prediction for SAP (AUROC 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.94). A total of 176 AP patients were analyzed at 24–48 hours; 39 (22%) met criteria for SAP. Patients who developed SAP had a significantly higher BUN (P < 0.001) after 24 hours. Elevated BUN levels within 24 to 48 hours were independently predictive of developing SAP (AUROC: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.66–0.85). Patients who developed SAP had a significantly smaller percentage decrease in BUN from admission to 24 to 48 hours (P = 0.002).

Conclusion:

We externally validated the prior model with admission BUN levels and further optimized it by incorporating albumin. We also found that persistent elevation of BUN is associated with development of SAP. Our model can be used to risk stratify patients with AP on admission and again at 24 to 48 hours.

### Association of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio and long-term outcome among women with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: filling gaps in female [^fcbb086a]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have established an association between the BUN/Cr ratio and adverse outcomes in various cardiovascular conditions. Specifically, a higher admission BUN/Cr ratio predicts increased in-hospital mortality in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, even after multivariable adjustment, and elevated ratios are independently associated with higher long-term all-cause mortality in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patients. In contrast, our study identifies the BUN/Cr ratio as a valuable prognostic marker in female patients undergoing CABG, where a higher ratio is associated with reduced mortality. This apparent contradiction likely stems from divergent pathophysiological mechanisms reflected by the BUN/Cr ratio across different cardiovascular states. In female CABG patients, an elevated ratio primarily signifies effective perioperative volume management (achieved through active diuresis and fluid restriction), resulting in relative volume deficit. This contrasts with AMI and ADHF, where a high ratio typically indicates pathological renal hypoperfusion secondary to severe cardiac dysfunction.

We utilized RCS functions to analyze the dose-response relationship regarding long-term outcomes. Our findings reveal an L-shaped association between BUN/Cr levels and HRs for all-cause mortality (Turning point 17.308), when it is below the turning point (< 17.308), the low ratio reflects volume overload or renal tubular dysfunction (such as insufficient diuresis, chronic kidney disease), leading to increased cardiac burden, pulmonary edema, and increased risk of kidney injury. This may be due to surgical stress or postoperative pulmonary edema and kidney injury, which significantly increases the risk of death (HR 0.814, with an increase of 18.6% for every 1 unit decrease in risk); When the ratio is higher than the inflection point (≥ 17.308), the increase in the ratio is mainly due to successful volume management (strict fluid limitation and diuresis to achieve mild dehydration), avoiding damage to the heart caused by volume overload, and patients with good renal tubular function can tolerate this state, putting the risk of death into a safe plateau period (HR 0.985 showed no significant change), until the ratio is extremely high before it may turn harmful. The inflection point value of 17.308 has therefore become a key target for postoperative volume control. These results highlight the critical importance of managing BUN/Cr levels in the clinical care of female CABG patients.

### Year in review 2013: critical care-nephrology [^91437972]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Renal replacement therapy

In critically ill patients with AKI, urea and creatinine are not well performing indicators of renal function given the lack of steady state in terms of production and the influence of catabolism, volume status and production rates, particularly in sepsis. Consequently, physicians treating critically ill patients put an increasing emphasis on fluid overload, oliguria, impaired oxygenation and acidosis as triggers for initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) with a general trend to initiate RRT earlier in sicker patients. Thakar and colleagues performed an international survey predominantly among North American nephrologists consulting in the ICU. They evaluated practice patterns for the initiation of RRT using three different scenarios representing patients with increased severity of disease. The majority of the 172 respondents (70% USA) expressed a reticence in commencing RRT early given the lack of evidence, preferring to base their decision on absolute levels of creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (> 442 μmol/l (> 5 mg/dl), > 35.6 mmol/l (> 100 mg/dl), respectively) rather than any relative rise. Despite this, 94% of physicians reported that they would be likely to start dialysis early in patients with the highest disease burden with early RRT described as a lower BUN on commencing treatment. Thus, the proportion of physicians starting dialysis at a BUN < 75 mg/dl tripled in the more severe case. Finally, given a selection of five parameters (BUN, creatinine, urine output, oxygenation and potassium) for starting RRT, the latter two were given the highest priority, with oxygen saturation appearing as the most frequent trigger in severe cases. These results also differ from a recently published survey among 275, mainly European, intensivists. Whereas the median thresholds with regard to sCr (300 μmol/l) or urea (40 mmol/l) were similar, there was a higher priority with hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and volume overload. In addition, they demonstrated a trend towards early initiation of RRT, with the majority favoring initiation when a diagnosis of AKI was made based on AKIN/RIFLE criteria, particularly with regard to oliguria. As usual, it must be remarked that data from surveys have a high risk of self-selection of participants; however, these results should not be overlooked as they represent the view of a large panel of experts.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^0c152410]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study is the largest concerning the diagnostic performance of BCR for differentiating prerenal from intrinsic AKI. It is the first to specifically investigate BCR in an unselected population of patients admitted to the Emergency Department. We have found that BCR had no overall discriminative capacity in this setting, no matter what threshold of BCR is chosen.

Even though the rationale underlying the use of BCR is seducing, our results show that it simply doesn't work in the real world. Indeed, many factors are known to modify BCR independently of effective circulating volume. Gastro intestinal bleeding, a high protein diet, the catabolic effects of fever, trauma, infection, thyrotoxicosis, drugs such as tetracycline or corticosteroids, all increase protein turnover resulting in increased hepatic production of urea and increase BCR. Conversely, in osmotic diuresis and with the use of acetazolamide, proximal tubular reabsorption of salt and water is impaired leading to an increase in excreted urea and a decrease in BCR even in states of hypovolemia. BCR also decreases in patients with liver failure or protein malnutrition due to lower levels of BUN. One can also speculate that AKI is probably due to functional and intrinsic disease coexisting in different proportions, in a given patient at a given time. Indeed, it is assumed that a continuum exists which leads from prerenal to intrinsic AKI, the proportion of each changing over time. It can then easily be assumed that BCR would only be reliable if the underlying disease was 100% prerenal or 100% intrinsic, which is probably rarely the case.

We chose a "cut off creatinine" for inclusion of patients at 133 μmol/L. The reason for this was twofold: 1/ This threshold is recognized as the highest creatinine level one can have with a normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ie 75 mL/min per 1.73m 2. Indeed, a young (20–29 years old) black male with a creatinine of 133 μmol/L would have a normal GFR. However, all creatinine levels above 133 μmol/L are associated with altered GFRs. By including only patients with creatinine levels greater than 133 μmol/L we were sure to only include patients with renal failure. 2/ If we had included all 26,229 patients with a measured creatinine, we would have selected many healthy individuals admitted to hospital for the first time. Many patients would have met our exclusion criteria because of a short hospital stay (< 48 h) and or no baseline creatinine.

### Who's at risk? A prognostic model for severity prediction in pediatric acute pancreatitis [^e2f61e25]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the study was to validate and optimize a severity prediction model for acute pancreatitis (AP) and to examine blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level changes from admission as a severity predictor.

Study Design

Patients from 2 hospitals were included for the validation model (Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters and Children's National Hospital). Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center data were used for analysis of BUN at 24 to 48hours.

Results

The validation cohort included 73 patients; 22 (30%) with either severe or moderately severe AP, combined into the all severe AP (SAP) group. Patients with SAP had higher BUN (P = 0.002) and lower albumin (P = 0.005). Admission BUN was confirmed as a significant predictor (P = 0.005) of SAP (area under the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60–0.86). Combining BUN (P = 0.005) and albumin (P = 0.004) resulted in better prediction for SAP (AUROC 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.94). A total of 176 AP patients were analyzed at 24-48hours; 39 (22%) met criteria for SAP. Patients who developed SAP had a significantly higher BUN (P < 0.001) after 24hours. Elevated BUN levels within 24 to 48hours were independently predictive of developing SAP (AUROC: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.66–0.85). Patients who developed SAP had a significantly smaller percentage decrease in BUN from admission to 24 to 48hours (P = 0.002).

Conclusion

We externally validated the prior model with admission BUN levels and further optimized it by incorporating albumin. We also found that persistent elevation of BUN is associated with development of SAP. Our model can be used to risk stratify patients with AP on admission and again at 24 to 48hours.

Blood Urea Nitrogen BUN measurements are used in the diagnosis of certain renal and metabolic diseases. The determination of serum urea nitrogen is the most widely used test for the evaluation of kidney function. The test is frequently requested in conjunction with the serum creatinine test for the differential diagnosis of prerenal, renal, and post renal uremia. High BUN levels are associated with impaired renal function, increased protein catabolism, nephritis, intestinal obstruction, urinary obstruction, metallic poisoning, cardiac failure, peritonitis, dehydration, malignancy, pneumonia, surgical shock, Addison's disease, and uremia. Low BUN levels are associated with amyloidosis, acute liver disease, pregnancy, and nephrosis. Normal variations are observed according to a person's age and sex, the time of day, and their diet – particularly in their protein intake. Sodium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.

Total Bilirubin Elevated levels are associated with hemolytic jaundice, paroxysmal hemoglobinuria, pernicious anemia, polycythemia, icterus neonatorum, internal hemorrhage, acute hemolytic anemia, malaria, and septicemia. Low bilirubin levels are associated with aplastic anemia, and certain types of secondary anemia resulting from toxic therapy for carcinoma and chronic nephritis. Total Calcium Calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid disease, bone diseases, chronic renal disease, and tetany. Urinary calcium measurement is used in the.

### Association of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio and long-term outcome among women with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: filling gaps in female [^2af75b39]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we identified an L-shaped relationship between the BUN/Cr ratio and long-term mortality in female patients undergoing CABG, with an inflection point at approximately 17.308. It is crucial to address abnormal BUN/Cr levels in female CABG patients within clinical practice to enhance long-term survival outcomes. Future prospective validation studies are necessary to confirm these findings and further elucidate the implications for patient management.

Lastly, recognising that the UCR is reported in disparate units is also crucial. In Europe, the urea/creatinine ratio is frequently used, whereas in the United States, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratio is commonly reported. Conversion factors are available for calculating BUN, which is approximately one-half (28/60 or 0.446) of blood urea. It is essential to ensure that both BUN or urea and creatinine are reported in the same units to ensure the accuracy of the ratio calculation (Fig. 4). Standardisation in reporting facilitates comparison between studies and provides a uniform approach to assessing patient outcomes and formulating clinical decision-making.

Fig. 4
Conversion factors BUN and urea. The chemical formula of urea is CO(NH₂)₂, with a molecular weight of approximately 60. Each of the two nitrogen molecules has a weight of approximately 14 g/mol. The ratio 60/28 can be expressed as follows: To convert from BUN to urea, one must multiply by 2.14. Similarly, to convert from urea to BUN, one must divide by 2.14. To convert from mg/dL to mmol/L for BUN and urea, the value should be multiplied by the weight in mol and then multiplied by 10 to convert L to dL. For BUN, this is 2 × nitrogen (2 × 14 = 10/28 = 0.357), while for urea it is CO(NH₂)₂ (10/60 = 0.166). Both BUN and urea in mmol/L are molecular weight units and can be converted without the use of a conversion factor. All of these values are approximations and have been rounded for simplicity.

The BUN/Creatinine Ratio is a clinical calculator used in the field of nephrology and internal medicine. BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen, a waste product generated in the liver and excreted by the kidneys, while Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle metabolism and also excreted by the kidneys.

This ratio is primarily used to differentiate between prerenal and renal causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). A high BUN/Creatinine ratio (> 20:1) is typically suggestive of a prerenal cause such as dehydration or decreased blood flow to the kidneys, while a low ratio (< 10:1) is more indicative of intrinsic renal disease or postrenal obstruction.

The BUN/Creatinine Ratio is applicable to patients with suspected kidney disease or injury, or those with known renal conditions where monitoring of renal function is necessary. It is also used in the evaluation of patients with altered mental status or suspected metabolic disorders.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the BUN/Creatinine ratio, but it should be interpreted with caution in patients with liver disease, malnutrition, or those on certain medications that can affect BUN or creatinine levels. It is also important to note that this ratio is

### Analysis of prognostic risk factors in critically ill elderly patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury [^65f5dda1]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and staging of AKI still rely predominantly on serum creatinine levels and urine output, despite the inherent limitations of these indicators when used in isolation. It is well established that creatinine is a sensitive marker of glomerular filtration rate. Liu et al. demonstrated that infection-induced inflammation and renal hypoperfusion can lead to elevated creatinine levels. However, factors such as medication effects, volume status, and nutritional deficiencies may obscure the accuracy of serum creatinine concentrations, particularly in elderly patients. In this study, elderly patients with SA-AKI and serum creatinine levels ≥ 1.5 mg/dL had a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is crucial to closely monitor serum creatinine levels in elderly septic patients to assess AKI risk. Timely clinical intervention may help reduce the risk of mortality.

UCR ≥ 20 was found to be associated with poor prognosis in elderly patients with SA-AKI, consistent with previous studies. Sepsis often leads to hemodynamic instability. Under hypovolemic conditions, aberrant activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) increases renal tubular sodium and water reabsorption, reduces urea excretion, and results in elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels due to partial reabsorption of BUN in the renal tubules. Both creatinine and BUN levels are susceptible to various confounding factors. The UCR may offer greater stability and diagnostic accuracy by minimizing the influence of these variables. UCR of 10 is considered normal and clinically relevant for identifying prerenal causes of kidney injury, thereby aiding in early AKI detection and improving patient outcomes.

### Volume contracted state, mortality and functional outcomes in patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion [^17ab3648]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability globally, among the different types of strokes, acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) is the most common. AIS results from sudden occlusion in a cerebral blood vessel, leading to hypoperfusion of a brain territory, and the underlying mechanisms of AIS are influenced by complex interactions between the brain's blood flow and overall cardiovascular dynamics. The role of dehydration status, or more specifically volume contracted state (VCS), in cerebral infarction, is thought to be multifactorial. Dehydration reduces intravascular volume and increases blood viscosity, both of which may contribute to diminished cerebral perfusion in the setting of impaired autoregulation. Elevated haematocrit levels have been correlated with larger infarct sizes in patients experiencing cerebral infarction. Furthermore, VCS has been associated with an increased incidence of recurrent embolic strokes and thrombotic events, including venous thromboembolism, following an acute stroke.

The blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) is a commonly utilised indirect indicator for evaluating VCS, BUN/Cr ratio has been applied in various studies to assess VCS. Both BUN and Cr are key markers in evaluating renal function and are frequently included in electrolyte panels for patients experiencing cerebral infarction. Its potential value as a VCS marker would be significant if it could reliably predict adverse outcomes in patients with AIS. In this study, we use an elevated BUN/Cr ratio (> 20) as a surrogate biomarker of VCS, recognising that it is one of the several potential clinical or biochemical indicators of volume contraction. Thus, the primary aim of this study was to investigate the association between VCS and clinical outcomes in patients with AIS.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^03899f8c]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury evaluation and stage-based management — Initial assessment, monitoring, nephrotoxin exposure, hemodynamic assessment, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk management are outlined as follows: Laboratory parameters — including SCr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and electrolytes, complete blood count and differential — should be obtained, and urine analysis and microscopic examination as well as urinary chemistries may be helpful in determining the underlying cause of AKI; imaging tests, especially ultrasound, are important components of the evaluation for patients with AKI. Individualize frequency and duration of monitoring based on patient risk, exposure and clinical course, and it is advisable to tailor management to AKI stage. While stage-based actions provide a starting point, they are neither complete nor mandatory for an individual patient, and the measurement of urine output does not imply that the urinary bladder catheterization is mandatory for all patients. Nephrotoxic drugs account for some part of AKI in 20–30% of patients, and it seems prudent to limit exposure to these agents whenever possible and to weigh the risk of developing or worsening AKI against the risk associated with not using the agent. To ensure adequate circulating blood volume, static variables like central venous pressure are not nearly as useful as dynamic variables, such as pulse-pressure variation, inferior vena cava filling by ultrasound and echocardiographic appearance of the heart. Since AKI is a risk factor for CKD, it is important to evaluate patients with AKI for new onset or worsening of pre-existing CKD; if patients have CKD, manage patients as detailed in the KDOQI CKD Guideline (Guidelines 7–15), and if patients do not have CKD, consider them to be at increased risk for CKD and care for them as detailed in the KDIGO CKD Guideline 3 for patients at increased risk for CKD.

### Identification of early predictors for infected necrosis in acute pancreatitis [^1809ea20]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

One must also consider parameters that have been suggested as predictors of infected necrosis before but did not contribute to prediction in the current study. For instance, higher median procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations have been found in patients with infected necrosis and a complicated course of acute pancreatitis resulting in death. In our patients, overall mortality was as low as 6.7% percent, which could explain why we did not find an association. Besides, earlier findings suggest that PCT is not a specific marker of infected necrosis as it is also elevated in septic patients without pancreatitis. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that PCT levels in acute pancreatitis are elevated as part of the systemic inflammatory response and therefore not necessarily indicate infection.

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) has been reported with alleged predictive value as a rise in blood urea nitrogen within 48 h was associated with a risk for the development of infected pancreatic necrosis. Although we found an association between BUN and infected pancreatic necrosis as well, the association was weaker than with other parameters and inclusion of BUN did not further improve the prediction model. Besides analyzing BUN at a single time point, a high correlation with creatinine, another indicator of renal function and the strongest single predictor of infected necrosis in our study, could explain why BUN was not included in our final prediction model.

### Clinical significance of lower respiratory tract culture within 48 h of admission in patients with viral pneumonia: an observational study [^2e4d970b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

According to our regression analysis, patients with hemoptysis prior to hospital admission were 3.9 times more likely to have positive lower respiratory tract cultures than those without hemoptysis. It has been has been found that influenza causes significant epithelial cell damage in the lungs. Polymerase component PB1 subunit (PB1-F2) can induce mitochondrial permeabilization and apoptosis with viral infection, which can inadvertently provide nutrition to invading opportunistic bacteria, result in severe cytopathic damage, and destroy the surfactant layer in the lungs. Furthermore, it has been observed that influenza increases the sensitivity of the lower respiratory tract to pathogens, despite the fact that several processes can impact the antibacterial innate immune response. This can render both the upper airways and the lungs susceptible to subsequent bacterial infiltration, thereby leading to increased bacterial load and mortality. These processes include inhibition by type I interferons and alveolar macrophages depletion. However, after infection with influenza A, the virus replicates within epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and serves as a receptor for bacteria, which is one of the causes for the high incidence of bacterial infections. Further research is required to define the relevant mechanism.

BUN level seems to be a more sensitive indicator of infection than white blood cell count, C-reactive protein or procalcitonin, according to subgroup analysis. The BUN level is an indicator of acute renal injury, which is common in patients with moderate and severe pneumonia. In patients with pneumonia, dehydration typically leads to an increase in urea by the kidneys, and an elevated BUN level is frequently noted. The findings indicate that infection can damage the kidney. Acute kidney damage could be an early indicator of severe pneumonia complicated with sepsis. Together, these findings suggest that an elevated BUN level, and positive culture results may indicate co-infection. More research is required to confirm this hypothesis.

Limitations

There were several limitations to this study. To begin, in this study, we analyzed data retrospectively, which limited the ability to infer causality. Second, it was a single-center cohort study with a relatively small sample size. Thus, the data may not be representative of the population under study. Furthermore, the findings were restricted to this population and could not be generalized to other populations. Finally, the small sample size made multivariate analysis less robust.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^370eb991]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO AKI — timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) recommendations state to initiate RRT emergently when life‑threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance exist, and to consider the broader clinical context, the presence of conditions that can be modified with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests — rather than single BUN and creatinine thresholds alone — when making the decision to start RRT (Not Graded). The rationale notes that while no RCTs exist for dialysis for life‑threatening indications, it is widely accepted that patients with severe hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, pulmonary edema, and uremic complications should be dialyzed emergently.

### Association of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio and long-term outcome among women with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: filling gaps in female [^7c6716cb]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) has been associated with poorer outcomes in various cardiovascular diseases, including acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, its significance in female patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains largely unexplored.

Methods

We utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary outcome was long-term mortality at one, two, three, four, and five years post-surgery. The relationship between BUN/Cr and the risk of long-term mortality in patients with CABG was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards and restricted cubic spline models. Subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate the prognostic value of BUN/Cr across different patient subgroups.

Results

The study included 1,358 participants with a mean age of 70.9 years (range: 60.9–80.8) and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 30.8 kg/m² (range: 24–37.6). A one unit increase in BUN/Cr was associated with lower one-year mortality after adjusting for all covariates (hazard ratio (HR) 0.95, 95% CI 0.91–0.98). Participants in the lowest BUN/Cr category (Q1, ≤ 15) exhibited a significantly higher risk of mortality (HR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.36–5.27, p = 0.004) compared to the reference group (Q4). Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed an L-shaped relationship between BUN/Cr levels and long-term mortality, with an inflection point at 17.308. Stratified and sensitivity analyses further supported these findings.

Conclusions

These results suggest an L-shaped association between BUN/Cr and long-term mortality among female patients undergoing CABG, which will provide a unique perspective for clinical management of the special group of women undergoing CABG.

### EGFR and outcomes in patients with acute decompensated heart failure with or without elevated BUN [^9f834605]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

In patients with heart failure, the association of renal dysfunction and BUN levels with outcomes is unclear. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between the eGFR at discharge and outcomes in patients with heart failure with or without an elevated BUN level at discharge.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Of 4842 patients enrolled in the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Syndromes Registry, 4449 patients discharged alive after hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure were investigated to assess the association of eGFR in the context of serum BUN level at discharge with all-cause mortality. The enrolled patients were divided into four groups on the basis of the discharge levels of eGFR (< 45 or ≥ 45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) and BUN (≥ 25 or < 25 mg/dl). The median follow-up period after discharge was 517 (381–776) days.

Results

The all-cause mortality rate after discharge was 19.1%. After adjustment for multiple comorbidities, an eGFR < 45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) was associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality in patients with a BUN ≥ 25 mg/dl (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.33 to 1.88; P < 0.001) but not in patients with a BUN < 25 mg/dl (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.26; P = 0.84) relative to those with an eGFR ≥ 45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a BUN < 25 mg/dl. Among patients with an eGFR ≥ 45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), a BUN ≥ 25 mg/dl was associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality than a BUN < 25 mg/dl (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.73; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

We showed that elevation of BUN at discharge significantly modified the relation between eGFR at discharge and the risk of all-cause mortality after discharge, suggesting that the association between eGFR and outcomes may be largely dependent on concomitant elevation of BUN.

### A combined-biomarker approach to clinical phenotyping renal dysfunction in heart failure [^33287b1a]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Differentiating heart failure (HF) induced renal dysfunction (RD) from intrinsic kidney disease is challenging. It has been demonstrated that biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BUN/creat) can identify high- vs low-risk RD. Our objective was to determine if combining these biomarkers could further improve risk stratification and clinical phenotyping of patients with RD and HF.

Methods and Results

A total of 908 patients with a discharge diagnosis of HF were included. Median values were used to define elevated BNP (> 1296 pg/mL) and BUN/creat (> 17). In the group without RD, survival was similar regardless of BNP and BUN/creat (n = 430, adjusted P = 0.52). Similarly, in patients with both a low BNP and BUN/creat, RD was not associated with mortality (n = 250, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6–1.6, P = 0.99). However, in patients with both an elevated BNP and BUN/creat those with RD had a cardiorenal profile characterized by venous congestion, diuretic resistance, hypotension, hyponatremia, longer length of stay, greater inotrope use, and substantially worse survival compared with patients without RD (n = 249, adjusted HR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2–2.7, P = 0.008, P interaction = .005).

Conclusions

In the setting of decompensated HF, the combined use of BNP and BUN/creat stratifies patients with RD into groups with significantly different clinical phenotypes and prognosis.

### Reconsidering the urea-to-creatinine ratio as a signal of muscle catabolism in patients with cirrhosis [^c9530191]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

On the urea side, portal hypertension and hepatocellular dysfunction alter nitrogen metabolism by reducing the efficiency of ureagenesis. Ammonia disposal primarily occurs in the liver, where the urea cycle converts ammonia derived from the intestines into urea, a water-soluble compound that is excreted in the urine. Within this substrate-to-product framework, ammonia and urea are complementary biochemical indicators of the same pathway; the ammonia-to-urea (A-to-U) ratio, analogous to a simplified enzymatic system, reflects urea-cycle efficiency. Cirrhosis perturbs this system in two coordinated ways. First, increased intrahepatic vascular resistance and the formation of portosystemic shunts reduce the delivery of portal ammonia to hepatocytes, thereby impairing hepatic clearance and leading to elevated systemic ammonia levels. Second, impaired hepatocellular function reduces urea-cycle throughput, resulting in lower circulating urea levels for a given nitrogen load. The combined effect produces a biochemical profile characterized by elevated ammonia and disproportionately low urea levels. Clinically, this explains why patients with cirrhosis may exhibit a low or "normal" UCR, not because protein catabolism is minimal, but because the hepatic capacity to convert ammonia into urea is limited. The A-to-U ratio reflects this physiology, and values greater than 1.53 mg/g have been independently associated with clinically significant portal hypertension. Specific complications, however, can modify this pattern. Gastrointestinal bleeding related to portal hypertension, such as variceal hemorrhage, delivers a substantial nitrogen load to the portal circulation through the digestion and intestinal reabsorption of hemoglobin. This nitrogen input functions as an exogenous source from the perspective of hepatic metabolism, increasing ureagenesis and raising plasma urea independently of muscle catabolism. Under these conditions, an elevated UCR signals exogenous nitrogen influx and prerenal dynamics rather than impaired amino acid utilization or enhanced protein breakdown (Fig 1)

### Hyponatremia and worsening sodium levels are associated with long-term outcome in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure [^ad72c70f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Subgroup Analyses

Whereas renal function is a major determinant of serum sodium levels in AHF, 25 Lee et al. clarified a significant interaction between blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and improved hyponatremia. 11 However, improved hyponatremia was related to better outcomes only in subjects with elevated BUN. Because elevated BUN is a complex indicator related to impaired left ventricular function, poor renal function, inadequate kidney perfusion, hypovolemia, hyperprotein diet, and even gastrointestinal bleeding, the interaction between renal function and hyponatremia remains a controversy. In this study, we illustrated that both on‐admission hyponatremia and drop of sodium levels during hospitalization consistently correlated with worse long‐term outcomes both in the elderly and the young, in men and women, in patients with reduced or preserved LVEF, and in patients with preserved or impaired renal function. In addition, there was a trend that hyponatremia carried a higher risk in the elderly than in the young.

### Association and risk of blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio with congestive heart failure in critically ill COPD patients [^5f05d608]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The association between BCR and COPD with CHF comorbidity is likely driven by complex pathophysiological mechanisms. COPD patients frequently experience chronic hypoxemia and systemic inflammatory responses. Hypoxemia induces endothelial dysfunction in the kidneys and disrupts the oxygen supply-demand balance in renal tubules, thereby exacerbating ischemic renal injury. Furthermore, the systemic inflammatory response, regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokineslike tumor necrosis factor-αand interleukin-6, increases oxidative stress in the kidney, promotes fibrosis, as well as triggers endothelial dysfunction, further impairing renal function. Under the combined effects of hypoxemia and inflammation, reduced renal blood flow diminishes the GFR, potentially inducing renal damage and chronic kidney disease. This deterioration in renal function, reflected by elevated BCR, can increase cardiac load, ultimately promoting the development of CHF and negatively impacting patient survival.

It is noteworthy that CHF and renal insufficiency alone cannot fully explain the adverse effects of elevated BCR. Accelerated catabolic processes, which increase with age, may also lead to higher BCR in elderly patients. Aging correlates with the progressive breakdown of proteins (albumin, hemoglobin, ferritin), leading to elevated BUN and potentially higher BCR. This finding aligns with our results, as the majority of COPD patients with CHF comorbidity were elderly (median [IQR] = 74, p < 0.0001), which may partially explain the higher BCR in this population. Moreover, CHF itself may further elevate BCR by causing impaired renal perfusion and inducing tubular dysfunction. This vicious cycle may be particularly evident in COPD patients with CHF. Therefore, closely monitoring of renal function in this patient population is essential.

### The link between alcohol consumption and kidney injury [^c0a56dfa]. The American Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Alcohol consumption contributes to systemic organ dysfunction, but its direct effect on kidney health is unclear. Epidemiological studies show inconsistent findings due to reliance on conventional markers like serum creatinine (sCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), which are insensitive to early chronic kidney disease (CKD) and influenced by factors such as muscle mass, diet, and hydration status. Experimental studies indicate that alcohol may directly exacerbate renal damage through mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Furthermore, indirect effects from alcohol-induced altered intestinal permeability and microbiome, liver injury, microcirculatory/cardiac dysfunction and muscle damage may also facilitate kidney damage. Notably, alcohol-related liver disease can lead to hepatorenal syndrome, a severe form of kidney dysfunction driven by circulatory disturbances and systemic inflammation. This overview explores the adverse effects of alcohol misuse on kidney health and disease, emphasizing the need for comprehensive epidemiological studies with more sensitive kidney injury biomarkers. It also highlights the importance of using clinically relevant preclinical models to clarify the underlying mechanisms of alcohol-related kidney injury and to enhance our understanding of its long-term clinical consequences.

### Defining community acquired pneumonia severity on presentation to hospital: an international derivation and validation study [^f36dbf06]. Thorax (2003). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "CURB-65 score" for community-acquired pneumonia.

The CURB-65 score is a clinical prediction rule that has been validated for predicting mortality in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The name CURB-65 is an acronym for each of the risk factors measured. These include: Confusion of new onset (defined as an AMTS of 8 or less), Urea greater than 7 mmol/L, Respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or greater, Blood pressure less than 90 systolic or diastolic blood pressure 60 or less, and age 65 or older.

This scoring system is used in the adult population, specifically those diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. The CURB-65 score helps clinicians decide the appropriate level of medical care for a patient with CAP, whether that be home treatment, hospitalization, or intensive care.

The CURB-65 score may not be suitable for use in patients with certain conditions that could independently affect the score variables, such as chronic respiratory or kidney disease. It also may not be appropriate for use in immunocompromised patients, as their clinical presentation and disease course may differ from the general population.

The CURB-65 score is a clinical tool used to evaluate the severity of pneumonia and guide treatment decisions. It assesses five key factors, assigning 1 point to each if the condition is present. The total score, which can range from 0 to 5, determines mortality risk and treatment recommendations.

- **Confusion**: If the patient exhibits new or worsening confusion, this signs results in a score of 1 point.
- **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)**: An elevated BUN level above 19 mg/dL (or 7 mmol/L) contributes 1 point.
- **Respiratory Rate**: A respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or more also scores 1 point.
- **Blood Pressure**: If the systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mmHg or the diastolic is 60 mmHg or lower, 1 point is assigned.
- **Age**: Patients aged 65 years or older receive a score of 1 point.

Summing these points provides the total CURB-65 score. The interpretation of this score is crucial for determining the appropriate level of care:

- Scores of 0 or 1 indicate a low risk of mortality, suggesting that outpatient treatment may be appropriate.
- A score of 2 suggests moderate risk, warranting consideration for hospital admission.
- Scores of 3 or higher reflect a high risk of mortality, necessitating evaluation for potential intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

This scoring system helps clinicians make informed decisions based on a structured assessment of pneumonia severity.

### Biomarkers for the diagnosis of acute kidney injury [^28d097b8]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The identification of acute kidney injury relies on tests like blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine that were identified and incorporated into clinical practice several decades ago. This review summarizes clinical studies of newer biomarkers that may permit earlier and more accurate identification of acute kidney injury.

Recent Findings

The urine may contain sensitive and specific markers of kidney injury that are present due to either impaired tubular reabsorption and catabolism of filtered molecules or release of tubular cell proteins in response to ischemic or nephrotoxic injury. Many potential markers have been studied. Promising injury markers in the urine include N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, kidney injury molecule-1, and interleukin-18. Serum cystatin C may be a better measure of glomerular filtration rate than serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen.

Summary

New biomarkers of kidney injury and glomerular filtration rate hold the promise of substantially improving the diagnostic approach to acute kidney injury. Adequately powered clinical studies of multiple biomarkers are needed to qualify the biomarkers before they can be fully adopted in clinical practice. Once adopted, more sensitive biomarkers of acute kidney injury hold the potential to transform the care of patients with renal disease.

### Association of acute kidney injury with the severity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a meta-analysis [^6e16df46]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

we aimed to explore the relationship of acute kidney injury (AKI) with the severity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, MedRxiv Database. We compared the laboratory indicators of renal impairment and incidences of AKI in the severe versus non-severe cases, and survival versus non-survival cases, respectively.

Results

In 41 studies with 10,335 COVID-19 patients, the serum creatinine (sCr) in severe cases was much higher than that in non-severe cases (SMD = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.29–0.39), with a similar trend for blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (SMD = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.51–0.81), hematuria (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.15–2.19), and proteinuria (OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.58–5.38). The estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased significantly in severe cases compared with non-severe cases (SMD = -0.45, 95% CI: -0.67- -0.23). Moreover, the pooled OR of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and AKI prevalence for severe vs. non-severe cases was 12.99 (95%CI: 4.03–41.89) and 13.16 (95%CI: 10.16–17.05), respectively. Additionally, 11 studies with 3759 COVID-19 patients were included for analysis of disease mortality. The results showed the levels of sCr and BUN in non-survival cases remarkably elevated compared with survival patients, respectively (SMD = 0.97, SMD = 1.49). The pooled OR of CRRT and AKI prevalence for non-survival vs. survival cases was 31.51 (95%CI: 6.55–151.59) and 77.48 (95%CI: 24.52–244.85), respectively.

Conclusions

AKI is closely related with severity and mortality of COVID-19, which gives awareness for doctors to pay more attention for risk screening, early identification and timely treatment of AKI.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^95ff6101]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy — impact of residual urea clearance (Kr) on BUN dynamics is described as follows: residual kidney function (RKF) contributes little to the decrease in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) during dialysis, but Kr lowers the predialysis BUN level during the long interdialysis interval; when Kr is zero the interdialysis BUN rise is linear in the absence of fluid gain, whereas if Kr is greater than zero the interdialysis increase is curvilinear and concave downward, yielding a lower predialysis BUN so less hemodialysis (HD) is required to maintain the same average BUN level.

### The correlation study between blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio and prognosis of patients with sepsis during hospitalization [^f9b21b37]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

In recent years, blood urea nitrogen to albumin ratio (B/A) has been discovered to be an important prognostic biomarker, combining urea nitrogen with albumin, two important predictors. Previously, studies on the prognosis of disease based on B/A have focused primarily on lung diseases, such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and lung cancer, and it has been established that elevated B/A had a high predictive value for mortality. The recent studies have also demonstrated that elevated B/A may play a role in prognosticating chronic heart failure, Escherichia coli bacteremia, and gastrointestinal bleeding, which also broaden our perspective. A study of 1253 elderly emergency department patients identified B/A as an independent predictor of ICU mortality. The comorbidities of the patients included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, and tumors. This also confirmed that B/A might have a certain predictive value for the prognosis of various diseases, and might even be an independent predictor of some severe diseases.

However, there is no research report on the B/A value for the prognosis evaluation of patients with sepsis, and this study may be the first report in this area. The results showed that the patients with sepsis in the non-survivors group had higher B/A values and more comorbidities than those in the survivors group. RCS showed that the risk of ICU all-cause mortality increased with the B/A level, showing a non-linear trend. The mortality rate in the high B/A group was significantly higher than that in the low B/A group. Kaplan–Meier curves revealed that compared with the low B/A group, the ICU cumulative survival rate of patients with sepsis was significantly lower in the high B/A group. Further analysis of multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression showed that an elevated B/A (≥ 7.93) was an independent factor associated with ICU mortality among patients with sepsis. In conclusion, this study provided a preliminary indication of correlation between elevated B/A levels and ICU all-cause mortality in patients with sepsis.

The association of ALT/AST ratio, BUN and BUN/Cr ratio with depression

Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that elevated ALT/AST ratios remained significantly associated with increased depression risk after full covariate adjustment (Model 3, Table 2), demonstrating a 106% risk elevation per unit increase (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.41–3.01, P < 0.001). Conversely, ​​elevated BUN (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.79–0.89, P < 0.001) and BUN/Cr ratio (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94–0.98, P < 0.001) demonstrated a 16% and 4% reduction in depression risk per unit increase, respectively.

### Hypoalbuminemia and acute kidney injury: a meta-analysis of observational clinical studies [^f41cf154]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Albumin and AKI

Lower serum albumin was a significant independent predictor of AKI development. With each 10 g L −1 decrement in serum albumin the odds of AKI increased by 134% (pooled OR, 2.34; CI, 1.74–3.14). The odds of AKI development were more than doubled in association with lower albumin among the six studies of surgical or ICU patients and nearly tripled among studies in other hospital settings. Serum albumin was the first or second most powerful independent predictor of AKI in 7 of the 11 studies evaluating this end point (Fig. 2).

Significant heterogeneity was present (p < 0.001), confirming the appropriateness of the random effects model. Approximately two-thirds of the total variance was attributable to heterogeneity (I 2 67.9%). There was no evidence of publication bias (p = 0.21). Heterogeneity persisted among studies on surgical and ICU patients (p = 0.001; I 2 75.7%) but not on other indications (p = 0.32; I 2 14.9%).

The increase in odds of AKI associated with lower serum album was greater among studies with prospective design and larger size (Table 3). Significant heterogeneity was absent in both the prospective (p = 0.56; I 2 0%) and larger (p = 0.33; I 2 13.3%) studies, but remained present in the retrospective (p < 0.001; I 2 76.5%) and smaller (p = 0.002; I 2 71.2%) studies. The differences between recent and older studies and between studies adopting AKI definitions based on fixed versus graded SCr increases were relatively minor (Table 3).

### Relation between renal function and response to cardiac resynchronization therapy in multicenter automatic defibrillator implantation trial – cardiac resynchronization therapy (MADIT-CRT) [^2db4e126]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiorenal interactions have been shown to affect outcome in heart failure patients but were not related to response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to test our hypothesis that assessment of markers of prerenal failure may help identify mildly symptomatic HF patients with diminished effective circulating blood volume who will benefit from CRT.

Methods

The benefit of CRT with a defibrillator (CRT-D) as compared with defibrillator-only therapy in reducing the risk of HF or death was assessed by renal function parameters (including serum creatinine [SCr], blood urea nitrogen [BUN], and the ratio of BUN to SCr [BUN:SCr], dichotomized at median values and into approximate quartiles) among 1,803 patients enrolled in the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy.

Results

Multivariate analysis showed that the benefit of CRT-D was inversely related to SCr levels and directly related to BUN levels. Combined assessment of the two renal function parameters showed a significant difference in the benefit of CRT-D between patients with low (≤ 18 mg/dL, HR = 0.85, P = 0.28) and elevated (> 18 mg/dL, HR = 0.46, P < .001) BUN:SCr (P-value for interaction = .005). Consistently, the benefit of CRT-D was significantly increased with increasing quartiles of BUN:SCr (Q(1): HR = 1.06 [P = 0.79], Q(2): HR = 0.64 [P = 0.04], Q(3): HR = 0.47 [P < .001], Q(4): HR = 0.44 [P < .001]; P-value for trend = .005).

Conclusions

In MADIT-CRT, patients with an elevated ratio of BUN to SCr experienced a significantly greater reduction in the risk of HF or death with CRT-D therapy as compared with patients with a low ratio. These findings suggest an association between prerenal function and response to CRT.
