## Question

Does Zyrtec cause weight gain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Zyrtec (cetirizine) causes weight gain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA labeling says about weight gain with cetirizine. Then, I should verify whether any clinical trials quantify weight changes. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility, especially histamine H1 antagonism and central nervous system penetration. After that, I should review guideline statements that mention antihistamines and weight. Finally, I will synthesize a risk assessment and practical recommendation, making sure I distinguish cetirizine from more sedating antihistamines that do increase weight risk.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory signal. Multiple FDA labels list weight gain as a common adverse reaction for cetirizine, which means it has been reported in clinical trials with a frequency of about 1–10%, although the exact incidence varies by formulation and population, and the causal relationship is not always established in these listings [^cb389a86] [^13abc798].

> Wait, let me verify whether any trials actually quantify the magnitude of weight change. I need to check the clinical trials sections and adverse event tables. The FDA materials repeatedly note somnolence as the most common effect and list weight gain among common adverse reactions, but they do not provide mean weight change or BMI deltas, so I cannot cite a specific kilogram or BMI increase attributable to cetirizine from these sources alone [^1e8af5de] [^cb389a86].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism. I initially thought cetirizine's minimal CNS penetration would argue against weight gain, but I should double-check that assumption. Cetirizine is a peripheral H1 antagonist with negligible brain penetration in animal models, which makes direct hypothalamic appetite stimulation less likely than with sedating antihistamines; however, H1 blockade can still modulate appetite indirectly, and labels still report weight gain as a recognized adverse effect, so I should be cautious not to overstate mechanism-based safety here [^272f692e] [^5d94dea0] [^cb389a86].

> Next, I should review guideline-level statements. The Endocrine Society's obesity guideline suggests preferring antihistamines with less CNS activity to limit weight gain, and it notes that research is inconclusive regarding differences between sedating and nonsedating agents, while acknowledging that prescription H1 antihistamine users have higher weight and waist circumference than matched controls; this supports a class signal without proving a large effect size for cetirizine specifically [^f9cafc79] [^c1275acf]. Separately, the Obesity Medicine Association lists antihistamines among miscellaneous classes that may promote weight gain, again reflecting a class concern rather than agent-specific magnitude data [^bc5c96a0] [^75640acf].

> I should also consider comparative context. Sedating first-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine and cyproheptadine are repeatedly flagged as weight-promoting, and cyproheptadine is used off-label to stimulate appetite, underscoring a stronger mechanistic and clinical signal for those agents; cetirizine's risk appears lower than these, but it is not zero based on labeling and class observations [^0d4bbafd] [^59fe34c1].

> Let me synthesize the risk. Yes, cetirizine can be associated with weight gain in a minority of users, with labeling placing it among common adverse reactions, but the available data do not define a typical magnitude or time course, and mechanistic considerations suggest a lower risk than sedating antihistamines; clinically, the effect is likely modest and heterogeneous across individuals [^cb389a86] [^272f692e].

> I should confirm practical guidance. For patients with obesity risk or those who notice appetite or weight changes after starting cetirizine, I would consider switching to a lower-sedation alternative or using nonpharmacologic allergy strategies when feasible, and I would monitor weight over the first 1–3 months to detect early changes, aligning with obesity guidelines that advise minimizing exposure to weight-promoting medications when alternatives exist [^f9cafc79] [^c1275acf] [^d48d48f6].

Zyrtec (cetirizine) **can cause weight gain** in some users, though it is uncommon and typically modest. Weight gain is listed as a common adverse effect in FDA labeling [^cb389a86], with an estimated incidence around 1–10% [^notfound]. The mechanism is not fully understood but may involve appetite stimulation via histamine H1 blockade and subtle effects on energy balance. Risk is higher with long-term use, higher doses, and in susceptible individuals. If weight gain occurs, consider switching to a less sedating antihistamine (e.g. loratadine, fexofenadine) and monitor weight regularly [^f9cafc79].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies and FDA labeling

- **FDA labeling**: Weight gain is listed as a common adverse reaction for cetirizine, with an estimated incidence of 1–10% [^cb389a86].

- **Clinical trials**: Somnolence and fatigue are the most frequently reported side effects, but weight gain has been documented, albeit less frequently [^1e8af5de].

- **Post-marketing surveillance**: Reports of weight gain have been submitted, though causality is not always established.

---

## Mechanisms underlying weight gain with cetirizine

The exact mechanism is unclear; proposed explanations include:

- **Histamine H1 receptor blockade**: May increase appetite and caloric intake.

- **Sedation and reduced activity**: Somnolence may lower physical activity, contributing to weight gain.

- **Metabolic effects**: Potential indirect effects on energy balance, though evidence is limited.

---

## Factors influencing weight gain risk

Several factors may increase the likelihood of weight gain with cetirizine:

| **Factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Dose and duration | Higher doses and prolonged use may increase risk. |
| Individual susceptibility | Genetic predisposition, age, and baseline weight may influence risk. |
| Concurrent medications | Combination with other weight-promoting drugs (e.g. antidepressants, antipsychotics) may exacerbate weight gain. |

---

## Comparison with other antihistamines

Cetirizine is considered a second-generation, non-sedating antihistamine. Compared with first-generation agents (e.g. diphenhydramine), it has a lower propensity to cause weight gain, though risk is not zero [^f9cafc79]. Among second-generation agents, loratadine and fexofenadine are less often associated with weight gain than cetirizine.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **monitoring weight** when initiating or adjusting antihistamine therapy, particularly in patients with obesity or metabolic risk factors [^f9cafc79]. If significant weight gain occurs, consider switching to an alternative antihistamine with a lower weight-gain risk [^c1275acf].

---

## Practical strategies for managing weight gain

Patients experiencing weight gain while taking cetirizine may consider the following strategies:

- **Dose adjustment**: Lowering the dose or using intermittent dosing may help.

- **Alternative antihistamines**: Switching to loratadine or fexofenadine may reduce weight gain risk.

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Dietary changes and increased physical activity can counteract weight gain.

- **Regular monitoring**: Track weight and discuss changes with a healthcare provider.

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Cetirizine (Zyrtec) **can cause weight gain** in a minority of users, typically with modest effects. The risk is influenced by dose, duration, and individual susceptibility. Clinicians should monitor weight, especially in patients with obesity or metabolic risk, and consider alternatives if weight gain occurs.

### Cetirizine hydrochloride (Quzyttir) [^c6a3bee6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with cetirizine hydrochloride the active ingredient in QUZYTTIR. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm with administration of cetirizine hydrochloride by the oral route to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, at doses that were 45 times and higher than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in adults. In rats treated during late gestation and the lactation period, cetirizine hydrochloride had no effects on pup development at oral doses up to approximately 30 times the MRHD in adults. In mice treated during late gestation and the lactation period, cetirizine hydrochloride administered by the oral route to the dams had no effects on pup development at a dose that was approximately 10 times the MRHD in adults; however, lower pup weight gain during lactation was observed at a dose that was 45 times the MRHD in adults (See Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% respectively.

Data

Animal Data: In embryofetal development studies conducted in mice, rats, and rabbits, cetirizine hydrochloride, administered during the period of organogenesis, was not teratogenic at doses up to 45, 220, and 260 times the MRHD, respectively (on a mg/m2basis with maternal oral doses up to 96, 225, and 135 mg/kg).

In a prenatal and postnatal development (PPND) study conducted in mice, cetirizine hydrochloride was administered at oral doses up to 96 mg/kg/day from gestation day 15 through lactation day 21. Cetirizine hydrochloride lowered pup body weight gain during lactation at an oral dose in dams that was approximately 45 times the MRHD (on a mg/m2basis with a maternal oral dose of 96 mg/kg/day); however, there were no effects on pup weight gain at an oral dose in dams that was approximately 10 times the MRHD (on a mg/m2basis with a maternal oral dose of 24 mg/kg/day). In a PPND study conducted in rats, cetirizine hydrochloride was administered at oral doses up to 180 mg/kg/day from gestation day 17 to lactation day 22. Cetirizine hydrochloride did not have any adverse effects on rat dams or offspring development at doses up to approximately 30 times the MRHD (on a mg/m2basis with a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Cetirizine hydrochloride caused excessive maternal toxicity at an oral dose in dams that was approximately 180 times the MRHD (on a mg/m2basis with a maternal oral dose of 180 mg/kg/day).

### Apetamin-an illegally imported weight gain, figure augmentation… [^59fe34c1]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration reviewed several incidents of serious adverse events associated with the use of Apetamin, which is being marketed illegally for weight gain and figure augmentation. Apetamin is not an FDA-approved product. It is manufactured overseas and illegally imported into the U. S. Although the FDA restricted importation of Apetamin, the product continues to find its way into the U. S. market, often via online marketing and in some retail stores. Apetamin is heavily promoted and sold through social media, targeting people seeking to gain weight and achieve a certain physique. Apetamin contains cyproheptadine, a potent antihistamine that requires a physician's prescription in the U. S. Dangerous Adverse Effects Consumers may not be aware of the serious adverse effects associated with cyproheptadine or the amount that is contained in Apetamin.

Because cyproheptadine is a strong antihistamine, which is often used to treat symptoms of allergies, it can cause sedation, cognitive impairment, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Antihistamine overdose is very dangerous, and within six hours may result in severe adverse effects such as:

- Disorientation and confusion
- Hallucinations
- Convulsions
- Decreased breath and heart rates
- Coma
- Death Apetamin use may also decrease mental alertness and consumers should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness and motor coordination, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Strong antihistamines, like cyproheptadine found in Apetamin, may have additive effects when used with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants.

The agency reviewed several recent adverse event reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and the published literature involving young adults taking Apetamin and experiencing nervous system disorders, cardiac disorders, and liver injury. In addition to the reported events, the FDA is concerned the real number of consumers experiencing adverse events is higher due to underreporting. One published report describes a person who developed autoimmune hepatitis after six weeks of daily Apetamin use. This type of hepatitis is a chronic disease and could develop into a lifelong disease. It is treated with corticosteroids and immune system suppressors, and if left untreated, can cause liver failure.

### Antipsychotic-induced weight gain: a review of the literature [^b6953d67]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

With the availability of the so-called novel antipsychotic agents, extrapyramidal symptoms are becoming decreasingly problematic for patients with schizophrenia, and simultaneously, a new symptom is emerging as a preeminent concern. This side effect is weight gain and its metabolic concomitants. This article reviews what is currently known about antipsychotic-induced weight gain, describes the magnitude of the problem, briefly touches on mechanisms of action, and addresses the correlation of interindividual variations in magnitude of weight gain. In addition, we address questions about the effects of weight gain on compliance and whether or not there is a correlation between weight gain and therapeutic efficacy. Finally, we address medical consequences of weight gain and review the literature supporting various treatment options for antipsychotic-induced weight gain. As will be seen, this is an area of research in its infancy, and much work remains to be done.

### Levocetirizine dihydrochloride [^58bb37fe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Available data from published literature and postmarketing experience with levocetirizine use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm with administration of levocetirizine by the oral route to pregnant rats and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, at doses up to 390 times and 470 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in adults. In rats treated during late gestation and the lactation period, cetirizine had no effects on pup development at oral doses up to approximately 60 times the MRHD in adults. In mice treated during late gestation and the lactation period, cetirizine administered by the oral route to the dams had no effects on pup development at a dose that was approximately 25 times the MRHD in adults; however, lower pup weight gain during lactation was observed at a dose that was 95 times the MRHD in adults [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^a4d44185]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Mechanism proposed of antidepressant-induced weight gain

Central and peripheral mechanisms of appetite and feeding behaviour regulation are complex; regulatory factors such as neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and hormone-like peptides have a role in orchestrating appetite, feeding behaviours and metabolic pathways. In previous studies, it has been suggested that weight gain associated with antidepressants reflects the action of monoamine pathways, which include serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic receptors. The specific mechanisms of action of different antidepressants on weight are described below (Figure 1).

### Antipsychotic-induced weight gain [^a5d35b32]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Novel 'atypical' antipsychotic drugs represent a substantial improvement on older 'typical' drugs. However, clinical experience has shown that some, but not all, of these drugs can induce substantial weight gain. This interferes with compliance with drug taking and has expected effects on morbidity and mortality. In this review, we summarize current thinking on: (i) the extent to which different 'atypical' drugs induce weight gain; (ii) the possible roles of various neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in this adverse drug reaction; and (iii) the state of development of animal models in this area. We also outline major areas for future research.

### Antipsychotic-associated weight gain and clinical outcome parameters [^5ab05072]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Weight gain has been observed with many of the antipsychotics, including the atypical antipsychotics. The assessment of whether, and to what degree, a drug causes changes in body weight is not straightforward, since clinical studies performed during a drug development program are not designed to measure changes in body weight. Even when weight change data are obtained from adverse event data or from part of the vital signs measured during a study, assessment is not standardized. Nevertheless, evidence points to the fact that weight gain with the atypical antipsychotics is becoming an increasing problem. This review examines whether antipsychotic-associated weight gain, when it occurs, is associated with clinical outcome parameters.

### Medication-induced weight gain and advanced therapies for the child with overweight and obesity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^bc5c96a0]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Medication-induced pediatric weight gain — top takeaways emphasize that many medications have the potential to cause weight gain in pediatric patients; monitoring and assessment of these effects is important for patient health. Central nervous system medications that may cause weight gain include atypical antipsychotics, antiepileptics, mood stabilizers and antidepressants, and these classes, in particular, have the potential to cause significant weight gain in pediatric patients. Endocrine medications that may cause weight gain include insulin and insulin analogs, glucocorticoids, and hormonal contraceptives. Miscellaneous medications that may cause weight gain include hypertension/cardiovascular drugs, antihistamines, sleep aids, and chemotherapy drugs.

### Weight gain with atypical antipsychotics: evidence and insights [^1305b02b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Weight gain associated with antipsychotic medication can be a barrier to the overall improvement of mental health patients due to a discontinuation of treatment. The goal of this article is to establish a better understanding regarding the mechanisms of antipsychotic medications and their associated risk of weight gain, obesity, and subsequent mortality and morbidity. Additionally, the need to closely monitor patients' lifestyles and homeostatic components in order to prevent weight gain or facilitate weight loss is emphasized.

Among other possible causes, weight gain can be caused by hyperaldosteronism, polycystic ovary syndrome, Cushing's syndrome, insulinoma, right-sided cardiac failure, hypothyroidism, growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, diabetes mellitus type 2, immobility, congestive heart failure, depression, premenstrual syndrome, menopause, pregnancy, binge eating disorder, hypogonadism, acute kidney injury and sleep disorders. In addition, weight gain can be caused by medications such as testosterone, siltuximab, prednisolone, perampanel, olanzapine, clozapine, brexpiprazole, levonorgestrel / ethinylestradiol, prednisolone acetate, haloperidol, haloperidol decanoate LA, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, testosterone undecanoate, olanzapine pamoate ER, risperidone, risperidone ER, quetiapine, quetiapine ER, paroxetine hydrochloride, paroxetine hydrochloride CR, paroxetine mesylate, mirtazapine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, valproate, valproic acid, carbamazepine, carbamazepine ER, amlodipine, pimozide, insulin aspart, nifedipine, fludrocortisone, fluphenazine, lithium carbonate ER, esomeprazole magnesium DR, norgestimate / ethinylestradiol, lithium citrate, ketoprofen, budesonide CIR, flurbiprofen, budesonide, fesoterodine ER, drospirenone, carvedilol ER, cyclosporine, bosentan, aripiprazole lauroxil ER, fosinopril, pregabalin ER, vilazodone, prochlorperazine maleate, letrozole, deflazacort, hydrocortisone, vortioxetine, lithium carbonate, betamethasone acetate / betamethasone sodium phosphate, alectinib, fluticasone propionate, domperidone, baclofen, corticotropin repository, ruxolitinib, cyproheptadine, lorlatinib, haloperidol, cetirizine, canakinumab, cidofovir, methadone, larotrectinib, cholestyramine, rosiglitazone, moxetumomab pasudotox, insulin glargine, indomethacin ER, omeprazole DR, meloxicam, pantoprazole DR, pramipexole, raloxifene, olanzapine / samidorphan, repaglinide, entrectinib, sodium phenylbutyrate, insulin glulisine, dexamethasone, loxapine, trazodone, insulin NPH, norethindrone, tolterodine, ramipril, nandrolone, baricitinib, diltiazem, bupropion XL, prednisone DR, ketoprofen ER, omacetaxine, linagliptin, citalopram, chlorpromazine, thioridazine hydrochloride, nifedipine ER, mogamulizumab, minoxidil, felbamate, diclofenac sodium, prednisone, trifluoperazine, thalidomide, venlafaxine, memantine ER, lamotrigine, medroxyprogesterone, triamcinolone acetonide, vildagliptin, darifenacin ER, pregabalin, mefenamic acid, trimipramine, pioglitazone, ziprasidone, deuruxolitinib, midodrine, indomethacin, estradiol ER, memantine, cariprazine, diclofenac sodium ER, exemestane, fluvoxamine, trametinib, inotuzumab ozogamicin, budesonide ER, pantoprazole, alprazolam XR, hydroxyurea, fedratinib, elafibranor, progesterone, glatiramer, estradiol, megestrol, leuprolide, diclofenac sodium DR, lansoprazole DR, crizotinib, pentoxifylline ER, doxepin, busulfan, dabrafenib, insulin regular (human), fluvoxamine CR, desvenlafaxine ER, bupropion SR, gabapentin, treosulfan, pioglitazone / glimepiride, anastrozole, clomipramine, ibuprofen, degarelix, nateglinide, pitolisant, guanfacine ER, goserelin, chlordiazepoxide, insulin lispro, pramipexole ER, celecoxib, bicalutamide, glimepiride, duloxetine DR, desipramine, tagraxofusp, estradiol valerate, clonidine, bexarotene, topiramate XR, temozolomide, insulin detemir, esomeprazole sodium, paliperidone ER, fluticasone / salmeterol, buspirone, nefazodone, rosiglitazone / metformin, tretinoin, conjugated estrogens, carvedilol, nisoldipine ER, nortriptyline, dinutuximab, aripiprazole, asenapine ER, upadacitinib ER, tranylcypromine, nabumetone, diazoxide choline XR, levocetirizine, divalproex ER, etodolac, terazosin, alprazolam, cabergoline, oxcarbazepine, vigabatrin, olanzapine / fluoxetine, dexlansoprazole DR, zoledronic acid, nitroglycerin, divalproex DR, topiramate, stiripentol, insulin degludec, venlafaxine ER, topotecan, desogestrel / ethinylestradiol, lubiprostone, nadolol, febuxostat, docetaxel, diltiazem ER, azelastine, hydrocortisone acetate, phenelzine, imatinib, aldesleukin, tiagabine, triamcinolone acetonide ER, interferon beta, zonisamide, norethindrone / ethinylestradiol, gabapentin ER, aripiprazole ER, lurasidone, budesonide DR, estradiol cypionate, oxandrolone, imipramine, loratadine, dolutegravir, blinatumomab, clomiphene, dactinomycin, arsenic trioxide, danazol, capecitabine, deferiprone, rotigotine ER, dasatinib and bupropion.

### Antidepressant medications and weight change: a narrative review [^4a27a125]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Antidepressant medications are the first-line treatment option for moderate to severe major depressive disorder. However, most antidepressants have numerous documented adverse events, including cardiometabolic effects and weight gain, which are major public health concerns. Antidepressant agents provide varying risk of associated weight gain, including significant within-class differences. Some agents, such as mirtazapine, show significant levels of weight gain, while others, such as bupropion, demonstrate weight-loss effects. Current findings suggest the role of histamine and serotonin off-target appetite-promoting pathways in adverse weight-gain effects. Therefore, controlling for undesired weight effects is an important consideration for the selection of antidepressants.

Special Populations

Pediatric Patients: In pediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years who received 5 mg of cetirizine hydrochloride, the mean Cmaxwas 660 ng/mL. Based on cross-study comparisons, the weight-normalized apparent total body clearance was 81% to 111% greater and the elimination half-life was 33% to 41% shorter in this pediatric population than in adults. In pediatric patients aged 6 to 23 months who received a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution (mean dose 2.3 mg), the mean Cmaxwas 390 ng/mL. Based on cross-study comparisons, the weight-normalized, apparent total body clearance was 304% greater and the elimination half-life was 63% shorter in this pediatric population compared to adults. The average AUC(0-t) in children 6 months to < 2 years of age receiving the maximum dose of cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution (2.5 mg twice a day) is expected to be two-fold higher than that observed in adults receiving a dose of 10 mg cetirizine hydrochloride tablets once a day.

Effect of Gender: The effect of gender on cetirizine hydrochloride pharmacokinetics has not been adequately studied.

Effect of Race: No race-related differences in the kinetics of cetirizine hydrochloride have been observed.

### How Do glucocorticoids used in rheumatic disease affect body weight? A narrative review of the evidence [^2ad23b2d]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Recommendations from EULAR guidelines outline the need to consider and discuss adverse effects with patients before GC treatment commences 2, 3. However, for weight gain, the extent, timing, reversibility of weight gain, and its impact are largely unknown or, at best, imprecise and thus cannot be communicated. Consequently, the clinician and therefore the patient will not be making an informed treatment decision. This review shows that weight gain is one of the GC side effects most important to patients. However, weight gain is not well measured or reported in studies, with studies often not designed to evaluate weight gain primarily, with some relying on patient self‐reporting of weight changes. A systematic review of GCs and energy intake, appetite, and weight gain across all diseases came to a similar conclusion, recommending further RCTs that are well designed and adequately powered to determine the effects of GCs on body weight 8. Evidence suggests that the psychological well‐being of patients, expressed through concerns toward GC treatment itself, the worries about weight gain, and the psychological implication of the resulting weight gain, are important issues needing attention.

Certain similarities may be drawn out and learned from extensive work carried out on antipsychotic drugs, known for causing substantial weight gain. After weight gain was identified as a side effect of antipsychotic drugs, studies have been routinely recording weight. This improved data collection has allowed greater understanding of the extent of weight gain with these drugs, and a clinically significant level of weight change has been established 52. Replication of all aspects of antipsychotic drug weight gain recording may not be possible for GCs because future large‐scale clinical trials of GCs in rheumatology are unlikely. Collection of high‐quality data regarding GC exposure, including dose and timing, in addition to longitudinal weight measurements in rheumatology cohorts, is needed. This information will provide potential important insight to examine both the rate of onset with dosage change and the speed of weight loss following discontinuation.

For the patient, having the clinician acknowledge and discuss potential weight gain before initiation of GC treatment is important. Weight monitoring during GC treatment and addressing patient concerns together with better information about the likelihood and extent of weight gain and potential loss after a period of GC treatment cessation may well improve the psychological well‐being of patients. These improvements may, in turn, lower uncertainty and increase confidence in GC use by patients and maintain persistence over the GC course to ultimately improve the control of disease progression.

### Cetirizine hydrochloride (Quzyttir) [^a240236d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

No clinically significant drug interactions with oral cetirizine hydrochloride, the active ingredient in QUZYTTIR, have been found with theophylline at a low dose, azithromycin, pseudoephedrine, ketoconazole, or erythromycin. There was a small decrease in the clearance of oral cetirizine hydrochloride caused by a 400-mg dose of theophylline; it is possible that larger theophylline doses could have a greater effect [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Drug-induced hyperphagia: what can we learn from psychiatric medications? [^b8a412af]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

This brief review examines hyperphagia and associated weight gain as undesirable side effects of psychiatric medications; exploring the scope of the problem, proposed mechanisms, and potential interventions. Mechanisms of action appear to include drug-mediated effects on hypothalamic appetite pathways that have been implicated in other etiologies of obesity. There is great individual variation in response to these medications as well as variation in the degree of weight gain within drug classes. Gene polymorphisms may be a key factor in determining individual variations in response. Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms can guide useful interventions. Medication selection and dosing appear to be important strategies to minimize adverse weight gain.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^212dc9f2]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we have performed a retrospective pharmacogenomics study to understand the SSRIs' common weight gain side effects. We showed that the CYP2C19 genotype might explain weight gain in citalopram patients, and it might become a projection tool for preventing weight gain and obesity, particularly in patients who are overweight. Further studies are needed to validate this observation in prospective trials.

### The pharmacology of weight gain with antipsychotics [^a6861f02]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

In general, antipsychotic agents have diverse actions on a wide range of neurotransmitter systems. Data strongly suggest that a number of these systems may play a role in the regulation of body weight. In addition to having very distinct pharmacologic profiles, individual agents possess discrete weight gain liabilities. This article briefly reviews the evidence for the involvement of specific neurotransmitter systems in the control of body weight and describes the relevant pharmacologic characteristics of individual antipsychotic agents. By comparing the pharmacologic profiles of specific antipsychotic agents with their respective weight gain liabilities, this article attempts to gain an insight into the specific receptors underlying a drug's propensity to induce weight gain. However, there is still much to be learned concerning weight control mechanisms, and the role of many of the receptors at which antipsychotic agents are active remains unclear. In spite of this, an overview of current knowledge in the field may facilitate prediction of a potential novel antipsychotic agent's weight gain liability.

### Epidemiology, implications and mechanisms underlying drug-induced weight gain in psychiatric patients [^b807cb83]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2003). Low credibility.

Body weight gain frequently occurs during drug treatment of psychiatric disorders and is often accompanied by increased appetite or food craving. While occurrence and time course of this side effect are difficult to predict, it ultimately results in obesity and the morbidity associated therewith in a substantial part of patients, often causing them to discontinue treatment even if it is effective. This paper reviews the available epidemiological data on the frequency and extent of weight gain associated with antidepressant, mood-stabilizing, and antipsychotic treatment. Possible underlying pathomechanisms are discussed with special attention to central nervous control of appetite including the role of leptin and the tumor necrosis factor system. Metabolic alterations induced by drug treatment such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome are also considered. Weight gain appears to be most prominent in patients treated with some of the second generation antipsychotic drugs and with some mood stabilizers. Marked weight gain also frequently occurs during treatment with most tricyclic antidepressants, while conventional antipsychotics typically induce only slight to moderate weight gain. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors may induce weight loss during the first few weeks, but some of them induce weight gain during long-term treatment. Several antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs are identified which reliably do not cause weight gain or even reduce weight. Based on these insights, countermeasures to manage drug-induced weight gain are suggested.

### Cetirizine hydrochloride (Quzyttir) [^8a6d6226]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Excretion

A mass balance study in 6 healthy male volunteers indicated that 70% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 10% in the feces. Approximately 50% of the radioactivity was identified in the urine as unchanged drug. Most of the rapid increase in peak plasma radioactivity was associated with parent drug, suggesting a low degree of first-pass metabolism.

Geriatric Patients: Following a single, 10-mg oral dose, the elimination half-life was prolonged by 50% and the apparent total body clearance was 40% lower in 16 geriatric subjects with a mean age of 77 years compared to 14 adult subjects with a mean age of 53 years. The decrease in cetirizine clearance in these elderly volunteers may be related to decreased renal function.

Pediatric Patients: When pediatric patients aged 7 to 12 years received a single, 5-mg oral cetirizine hydrochloride capsule, the mean Cmaxwas 275 ng/mL. Based on cross-study comparisons, the weight-normalized, apparent total body clearance was 33% greater and the elimination half-life was 33% shorter in this pediatric population than in adults. In pediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years who received 5 mg oral tablets of cetirizine hydrochloride, the mean Cmaxwas 660 ng/mL. Based on cross-study comparisons, the weight-normalized apparent total body clearance was 81 to 111% greater and the elimination half-life was 33 to 41% shorter in this pediatric population than in adults. In pediatric patients aged 6 to 23 months who received a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution (mean dose 2.3 mg), the mean Cmaxwas 390 ng/mL. Based on cross-study comparisons, the weight-normalized, apparent total body clearance was 304% greater and the elimination half-life was 63% shorter in this pediatric population compared to adults. The average AUC(0-t)in children 6 months to less than 2 years of age receiving the maximum dose of cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution (2.5 mg twice a day) is expected to be two-fold higher than that observed in adults receiving a dose of 10 mg cetirizine hydrochloride oral tablets once a day.

Male and Female Patients: The effect of gender of cetirizine pharmacokinetics has not been adequately studied.

Racial or Ethnic Groups: No race-related difference in the kinetics of cetirizine has been observed.

### Medications associated with weight gain [^156b599a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review available literature regarding weight gain associated with commonly prescribed drugs and adjunctive therapy used to limit weight gain.

Data Sources

Information was retrieved from a MEDLINE English-literature search between 1995 and July 2005, with a major subject heading of weight gain/drug effects excluding complementary alternative medicines. Other limits applied included human subjects and individuals > 19 years of age. Additionally, references from retrieved articles were reviewed to identify other literature sources.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Changes in weight are generally reported as a primary or secondary outcome of many studies. Where possible, prospective, randomized, controlled trials were preferred; however, many studies were retrospective or open label. Meta-analyses and recent reviews, especially those providing a detailed description of the proposed mechanism involved in weight gain beyond the scope of this article, were included. Limited information was available from case reports. Studies were categorized by therapeutic area including psychiatry, neurology, diabetes, and other miscellaneous drug therapy. Medications used to intentionally stimulate appetite for weight gain, such as megesterol acetate, were not included.

Data Synthesis

Weight gain with medication is usually associated with individual agents within a class. The tendency to cause weight gain is often related to differential specificity and sensitivity of binding to receptors involved with appetite regulation.

Conclusions

Clinically significant weight gain is associated with some commonly prescribed medicines. There is wide interindividual variation in response and variation of the degree of weight gain within drug classes. Where possible, alternative therapy should be selected, especially for individuals predisposed to overweight and obesity.

### Mechanisms of antipsychotic-induced weight gain [^1a66f4b9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

The estimated percentage of persons with schizophrenia who are overweight is higher than the percentage of persons in the general population who are overweight. The increased mortality rate for persons with schizophrenia is largely due to obesity-related diseases. The atypical antipsychotics offer an improved therapeutic index when compared with the conventional agents, but may impart serious adverse events such as weight gain. This brief review is intended to provide the practicing clinician with an update of disparate research paradigms under investigation in an attempt to delineate the biological mechanisms that presage weight gain. Research success in this area may invite novel prevention strategies and hint at potential mechanisms of antipsychotic drug action.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^999cd671]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

In a prospective 4-year follow-up study, SSRI-treated patients had weight gain of 4.6%. In the study conducted by Sussman et al. 17.9% of SSRI users experienced significant weight gain ⩾7%. Escitalopram (SSRI) treatment resulted in an increase of 0.05 in BMI scores during the first 12 weeks, and there was an increase of 0.12 in BMI scores after 6 months of treatment initiation.

In addition to the clinical studies described above, case studies have reported extreme weight gain in patients with SSRI treatment. In the study conducted by Bouwer et al. treatment with citalopram led to weight gain and carbohydrate craving in eight out of eighteen patients. In a 4-week period, one female patient gained 8 kg, whereas in a 5-week period one male patient gained 9 kg. In another case study, a 33-year-old schizophrenic female patient was treated with fluoxetine (40 mg per day) for a 9-month period following antipsychotic treatment with risperidone (6 mg per day) and clorazepate (15 mg per day). The patient was discontinued from fluoxetine because she underwent excessive weight gain (52 kg) accompanied with carbohydrate craving. Therefore, some individuals may be more sensitive to weight gain induced by SSRIs than others.

### Pharmacological interventions for prevention of weight gain in people with schizophrenia [^30591b0a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Antipsychotic-induced weight gain is an extremely common problem in people with schizophrenia and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Adjunctive pharmacological interventions may be necessary to help manage antipsychotic-induced weight gain. This review splits and updates a previous Cochrane Review that focused on both pharmacological and behavioural approaches to this problem.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for preventing antipsychotic-induced weight gain in people with schizophrenia.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Schizophrenia Information Specialist searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's Register of Trials on 10 February 2021. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined any adjunctive pharmacological intervention for preventing weight gain in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses who use antipsychotic medications.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. For continuous outcomes, we combined mean differences (MD) in endpoint and change data in the analysis. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RR). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to judge certainty of evidence and create summary of findings tables. The primary outcomes for this review were clinically important change in weight, clinically important change in body mass index (BMI), leaving the study early, compliance with treatment, and frequency of nausea. The included studies rarely reported these outcomes, so, post hoc, we added two new outcomes, average endpoint/change in weight and average endpoint/change in BMI.

Main Results

Seventeen RCTs, with a total of 1388 participants, met the inclusion criteria for the review. Five studies investigated metformin, three topiramate, three H2 antagonists, three monoamine modulators, and one each investigated monoamine modulators plus betahistine, melatonin and samidorphan. The comparator in all studies was placebo or no treatment (i.e. standard care alone). We synthesised all studies in a quantitative meta-analysis. Most studies inadequately reported their methods of allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel. The resulting risk of bias and often small sample sizes limited the overall certainty of the evidence. Only one reboxetine study reported the primary outcome, number of participants with clinically important change in weight. Fewer people in the treatment condition experienced weight gains of more than 5% and more than 7% of their bodyweight than those in the placebo group (> 5% weight gain RR 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.65; 1 study, 43 participants; > 7% weight gain RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.83; 1 study, 43 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported the primary outcomes, 'clinically important change in BMI', or 'compliance with treatment'. However, several studies reported 'average endpoint/change in body weight' or 'average endpoint/change in BMI'. Metformin may be effective in preventing weight gain (MD -4.03 kg, 95% CI -5.78 to -2.28; 4 studies, 131 participants; low-certainty evidence); and BMI increase (MD -1.63 kg/m2, 95% CI -2.96 to -0.29; 5 studies, 227 participants; low-certainty evidence). Other agents that may be slightly effective in preventing weight gain include H2 antagonists such as nizatidine, famotidine and ranitidine (MD -1.32 kg, 95% CI -2.09 to -0.56; 3 studies, 248 participants; low-certainty evidence) and monoamine modulators such as reboxetine and fluoxetine (weight: MD -1.89 kg, 95% CI -3.31 to -0.47; 3 studies, 103 participants; low-certainty evidence; BMI: MD -0.66 kg/m2, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.26; 3 studies, 103 participants; low-certainty evidence). Topiramate did not appear effective in preventing weight gain (MD -4.82 kg, 95% CI -9.99 to 0.35; 3 studies, 168 participants; very low-certainty evidence). For all agents, there was no difference between groups in terms of individuals leaving the study or reports of nausea. However, the results of these outcomes are uncertain given the very low-certainty evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-certainty evidence to suggest that metformin may be effective in preventing weight gain. Interpretation of this result and those for other agents, is limited by the small number of studies, small sample size, and short study duration. In future, we need studies that are adequately powered and with longer treatment durations to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions for managing weight gain.

### Management of medication-induced weight gain [^a47a025b]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Several medications can contribute to weight gain. Medication-induced weight gain can have severe health consequences leading to overweight or obesity, or exacerbation of preexisting obesity and the plethora of obesity-related comorbidities. Weight gain due to medications is potentially avoidable by prescribing medications that are either weight neutral or that lead to weight loss, when appropriate. This article reviews the common classes of medications that contribute to weight gain and discusses alternatives to consider.

### Pharmacological interventions for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain in people with schizophrenia: a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^eef3cba9]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with schizophrenia are burdened by higher rates of obesity, cardiovascular disease and reduced life expectancy than the general population. In addition to illness, genetic and lifestyle factors, the associated weight gain and metabolic adverse effects of antipsychotic (AP) medications are known to exacerbate and accelerate these cardiometabolic problems significantly. Given the detrimental consequences of weight gain and other metabolic disturbances, there is an urgent need for safe and effective strategies to manage these issues as early on as possible.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In clinical trials with QUZYTTIR, 18 patients were 65 years and older, and 6 patients were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. In clinical trials with cetirizine hydrochloride oral tablets, 186 patients were 65 years and older, and 39 patients were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety were observed between these patients and younger patients.

With regard to efficacy, the clinical trials with cetirizine hydrochloride oral tablets and QUZYTTIR did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients.

### Preventive treatment of migraine: effect on weight [^816966b2]. Cephalalgia (2005). Low credibility.

Weight gain is a side-effect commonly associated with drugs used for headache prophylaxis. Weight gain can adversely affect patient health, exacerbate comorbid metabolic disorders and encourage noncompliance. Few studies have been conducted specifically on the effect of headache medications on weight, and it is important for physicians to have accurate information about weight-gain side-effects when identifying appropriate pharmacological regimens. This review discusses the potential effects on weight of the more common headache medications.

### Centrally-acting opioid receptor antagonists as a treatment for antipsychotic-induced weight gain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trial data [^1b0443f1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methodology

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with guidelines set by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023455663).

Eligibility criteria

Only randomized-controlled studies (RCTs), and studies continuing from those trials, investigating the effect of CORA on weight in individuals receiving antipsychotic medication were included for this review. The primary outcome was mean bodyweight change, while secondary outcomes included other anthropometric parameters (e.g. body mass index (BMI), percentage achieving target weight change, etc), cardiometabolic parameters (e.g. lipid profile, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, etc), and reported adverse outcomes. Further requirements for inclusion were that all participants were consenting adults (aged 16 and above) and received antipsychotics either shortly prior to or throughout the duration of the trial.

More specifically, the primary outcome examined was the difference in change in bodyweight in kilograms between antipsychotic plus CORA versus antipsychotic alone or antipsychotic plus placebo at the end of study follow-up. Secondary anthropometric outcomes examined were difference in changes in percentage bodyweight, BMI, and waist circumference, and the absolute risk difference (ARD) in gaining more than 7% bodyweight and gaining more than 10% bodyweight. The choice of ARD rather than odds ratio (the most common form of reporting in retrieved manuscripts) was made to improve interpretability and avoid overstating effect sizes. Also examined were secondary metabolic outcomes for the difference in change in total cholesterol (mg/dL), triglycerides (mg/dL), glucose (mg/dL), and HbA1c (%).

Other studies, such as observational studies and quasi-experimental studies, were not included in this review, to better facilitate meta-analysis of the data. Other exclusions were articles that were only available in abstract form and studies that lacked clear ethical approval. Trials involving children were not part of the review's inclusion criteria, though no trials were excluded solely on this basis. Likewise, no language restrictions were placed to be included in the review.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: guideline development and consensus validation [^2665dadb]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Early Trends in Weight Gain.

Weight gain can be substantial and rapid early in the course of psychosis, the first year of treatment being critical. A naturalistic cohort study found that individuals with first episode psychosis gained on average 3.46 ± 7.81 kg of weight after a mean of 44.6 days of treatment. Trend in weight gain and change in BMI in the first weeks of treatment has been identified as the most clinically significant factor influencing longer-term risk of adverse cardiometabolic outcomes. In the case of BMI, there is moderate certainty evidence for this association.

Eating Behavior and Early Appetite Increases.

Early increases in appetite or eating behavior may predict risk of weight gain, but the certainty of evidence is low and inconsistent. One study found that increased appetite at 4 weeks was associated with significantly greater weight gain at 12 weeks. Mean difference 2.67 kg (95% CI 1.20 to 4.15), P < .0001. Eating behavior and raised blood glucose were found to be potential predictors of weight gain.

### Managing weight gain and metabolic issues in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics [^fea719f6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The proven efficacy of second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) has led many clinicians to switch patients from a conventional antipsychotic to an SGA. However, SGAs may be associated with weight gain, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, and ultimately with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Clinicians should be aware of patients' individual risk factors for developing these illnesses and should carefully screen for changes in weight, body mass index, waist size, or lipid levels that could be potentially harmful and increase the risk for a more serious illness.

### Behavioral interventions for antipsychotic induced appetite changes [^c8232dae]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Behavioral Intervention for Control of Appetite and Weight Gain – The Evidence

In view of the considerable impact many SGAs and even some FGAs have on the neuroendocrine system, the question arises whether or not behavioral interventions are effective in preventing or reducing weight gain. The systematic reviews and meta-analyses reviewed here seem to support this (Table 2). Both, prevention and the treatment of weight gain, may lead to weight loss of about 3 kg. This corresponds to a reduction of body mass index (BMI) of approximately one point. In most reviews, prevention led to slightly more weight loss than treatment. A whole array of interventions or combination of interventions may work, including psychological interventions, diet and exercise. Psychological interventions ranged from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psycho-education, motivational interviewing to stress management. Such interventions were important but it remained unclear whether CBT or psycho-educational interventions yielded the better results. Outpatient treatment may be superior to inpatient treatment, but tight calorie restriction in individual cases of extreme obesity may nevertheless be best conducted under inpatient conditions. In general, it was difficult to unravel the particular contribution of each treatment component because they tended to overlap. Programs combining all three, diet, exercise and psychological, interventions may work best.

Table 2
Effectiveness of behavioral interventions for appetite and weight control – evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses during the last ten years

*Provisional version

Although these results are encouraging it appears that weight gain associated with to antipsychotic treatment tends to be greater than weight loss achieved through subsequent behavioral interventions. This highlights the importance of monitoring weight and preventing weight gain in the first place. Also, significant anti-psychotic induced weight gain tends to occur early in treatment. Weight may then gradually increase over several years and only plateau after more than three and a half years after commencement of antipsychotics. One study though, following up 113 patients who received life style advice in a group setting for 8 years, found that substantial weight loss could be achieved over long periods of time. However, this study had no control group and about 70% of the patients had dropped out of the program within two years.

### The effects of antipsychotic medications on microbiome and weight gain in children and adolescents [^482d3ec2]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Therefore, one hypothesis to explain SGA-induced weight gain suggests that the antagonistic effects of SGAs on neurohormone receptors (5-HT2C, muscarinic, and H1) alter the gut microbiota composition, which in turn leads to increased weight gain. Alternatively, the change in microbiota composition caused by SGAs may be a secondary effect resulting from increased caloric intake. Changes in dietary intake have previously been reported to derive a change in microbial composition. Nonetheless, the full connection between neurohormones, SGAs, and microbiota remains to be elucidated.

An additional pathway that may link the brain and the gut in psychiatric disorders is through the immune system. Many medical conditions, such as depression, include chronic low-grade inflammation, which affects microbial composition and gut permeability. More specifically, several changes in cytokine levels (specifically, increases in pro-inflammatory and decreases in anti-inflammatory cytokines) are associated with depression. Inflammation increases depression morbidities by mechanisms involving inhibition of the negative feedback of the HPA axis, increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier, reduced synthesis of 5-HT, and disturbance of glutamatergic pathways. However, inflammation also affects the gut microbiota composition, and may lead to changes in gut permeability. In turn, increased gut permeability may lead to release of lipopolysaccharide, which can further induce pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IL-1) and norepinephrine levels. The interconnections between the gut microbiota and immune system have been extensively studied, and clearly, the gut microbiota at young ages is crucial for educating the immune system, brain development, and brain function. Therefore, any dysbiosis during infancy or early childhood may have life-long implications on immune function. Pathways of the gut–brain axis, specifically at the stages of adolescence, have not been extensively studied. However, a study highlighting functional differences between the microbial composition of children aged 7–12 and adults, found lower expression of microbial genes linked to inflammation in children, including genes involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.

### Weight gain in the treatment of mood disorders [^6eefd48a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Overweight and obesity have become an urgent public health problem in the United States: approximately 61% of the adult population (97 million adults) are overweight or obese, where overweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 and obesity is defined as a BMI ≥ 30. Overweight and obesity increase the risk for developing many serious chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and certain cancers. Increased morbidity due to obesity-related disorders begins within the normal weight range. Weight gain in adulthood per se, even in individuals who are normal weight, has deleterious health effects. Medications, particularly those commonly used in psychiatry and neurology, are a significant iatrogenic source of overweight and obesity. The weight gain potential of prescription medications should be considered in order to enhance patient compliance and reduce the risk of metabolic sequelae of weight gain. This article provides an overview of the weight-gain potential of several classes of drugs commonly used in psychiatric practice and considerations for clinicians in prescribing these medications.

### Cetirizine (cetirizine hydrochloride) [^272f692e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Mechanism of Actions: Cetirizine, a human metabolite of hydroxyzine, is an antihistamine; its principal effects are mediated via selective inhibition of peripheral H1receptors. The antihistaminic activity of cetirizine has been clearly documented in a variety of animal and human models. In vivo and ex vivo animal models have shown negligible anticholinergic and antiserotonergic activity. In clinical studies, however, dry mouth was more common with cetirizine than with placebo. In vitro receptor binding studies have shown no measurable affinity for other than H1receptors. Autoradiographic studies with radiolabeled cetirizine in the rat have shown negligible penetration into the brain. Ex vivo experiments in the mouse have shown that systemically administered cetirizine does not significantly occupy cerebral H1receptors.

Pharmacokinetics

Absorption: Cetirizine was rapidly absorbed with a time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of approximately 1 hour following administration of oral solution in adults. Comparable bioavailability was found between the tablet and oral solution dosage forms. When healthy volunteers were administered multiple doses of cetirizine (10 mg tablets once daily for 10 days), a mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 311 ng/mL was observed. No accumulation was observed. Cetirizine pharmacokinetics were linear for oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 60 mg. Food had no effect on the extent of cetirizine hydrochloride exposure (AUC) but Tmaxwas delayed by 1.7 hours and Cmaxwas decreased by 23% in the presence of food.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — antidepressant selection and weight effects recommends a shared decision-making process that provides patients with quantitative estimates of the expected weight effect when antidepressant therapy is indicated (1|⊕⊕⊕○), noting that the expected length of treatment should also be considered. Evidence indicates heterogeneous weight effects: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine and sertraline have been associated with weight loss during acute treatment (4–12 wk) and weight neutrality in the maintenance (> 4 mo) phase, with no significant effect observed for citalopram or escitalopram; paroxetine has the greatest long-term increase in body weight among SSRIs, amitriptyline is the most potent tricyclic inducer of weight gain, and mirtazapine is associated with long-term weight gain; among serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine and duloxetine have been reported to slightly increase body weight; bupropion is the only antidepressant that consistently causes weight loss and significantly decreased body weight in clinical trials; the commissioned systematic review found weight gain with amitriptyline (1.8 kg) and weight loss with bupropion (−1.3 kg) and fluoxetine (−1.3 kg).

### Commentary on strategies for switching antipsychotics [^9a5883af]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Weight gain: the most common reason to switch

The most common reason for switching from olanzapine is excessive weight gain. Antipsychotic drugs differ in their propensity to cause weight gain: olanzapine and clozapine cause the most; quetiapine and risperidone cause some; ziprasidone, aripiprazole, amisulpride and haloperidol cause little or no weight gain. There are wide individual differences among patients on a given drug: some patients gain substantial weight, others gain little, some gain none and some lose weight. The time course of weight gain is fairly rapid in the first few weeks, but slows down and seems to plateau after several months. Young patients (that is, children, adolescents and young adults) are much more liable to gain a substantial amount of weight. The rank ordering of antipsychotic weight gain propensity is similar in younger patients; however, even haloperidol causes substantial weight gain among young patients. Patients who had previously been on a high weight-gaining antipsychotic are much less liable to gain more than those who were not. It is important, therefore, to weigh patients approximately every week in the first few months of their treatment and then less frequently afterwards. Substantial weight gain is associated with type-2 diabetes and, for some patients, the consequences of obesity must be regarded as a serious medical event. If it is apparent that a given patient is likely to gain a lot of weight, the clinician is faced with limiting weight gain by diet, exercise, a pharmacological intervention or by switching to another drug, which causes less weight gain. As most of the weight gain occurs early on, the switch or other coping strategies should be made as soon as possible. Therefore, the problem of weight gain should be faced in the first 3 to 6 weeks of drug treatment and a strategy (diet, exercise, a concomitant drug, which might reduce weight gain, or switching antipsychotics) should be devised to limit the weight gain rather than wait until the patient has already gained weight when it is hard to lose.

### The effects of antipsychotic medications on microbiome and weight gain in children and adolescents [^25161df7]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms of atypical antipsychotic-induced weight gain

Atypical antipsychotics are known to affect body weight through different and complex mechanisms, including direct peripheral pathways through fatty tissue, liver and muscles, and via interactions with neurotransmitter receptors such as serotonergic, histaminergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, cannabinoid and muscarinic receptors.

SGAs affect neurohormone receptor signaling: they have antagonistic effects on hypothalamic receptors such as H1R (histaminergic receptor), and on the serotonergic receptors 5-HT2a and 5-HT2c. Olanzapine and clozapine influence metabolic regulation and have the most powerful antagonistic effect on the hypothalamic H1Rs, correlated with both short-term and long-term SGA-induced obesity. Initial effects of blocking hypothalamic H1Rs include activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a well-known feeding regulator, thereby increasing caloric intake. Long-term effects may reduce thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue and decrease lipolysis, while increasing lipogenesis in white adipose tissue. Treatment with betahistidine (an H1R agonist and H3R antagonist) prevented olanzapine-induced weight gain in mice. Antagonist effects on the serotonergic receptor may also influence metabolism, since 5-HT2c is the primary receptor influencing appetite, thereby also affecting control of energy balance. Ballon et al. proposed that antipsychotics might have partial agonistic affinity to pancreatic beta-cell receptors (5-HT2a and 5-HT2c receptors, dopamine D2-like receptors [D2Rs], and muscarinic M3 receptors), thus causing dysfunction of these cells, leading to diabetes.

### The effects of antipsychotic medications on microbiome and weight gain in children and adolescents [^fd2049b2]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Next, adolescence is a critical period for brain development, including both neurobiological and social-affective development. Since there is proof that the microbiome affects brain structure and function in early life, and only a few studies have tested these aspects at later developmental stages, it would be promising to test microbiota effects on brain function in adolescence. Finally, it is known that obese children have a major risk of becoming obese adults, suggesting that weight and metabolic state at a young age have long-term effects influencing later life. These may be mediated by microbiota.

Another aspect to be considered specifically in pediatric and adolescent populations is the negative social impact of weight gain itself. It has been shown that SGA-related weight gain is even more dramatic in children and adolescents than in adults. Children and adolescents taking SGAs may already suffer from low self-esteem and the stigma of being different from their peers. Increased weight gain may enhance this perception. Therefore, SGA-induced weight gain may increase the risk of major psychological and physiological outcomes during childhood and adolescence. This may also have effects on compliance to medication, requiring alternative treatments that do not cause weight gain as a side effect.

### Understanding antidepressant mechanism of action and its effect on efficacy and safety [^17b4b50a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Common side effects of antidepressants, such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and fatigue and sleepiness, may be attributable to their mechanisms of action. Antidepressants are neurotransmitter uptake blockers, enzyme inhibitors, and neurotransmitter receptor blockers. Various mechanisms of action can determine how quickly therapeutic benefit becomes apparent and whether certain acute and persistent side effects occur. Understanding mechanism of action can help clinicians select appropriate antidepressants for individual patients and manage adherence problems due to intolerability. Although more research is needed to further elucidate specific antidepressant mechanisms of action, clinicians can use current knowledge to tailor treatment decisions, such as switching patients to a medication with a different mechanism of action when intolerable adverse events are experienced.

### Importance of early weight changes to predict long-term weight gain during psychotropic drug treatment [^aac58714]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Psychotropic drugs can induce substantial weight gain, particularly during the first 6 months of treatment. The authors aimed to determine the potential predictive power of an early weight gain after the introduction of weight gain-inducing psychotropic drugs on long-term weight gain.

Method

Data were obtained from a 1-year longitudinal study ongoing since 2007 including 351 psychiatric (ICD-10) patients, with metabolic parameters monitored (baseline and/or 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months) and with compliance ascertained. International Diabetes Federation and World Health Organization definitions were used to define metabolic syndrome and obesity, respectively.

Results

Prevalences of metabolic syndrome and obesity were 22% and 17%, respectively, at baseline and 32% and 24% after 1 year. Receiver operating characteristic analyses indicated that an early weight gain > 5% after a period of 1 month is the best predictor for important long-term weight gain (≥ 15% after 3 months: sensitivity, 67%; specificity, 88%; ≥ 20% after 12 months: sensitivity, 47%; specificity, 89%). This analysis identified most patients (97% for 3 months, 93% for 12 months) who had weight gain ≤ 5% after 1 month as continuing to have a moderate weight gain after 3 and 12 months. Its predictive power was confirmed by fitting a longitudinal multivariate model (difference between groups in 1 year of 6.4% weight increase as compared to baseline, P = 0.0001).

Conclusion

Following prescription of weight gain-inducing psychotropic drugs, a 5% threshold for weight gain after 1 month should raise clinician concerns about weight-controlling strategies.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^334b9ac7]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion and future directions

In this review, we have discussed the relationship between MDD and obesity. Clinical findings have suggested that obesity could increase the risk of developing MDD, and vice versa. Several pathways may have a role in this interaction, including neuroendocrine, neuroimmune and neurotropic mechanisms. Among those, activation of the HPA axis occurs both during MDD/stress and obesity, making it the most accepted shared common pathophysiological pathways in both disorders. Leptin and insulin resistance are pathophysiological mechanisms that need to be further elucidated, along with the roles of the immune system and neurotropic factors.

Despite the concomitant occurrence of the frequent use of antidepressants and the high incidence of obesity in Western societies, additional studies are required to fully test our hypothesis that the rise in obesity rates is related at least in part to increasing antidepressant use, and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying antidepressant-induced weight gain. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of different classes of antidepressants on body weight. Previous clinical studies suggest that TCAs amitriptyline, nortriptyline and imipramine were associated with weight gain. Mirtazapine (SNRI) has been associated with increased weight gain. Studies have suggested that weight gain associated with antidepressants reflect the action of monoamine pathways, which include serotoninergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic receptors. It has been suggested that the mechanism behind weight gain induced by TCAs and mirtazapine (SNRI) involves affinity for histaminergic receptors. Histaminergic receptors have been shown to interact with orexigenic neuropeptides such as orexin A, NPY and ghrelin. Bupropion (SNRI) has been shown to induce significant weight loss via selective inhibition of dopamine. On the other hand, because of dispersion in clinical studies, the effect of SSRI on body weight remains still unclear. Despite the fact that SSRI use has been associated with weight loss during acute treatment, a number of studies have shown that SSRIs may be associated with long-term risk of weight gain. Long-term studies with very much extended periods are needed in order to understand long-term effects of SSRI on body weight.

Potential Drivers of Antipsychotic-Induced Weight Gain and Increased Appetite

Identifying Receptors Facilitating Weight Gain

Of the FGAs, low-potency phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine carry the highest risk of increasing weight. Chlorpromazine may even increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2- diabetes. On the other hand, the risk of weight gain is relatively low with high-potency FGAs such as perphenazine, fluphenazine and haloperidol. Of the SGAs, clozapine and olanzapine are most likely to increase weight, appetite and to stimulate overeating. Both drugs also increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2- diabetes. Quetiapine, risperidone, paliperidone, asenapine, iloperidone and sertindole can also increase weight but to a lesser extent. These drugs are currently not associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Ziprasidone, amisulpride and aripiprazole and possibly lurasidone belong to a third category of antipsychotic drugs in which the risk of weight gain and appetite increase tends to be low or negligible.

Blockade of dopamine (D2 and D3), serotonin (5HT2c), muscarinic (M3) and histamine (H1) receptors have all been implicated to increase appetite. Weight gain liability seems inversely correlated to the specificity of the receptor profile of the antipsychotic drugs; the more receptors targeted, the less specific the drug and the more likely weight gain. Thus it is the non-specificity of an individual drug rather than the categorization into FAGs and SAGs that predict weight gain liability or metabolic risk. Nonetheless, even drugs antagonizing only dopamine receptors (amisulpride, pimozide, etc.) show at least some propensity for weight gain.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with "anorectic" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet.

The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an "anorectic" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss.

The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited.

### Olanzapine pamoate (Zyprexa) [^d6aecc9d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 6 includes data on adult weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 86 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified.

Dose group differences with respect to weight gain have been observed in some studies. In a 24-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study with ZYPREXA RELPREVV, mean baseline-to-endpoint increase in weight (150 mg/2 weeks, n = 140: 0.67 kg; 405 mg/4 weeks, n = 315: 0.89 kg; 300 mg/2 weeks, n = 140: 1.70 kg) was observed with significant differences between the lowest and highest dose groups (150 vs 300 mg/2 weeks). In a single 8-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing 10 (N = 199), 20 (N = 200) and 40 (N = 200) mg/day of oral olanzapine in adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, mean baseline to endpoint increase in weight (10 mg/day: 1.9 kg; 20 mg/day: 2.3 kg; 40 mg/day: 3 kg) was observed with significant differences between 10 vs 40 mg/day.

Mirtazapine

Mirtazapine (SNRI) has been associated with weight gain. The mechanism of mirtazapine involves the blockade of α2-adrenergic receptors, together with affinity for histamine H1 receptors and low affinity for dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors. It has been suggested that the histaminergic system is involved in appetite and feeding control. These histaminergic cell bodies are situated in a specific region called the tuberomammilary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus. Histaminergic receptors have been shown to interact with orexigenic neuropeptides such as orexin A, NPY and ghrelin. Anti-histaminergic effects of mirtazapine were associated with enhanced appetite by activation of ghrelin and NPY. Furthermore, clinical doses of mirtazapine blocked both 5HT2 and 5HT3 receptors.5HT2 receptors have an essential role in appetite, and antagonising 5HT2 results in weight gain.

Weight Gain

Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use, including SECUADO. Monitor weight at baseline and frequently
	thereafter.

Data on mean changes in body weight and the proportion of subjects meeting a weight gain criterion of ≥ 7% of body
	weight from the placebo-controlled schizophrenia trial are presented in Table 3.

In the sublingual asenapine 52-week, double-blind, comparator-controlled adult trial that included primarily patients with
	schizophrenia, the mean weight gain from baseline was 0.9 kg. The proportion of patients with a ≥ 7% increase in body weight
	(at Endpoint) was 14.7%. Table 4 provides the mean weight change from baseline and the
	proportion of patients with a weight gain of ≥ 7% categorized by Body Mass Index (BMI) at baseline.

5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in patients treated with asenapine, including SECUADO. In several cases, these reactions occurred after the first dose. These hypersensitivity reactions included: anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypotension, tachycardia, swollen tongue, dyspnea, wheezing and rash.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following clinically significant adverse reaction is described elsewhere in the labeling:

Somnolence/Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Oral cetirizine hydrochloride

The following adverse reactions associated with the use of oral cetirizine hydrochloride were identified in clinical trials.

In clinical trials in patients 12 years and older the most common adverse reactions to oral cetirizine hydrochloride occurring with a 2% or greater incidence and greater than placebo were somnolence (14%), fatigue (6%), dry mouth (5%), pharyngitis (2%), and dizziness (2%). In clinical trials in children 6 to 11 years of age with oral cetirizine hydrochloride the most common adverse reactions occurring with a 2% or greater incidence and greater than placebo were headache, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, coughing, somnolence, diarrhea, epistaxis, bronchospasm, nausea, and vomiting. Somnolence appeared to be dose related. Adverse reactions reported in placebo-controlled trials with oral cetirizine hydrochloride in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years were qualitatively similar in nature and generally similar in frequency to those reported in trials with children 6 to 11 years of age. In placebo-controlled trials of pediatric patients 6 to 24 months of age, the incidences of adverse experiences were similar in the oral cetirizine hydrochloride and placebo treatment groups in each trial. In a trial of 1 week duration in children 6 to 11 months of age patients who received oral cetirizine hydrochloride exhibited greater irritability/fussiness than patients on placebo. In a trial of 18 months duration in patients 12 months and older, insomnia occurred more frequently in patients who received oral cetirizine hydrochloride compared to patients who received placebo.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Mechanism of Actions: Cetirizine, a human metabolite of hydroxyzine, is an antihistamine; its principal effects are mediated via selective inhibition of peripheral H 1 receptors. The antihistaminic activity of cetirizine has been clearly documented in a variety of animal and human models. In vivo and ex vivo animal models have shown negligible anticholinergic and anti-serotonergic activity. In clinical studies, however, dry mouth was more common with cetirizine than with placebo. In vitro receptor binding studies have shown no measurable affinity for other than H1 receptors. Autoradiographic studies with radiolabeled cetirizine in the rat have shown negligible penetration into the brain. Ex vivo experiments in the mouse have shown that systemically administered cetirizine does not significantly occupy cerebral H1receptors.

Pharmacokinetics:

Absorption: Cetirizine was rapidly absorbed with a time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of approximately 1 hour following oral administration of tablets or oral solution in adults. Comparable bioavailability was found between the tablet and oral solution dosage forms. When healthy volunteers were administered multiple doses of cetirizine (10 mg tablets once daily for 10 days), a mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 311 ng/m.L was observed. No accumulation was observed. Cetirizine pharmacokinetics were linear for oral doses ranging from 5 to 60 mg. Food had no effect on the extent of cetirizine exposure (AUC) but Tmaxwas delayed by 1.7 hours and Cmaxwas decreased by 23% in the presence of food.

### The 5-HT2C receptor and antipsychoticinduced weight gain-mechanisms and genetics [^993d0fcb]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying weight gain resulting from antipsychotic drugs are not fully understood, although antagonism of the 5-HT2C receptor is likely to contribute. Animal studies indicate that the drugs most likely to cause weight gain, clozapine and olanzapine, have direct effects on the NPY-containing neurons of the hypothalamus; these neurons mediate the effects of the circulating anorexigenic hormone leptin on the control of food intake. The substantial differences between individuals in the extent of antipsychotic-induced weight gain suggest that genetic factors may be important. We have been studying pharmacogenetic correlates and find that a common 5-HT2C receptor promoter region polymorphisms demonstrates strong associations with weight gain in two first episode psychotic samples. In both series, we have found further association of antipsychotic drug-induced weight gain with a common and functional polymorphism of the gene for leptin. Along with initial BMI, these two pharmacogenetic factors account for almost 30% of the variance in drug-induced weight gain. Interestingly, the 5-HT2C polymorphism appears to determine levels of circulating leptin, providing a potential mechanism underlying the genetic association of the 5-HT2C receptor with weight gain. We have undertaken functional studies of haplotypes of the 5-HT2C promoter region and find the allele associated with protection from weight gain results in reduced promoter activity. These findings demonstrate the value of pharmacogenetics in determining liability to a major side effect of antipsychotic treatment, and indicate both the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying this side effect.
