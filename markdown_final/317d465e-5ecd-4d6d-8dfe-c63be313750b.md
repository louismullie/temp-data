## Question

Chest pain radiated to jaw differential diagnosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of chest pain radiating to the jaw. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and whether this could be an acute coronary syndrome or another life-threatening cause. Then, I should verify the key historical features that increase or decrease the likelihood of ischemia. Next, I will review the focused physical examination and bedside tests. After that, I need to check the initial diagnostic workup, including ECG and high-sensitivity troponin, and how to interpret results. Then, I will consider risk stratification tools and imaging pathways. Finally, I will synthesize the differential diagnosis, address sex-specific nuances, and outline management and disposition decisions, making sure I double-check each assertion against guideline-level sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the triage priority: chest pain radiating to the jaw is a classic anginal equivalent and mandates urgent evaluation for acute coronary syndrome, with early ECG and biomarker testing, because this radiation pattern increases the likelihood of myocardial ischemia and delays worsen outcomes. I should not wait to see if it resolves on its own, and I need to ensure the patient is placed on a cardiac monitor, given aspirin if not contraindicated, and have IV access established while awaiting results [^113N8YSs] [^111da6uC] [^116orube].

> Wait, let me verify the historical features that raise or lower suspicion for ischemia: substernal pressure, tightness, or squeezing that builds over minutes, is provoked by exertion or emotional stress, and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin favors angina, whereas sharp, fleeting, pleuritic, positional, or point-tender pain lowers the likelihood. Radiation to the jaw, neck, or arms is a classic ischemic pattern, and associated dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, or syncope further increase concern, especially in women, older adults, and people with diabetes. I should also ask about prior CAD, risk factors, and medication use including triptans, which can cause coronary vasospasm and jaw pain, so I need to check for that specifically [^115EMAzi] [^116orube] [^1147PYnA] [^117Rnrve] [^115Qe3gr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: jaw pain alone can be noncardiac, so I should confirm the presence of concurrent chest or exertional features and the overall time course. Jaw-only pain without chest symptoms is less likely to be ischemic but not impossible, and I should keep a high index of suspicion in high-risk patients while I proceed with objective testing rather than relying on symptom labels like "atypical", which the guidelines discourage [^114rDZVo] [^111o6SQd] [^116oj6Tr].

> Next, I should review the focused physical examination and bedside tests: I need to check vitals for hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, and a pulse differential suggesting aortic pathology. On exam, diaphoresis, new murmurs, S3, or rales raise concern for ACS complications, while reproducible point tenderness reduces the probability of ischemia. I should obtain a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes and a chest radiograph to screen for alternative thoracic causes and look for mediastinal widening if dissection is suspected, recognizing that a normal exam does not exclude ACS or dissection [^113oT28C] [^113qZiMH] [^115x8PJk].

> I will now examine the initial diagnostic workup: high-sensitivity cardiac troponin is the preferred biomarker to detect or exclude myocardial injury, and I should obtain serial measurements at 0 and 1–3 hours depending on the clinical pathway. Interpretation must follow sex-specific 99th percentile thresholds where available, because women often have lower assay cutoffs and may otherwise be underdiagnosed. If STEMI is present, immediate reperfusion is indicated, whereas NSTE-ACS requires risk stratification and guideline-directed therapy [^113N8YSs] [^111da6uC] [^114mMZtU].

> Let me consider risk stratification next: the HEART score integrates History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin and has been prospectively validated to identify low-risk patients suitable for early discharge with appropriate follow-up. Low-risk patients (HEART 0–3) can often be discharged after serial troponins if negative, intermediate-risk patients (4–6) benefit from observation and further testing, and high-risk patients (7–10) warrant admission and invasive evaluation. I should double-check that my local pathway aligns with serial troponin protocols and shared decision-making for imaging [^111hhJhr] [^111da6uC] [^1143r1hp].

> But wait, what if the ECG is nondiagnostic and troponins are equivocal? In that case, I should escalate to cardiac imaging based on pretest probability: coronary CT angiography is appropriate for stable intermediate-risk patients to exclude obstructive CAD, stress testing remains reasonable when imaging is unavailable or contraindicated, and transthoracic echocardiography helps assess wall motion abnormalities and complications. If aortic dissection remains on the table, CT angiography of the chest is indicated urgently given its high sensitivity and specificity [^111da6uC].

> I need to ensure I keep a broad differential while prioritizing life threats: the most likely cardiac cause is ACS, but I should actively consider aortic dissection when pain is sudden, severe, ripping, or associated with pulse deficits or mediastinal widening. Pulmonary embolism if there is pleuritic pain, dyspnea, or risk factors. Pericarditis if pain is pleuritic and positional with a friction rub. And esophageal rupture if there is emesis and subcutaneous emphysema. Noncardiac causes like GERD, costochondritis, and anxiety are common but should be diagnoses of exclusion after ruling out emergencies [^114qMUBR] [^113oT28C] [^117UyZpG].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought jaw radiation was "pathognomonic" for ACS. Hold on, I should verify and correct that overstatement: jaw radiation is a classic and high-risk feature that substantially increases the likelihood of ACS, but it is not pathognomonic, and I must rely on ECG and troponin to confirm myocardial injury rather than symptom pattern alone. Similarly, relief with nitroglycerin supports ischemia but is not diagnostic and should not be used as a standalone criterion [^116orube] [^1147PYnA] [^116oj6Tr].

> Let me think about sex-specific nuances because they change pretest probabilities: women more often present with dyspnea, nausea, back or jaw pain, and atypical descriptors, yet when women report typical features like jaw or arm radiation, the predictive value for MI can be equal to or greater than in men. Therefore, I should avoid labeling symptoms as "atypical", use sex-specific troponin thresholds where available, and maintain a high index of suspicion to prevent delays in care [^115YNbgW] [^113SoX9U] [^114rDZVo].

> I should double-check medication contributors: triptans can cause chest, throat, neck, and jaw tightness or pain via vasospasm and are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal angina. If a patient with jaw pain is on a triptan, I need to evaluate for ischemia promptly and discontinue the drug if there is any concern, rather than attributing symptoms solely to medication effects [^117Rnrve] [^115Qe3gr] [^1153JkAA].

> Next, I should review management pathways: if STEMI is identified, activate the cath lab immediately. If NSTE-ACS is likely, start dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, high-intensity statin, beta-blocker if no contraindications, and arrange coronary angiography based on risk. If low-risk HEART patients have negative serial troponins, discharge with close follow-up is reasonable. If noncardiac causes are suspected after appropriate testing, tailor therapy to the underlying condition and consider GERD evaluation or musculoskeletal management as indicated [^113e7qBD] [^111da6uC] [^111tB4uy].

> Finally, I need to ensure disposition is aligned with risk and patient preferences: high-risk patients require admission and invasive evaluation, intermediate-risk patients often benefit from observation and imaging, and low-risk patients can be discharged with clear return precautions. Throughout, I should use shared decision-making to discuss radiation exposure, costs, and alternatives, and I should explicitly document why I am ruling in or out ACS rather than using vague terms like "atypical chest pain" [^111da6uC] [^1143r1hp] [^114rDZVo].

Chest pain radiating to the jaw is most often due to **myocardial ischemia** [^116orube] (angina or acute coronary syndrome) [^111wWGXz], but it can also signal **aortic dissection** [^114qMUBR] or **pericarditis** [^1152j1Qz]. Other causes include **pulmonary embolism** [^113G3N6G], **pneumothorax** [^115x8PJk], **esophageal spasm** [^notfound], and **musculoskeletal or dental pain** [^115nYZBb] [^114vqSSd]. Because cardiac ischemia is common and life-threatening, obtain an **immediate ECG** [^112KEv5M] and **high-sensitivity troponin** [^111da6uC] to rapidly identify or exclude ACS, and use clinical judgment to evaluate for other causes based on history, exam, and imaging [^115Wf5GB].

---

## Cardiac causes

### Myocardial ischemia (angina pectoris and acute coronary syndrome)

- **Pathophysiology**: Ischemia causes retrosternal chest discomfort that builds over minutes [^116orube], often precipitated by exertion or emotion, and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin [^1147PYnA]; radiation to the jaw, neck, or left arm is common [^114VMS6p].

- **Clinical features**: Pressure, tightness, squeezing, or heaviness; associated dyspnea, nausea, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, or syncope [^116orube] [^111wWGXz].

- **Diagnosis**: Immediate ECG [^112KEv5M] and high-sensitivity troponin [^111da6uC]; serial troponins improve sensitivity for NSTEMI [^notfound].

---

### Aortic dissection

Aortic dissection presents with **sudden, severe, ripping chest pain** radiating to the back, neck, or jaw [^114qMUBR] and is associated with hypertension, connective tissue disease, or bicuspid aortic valve [^115QJrXV]. Diagnosis relies on **CT angiography** of the chest [^notfound].

---

### Pericarditis

Pericarditis causes **sharp, pleuritic chest pain** that improves when sitting forward and worsens when supine [^1152j1Qz]; it may radiate to the jaw or neck. Diagnosis is supported by **ECG** showing diffuse ST elevation and PR depression [^1152j1Qz], with echocardiography to assess effusion [^notfound].

---

## Pulmonary causes

### Pulmonary embolism (PE)

Pulmonary embolism can cause **pleuritic chest pain** with dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia [^113G3N6G]; jaw radiation is uncommon but possible. Diagnosis uses **clinical pretest probability** (Wells or Geneva) [^113G3N6G], D-dimer, and CT pulmonary angiography.

---

### Pneumothorax

Pneumothorax typically presents with **sudden pleuritic chest pain** and dyspnea; jaw radiation is rare. Diagnosis is made by **chest X-ray** or CT [^113G3N6G].

---

## Gastrointestinal causes

### Esophageal spasm or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

Esophageal spasm or GERD may cause **substernal chest pain** that can radiate to the jaw and mimic cardiac pain [^1172nwRR]. Diagnosis is based on **clinical response to acid suppression** [^116FPsW2], manometry, or pH monitoring [^111tB4uy].

---

## Musculoskeletal and dental causes

Musculoskeletal and dental causes include **temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders** [^1125GJ6U], cervical radiculopathy [^113wneYj], and dental pathology, which can produce localized jaw pain that may be referred to the chest. Diagnosis relies on **focused examination**, palpation, and imaging as indicated [^115nYZBb].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Given the broad differential, a **structured approach** is essential:

1. **ECG**: Identify STEMI, ischemia, pericarditis [^113oT28C]
2. **High-sensitivity troponin**: Detect myocardial injury (NSTEMI) [^111da6uC]
3. **Chest X-ray**: Screen for pneumothorax, mediastinal widening (aortic dissection) [^113G3N6G]
4. **CT angiography**: Evaluate for aortic dissection, PE [^113G3N6G]
5. **Echocardiography**: Assess cardiac function, pericardial effusion [^notfound]
6. **Esophageal testing**: Evaluate GERD or esophageal spasm if cardiac causes excluded [^111tB4uy]

---

Chest pain radiating to the jaw most often reflects **myocardial ischemia** [^116orube] but also raises concern for aortic dissection [^114qMUBR] and pericarditis [^1152j1Qz]. Use immediate ECG and troponin to identify ACS, then tailor further testing to the clinical picture to uncover pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or musculoskeletal causes [^1172nwRR].

### Pleuritic chest pain: sorting through the differential diagnosis [^113G3N6G]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Pleuritic chest pain is characterized by sudden and intense sharp, stabbing, or burning pain in the chest when inhaling and exhaling. Pulmonary embolism is the most common serious cause, found in 5% to 21% of patients who present to an emergency department with pleuritic chest pain. A validated clinical decision rule for pulmonary embolism should be employed to guide the use of additional tests such as d-dimer assays, ventilation-perfusion scans, or computed tomography angiography. Myocardial infarction, pericarditis, aortic dissection, pneumonia, and pneumothorax are other serious causes that should be ruled out using history and physical examination, electrocardiography, troponin assays, and chest radiography before another diagnosis is made. Validated clinical decision rules are available to help exclude coronary artery disease. Viruses are common causative agents of pleuritic chest pain. Coxsackieviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza, mumps, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus are likely pathogens. Treatment is guided by the underlying diagnosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are appropriate for pain management in those with virally triggered or nonspecific pleuritic chest pain. In patients with persistent symptoms, persons who smoke, and those older than 50 years with pneumonia, it is important to document radiographic resolution with repeat chest radiography six weeks after initial treatment.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

RELPAX should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established.

5.1	Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina

RELPAX is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of RELPAX. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. RELPAX may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.

Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving RELPAX. Do not use RELPAX if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first RELPAX dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of RELPAX. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of RELPAX.

5.2	Arrhythmias

Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1agonists. Discontinue RELPAX if these disturbances occur. RELPAX is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3	Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure

Sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with RELPAX and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. RELPAX is contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal's variant angina [see Contraindications (4)].

Neck pain

Classification Neck pain can be classified into four classes according to the impact of pain on body function and movement, as follows: Pain with mobility deficits Pain with headache Pain with radiating pain Pain with impaired movement.
Based on the causative mechanism, neck pain may be classified as follows: Axial neck pain caused due to incorrect posture, physical stress or fatigue Whiplash-associated disorder (WAD) due to pain in the muscles, joints, tendons and ligaments due to injuries or impact Cervical radiculopathy and myelopathy due to changes to the sensory/motor function of cervical nerves or compression of spinal cord.
Diagnosis Diagnosis should be preceded by careful evaluation of patient, the nature and extent of pain and any additional symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, vertigo or other distress (C). Symptom assessment may help in differentiating different types of neck pains. Sharp, shooting or tingling pain may indicate a radicular origin, whereas dull, aching pain accompanied with soreness or tenderness may point toward axial pain (C). Physical examination and self-report questionnaires are more valid assessment tools and should be preferred over diagnostic tests such as imaging, electrophysiology or blood tests, which have failed to demonstrate reliability (C). Identify the "red flags", which may include trauma, infections, history of pain, malignancy or major trauma, in addition to weight loss, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or fever (C).
Treatment Exercise and physiotherapy are the most effective interventional methods with proven efficacy in neck pain (A).– Analgesics such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs may be used for acute pain, and weak opioids may be used for chronic episodes, as first-line therapies (A). Antidepressants, muscle relaxants and strong opioids may be reserved for refractory cases or after failure of other interventional methods (C).

Statistical Analysis

Baseline characteristics are summarized as mean (SD) or median (interquartile range) as appropriate. We compared presenting chest pain characteristics of men and women for the whole population, for those with type 1 myocardial infarction, and for those with type 2 myocardial infarction, using chi‐squared tests for categorical data. Likelihood ratios (LRs) with 95% CIs were calculated to assess the predictive value of typical symptom characteristics (pain nature, pain location, radiation, additional features) for the diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction in men and women. An LR summarizes how many times more likely patients with a particular symptom feature are to have a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction than those without the feature. An LR of > 1 indicates that the feature is associated with the presence of type 1 myocardial infarction, and < 1 indicates that the feature is associated with the absence of type 1 myocardial infarction. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was then used to calculate odds ratios with 95% CIs for the number of typical features present based on the following categorization. Symptom presentations were categorized as having between 0 and 4 typical features on the basis of the pain nature (dull, heavy, tight, pressure, ache, squeezing, crushing, or gripping), location (central, left, or right chest; arm; or jaw), radiation (right arm, left arm, neck, jaw, back, other), and the presence of associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, sweating, dyspnea, palpitations, other). This model was adjusted for age, history of ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking (current or ex‐smoker), ischemia on the presenting 12‐lead ECG and an atypical feature variable (in either nature or location). All analyses were performed using R (Version 3.2.2).

Conclusions

In patients with NCCP, timely diagnostic evaluation and treatment of the underlying disease is important. A thorough history of symptoms and clinical examination findings can inform clinicians which diagnostic tests are most appropriate. Response to high-dose PPI treatment can indicate whether GERD is the underlying disease and should be considered as an early test. Panic and anxiety disorders are often not diagnosed and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain.

### Outpatient diagnosis of acute chest pain in adults [^1172nwRR]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately 1 percent of primary care office visits are for chest pain, and 1.5 percent of these patients will have unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction. The initial goal in patients presenting with chest pain is to determine if the patient needs to be referred for further testing to rule in or out acute coronary syndrome and myocardial infarction. The physician should consider patient characteristics and risk factors to help determine initial risk. Twelve-lead electrocardiography is typically the test of choice when looking for ST segment changes, new-onset left bundle branch block, presence of Q waves, and new-onset T wave inversions. For persons in whom the suspicion for ischemia is lower, other diagnoses to consider include chest wall pain/costochondritis (localized pain reproducible by palpation), gastroesophageal reflux disease (burning retrosternal pain, acid regurgitation, and a sour or bitter taste in the mouth), and panic disorder/anxiety state. Other less common but important diagnostic considerations include pneumonia (fever, egophony, and dullness to percussion), heart failure, pulmonary embolism (consider using the Wells criteria), acute pericarditis, and acute thoracic aortic dissection (acute chest or back pain with a pulse differential in the upper extremities). Persons with a higher likelihood of acute coronary syndrome should be referred to the emergency department or hospital.

Initial evaluation — synopsis and comprehensive history elements in the emergency department (ED): Patients presenting to the ED with nontraumatic chest pain are a frequent diagnostic challenge. The priorities are rapid initiation of optimal management for life-threatening conditions such as acute coronary syndromes (ACS), aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as nonvascular syndromes (eg, esophageal rupture, tension pneumothorax), and deliberate therapy for those with less critical illness. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is important to the evaluation, but history, examination, biomarkers, and other aids remain essential, and there is frequently a lack of correlation between intensity of symptoms and seriousness of disease. A comprehensive history that captures chest pain characteristics — nature, onset and duration, location and radiation, precipitating factors, relieving factors, and associated symptoms — can help better identify potential cardiac causes and should be obtained from all patients.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to risk assessment, general principles, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to view the following symptoms as potential angina equivalents:

- chest pain triggered by emotional stress

- dyspnea or dizziness on exertion

- pain in the arms, jaw, neck, or upper back

- fatigue.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to do not describe chest pain as atypical, because it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature. Describe chest pain as cardiac, possibly cardiac or noncardiac, as these terms are more specific to the potential underlying diagnosis.

Results

Baseline Characteristics

We recruited a total study population of 1941 patients (39% women) with suspected acute coronary syndrome (756 women, 62.8 ± 14.0 years; 1185 men, 60.7 ± 14.3 years; Table 1). A total of 388 (20%) patients (152/756 women and 236/1185 men) had a troponin concentration above the upper reference limit. The adjudicated diagnosis was type 1 myocardial infarction in 11.9% (90/756) of women and 15.5% (184/1185) of men. Men with suspected acute coronary syndrome had a higher burden of established cardiovascular risk factors than women, including higher rates of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, known ischemic heart disease, and cigarette smoking. A positive family history was more common among women. However, the frequency of cardiovascular risk factors was similar in men and women with a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction, with only previous coronary artery bypass grafting and cigarette smoking more common in men than women (Table S1).

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics of Study Population

Symptom Characteristics

Chest pain was the most common presenting symptom, reported by 92% (698/756) of women and 91% (1081/1185) of men with suspected acute coronary syndrome (P = 0.439; Table 2). Pain with typical nature descriptors, the presence of radiation, and the presence of additional symptoms were all more common in women with suspected acute coronary syndrome (P < 0.04 for all; Table 2). Women, compared with men, more often reported palpitations as a presenting symptom (11% versus 7%; Table S2). Women were also more likely to report that their pain radiated to the left arm (36% versus 31%), the back (31% versus 17%), or to the neck or jaw (28% versus 20%) than were men, and were more likely to report associated nausea (34% versus 22%; Table S2).

### Rizatriptan [^112SeJwy]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina

Rizatriptan benzoate should not be given to patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of rizatriptan benzoate. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). 5-HT1agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.

Triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving rizatriptan benzoate. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consideration should be given to administration of the first rizatriptan benzoate dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following rizatriptan benzoate administration. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered in intermittent long-term users of rizatriptan benzoate who have cardiovascular risk factors.

5.2 Arrhythmias

Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1agonists. Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate if these disturbances occur.

5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure

As with other 5-HT1agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck and jaw commonly occur after treatment with rizatriptan benzoate and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT1agonists.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort including pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, or squeezing, whereas sharp pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease and usually occurs with acute pericarditis. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, while sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area and pain radiating to below the umbilicus or hip are unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common associated symptoms include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

Data Collection and Definitions

The enrolled hospitals periodically uploaded their data to the central server of the ISACS‐TC. Registry data were collected by the designated physician at the time of clinical assessment. Killip classification at admission was determined by the attending physician in the emergency department. 17 Patients were asked about the quality of their symptoms. Typical chest pain was defined as any symptom of chest discomfort characterized by a sensation or pressure or tightness under the sternum or chest bone, with pain that may radiate to jaw, arms, or neck. The variable of atypical chest pain included both patients with atypical symptoms and those who were asymptomatic. Chest pain was considered to be atypical when its distribution was unusual, such as pressure or pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen or pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, or the stomach. Patients with angina "equivalents", such as dyspnea, and fatigue, were defined as asymptomatic.

Clinical Characteristics

We collected demographic and clinical characteristics for each patient including historical features of the chest pain and associated symptoms, past medical history, family history, physical examination findings, and electrocardiographic results. For SCAMP-enrolled patients, these data were collected on SCAMP data forms completed by the provider at the time of the visit. For patients in the historic cohort, the same data were retrospectively ascertained from the cardiologist's clinic note created at the time of the visit.

To target potential cardiac causes of chest pain, pertinent positive clinical history included whether the pain was associated with exertion or exertional syncope, radiated to the back, jaw, left arm, or left shoulder, increased with supine position, or was temporally associated with fever. Past medical history was considered positive if the patient had a condition that could lead to an increased risk of pathologic chest pain including systemic arthritis/vasculitis, a hypercoaguable state, or prolonged immobilization. Family history was considered positive if any of the following were present in a first-degree relative: sudden or unexplained death, cardiomyopathy, or a hypercoaguable state. Pertinent positives on physical examination included a pathological murmur, gallop, pericardial friction rub, abnormal second heart sound, distant heart sounds, peripheral edema, painful or swollen extremities, tachypnea, or fever (oral temperature > 38.4°C).

Test Interpretation

Electrocardigraphic interpretation was based on documented findings in the cardiologist's clinic note in the historical cohort and on the SCAMP data form for the SCAMP cohort. Ventricular hypertrophy, pathological ST-segment or T-wave changes (> 2 mm), high-grade atrioventricular block, ventricular or atrial ectopy, low QRS voltages, PR segment depression, S1/Q3/inverted T3, or a prolonged QTc > 470 ms were considered positive criteria.

Echocardiography, EST, and Holter and long-term event monitor results were obtained from reports generated at the time of the study in the historical cohort and from the SCAMP data form in the SCAMP group. Testing was generally obtained at the time of or soon after the initial visit for chest pain. Diagnoses from these tests that were considered potential cardiac causes of chest pain included specific coronary anomalies, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, pericarditis, pulmonary hypertension, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism.

5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure

Sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with eletriptan hydrobromide and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. Eletriptan hydrobromide tablets are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal's variant angina [see Contraindications (4)].

5.4 Cerebrovascular Events

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not.

Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical of migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions need to be excluded. Eletriptan hydrobromide tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [see Contraindications (4)].

5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions

Eletriptan hydrobromide may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional eletriptan hydrobromide doses [see Contraindications (4)].

5.6 Medication Overuse Headache

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused acute migraine drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.

### Typical and atypical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome: time to retire the terms? [^113oa83j]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Studies indicate that symptoms labeled as "atypical" are more common in women evaluated for myocardial infarction (MI) and may contribute to the lower likelihood of a diagnosis and delayed treatment and result in poorer outcomes compared with men with MI. Atypical pain is frequently defined as epigastric or back pain or pain that is described as burning, stabbing, or characteristic of indigestion. Typical symptoms usually include chest, arm, or jaw pain described as dull, heavy, tight, or crushing. In a recent article published in the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Ferry and colleagues addressed presenting symptoms in men and women diagnosed with MI and reported that typical symptoms in women were more predictive of a diagnosis of MI than for men. A critical question is, are there really typical or atypical symptoms, and if so, who is the reference group? We propose that researchers and clinicians either discontinue using the terms typical and atypical or provide the reference group to which the terms apply (eg, men versus women). We believe it is past time to standardize the symptom assessment for MI so that proper and rapid diagnostic testing can be undertaken; however, we cannot standardize the symptom experience. When we do this, we are at risk of having study results, such as those of Ferry and colleagues, that vary from prior evidence and could lead to what the authors hope to avoid: disadvantaging women in receiving expeditious diagnostic testing and treatment for acute coronary syndrome.

Physical examination findings in patients with chest pain — syndrome-specific clues: Acute coronary syndrome may present with diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, and an MR murmur, and examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. Pulmonary embolism can include pain with inspiration. Aortic dissection features severe pain with abrupt onset with pulse differential and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. Esophageal rupture may present with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, and unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds. Pericarditis can show fever, pleuritic chest pain increased in the supine position, and a friction rub. Myocarditis may include fever, chest pain, heart failure, and S3. Pneumothorax may present with dyspnea and pain on inspiration with unilateral absence of breath sounds. Costochondritis presents with tenderness of costochondral joints. Herpes zoster presents with pain in a dermatomal distribution, triggered by touch, with a characteristic unilateral dermatomal rash. Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration markedly reduce the probability of ACS.

Chest pain — symptom characterization and terminology — should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Although the term chest pain is used in clinical practice, patients often report pressure, tightness, squeezing, heaviness, or burning, and a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort"; patients may also report a location other than the chest, including the shoulder, arm, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw. Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac, and pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis — top take-home messages include that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

We describe a 63-year-old smoker who suffered from intractable facial pain secondary to an underlying lung neoplasm. Data from 30 previously reported and similar cases are also summarized. The clinical triad of a smoker suffering from periauricular pain and an elevated ESR should alert the clinician to the possibility of an occult lung mass. In these cases a computed tomography of the chest should always be obtained. Previously refractory pain typically responds to surgical resection of the mass and/or radiation therapy.

### Sex-and gender-stratified risks of psychological factors for incident ischemic heart disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113MQtW7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease is the most important cause of death globally and has obvious sex and gender (S&G) differences. 1 In 2015, 17.7 million people died from a cardiovascular disease event, of which an estimated 7.4 million were due to ischemic heart disease (IHD). 2 The prevalence of IHD is higher in men than in women (7.4% and 5.3% respectively, in US adults), and IHD mortality is up to 5 times higher in men than in women. 3, 4 Women develop IHD 10 years later than men on average, with risks increasing after menopause. 1 IHD comprises all cardiac conditions with an ischemic origin (ie, both obstructive coronary artery disease [CAD] and coronary microvascular disease). The term IHD is particularly relevant for cardiac diagnosis in women because women present more often than men with signs and symptoms of IHD in the absence of obstructive coronary arteries. 5 The combination of nonobstructive CAD and vasomotor disorders dominates in women at middle age and is often underestimated or not included in clinical studies. 5, 6 Whereas men more often experience the classic symptoms of chest pain with radiation to the back and arms, women more often present with "atypical" symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain at rest, nausea, and back or jaw pain than men, and these symptoms are not readily recognized as diagnostic for IHD. 2

Presentation (Symptoms)

Clinical presentation and characteristics of IHD between the sexes can differ. Women are more likely to present with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and with a varied pattern and distribution of symptoms, creating challenges for healthcare providers and women themselves to interpret symptoms as cardiac specific. 62, 63

Compared with men, women are more likely to develop angina as their first CVD manifestation (47% versus 32%) and less likely to present with an acute MI (6% versus 10%). Sex differences in the clinical presentation of IHD are more pronounced in women aged < 45 years with acute MI, who are more likely to present with chest pain equivalents and have higher in‐hospital 30‐day mortality; these sex differences are not as pronounced in women aged > 65 years. 64

Although most women report central chest pain during an ACS, they may describe it as tightness, pressure, or burning, and it is frequently accompanied by nonchest symptoms, such as dyspnea, fatigue, weakness, nausea, and discomfort in the upper back, shoulder, jaw, or arm. Defining chest pain as typical, atypical, and noncardiac, according to its relation to exertion, rest, or emotional stress, is derived from predominantly male cohorts and is less predictive of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in women, especially those aged < 65 years.

5.4	Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure

Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina.

5.5	Cerebrovascular Events

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs.

Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [see Contraindications (4)].

5.6	Other Vasospasm Reactions

Sumatriptan may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets.

Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1agonists have not been clearly established.

Chest pain is a common presenting complaint in the primary care setting. Imaging plays a key role in the evaluation of the multiple organ systems that can be responsible for chest pain. With numerous imaging modalities available, determination of the most appropriate test and interpretation of the findings can be a challenge for the clinician. In this 2-part series, we offer resources to guide primary care physicians in the selection of imaging studies and present the imaging findings of various causes of nonemergent chest pain. In Part 2, we focus on the radiologic appearance of common noncardiac sources of chest pain, including gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal etiologies.

Initial evaluation — history for chest pain emphasizes that in patients with chest pain, a focused history that includes characteristics and duration of symptoms relative to presentation as well as associated features, and cardiovascular risk factor assessment should be obtained. A comprehensive history that captures all the characteristics of chest pain, including but not limited to its 1) nature; 2) onset and duration; 3) location and radiation; 4) precipitating factors; 5) relieving factors; and 6) associated symptoms, can help better identify potential cardiac causes and should be obtained from all patients. The initial ECG is important to the evaluation, but history, examination, biomarkers, and other aids remain essential, and there is frequently a lack of correlation between intensity of symptoms and seriousness of disease.

### Typical and atypical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome: time to retire the terms? [^116pt46Y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

In a recent article published in the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Ferry et al 8 addressed presenting symptoms in men and women diagnosed with myocardial infarction (MI) using sex‐specific criteria in a substudy of the High‐STEACS (High‐Sensitivity Troponin in the Evaluation of Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome) trial. The definition of sex‐specific criteria were troponin levels > 99th percentile, which are 16 ng/L for women and 34 ng/L for men. 9 The rationale for the study was that sex‐specific thresholds for troponin have identified a population of patients with MI that was previously unrecognized. Therefore, these patients would have been excluded from prior research on sex differences in symptoms. In addition, "atypical" symptom presentations are more common in women than men and may contribute to the lower likelihood of a diagnosis and treatment and result in poorer outcomes compared with men with MI. Atypical pain was defined by Greenslade et al 10 as "epigastric or back pain or pain that was described as burning, stabbing, characteristic of indigestion, or other". Typical symptoms included "chest, arm, or jaw pain described as dull, heavy, tight, or crushing". The main study finding was that typical symptoms in women were more predictive of a diagnosis of MI than those in men.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes (Table 3) note that anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort and typically build in intensity over a few minutes. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and fleeting chest pain — of few seconds' duration — is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain (with radiation to the upper or lower back) is unlikely to be angina and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area or that radiates to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, whereas positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, heartburn unrelated to meals, and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

Physical examination — initial assessment of chest pain: In patients presenting with chest pain, a focused cardiovascular examination should be performed initially to aid in the diagnosis of ACS or other potentially serious causes of chest pain (eg, aortic dissection, PE, or esophageal rupture) and to identify complications (COR 1, LOE C-EO). Life-threatening causes of chest pain include, but are not limited to, ACS, PE, aortic dissection, and esophageal rupture, and because ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) can be recognized on the ECG, the major challenge is to distinguish between non–ST-segment–elevation (NSTE)-ACS and noncardiac chest pain. With an uncomplicated AMI, the examination may be negative, and although sudden severe chest or back pain with limb pulse differential suggests aortic dissection, the sensitivity of that finding alone was only 30%.

Background

Despite decades of quality‐improvement efforts, the timely diagnosis of STEMI patients in the ED presents significant operational challenges. In managing the timely care of patients with STEMI, EDs encounter 3 distinct types of patients who differ on the screening, diagnosis, and treatment continuum. First are patients who have been prediagnosed with STEMI, who have had an ECG performed and interpreted by another provider. They are usually transferred to an ED or a hospital capable of definitive treatment, most often percutaneous coronary intervention. The expectation is that treatment will be initiated on arrival. Second are prescreened patients who have been evaluated by another provider and referred to the ED with an ECG concerning for ischemia. In these cases, the diagnosis needs to be confirmed with a repeat ECG or reinterpretation of the ECG on arrival. The burden of screening for STEMI from the report of symptoms has already been met in these 2 scenarios; however, treatment has not been initiated. Third are the patients at greatest risk of delays in care: those arriving in the ED with undifferentiated symptoms who are primarily screened by that ED. In these cases, timely STEMI diagnosis is dependent on the patient's condition and symptoms triggering ED intake staff to perform an early ECG. 4, 5 The ECG is often considered the screening test for STEMI. In the context of emergency care, however, treatment is initiated with ECG evidence of STEMI, making it a diagnostic test. 6 The true screening test is the criteria by which ED care providers initiate an ECG (Figure 2).

Overly comprehensive screening criteria for a rare disease like STEMI risks underutilization. The sole use of chest pain is user friendly but likely produces inadequate case capture. Overall, 20% to 30% of patients with STEMI will report atypical symptoms like shortness of breath and dizziness 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or will focus on associated symptoms like jaw, neck, or back pain. In addition, age positively influences the probability of STEMI, and elderly patients with STEMI more frequently report atypical symptoms. 12, 13, 14 Shorter time to reperfusion has been shown to improve outcomes. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Door‐to‐ECG time interval is the first STEMI care target toward achieving timely intervention.

### Clinical transformation through change management case study: chest pain in the emergency department [^111hhJhr]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

2 Materials and Methods

A guiding team of emergency medicine physicians, cardiologists, and nursing leadership was assembled representing an influential coalition. A vision to "establish the standard of care" for this patient population was developed and communicated. Following the ACT methodology, the pertinent systematic review of chest pain risk stratification was performed, current data was presented, a consensus algorithm (adapted from three SCAMPs pilots at Brigham and Women's Hospital; 10/14/2012 to 5/20/2014) was drafted (Fig. 2) with plans to capture the data from adherence to and deviations from the algorithm.

Fig. 2
High level chest pain algorithm*.

*This high level algorithm is an abdriged version of the full interdisciplinary algorithm.

During the planning process, four critical components emerged as essential elements to algorithm formation:
I. Identification: Adults with undifferentiated chest pain presenting to the ED.
II. Indications: Inclusions: Chest discomfort/pain, chest pressure/fullness, pain radiating to left/both arms, jaw pain, pain in back/neck/stomach, shortness of breath, cold sweats, nausea/vomiting, lightheadedness. Exclusions: High concern for ACS on presentation [patients with STEMI (ST segment elevation myocardial infarction), definite NSTEMI, heart failure, arrhythmia, or non-cardiac etiology such as gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal or pulmonary.
III. Stratification: The HEART (H istory, E KG, A ge, R isk factors, T roponin) score was chosen as the best stratification tool. The HEART score, had been prospectively validated for ED chest pain patients in The Netherlands via risk stratification with significantly higher concordance (c-statistic) than the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) or the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) scores. A secondary analysis of the Myeloperoxidase In the Diagnosis of Acute coronary syndromes Study (MIDAS) at 18 tertiary referral centers in the United States showed the HEART score identified a substantial number of low-risk patients for the early discharge, by incorporating a serial troponin measure, while maintaining high sensitivity for ACS.
IV. Actions: Patients in the low-risk category (HEART score 0–3) would have a repeat troponin blood test in three hours and if normal would be discharged with cardiology or primary care physician follow-up within 72 h. Patients in the intermediate-risk category (HEART score 4–6) were recommended for observation status. Patients with a high-risk for ACS (HEART score 7–10) were recommended to be admitted for further evaluation and treatment.

### Differential diagnosis of chest symptoms in the athlete [^111igvRy]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Chest pain is a common complaint of athletes in all age groups. In athletes, chest pain is often attributed to "chest tightness", and treatment for bronchospasm is considered. However, the causes of the pain are wide and varied, and the pain is referable to the many organ systems that localize to the thorax. Therefore, when treatment with bronchodilators fails, it becomes important to consider other nonasthmatic causes of the pain. These causes can be organized by system and are explained in this article. Cardiac causes are the most feared and, fortunately, are very rare in the adolescent setting. With a thorough knowledge of etiologies of chest pain, the physician can often make a diagnosis with only a history and a physical exam.

2021 Chest Pain Guideline — symptom characterization and terminology states that the sensation produced by myocardial ischemia is characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse, and that point tenderness renders ischemia less likely. It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation, and the diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone, with some patients having noncardiac chest pain that may be ischemic in origin. Chest pain more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, and the more classic the chest discomfort is based on quality, location, radiation, and provoking and relieving factors, the more likely it is to be of cardiac ischemic origin. Atypical chest pain is a problematic term, and, as stated, we discourage the use of atypical chest pain; to diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged, and chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen.

### Presenting symptoms in men and women diagnosed with myocardial infarction using sex-specific criteria [^114mMZtU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptom Characterization

Patients were interviewed in the emergency department. The presenting symptoms as reported by the patient were documented on a data collection form (Figure S1) by a research nurse from the trial team blinded to the troponin concentration. If patients reported > 1 symptom (eg, chest pain and dyspnea), both symptoms were recorded as a presenting symptom. Presenting symptoms were then classified as typical or atypical, as described by Greenslade and colleagues. 14 Typical pain was classified in patients reporting the presence of chest, arm, or jaw pain with descriptors of dull, heavy, tight, pressure, ache, squeezing, crushing, or gripping. Atypical pain was classified in patients reporting epigastric or back pain or pain that was burning, stabbing, indigestion‐like, or any other pain description or presentation. 14 Guidelines also state that radiation of pain and the presence of associated symptoms form part of a typical presentation 8; therefore the presence of radiation (right arm, left arm, neck, jaw, back) and presence of any associated feature (nausea, vomiting, sweating, dyspnea, palpitations) was also documented.

High‐Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I Assay

### Unusual and very rare presentation of wrist pain in a man with acute anterior myocardial infarction, a case report and literature of review [^115BtEon]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As a rising concern in the field of cardiology, and emergency medicine, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are the most focused and prevalent complaints in these fields. AMI is considered a leading cause of death in developed countries and developing countries are struggling with this epidemic.

As AMI more commonly occurs in men, the symptoms that are available in the studies are more presented by men by typical presentation such as chest pain, cold sweating, and dyspnea. Because of the lack of evidence and data regarding atypical symptoms, which are statistically higher among women, diabetic patients, and other groups, these symptoms may not be diagnosed early enough for treatment. The patients can experience a wide range of unspecific pain and discomfort from the lower jaw to the abdomen while experiencing MI. There are cases reported that the pain was in other uncommon places such as ears, legs, or thighs. The atypical presentation of STEMI is estimated to be about 26–34%.

Furthermore, the mortality of patients presenting with atypical symptoms is higher than that of patients presenting with typical pain. In a study, the mortality of these patients was reported to be 20% higher.

Since the misdiagnosis of unusual manifestations, and late referral to the emergency room can lead to fatal cardiovascular outcomes, doctors should consider these factors. To detect rare forms of the disease, it is therefore important to introduce rare atypical symptoms. We introduce a patient with wrist pain in both hands with acute heart infarction.

Work group conclusions list Potential level: IV and Downgraded level: IV, and the conclusions note that a significant percentage of patients may present with atypical symptoms (e.g., scapular pain only) and that these patients responded well to surgical treatment.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest, and that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, whereas "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, structured risk assessment should be used and risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

### Adequately identifying low-risk chest pain in emergency primary care: evaluating the performance of preHEAR (T) based on two European cohorts [^112wfQkG]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

In this subanalysis, we validated the preHEAR score, comprising the first four elements without troponin (0–8 points, low-risk ≤ 3), using data from both the OUT-ACS and TRACE cohorts. We validated the preHEART scores using the OUT-ACS cohort, including a single hs-cTnT measurement (figure 2).

Figure 2
The prehospital HEAR(T) score. hs-cTnT, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T; LoD, limit of detection; URL, upper reference limit of normal.

The subjectivity issues of the history and ECG components of the original HEART scorewill also extend to the preHEART score. To mitigate such subjectivity, we have tried to standardise these components in the dataset as follows.

For the history component, we assigned points based on high- and low-risk features. Patients presenting solely with cardiac-suspected symptoms, such as constricting or tearing chest pain, chest pressure, diaphoresis, dyspnoea, nausea or vomiting or pain radiating to arms/jaw/neck, were assigned two points. Those presenting only with non-specific symptoms, like sharp, pinpoint, well-localised pain, burning pain, pain dependent on respiration, movement or palpation, as well as fatigue, syncope, palpitations or other non-specific pain, received zero points. Patients presenting with a combination of both specific and non-specific symptoms were given one point.

For the ECG component, interpretations were categorised to reduce subjectivity. Patients with ECGs interpreted as normal or non-ischaemic were given zero points. Those with non-specific findings received one point, including non-specific ST-segment or T-wave changes, repolarisation abnormalities, Q-waves, pacemaker rhythms, left ventricular hypertrophy, digoxin effects or bundle branch blocks. Patients with STEMI or ECGs exhibiting highly suggestive ischaemic findings, such as ST-segment depression or inversion of T-waves, were assigned two points. In the TRACE cohort, unreported ECGs were classified as normal.

### Acute coronary syndrome: diagnosis and initial management [^113e7qBD]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is defined as reduced blood flow to the coronary myocardium manifesting as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or non-ST-segment elevation ACS, which includes unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Common risk factors include being at least 65 years of age or a current smoker or having hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, a body mass index greater than 25 kg per m², or a family history of premature coronary artery disease. Symptoms most predictive of ACS include chest discomfort that is substernal or spreading to the arms or jaw. However, chest pain that can be reproduced with palpation or varies with breathing or position is less likely to signify ACS. Having a prior abnormal cardiac stress test result indicates increased risk. Electrocardiography changes that predict ACS include ST depression, ST elevation, T-wave inversion, or presence of Q waves. No validated clinical decision tool is available to rule out ACS in the outpatient setting. Elevated troponin levels without ST-segment elevation on electrocardiography suggest non-ST-segment elevation ACS. Patients with ACS should receive coronary angiography with percutaneous or surgical revascularization. Other important management considerations include initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy and parenteral anticoagulation, statin therapy, beta-blocker therapy, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor therapy. Additional interventions shown to reduce mortality in patients who have had a recent myocardial infarction include smoking cessation, annual influenza vaccination, and cardiac rehabilitation.

### Role of noninvasive testing in the clinical evaluation of women with suspected ischemic heart disease: a consensus statement from the American Heart Association [^1143teWJ]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Typical patterns of symptom presentation in women describe differences in symptom triggers and descriptors compared with men; the most common presentation of myocardial ischemia is chest pain or discomfort; however, women have a different pattern and distribution of non–chest-related pain symptoms, and women's ischemic symptoms are more often precipitated by mental or emotional stress and less frequently by physical exertion; proportionately, women more often report epigastric discomfort and associated nausea; radiation of discomfort to the arms, neck, and interscapular areas; and dyspnea and fatigue; studies have not found a pattern of symptoms uniquely ascribed to either sex, but significant overlap in qualitative descriptors exists, and the evidence synthesis highlights that women experience a broad range of symptoms, frequently including recent and stress-related symptoms.

### Sex-based differences in the performance of the HEART score in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain [^11312byg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

History

Patient history was scored as highly suspicious in case of typical chest pain — retrosternal or left‐sided chest pain with radiation to jaw, neck, or left arm, induced by exercise or emotional stress, and relieved by rest and/or nitroglycerin — and scored nonsuspicious in case of atypical chest pain — no chest pain, right‐sided chest pain, abdominal symptoms, pain that radiated to the back, or pain worsening on inspiration or palpation. Patients presenting with both typical and atypical symptoms were scored moderately suspicious.

ECG

The admission ECG was evaluated by 2 cardiologists. In case of dispute, a third cardiologist has decided. One point was given in case of nonspecific ST‐T wave changes, signs of previous MI, or other abnormalities not diagnostic for ischemia, such as left bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or pacemaker rhythm. Two points were given if there was significant new ST‐segment elevation or ‐depression suspect for myocardial ischemia, in the absence of left bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or use of digoxin.

Risk factors

Cardiovascular risk factors taken into account were current smoking (or quit < 1 month ago), dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity (body mass index, ≥ 30 kg/m²), and history of cardiovascular disease (coronary revascularization, MI, cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack, and/or peripheral artery disease). Dyslipidemia was scored when diagnosed previously by a physician or diagnosed during the index visit, according to the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines. 19 Hypertension was scored when reported in the medical history, when diagnosed during the index visit, or when the patient was treated for hypertension. 20 Diabetes mellitus was defined as any type of diabetes mellitus diagnosed previously by a physician or during the index visit. 21

Troponin

The HEART score only considers admission troponin levels. Troponin levels were measured with the Access AccuTnI+3 Troponin I assay on the UniCel DxI Immunoassay System (Beckmann Coulter, Brea, CA). The cutoff for MI was set at > 60 ng/L at the coefficient of variation < 10%. The limit of detection was 10 ng/L, and the 99th percentile cut‐off point of 42 ng/L. 22

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Acute chest pain with suspected gastrointestinal syndromes — among outpatients who present with chest pain, approximately 10% to 20% have a gastrointestinal cause, and in patients with recurrent acute chest pain without evidence of a cardiac or pulmonary cause, evaluation for gastrointestinal causes is reasonable. The first step in evaluation of potential esophageal chest pain is a careful history, and a history of use of medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, potassium supplements, iron, or bisphosphonates should be sought. When an esophageal cause of chest pain is suspected, upper endoscopy should be considered, and symptoms and signs that merit early evaluation (usually within 2 weeks) include dysphagia, odynophagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, weight loss, and recurrent vomiting. Patients without these symptoms may merit a trial of empiric acid suppression therapy, and if an upper endoscopy is normal and the symptoms persist despite a trial of acid suppression, consideration should be given to additional evaluation, such as esophageal function testing and pH monitoring, to exclude other esophageal causes.

Angina pectoris — recommendation-specific supportive text — notes that angina pectoris is perceived as a retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress (physical or emotional) or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation (eg, left arm, neck, jaw) and its associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea, nausea, lightheadedness). When actively treated or spontaneously resolving, it dissipates over a few minutes. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, confusion, presyncope or syncope, or vague abdominal symptoms are more common among patients with diabetes, women, and the elderly. A detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain — terminology and characterization — emphasizes precise language and symptom context: Chest pain should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and chest pain should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Because patients may not use the descriptor "pain", a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort". Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac. Pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing) and anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain localized to a very limited area or radiating below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, and occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdomen discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

6.3 Versus Joint Disorders

MPS often overlaps with joint‐related disorders, such as osteoarthritis, bursitis, tendinopathies, and TMJD, as these conditions present with localized musculoskeletal pain. Both MPS and joint disorders may present with pain during movement, making it challenging to differentiate them based solely on pain location. However, MPS is primarily characterized by the presence of discrete MTrPs, which produce referred pain that may not correspond directly to joint involvement. For example, shoulder pain in MPS may originate from MTrPs in the trapezius or infraspinatus muscles rather than from the glenohumeral joint itself. Similarly, TMJD and MPS can both cause pain in the jaw, neck, and facial muscles. However, TMJD pain is typically localized to the temporomandibular joint and is associated with joint‐specific dysfunctions, such as clicking, locking, or reduced jaw movement. In contrast, MPS‐related pain radiating to the jaw and face is often traced back to MTrPs in muscles like the masseter, temporalis, or sternocleidomastoid. Within the TMJD literature, a model for studying chronic pain has been developed that uses repeated intra‐muscular injections of nerve growth factor (NGF) to induce progressively worsening muscle pain, mechanical hyperalgesia, and functional limitations. NGF contributes to these effects by sensitizing peripheral nociceptive terminals, altering nociceptor transcription, and promoting nociceptor sprouting. With future research, the NGF pain model may improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of MPS.

A detailed clinical examination is essential to differentiate MPS from joint disorders, including TMJD. In MPS, palpation of MTrPs reproduces the patient's characteristic pain patterns, while in joint disorders, pain is more closely linked to joint movement and loading. Additionally, radiographic evidence of joint degeneration or inflammation is more commonly seen in joint disorders, whereas MPS is associated with muscle activation and the presence of taut bands.

In cases where both MPS and joint pathology coexist, effective pain management requires addressing both the joint dysfunction and myofascial components. For example, TMJD may coexist with MTrPs in the masticatory muscles, requiring targeted treatments for both joint dysfunction and myofascial pain to achieve optimal results. Please refer to Table 3 for a summary of the key characteristics and distinctions used in the differential diagnosis of MPS.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^116oj6Tr]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Clinical presentations of myocardial infarction — onset of myocardial ischemia is the initial step in MI and can be identified from the patient's history and the electrocardiogram (ECG); symptoms may include chest, upper extremity, mandibular, or epigastric discomfort, dyspnea, or fatigue, but they are not specific and MI may be atypical or silent. Very brief ischemia can cause cardiac troponin release and elevations, and the involved myocytes can subsequently die due to apoptosis. If myocardial ischemia is present clinically or detected by ECG changes together with myocardial injury manifested by a rising and/or falling cTn pattern, a diagnosis of acute MI is appropriate; if ischemia is not present clinically, elevated cTn may indicate acute myocardial injury (with rising and/or falling values) or more chronic ongoing injury (if unchanging). In suspected acute coronary syndrome ruled out for MI with normal cardiac biomarkers (≤ 99th percentile URL), unstable angina or an alternative diagnosis may be present, and these patients should be evaluated and treated accordingly.

### A novel diagnostic protocol to identify patients suitable for discharge after a single high-sensitivity troponin [^112cnWFJ]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Consecutive patients attending the ED with suspected ACS were prospectively screened from July 2012 to August 2013. Patients were included if they were at least 18 years of age and had at least 5 min of chest pain suggestive of ACS, and for whom the attending physician determined inpatient evaluation was required. Possible cardiac symptoms included acute chest, epigastric, neck, jaw or arm pain, or discomfort or pressure without an apparent non-cardiac source, in accordance with the American Heart Association case definitions. Patients were excluded if any of the following were present: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or left bundle branch block not known to be old, ECG changes diagnostic of ischaemia (ST segment depression ≥ 1 mm or T-wave inversion consistent with the presence of ischaemia), arrhythmias (new-onset atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, sustained supraventricular tachycardia, second-degree or complete heart block, or sustained or recurrent ventricular arrhythmias), hs-cTnT not suitable for analysis (eg, haemolysis), age ≥ 80 years, atypical symptoms in the absence of chest discomfort, a clear non-ACS cause for chest pain was found at presentation (eg, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, aortic dissection), another medical condition requiring hospital admission, refusal or inability to give informed consent, non-English speaking, pregnancy, renal failure requiring dialysis or inability to be contacted after discharge.

Data were collected prospectively using a published data dictionary. Attending ED clinicians completed the m-Goldman risk score on a predesigned clinical report form. Follow-up was undertaken by independent review of hospital electronic patient records, summary of health records from the patient's general practitioner (GP) obtained at least 6 months after attendance and a national clinical records search (which identifies death). The ethics committee did not grant permission for direct patient contact as they felt that comprehensive follow-up data relating to adverse events could be obtained accurately through GP records. This is because in the UK, GPs hold comprehensive records for individuals relating to primary, secondary and tertiary care. GP records have been demonstrated to be more accurate at reporting hospital admissions, including those for cardiac related events, than patients.GPs were therefore requested to provide all information regarding presentation to other institutions with chest pain, cardiology outpatient review and cardiac testing, including angiography with or without intervention. Where a participant had not attended hospital follow-up and/or a GP had failed to provide a health record/not GP-registered, the patient was regarded as lost to follow-up.

### Aortic dissection presenting as gait disturbance: a case report [^111PtBud]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Emergency medicine dogma traditionally teaches that aortic dissection presents as tearing chest pain, radiating to the back. This case report describes a 55-year-old woman presenting with a left homonymous hemianopsia and resultant gait disturbance. Initial head computed tomography demonstrated a right parietal infarct, and chest radiograph demonstrated a markedly widened mediastinum. Acute Stanford type A aortic dissection was subsequently confirmed. This report provides further evidence for atypical, painless presentations of aortic dissection. Given recent literature on the increasing prevalence of painless dissection, the disease entity should be included in the differential diagnosis for stroke, and a simple portable chest x-ray should always be obtained before administering thrombolytics.

Synopsis of noncardiac chest pain — differential diagnosis is broad and includes respiratory, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, psychological, and other causes; musculoskeletal causes are the most common and include costochondritis, muscle strain, and consequences of recent or occult chest trauma such as rib fracture; gastrointestinal causes, commonly esophageal, include gastrointestinal reflux, esophageal dysmotility, and gastritis from either medications or peptic ulcer disease; respiratory causes are less frequent but potentially more serious and include PE, pneumonia, and pneumothorax; many patients will have dyspnea in addition to chest pain; psychological causes are usually diagnoses of exclusion but merit consideration in the right context.

### The tooth, the whole tooth, and nothing but the tooth: can dental pain ever be the sole presenting symptom of a myocardial infarction? A systematic review [^112tjAz7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pain symptoms related to cardiac ischemia can vary greatly from patient to patient. However, should emergency physicians consider the possibility of myocardial infarction in patients who present solely with dental pain?

Objective

This is a systematic review of the literature investigating the incidence of jaw, tooth, or facial pain as the sole symptom of cardiac ischemia.

Methods

Studies investigating jaw, tooth, or facial pain of cardiac origin were identified using the PubMed database. All English studies in which cardiac pain originated in the face, teeth, or jaw were screened for inclusion. Data were abstracted from each study utilizing a structured review process, and rated for methodological quality.

Results

Eighteen studies met study criteria: 16 were case reports, and the remaining 2 were prospective cohort studies. After quality assessment and categorization, nine reports were categorized as weak, eight moderate, and one strong methodological quality.

Conclusion

Cardiac ischemia may present in no anatomic location other than face or jaw. However, despite frequent claims in the literature to the contrary, the lack of methodological quality of the studies investigated impedes a firm conclusion of face, jaw, or tooth pain as the only symptom of cardiac insufficiency.

### Symptoms in acute coronary syndromes: does sex make a difference? [^115WP1qQ]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary heart disease is a major problem in both men and women, but several studies have shown sex differences in symptoms of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Some findings, however, have been disparate and inadequate, and thus a comprehensive overview of this literature would be of value.

Method

Fifteen studies that identified symptoms of ACS for both women and men were examined through a review of the literature from 1989 to 2002. Terms used for the search included "myocardial infarction", "symptoms", "gender differences", and "acute coronary syndromes".

Results

Although chest pain was the most common symptom in both men and women, several differences were also noted. In all types of ACS, women had significantly more back and jaw pain, nausea and/or vomiting, dyspnea, indigestion, and palpitations. In a number of studies, which solely sampled patients with acute myocardial infarction, women demonstrated more back, jaw, and neck pain and nausea and/or vomiting, dyspnea, palpitations, indigestion, dizziness, fatigue, loss of appetite, and syncope. Men reported more chest pain and diaphoresis in the myocardial infarction sample. The designs and methodologies of the studies varied considerably.

Conclusion

In addition to the typical symptom of chest pain in ACS, women experience other atypical symptoms more frequently than men. Thus, there may be sex differences in the symptoms of ACS, differences that have a bearing not only on clinical practice, but also on the interpretation of available clinical studies and the design of future investigations.

### A 40-year-old woman with pain in the chest, hands, and feet [^11475MKg]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 40-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain and pain in the joints of her hands and feet. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges; the differential is refined until a final diagnosis is made.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain symptom characterization and terminology — For myocardial ischemia, the sensation is described as "characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse", and "Point tenderness renders ischemia less likely". "It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation.17" Although "A patient's history is the most important basis for considering presence or absence of myocardial ischemia", "The diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone", and "In some patients, what appears to be noncardiac chest pain may be ischemic in origin". Features more consistent with ischemia are summarized as "Chest pain that is more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin". Terminology guidance states "Atypical chest pain is a problematic term" and "we discourage the use of atypical chest pain"; to reduce ambiguity, "To diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged", and "chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen".

### Rizatriptan benzoate [^1153JkAA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina

Rizatriptan benzoate should not be given to patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of rizatriptan benzoate. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). 5-HT1agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.

Triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving rizatriptan benzoate. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consideration should be given to administration of the first rizatriptan benzoate dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following rizatriptan benzoate administration. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered in intermittent long-term users of rizatriptan benzoate who have cardiovascular risk factors.

5.2 Arrhythmias

Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1agonists. Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate if these disturbances occur.

5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure

As with other 5-HT1agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck and jaw commonly occur after treatment with rizatriptan benzoate and are usually non­-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT1agonists.

### 'Never say never': the first successful management of a type A aortic dissection in Liberia [^11313ykX]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Case presentation

A middle-aged Liberian mechanic presented to JFK hospital, Liberia's main teaching hospital and referral centre, with a chief complaint of severe chest pain and palpitations for 2 weeks' duration. The pain was described as dull and progressively worsening, until the morning of admission where he described 8/10 crushing chest pain radiating to the neck and jaw, partially relieved by morphine in the emergency department. Associated features included diaphoresis, vomiting and agitation. There was no history of chest trauma, connective tissue disease, hypertension, diabetes or dyslipidaemia. He had no other known medical conditions, and he was not taking any medications at the time of admission. There was no history of illicit drug use, and he had a remote 10 pack-year smoking history, quitting 22 years ago.

On examination, he was diaphoretic, and in severe distress secondary to pain. Vital signs included a blood pressure (BP) of 130/86 mm Hg, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and a temperature of 36.5°C with a body mass index of 30.4 kg/m². No oxygen saturation was documented. His cardiovascular exam was unremarkable with no murmur, radial-radial delay or significant BP differential on each arm; the only pertinent finding on the rest of his examination was epigastric tenderness.

Supported by an ECG showing an anteroseptal ST elevation myocardial infarction (figure 1), the initial impression was acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Cardiac enzymes and D-dimer are not readily available at JFK. Percutaneous coronary intervention or thrombolysis were also not available; he was managed with morphine, oxygen, nitrates and aspirin; however, the pain continued to progress. The managing team suspected an aortic dissection, so a chest X-ray (CXR) was performed, which showed mediastinal widening (figure 2), prompting a point-of-care ultrasound. This showed a dilated aortic root > 4 cm (5.48 cm) (figure 3) with visible dissection flap at the aortic root (figure 4).

### Heart in the 'jaws' of a constrictor, unusual cause of subacute right heart failure [^115GhMGt]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Constrictive Pericarditis (CP) is a potentially curable cause of diastolic heart failure. Known and common etiologies include previous heart surgery, chest radiation, trauma and infections such as tuberculosis. Conversely, a proportion of the cases may not have well identifiable causes, thus deemed idiopathic. Early identification is cardinal, as timely pericardiectomy is associated with lower operative complications. Clinically, timely diagnosis can be challenging especially in the absence of radiological signs. With high suspicion index, careful evaluation of jugular venous pressure and its wave forms aids diagnosis. Additionally, modern echocardiography machines in experienced hands permit confirmation of clinically suspected in majority cases.

### Patient delay and benefit of timely reperfusion in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^116HuSFY]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Participating PCI hospitals

The Feedback Intervention and Treatment Times in STEMI (FITT-STEMI) study is an ongoing multicentre trial currently including a network of 47 PCI hospitals throughout Germany. The study aims to assess the prognostic impact of a standardised feedback-driven quality management initiative for timely reperfusion therapy on treatment times and mortality in local STEMI treatment networks. The current analysis included data from the period from January 2006 to December 2017. Details of the protocol of the FITT-STEMI study including the predefined outcome measures have been published elsewhere. The PCI hospitals are obligated to prospectively enrol, without exception, all consecutive STEMI patients who presented within less than 24 hours after onset of infarct symptoms. The population analysed in the present paper comprised all STEMI patients who arrived at the primary PCI hospital via EMS with treatment times of less than 6 hours from arrival at the scene to balloon inflation.

Assessment of symptom onset

Patients were asked to provide information about their precise time of symptom onset related to the current episode of myocardial infarction. Symptoms of angina pectoris were deﬁned as any complaint of chest pain or compression due to myocardial ischaemia, which did not subside spontaneously and occurred both at rest or during exercise. When related to the current episode, pain radiating to left arm, neck or jaw was taken into account. Symptoms indicative of preinfarction unstable angina pectoris were documented. Symptom-to-contact time intervals were categorised in groups with 'very early' (S2C ≤ 1 hour), 'early' (1 hour < S2C ≤ 2 hours), 'intermediate' (2 hours < S2C ≤ 6 hours) and 'late' (6 hours < S2C ≤ 24 hours) presentation. Total ischaemic time was the time elapsed from symptom onset, when chest pain became more intense and sustained, to the balloon inflation in the catheterisation laboratory following wire crossing of the culprit lesion.

Definitions for Table 1.1 — symptom categories for chest discomfort are specified. Likely anginal symptoms include chest/epigastric/shoulder/arm/jaw pain or chest pressure/discomfort with exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest, nitroglycerin, or both. Less-likely anginal symptoms include dyspnea or fatigue when not exertional and not relieved by rest/nitroglycerin, as well as generalized fatigue or chest discomfort with a time course not suggestive of angina. A noncardiac explanation is present when an alternative diagnosis such as gastroesophageal reflux, chest trauma, anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or pleurisy is the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms.

### Heart in the 'jaws' of a constrictor, unusual cause of subacute right heart failure [^117BWfAZ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In view of both course and presentation, when faced with acute RHF in the absence of chest radiographic signs of CP, it's suspicion of index must be heightened and advanced imaging modalities sought. Otherwise, patient could be subjected to medical therapy with catastrophic outcome. We believe this case is very unusual and could aid accurate diagnosis of similar cases.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114qMUBR]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — symptom quality, timing, location, and modifiers: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing), and sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is unlikely to be anginal and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome, and pain that can be localized to a very limited area or radiating to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Ripping chest pain, "worse chest pain of my life", especially when sudden in onset and occurring in a hypertensive patient or with a known bicuspid aortic valve or aortic dilation, is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing, sharp pain, or discomfort in the throat or abdomen may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### Assessment and treatment of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and acute nonischemic myocardial injury [^114nhXg2]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptoms

The UDMI notes the following symptoms, in various combinations, as associated with myocardial ischemia: chest, upper extremity, mandibular, or epigastric discomfort, and dyspnea or fatigue during exertion or at rest. Although data on the duration of symptoms are lacking, experts have suggested a minimum of 10 minutes for symptoms to be considered consistent with MI. However, these symptoms, regardless of duration, are not specific for myocardial ischemia, and MI may occur with atypical symptoms or even without symptoms at all. For example, an assessment of > 4 million patients with MI found that 33% did not report chest pain on presentation. A cardiac catheterization study of patients with a history of angina and known obstructive CAD reported denial of all typical symptoms of ischemia, including chest pain, in > 30% of patients during ECG-confirmed ischemia induced via prolonged coronary balloon inflation. Symptoms atypical for myocardial ischemia are more common in diabetic patients, the elderly, and women, a combined demographic that accounts for the majority of patients ultimately diagnosed with acute MI. – Moreover, surveillance studies have found up to 45% of all MIs to be silent or unrecognized with mortality rates similar to recognized MIs.

Studies comparing the prevalence of ischemic symptoms among patients with type 1 MI versus type 2 MI or nonischemic myocardial injury are small and limited by classification bias because of symptomatology influence on myocardial injury type classification. Among studies of physician adjudication of myocardial injury type, the prevalence of chest pain ranges significantly from 49% to 93% for type 1 MI, 9% to 62% for type 2 MI, 0% to 27% for nonischemic myocardial injury, and 13% for patients with multifactorial or indeterminate causes of elevated cTn. Dyspnea was more prevalent in type 2 MI (12%–46%) and nonischemic myocardial injury (33%) than in type 1 MI (4%–10%).,

Therefore, the presence or absence of various signs and symptoms may increase or decrease the odds of acute ischemia. However, these signs and symptoms vary in prevalence between types of myocardial injury, none are diagnostic of acute ischemia (MI), and they cannot reliably differentiate types of myocardial injury.

### Unusual and very rare presentation of wrist pain in a man with acute anterior myocardial infarction, a case report and literature of review [^115Cjhxs]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and literature review

Based on the review of the literature, it seems that this is the first case report about" a patient with wrist pain and AMI". A young man with a history of hypertension and pain in the wrists went to the emergency room about 5 h after the onset of symptoms, and this delay caused a decrease in EF. Our patient had wrist pain since 11:30 at night and did not pay attention to it. Even though the symptoms were severe at 3:30 in the morning, he didn't think there was anything serious wrong. Later, he felt a slight burning sensation in the epigastrium and went to the hospital for a gastrointestinal examination. This delay was about 5 h. The patient's description of his pain is very interesting, "I felt that my wrists were about to explode. This condition started at 3:30 a.m. It didn't get better after taking sublingual nitroglycerin and injecting intravenous morphine, but after performing PCI, I got relief from this pain".

Although the majority of AMI cases are characterized by typical chest pain, which may radiate to the arms, back, and lower jaw, a significant percentage of individuals come with atypical MI presentation. The condition of acute myocardial infarction can sometimes manifest in diverse and strange ways, as in the case of our patient suffering from wrist pain, which doctors and nurses need to be aware of. Based on epidemiological studies, about 26–34% of patients with AMI have atypical symptoms. The presence of atypical symptoms causes a late referral of patients to the emergency room, delays in diagnosis and treatment (especially early reperfusion), and higher mortality of patients. This failure in immediate diagnosis and treatment increases the possibility of arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, heart failure, and sudden death. Figure 5 is an illustration of AMI pain distribution based on various studies.

Case summary

A 54 year-old female presented with new onset chest pain radiating to her upper back, associated with recurrent abdominal pain, general malaise, and a 3-days history of nausea and vomiting. Notably, she was hospitalized 2-months ago for abdominal pain, and diagnosed with acute bilateral renal infarcts (left > right) of unknown etiology. Other comorbidities included: recent COVID-19 infection, bronchitis, beta-thalassemia, migraines, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, inflammatory arthritis consistent with psoriatic arthritis. Her past medical history was otherwise significant for previously elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, oral corticosteroid use (> 1 year ago), and occasional corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain. Her family history was negative for any aneurysms, dissections, early or sudden death, and connective tissue diseases. The patient is a lifelong non-smoker, and had no relevant past surgical history, recent travel, allergies, history of infectious diseases, including syphilis. Review of systems was positive for headache, jaw pain, rhinitis, and fatigue. There was no history of salivary/lacrimal gland enlargement, dry eyes, lymphadenopathy, limb claudication, pancreatitis, cholangitis, oral or genital ulcers, rash, fevers, night sweats, or weight loss.

### American heart month-February 2019 [^114VMS6p]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the United States, and heart attacks are a major category of heart disease; someone in the United States has a heart attack every 40 seconds (1). February is American Heart Month, an ideal time to remind all adults to focus on their hearts and encourage them, their families, friends, and communities to learn the important signs and symptoms of heart attack and how to respond. Recognizing that someone might be having a heart attack and calling emergency services (9–1–1) are crucial for optimizing access to lifesaving emergency cardiac care and receipt of advanced treatments and improving survival. Five common symptoms of a heart attack are 1) pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, or back; 2) feeling weak, lightheaded, or faint; 3) chest pain or discomfort; 4) pain or discomfort in the arms or shoulder; and 5) shortness of breath. If someone is suspected to be having a heart attack, 9–1–1 should be called immediately.
