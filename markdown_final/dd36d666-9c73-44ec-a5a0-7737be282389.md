Perforated ear drum

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about perforated eardrum management, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entity and distinguishing acute versus chronic perforations. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and key modifiers that change management. Next, I will review evidence-based treatment for acute otitis media with perforation, followed by chronic suppurative otitis media. After that, I need to check adjunctive measures like aural toilet and water precautions. I will then examine special scenarios such as tympanostomy tube otorrhea, barotrauma, and cerumen management. Finally, I should consider surgical indications, follow-up, and a practical decision algorithm, while continuously double-checking safety issues like ototoxicity and contraindicated agents [^116yKq2Q] [^114C4PPy].

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its subtypes. A perforated tympanic membrane may be acute, typically from acute otitis media with spontaneous perforation and discharge, or chronic, as in chronic suppurative otitis media with persistent otorrhea through a perforation; distinguishing these is foundational because management diverges substantially, and I need to ensure I do not conflate the two contexts when citing evidence [^1131UuJr] [^115TVDqQ].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach. I should confirm the diagnosis with pneumatic otoscopy or tympanometry when feasible, and document the presence of discharge, perforation size and location, and any middle ear pathology; importantly, tasting medication or air expulsion from the ear canal suggests a patent perforation or tube, which should immediately alter topical choices to non-ototoxic agents, and I need to remember that otorrhea with a bulging tympanic membrane supports the diagnosis of AOM even in the absence of classic symptoms in some high-risk populations [^114LbU7C] [^116yKq2Q] [^112UW88w].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics in acute AOM with perforation. I initially thought oral antibiotics might be unnecessary because topical therapy could suffice, but wait, let me verify the pediatric data; a randomized trial in children with AOM and ear discharge found that antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops were not non-inferior to oral antibiotics, and in fact favored oral therapy for clinical resolution, so I should correct that assumption and recommend oral antibiotics as first-line in this scenario, with amoxicillin as a reasonable choice unless local resistance patterns dictate otherwise [^notfound]. I should also note that in high-risk Indigenous populations, prolonged amoxicillin reduced perforation rates, but I must be cautious about generalizing that to low-risk settings due to resistance concerns and differing baseline risk [^112UW88w] [^115dHsq4].

> Next, I should review management for chronic suppurative otitis media. Let me consider the comparative effectiveness of topical versus systemic therapy; multiple Cochrane reviews suggest that topical quinolone antibiotics are superior to systemic antibiotics for short-term resolution of otorrhea, and when systemic therapy is already in place, adding systemic antibiotics to effective topical therapy offers little to no additional benefit, so I should prioritize topical quinolone drops plus aural toilet and avoid routine systemic antibiotics unless there are specific indications such as extension beyond the ear or host factors [^111wqyZs] [^113WobcF] [^1131UuJr] [^113KJ5fL]. I should double-check that the evidence quality is low to moderate and heterogeneous, but the direction consistently favors topical quinolones over systemic therapy for short-term otorrhea resolution [^113WobcF] [^112zH3x1].

> I need to ensure I address adjunctive measures. Aural toilet to remove debris improves drop penetration and is standard in CSOM care, though high-quality comparative data on frequency are limited; daily dry mopping may be reasonable in community settings, while clinic-based suction under microscopy is effective when available, and I should counsel strict water precautions during active otorrhea to reduce recurrence risk and facilitate healing [^114LmLKU] [^1155AYug] [^113qYyU9].

> But wait, what if the patient has a tympanostomy tube or suspected nonintact membrane. I should confirm that only non-ototoxic topical agents are used when the tympanic membrane is nonintact, which means avoiding aminoglycosides, alcohol, and low pH acidifying drops; quinolone otic drops are preferred and are the only FDA-approved topical antimicrobials for middle ear exposure, and I should reassess within 48 to 72 hours if there is no improvement to confirm the diagnosis and delivery of therapy [^114C4PPy] [^112R4BHy] [^116yKq2Q] [^114aCnLQ].

> Let me consider special scenarios. For barotrauma-related perforations, most heal spontaneously, but I should verify whether early paper patching or other office interventions improve closure rates or hearing outcomes; observational and small randomized data suggest early paper patching or bioactive approaches may accelerate closure and improve hearing compared with observation alone, though I must acknowledge the low quality of evidence and individualize decisions [^116cs53C] [^11794TBZ] [^113m9YAd] [^112R68ke]. For retained or long-term tympanostomy tubes, I should confirm the higher risk of persistent perforation and arrange appropriate follow-up, with counseling that many perforations close spontaneously but some require repair, and that water precautions remain important during otorrhea episodes [^116TrQum] [^114nm2aE].

> I should double-check cerumen management in the setting of a known or suspected perforation. Irrigation is contraindicated when the tympanic membrane is nonintact due to risk of caloric effects, infection, and ototoxicity; instead, I should use manual removal under direct visualization or refer for specialty care, and I must document counseling to avoid home irrigation or cerumenolytics in this context [^1123jHZ8] [^113GCxbA] [^113dCaQC].

> Next, I should review surgical indications and timing. Persistent perforations beyond about three months, recurrent otorrhea despite optimized medical therapy, significant conductive hearing loss, or patient preference for earlier closure are reasonable indications for tympanoplasty; pediatric success rates are generally high, though some data suggest better outcomes after age six, so I need to balance Eustachian tube function, infection control, and developmental considerations when planning surgery [^111qCJ6k] [^116wL11R] [^113DwTek].

> I will now examine follow-up and safety. I should confirm that patients improve within 48 to 72 hours of initiating therapy; if not, I need to reassess the diagnosis, the delivery of topical therapy, and the possibility of resistant organisms or complications, and I must monitor for ototoxicity when using topical agents, particularly avoiding prolonged or repeated courses of potentially ototoxic drops across a nonintact membrane [^114aCnLQ] [^116yKq2Q].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway while I keep verifying each branch. If acute AOM with perforation and discharge, I will prescribe oral antibiotics and consider topical quinolone drops as adjuncts, reassessing in 48 to 72 hours; if CSOM, I will prioritize topical quinolone drops with aural toilet and avoid routine systemic antibiotics unless indicated; if tympanostomy tube otorrhea, I will treat with topical quinolone drops and water precautions; if traumatic perforation, I will observe with water precautions and consider early paper patching or bioactive adjuncts for larger defects; and if persistent perforation beyond three months or recurrent disease, I will refer for tympanoplasty evaluation, ensuring I have excluded cholesteatoma and optimized middle ear status beforehand [^113WobcF] [^113qYyU9] [^11794TBZ] [^111qCJ6k].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed key safety caveats. I should avoid aminoglycoside-containing otic preparations and acidifying or alcohol-based drops when the tympanic membrane is perforated, given documented risks of ototoxicity and pain, and I should document explicit counseling on water avoidance during active otorrhea and on the signs that require urgent reassessment, such as worsening pain, vertigo, or new hearing loss [^116yKq2Q] [^113NjyFk] [^116ffQc3] [^113qYyU9].

A perforated eardrum (**tympanic membrane perforation**) is a hole in the eardrum that can result from infection, trauma, or pressure changes, causing hearing loss, pain, and a risk of middle ear infection [^116jf9iY] [^114txVDQ]. Most small perforations heal spontaneously within weeks to months, but larger or persistent holes may require surgical repair (**myringoplasty**) [^111qCJ6k]. Keep the ear dry, avoid water entry, and refrain from inserting objects or blowing the nose forcefully to prevent complications [^114M75tG]. Seek medical evaluation for persistent symptoms, recurrent infections, or hearing loss; **topical antibiotics** are used if infection is present, and surgery is considered for perforations lasting beyond 3–6 months or causing significant hearing impairment [^112zH3x1] [^111qCJ6k].

---

## Causes of perforated eardrum

Perforated eardrums can result from several causes, including:

- **Infections**: Acute otitis media (middle ear infection) is the most common cause, especially in children [^notfound].

- **Trauma**: Direct injury from objects inserted into the ear, head trauma, or barotrauma from rapid pressure changes (e.g. flying, diving) [^113mxJE3].

- **Medical procedures**: Myringotomy, tympanostomy tube placement, or other surgical interventions [^116TrQum].

- **Chronic conditions**: Chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma, or persistent Eustachian tube dysfunction [^1131UuJr].

---

## Symptoms and complications

Common symptoms of a perforated eardrum include:

- **Hearing loss**: Typically conductive, varying with perforation size and location [^notfound].

- **Ear pain**: Often sudden, especially with traumatic perforations.

- **Tinnitus**: Ringing or buzzing in the ear.

- **Vertigo**: Dizziness or balance disturbances.

- **Otorrhea**: Ear discharge, particularly with infections [^1131UuJr].

Potential complications include chronic infection, persistent perforation, cholesteatoma, and permanent hearing loss [^116jf9iY].

---

## Natural healing and spontaneous closure

Many **tympanic membrane perforations** heal spontaneously, particularly small traumatic perforations. The healing process typically involves **epithelial migration, fibroblast proliferation, and remodeling**, with most small perforations closing within weeks to months. Larger or chronic perforations may persist and require **surgical intervention** [^116jf9iY].

---

## Medical management

Medical management focuses on preventing infection, controlling symptoms, and promoting healing:

- **Observation**: Small, dry perforations often heal without intervention.

- **Topical antibiotics**: Used if infection is present or suspected, particularly in chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) [^112zH3x1].

- **Aural toilet**: Regular ear cleaning to remove debris and facilitate healing [^114LmLKU].

- **Water precautions**: Keeping the ear dry to prevent infection and further damage [^113qYyU9].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgical repair (myringoplasty) is indicated for:

- **Persistent perforations**: Lasting longer than 3–6 months.

- **Significant hearing loss**: Particularly with large perforations.

- **Recurrent infections**: Chronic otorrhea or frequent middle ear infections.

- **Patient preference**: Desire for closure due to lifestyle or occupational reasons [^111qCJ6k].

Surgical techniques include traditional myringoplasty, endoscopic approaches, and regenerative therapies using growth factors or bioactive materials [^1115VEZM].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

The prognosis for **tympanic membrane perforation** is generally favorable. Small perforations usually heal spontaneously with minimal long-term consequences, whereas larger or chronic perforations may require surgical repair, with high success rates reported for **myringoplasty**. Hearing outcomes depend on perforation size, location, and the presence of **underlying middle ear pathology** [^116wL11R].

---

## Preventive measures and patient education

Preventive measures include:

- **Avoiding trauma**: Do not insert objects into the ear canal [^113C2uGK].

- **Pressure equalization**: Use techniques to equalize pressure during flights or diving [^114txVDQ].

- **Prompt treatment**: Early management of ear infections and chronic middle ear conditions [^notfound].

Patient education should emphasize the importance of keeping the ear dry, recognizing signs of infection, and seeking timely medical evaluation [^114M75tG].

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^115TVDqQ]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Of children with acute otitis media (AOM), 15%–20% present with acute ear discharge due to a spontaneous perforation of the eardrum. These children experience equal levels of ear pain, suffer from more frequent AOM recurrences and hearing problems, and benefit more from antibiotic treatment than those with AOM who do not present with ear discharge. Current guidelines suggest clinicians can consider oral antibiotics for children with AOM and ear discharge (AOMd), but this must always be balanced against the risk of side effects and the significant public health danger of antibiotic resistance. We have previously shown that treatment with antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops is superior to oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes presenting with acute ear discharge. The question is whether this strategy is also effective in children without ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge as one of the symptoms of AOM, arguing that the spontaneous perforation of the eardrum would provide an entry for topical antibiotics to act in the middle ear. Such approach would contribute to antibiotic stewardship and avoid systemic antibiotic side effects. We, therefore, conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment with oral antibiotics and antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops in children presenting in primary care with AOMd.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114M75tG]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — patient information for topical therapy states that eardrops alone are the most effective treatment, while antibiotics taken by mouth "should be used only when infection spreads beyond the ear canal, eardrops cannot get into the ear, or the immune system is weak"; all approved eardrops are "highly effective, with no consistent advantage" for a specific drug. Most patients "feel better within 48 to 72 hours and have minimal or no symptoms by 7 days", and drops "should be used for at least 7 days" with continuation "for a maximum of 7 additional days" if symptoms persist. "Pain‑relieving (anesthetic) eardrops are not recommended", and keeping the ear dry is important; a "cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly" may be used before showering. Eardrops are generally safe, but tasting the drops suggests a perforation and patients should inform a doctor, and they should also call a doctor if the drops become painful or unexpected symptoms develop.

### Systemic antibiotics versus topical treatments for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^111wqyZs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing.

Objectives

To compare systemic antibiotics and topical antiseptics or antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with an underlying eardrum perforation (CSOM).

Search Strategy

The Cochrane ENT Disorders Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965) PREMEDLINE, Metadatabase of registers of ongoing trials (mRCT), and article references.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials; any systemic versus topical treatment (excluding steroids); participants with CSOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, entered data into RevMan; two authors provided a second assessment of titles and abstracts, and inputted where there was ambiguity. We contacted investigators for clarifications.

Main Results

Nine trials (833 randomised participants; 842 analysed participants or ears). CSOM definitions and severity varied; some included mastoid cavity infections, other diagnoses, or complications. Methodological quality varied; generally poorly reported, follow-up short, handling of bilateral disease inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than systemic antibiotics at clearing discharge at 1–2 weeks: relative risks (RR) were, 3.21 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 5.49) using systemic non-quinolone antibiotics (2 trials, N = 116), and 3.18 (1.87 to 5.43) using systemic quinolone (3 trials, N = 175); or 2.75 (1.38 to 5.46) in favour of systemic plus topical quinolone over systemic quinolone alone (2 trials, N = 90). No statistically significant benefit was seen at 2–4 weeks for topical non-quinolone antibiotic (without steroids) or topical antiseptic over systemic antibiotics (mostly non-quinolones), but numbers were small: one trial tested topical non-quinolones (N = 31); two tested antiseptics (N = 152). No benefit of adding systemic to topical treatment at 1–2 weeks was detected either, although evidence was limited (three trials, N = 204). Evidence regarding safety was generally weak. Adverse events reported were generally mild, although hearing worsened by ototoxicity (damaging auditory hair cells) was seen with chloramphenicol drops (non-quinolone antibiotic).

Authors' Conclusions

Topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than systemic antibiotics; topical non-quinolone antibiotic (without steroids) or antiseptic results are less clear. Evidence regarding safety was weak. Further studies should clarify topical non-quinolones and antiseptic effectiveness, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications), and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether there may be fewer adverse events with topical quinolones than other topical or systemic treatments.

### Systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1131UuJr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Systemic antibiotics are a commonly used treatment option for CSOM, which act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing systemic antibiotics (oral, injection) against placebo/no treatment or other systemic antibiotics with at least a one-week follow-up period, involving patients with chronic (at least two weeks) ear discharge of unknown cause or due to CSOM. Other treatments were allowed if both treatment and control arms also received it.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks); health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

We included 18 studies (2135 participants) with unclear or high risk of bias. 1. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo It is very uncertain if there is a difference between systemic (intravenous) antibiotics and placebo in the resolution of ear discharge at between one and two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 8.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 38.21; 33 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report results for resolution of ear discharge after two weeks. Health-related quality of life was not reported. The evidence is very uncertain for hearing and serious (intracranial) complications. Ear pain and suspected ototoxicity were not reported. 2. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both study arms received topical antibiotics) Six studies were included of which five presented useable data. There may be little or no difference in the resolution of ear discharge at between one to two weeks for oral ciprofloxacin compared to placebo or no treatment when ciprofloxacin ear drops were used in both intervention arms (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.12; 390 participants; low-certainty evidence). No results after two weeks were reported. Health-related quality of life was not reported. The evidence is very uncertain for ear pain, serious complications and suspected ototoxicity. 3. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both study arms received other background treatments) Two studies used topical antibiotics plus steroids as background treatment in both arms. It is very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge between metronidazole and placebo at four weeks (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.65; 40 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). This study did not report other outcomes. It is also very uncertain if resolution of ear discharge at six weeks was improved with co-trimoxazole compared to placebo (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.16; 98 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Resolution of ear discharge was not reported at other time points. From the narrative report there was no evidence of a difference between groups for health-related quality of life, hearing or serious complications (very low-certainty evidence). One study (136 participants) used topical antiseptics as background treatment in both arms and found similar resolution of ear discharge between the amoxicillin and no treatment groups at three to four months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.41; 136 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The narrative report indicated no evidence of differences in hearing or suspected ototoxicity (both very low-certainty evidence). No other outcomes were reported. 4. Different types of systemic antibiotics This is a summary of four comparisons, where different antibiotics were compared to each other. Eight studies compared different types of systemic antibiotics against each other: quinolones against beta-lactams (four studies), lincosamides against nitroimidazoles (one study) and comparisons of different types of beta-lactams (three studies). It was not possible to conclude if there was one class or type of systemic antibiotic that was better in terms of resolution of ear discharge. The studies did not report adverse events well.

Authors' Conclusions

There was a limited amount of evidence available to examine whether systemic antibiotics are effective in achieving resolution of ear discharge for people with CSOM. When used alone (with or without aural toileting), we are very uncertain if systemic antibiotics are more effective than placebo or no treatment. When added to an effective intervention such as topical antibiotics, there seems to be little or no difference in resolution of ear discharge (low-certainty evidence). Data were only available for certain classes of antibiotics and it is very uncertain whether one class of systemic antibiotic may be more effective than another. Adverse effects of systemic antibiotics were poorly reported in the studies included. As we found very sparse evidence for their efficacy, the possibility of adverse events may detract from their use for CSOM.

### Middle ear pain and trauma during air travel [^113mxJE3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Changes in air pressure during flying can cause ear-drum pain and perforation, vertigo, and hearing loss. It has been estimated that 10% of adults and 22% of children might have damage to the ear drum after a flight, although perforation is rare. Symptoms usually resolve spontaneously.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of interventions to prevent middle ear pain during air travel? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to April 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 4 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: nasal balloon inflation, oral pseudoephedrine, and topical nasal decongestants.

### Surgical management of the septal perforation [^113WTLCJ]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Initial management of a septal perforation involves medical intervention, but there are several surgical options available. Deciding to proceed with a surgical repair is dependent on the etiology of the defect, how the symptoms impact the patient, the extent of damage or impending destruction to the nasal support, and the absence of any active disease process. The literature describes several methods for septal perforation repair; each has its technical challenges because of the tenuous nature of the tissues and limited surgical exposure of the area. This article reviews the diagnostic work-up of septal perforations, the medical management, and the surgical treatment options, with emphasis placed on the open rhinoplasty approach.

### Panel 7: otitis media: treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice. Data Sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). Review Methods All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments. Implications for Practice Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is important to reduce overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and antibiotic resistance. Children at risk for otitis media and its complications deserve special attention.

### Can vinegar be used in treating Pseudomonas ear infections in a patient with a perforated eardrum? [^112rU2Lp]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic Pseudomonas ear infections are difficult to treat, particularly in immunodeficient patients. Vinegar therapy is a time-tested measure for the treatment of these infections. It is inexpensive, simple, easy to administer, and very effective. However, some physicians are reluctant to use it in immunocompromised patients or in the setting of a perforated tympanic membrane. We describe our successful use of vinegar therapy in a 32-year-old man with both of these conditions. His Pseudomonas ear infection had persisted for more than 5 years despite conventional drug treatment. Eventually, we treated him with instillations of topical vinegar, and his infection cleared in 3 weeks.

### Topical antibiotics without steroids for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^1166cArA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing.

Objectives

Assess topical antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations (CSOM).

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965), PREMEDLINE, metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), and article references.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials; any topical antibiotic without steroids, versus no drug treatment, aural toilet, topical antiseptics, or other topical antibiotics excluding steroids; participants with CSOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, entered data onto RevMan; two authors inputted where there was ambiguity. We contacted investigators for clarifications.

Main Results

Fourteen trials (1,724 analysed participants or ears). CSOM definitions and severity varied; some included otitis externa, mastoid cavity infections and other diagnoses. Methodological quality varied; generally poorly reported, follow-up usually short, handling of bilateral disease inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than no drug treatment at clearing discharge at one week: relative risk (RR) was 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.59) (two trials, N = 197). No statistically significant difference was found between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) at weeks one or three: pooled RR were 0.89 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.32) (three trials, N = 402), and 0.97 (0.54 to 1.72) (two trials, N = 77), respectively. A positive trend in favour of quinolones seen at two weeks was largely due to one trial and not significant after accounting for heterogeneity: pooled RR 0.65 (0.46 to 0.92) (four trials, N = 276) using the fixed-effect model, and 0.64 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.17) accounting for heterogeneity with the random-effects model. Topical quinolones were significantly better at curing CSOM than antiseptics: RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.67) at one week (three trials, N = 263), and 0.58 (0.47 to 0.72) at two to four weeks (four trials, N = 519). Meanwhile, non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) compared to antiseptics were more mixed, changing over time (four trials, N = 254). Evidence regarding safety was generally weak.

Authors' Conclusions

Topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than no drug treatment or topical antiseptics; non-quinolone antibiotic effects (without steroids) versus no drug or antiseptics are less clear. Studies were also inconclusive regarding any differences between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics, although indirect comparisons suggest a benefit of topical quinolones cannot be ruled out. Further trials should clarify non-quinolone antibiotic effects, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications) and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether quinolones may result in fewer adverse events than other topical treatments.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^112UW88w]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Our trial supports the notion that asymptomatic bulging of the tympanic membrane is an important predictor of AOM and perforation; this has not been emphasised in the AAP and AAFP guideline. Furthermore, the implications of withholding antibiotic therapy in children with bulging eardrums have not previously been evaluated in high quality studies. Guidelines for management of AOM in Indigenous children define AOM as middle ear effusion with either bulging of the tympanic membrane, recent discharge, ear pain, or redness. There is no option to withhold antibiotics in an Aboriginal child with AOM; for children in whom AOM is associated with perforation, longer courses of antibiotics are recommended. Our RCT supports that recommendation.

A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data from studies in low-risk populations identified subgroups most likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy. In children younger than 2 years of age with bilateral acute otitis media, 55% of controls and 30% on antibiotics still had pain, fever, or both at 3–7 days, with a rate difference between these groups of -25% (95% CI -36% to -14%), resulting in a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of four children. In children with otorrhoea the rate difference and NNT, respectively, were -36% (-53% to -19%) and three, whereas in children without otorrhoea the equivalent values were -14% (-23% to -5%) and eight. From our results in Aboriginal children (Table 2), the NNT would be about ten for normalisation of ears, about six for prevention of perforation, and about four for either beneficial outcome. If compliance could be guaranteed in Aboriginal children, each NNT would likely be reduced.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^1123jHZ8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — precautions for removal and irrigation highlight safety considerations and technique selection. The suspicion of a nonintact tympanic membrane should be assessed by history and/or physical examination prior to selection of a disimpaction technique, and prior tympanic membrane perforation, prior ear surgery, intratympanic injections, tympanostomy tubes, or barotrauma should prompt use of techniques other than irrigation. Current otitis externa should also be identified; if the ear canal is currently infected, irrigation should be avoided. Pain should alert clinicians to possible infection or other pathology, and if present the ear should be assessed before selecting a method of cleaning. In the presence of a perforated tympanic membrane, irrigation could produce caloric effects resulting in vertigo, some agents can be toxic to the middle or inner ear, and mechanical removal is the preferred technique when eardrum perforation is suspected. Safe and effective irrigation is not always possible in patients with narrow or stenotic ear canals, and specialized equipment and procedures may be required to safely remove cerumen in these patients. A perforated tympanic membrane or patent tympanostomy tube likewise limits options available for cerumen removal.

### Systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^113KJ5fL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Systemic antibiotics are commonly used to treat people with CSOM. This is the first update to the review published in 2021, and is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics compared to placebo, no treatment, or another systemic antibiotic in people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose, and Throat Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two clinical trials registers to 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing systemic antibiotics (oral, injection) to placebo/no treatment or other systemic antibiotics with at least a one-week follow-up period, involving people with chronic (at least two weeks) ear discharge of unknown cause or due to CSOM. Other treatments were allowed if both treatment and control arms received it.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks); health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia)/discomfort/local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity measured in several ways. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update found three new studies (390 participants). Overall, we included 21 studies (2525 participants). We report four core comparisons below, and describe an additional four in the Results section of the review. 1. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo It is very uncertain from a single study if there is a difference between systemic (intravenous) antibiotics and placebo in the resolution of ear discharge between one and two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 8.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 38.21; 1 study, 33 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report results for resolution of ear discharge after two weeks, or health-related quality of life. The evidence is very uncertain for hearing and serious (intracranial) complications. The study did not report ear pain and suspected ototoxicity. 2. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both study arms received topical antibiotics) Seven studies assessed this comparison, with five presenting usable data. There may be little or no difference between oral ciprofloxacin and placebo/no treatment (with all participants receiving ciprofloxacin ear drops) in the resolution of ear discharge between one and two weeks (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.17; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 300 participants; low-certainty evidence), with similar results at two to four weeks. One study reported outcomes beyond four weeks, but the results were not usable. No studies reported health-related quality of life. The evidence is very uncertain for ear pain, serious complications, and suspected ototoxicity. 3. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (plus topical antibiotics and topical steroids in both study arms) Two studies used topical antibiotics plus topical steroids as background treatment in both arms. It is very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge between metronidazole and placebo at two to four weeks (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.65; 1 study, 30 participants). This study did not report other outcomes. It is also very uncertain if co-trimoxazole improved resolution of ear discharge after four weeks compared to placebo (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.16; 1 study, 98 participants; very low-certainty evidence). From the narrative reporting of one study, there was no evidence of a difference between groups for health-related quality of life, hearing, or serious complications (very low-certainty evidence). 4. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (plus topical antiseptics in both study arms) One study (136 participants) used topical antiseptics as background treatment in both arms, and found no difference in the resolution of ear discharge between the amoxicillin and no-treatment groups at three to four months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.41; 136 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The narrative report indicated no evidence of differences in hearing or suspected ototoxicity (very low-certainty evidence). The study reported no other outcomes. Limitations include heterogeneity in the duration and definition of CSOM used by studies included in the review. Although we planned subgroup analyses for different participant characteristics, treatment duration, and spectrum of antibiotic activity, we did not perform these analyses due to lack of available data.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence available to determine whether systemic antibiotics are effective in achieving resolution of ear discharge in people with CSOM is limited. We are very uncertain if systemic antibiotics, when used alone (with or without aural toileting (ear cleaning)), are more effective than placebo or no treatment. When added to an intervention such as topical antibiotics, there may be little or no difference in resolution of ear discharge (very low-certainty evidence). Data were only available for certain classes of antibiotics; it is very uncertain whether one class of systemic antibiotic is more effective than another. Harmful effects of systemic antibiotics were poorly reported in the included studies.

### Topical antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^112zH3x1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics, the most common treatment for CSOM, aim to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or with other treatments for CSOM, such as antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2020 and one of a suite of seven reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of topical antibiotics (without steroids) for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The latest search date was 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with at least a one week of follow-up involving adults and children with chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antibiotic(s) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders, or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antibiotic compared to placebo or no intervention, and compared to another topical antibiotic (e.g. topical antibiotic A versus topical antibiotic B).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks and up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update found one new study (100 participants). Overall, we included 18 studies with 1783 participants (in 16 studies), plus 108 ears that could not be accounted for in participant numbers (in two studies). 1. Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with aural toilet in both arms and no other background treatment) One study (50 participants, data unavailable for 15 participants) compared a topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) with placebo (saline). All participants received aural toilet. Topical ciprofloxacin may increase resolution of discharge at one to up to two weeks compared with placebo (84% with antibiotic versus 12% with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 6.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82 to 24.99; 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study authors reported "no medical side-effects and worsening of audiological measurements related to this topical medication were detected". 2. Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with use of oral antibiotics in both arms) Four studies (438 participants) compared topical antibiotics versus no treatment, with oral antibiotics in both arms. These compared topical ciprofloxacin to no treatment (3 studies, 190 participants) or topical ceftizoxime to no treatment (1 study, 248 participants). In each study, all participants received the same antibiotic systemically (oral ciprofloxacin or injected ceftizoxime). In at least one study, all participants received aural toilet. There were no useable data comparing topical ceftizoxime to no treatment. Topical antibiotics in addition to systemic antibiotics may increase resolution of ear discharge at one to up to two weeks compared with systemic antibiotics alone (resolution of discharge occurring in 88% with topical antibiotics versus 60% without topical antibiotics; RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.88; 1 study, 100 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study (40 participants) stated "no side effect was recorded in any patient" (low-certainty evidence). 3. Comparisons of different topical antibiotics Eight studies (794 participants, plus 40 ears) compared aminoglycosides (gentamicin, neomycin, or tobramycin) with quinolones (ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin). Resolution of discharge at one to up to two weeks may be higher in the quinolones group, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.67; 7 studies, 794 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was considerable heterogeneity (I 2 = 97%). One study (308 participants) stated there were no differences between the different groups for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of topical antibiotics on ear pain (1 study reported no differences between groups). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of topical antibiotics on hearing loss (2 studies reported no differences between groups). 4. Other comparisons We assessed five studies (501 participants, plus 68 ears) over the following three additional comparisons: quinolones versus aminoglycosides/polymyxin B with/without gramicidin, aminoglycosides versus trimethoprim-sulphacetamide-polymixin B, and rifampicin versus chloramphenicol. However, these results have not been included in the abstract.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics in improving resolution of ear discharge in people with CSOM because of the limited amount of low- or very low-certainty evidence available. This was mostly due to risk of bias and imprecision. However, amongst this uncertainty, there is some evidence to suggest that the use of topical antibiotics may be effective when compared to placebo, or when used in addition to a systemic antibiotic. There is also uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine whether quinolones are better or worse than aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, harmful effects were poorly reported. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^111q8AQv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — symptoms, hearing impact, treatment options, and complication rates are described: Patients seek treatment for a host of symptoms including pain, itching, sensation of fullness, tinnitus, odor, drainage, and cough, and hearing loss can range from 5 to 40 dB depending on the degree of occlusion. Multiple treatment options exist — observation, cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, and manual removal other than irrigation — with combinations used and manual removal performed with a curette, probe, hook, forceps, or suction under direct visualization. Though generally safe, complications such as tympanic membrane perforation, canal laceration, infection, bleeding, or hearing loss occur at a rate of about 1 in 1000 ear irrigations, which applied nationally estimates that 8000 complications occur annually; other reported complications include otitis externa, pain, dizziness, and syncope.

### Topical versus systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^113WobcF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics are the most common treatment for CSOM, which act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be administered both topically and systemically, and can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM such as ear cleaning (aural toileting).

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical versus systemic antibiotics for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving patients (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The studies compared topical antibiotics against systemic (oral, injection) antibiotics. We separated studies according to whether they compared the same type of antibiotic in both treatment groups, or different types of antibiotics. For each comparison we considered whether there was background treatment for both treatment groups, for example aural toileting (ear cleaning).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks up to four weeks, and after four weeks), health-related quality of life using a validated instrument, ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

Six studies (445 participants), all with high risk of bias, were included. All but two studies included patients with confirmed CSOM, where perforation of the ear drum was clearly documented. None of the studies reported results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks or health-related quality of life. 1. Topical versus systemic administration of the same type of antibiotics (quinolones) Four studies (325 participants) compared topical versus systemic (oral) administration of ciprofloxacin. Three studies reported resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks and found that the topical administration may slightly increase resolution (risk ratio (RR) 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24 to 1.76; 285 participants; 3 studies; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). In these studies, aural toileting was either not mentioned, or limited to the first visit. Three studies (265 participants) reported that they did not suspect ototoxicity in any participants, but it is unclear how this was measured (very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported the outcomes of ear pain or serious complications. No studies reported results for hearing, despite it being measured in three studies. 2. Topical versus systemic administration of different types of antibiotics (quinolones versus aminoglycosides) One study (60 participants) compared topical ciprofloxacin versus gentamicin injected intramuscularly. No aural toileting was reported. Resolution of ear discharge was not measured at one to two weeks. The study did not report any 'side effects' from which we assumed that no ear pain, suspected ototoxicity or serious complications occurred (very low-certainty evidence). The study stated that "no worsening of the audiometric function related to local or parenteral therapy was observed". 3. Topical versus systemic administration of different types of antibiotics (quinolones versus amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) One study compared topical ofloxacin with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with all participants receiving suction ear cleaning at the first visit. It is uncertain if there is a difference between the two groups in resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks due to study limitations and the very small sample size (RR 2.93, 95% CI 1.50 to 5.72; 56 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is unclear if there is a difference between topical quinolone compared with oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with regards to ear pain, hearing or suspected ototoxicity (very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported the outcome of serious complications.

Authors' Conclusions

There was a limited amount of low-quality evidence available, from studies completed over 15 years ago, to examine whether topical or systemic antibiotics are more effective in achieving resolution of ear discharge for people with CSOM. However, amongst this uncertainty there is some evidence to suggest that the topical administration of antibiotics may be more effective than systemic administration of antibiotics in achieving resolution of ear discharge (dry ear). There is limited evidence available regarding different types of antibiotics. It is not possible to determine with any certainty whether or not topical quinolones are better or worse than systemic aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, adverse effects were poorly reported.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^113C2uGK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Table 7 — patient education for cerumen (earwax) outlines Do items such as recognizing that earwax is normal and that earwax not causing symptoms or blocking the ear canal should be left alone; understanding symptoms of cerumen impaction (decreased hearing, fullness, tinnitus, and changes to hearing aid function); seeking medical evaluation for hearing loss, ear fullness, or ear pain when the cause is uncertain because other conditions can masquerade as cerumen impaction; asking a provider about safe home treatments; and seeking medical attention for ear pain, drainage, or bleeding. The Don't items include: overclean your ears; put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear; use ear candles because there is no evidence they remove impacted cerumen and they can cause serious damage; ignore symptoms if home remedies are unsuccessful; irrigate or try cerumen-removing/softening drops after ear surgery or with a perforated eardrum unless cleared by an otolaryngologist; and forget to clean hearing aids as recommended by the manufacturer or hearing health professional.

### WITHDRAWN: interventions for chronic suppurative otitis media [^113SA8eK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a serious bacterial infection of the middle ear that can follow untreated acute otitis media.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different treatments for CSOM.

Search Strategy

We searched Medline from 1966 to 1996 and a bibliographic collection of the Hearing Impairment Research Group in Liverpool, UK. We handsearched two otolaryngology journals and contacted members of an international hearing network.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of any method of management for patients with eardrum perforation and persistent otorrhea.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers independently assessed eligibility and trial quality. One reviewer extracted data. We contacted investigators for clarifications.

Main Results

Twenty-four trials involving 1660 people were included. Clinical definitions and severity of CSOM varied, methodological quality was generally low and follow-up was short. Treatment with antibiotics or antiseptics accompanied by aural toilet was more effective in resolving otorrhea than no treatment (two trials, odds ratio 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.24 to 0. 57) or aural toilet alone (six trials, odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.43). Topical treatment with antibiotics or antiseptics was more effective than systemic antibiotics (six trials, odds ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.69). Combining topical and systemic antibiotics was not more effective than topical antibiotics. Topical quinolones were more effective than non-quinolones (five trials, odds ratio 0.26, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.41). No difference in the effectiveness of topical antibiotics and topical antiseptics was found (three studies, odds ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 2.81). Some topical antibiotic combinations may be more effective than others in resolving otorrhea. Rates of adverse drug events were low and equal between groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment of CSOM with aural toilet and topical antibiotics, particularly quinolones, is effective in resolving otorrhea and eradicating bacteria from the middle ear. Longterm outcomes such as preventing recurrences, closure of tympanic perforation and hearing improvement need to be further evaluated.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^1163dBDE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Table 10 — general guidelines for corticosteroid therapy for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) present systemic and intratympanic options. Systemic therapy is described as "Immediate, ideally within first 14 days. Benefit has been reported up to 6 weeks postonset of SSNHL", with dosing such as "Prednisone, 1 mg/kg/d (usual maximal dose is 60 mg/d)" or "Methylprednisolone, 48 mg/d", given at "Full dose for 7 to 14 days, then taper over similar time period", with "Do not divide doses" and "Audiogram at completion of treatment course and at delayed intervals". Intratympanic therapy may be "Immediate" or used as "Salvage (rescue) after initial treatment fails or after 2 weeks of symptom onset", with dosing options "Dexamethasone 24 mg/mL (compounded) or 10 mg/mL (stock) if compounded concentration unavailable" and "Methylprednisolone 40 mg/mL or 30 mg/mL". Administration includes "Inject 0.4 to 0.8 mL into middle ear space up to 4 injections over a 2-week period" and "Keep head in otologic position (one side down, affected ear up) for 15–30 minutes", with monitoring that "Interval audiograms between injections may help direct early termination of therapy if hearing loss resolves", and postprocedure care to "Inspect tympanic membrane… May insert pressure-equalizing tube… but this increases risk of tympanic membrane perforation".

### Topical antibiotics with steroids for chronic suppurative otitis media [^116YrGRc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as steroids, antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in combined preparations with steroids.

Objectives

To assess the effects of adding a topical steroid to topical antibiotics in the treatment of people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any combination of a topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class and a topical corticosteroid (steroid) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antibiotic and steroid compared to a) placebo or no intervention and b) another topical antibiotic.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks and after four weeks; health-related quality of life; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity.

Main Results

We included 17 studies addressing 11 treatment comparisons. A total of 1901 participants were included, with one study (40 ears) not reporting the number of participants recruited, which we therefore could not account for. No studies reported health-related quality of life. The main comparisons were: 1. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus placebo or no treatment Three studies (210 participants) compared a topical antibiotic-steroid to saline or no treatment. Resolution of discharge was not reported at between one to two weeks. One study (50 'high-risk' children) reported results at more than four weeks by ear and we could not adjust the results to by person. The study reported that 58% (of 41 ears) resolved with topical antibiotics compared with 50% (of 26 ears) with no treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain. One study (123 participants) noted minor side effects in 16% of participants in both the intervention and placebo groups (very low-certainty evidence). One study (123 participants) reported no change in bone-conduction hearing thresholds and reported no difference in tinnitus or balance problems between groups (very low-certainty evidence). One study (50 participants) reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these patients were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment. One study (123 participants) reported that no side effects occurred in any participants (very low-certainty evidence). 2. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus topical antibiotics (same antibiotics) only Four studies (475 participants) were included in this comparison. Three studies (340 participants) compared topical antibiotic-steroid combinations to topical antibiotics alone. The evidence suggests little or no difference in resolution of discharge at one to two weeks: 82.7% versus 76.6% (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.21; 335 participants; 3 studies (4 study arms); low-certainty evidence). No results for resolution of discharge after four weeks were reported. One study (110 participants) reported local itchiness but as there was only one episode in each group it is uncertain whether there is a difference (very low-certainty evidence). Three studies (395 participants) investigated suspected ototoxicity but it was not possible to determine whether there were differences between the groups for this outcome (very low-certainty evidence). No study reported serious complications. 3. Topical antibiotics with steroids compared to topical antibiotics alone (different antibiotics) Nine studies (981 participants plus 40 ears) evaluated a range of comparisons of topical non-quinolone antibiotic-steroid combinations versus topical quinolone antibiotics alone. Resolution of discharge may be greater with quinolone topical antibiotics alone at between one to two weeks compared with non-quinolone topical antibiotics with steroids: 82.1% versus 63.2% (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.84; 7 studies; 903 participants, low-certainty evidence). Results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were not reported. One study (52 participants) reported usable data on ear pain, two studies (419 participants) reported hearing outcomes and one study (52 participants) reported balance problems. It was not possible to determine whether there were significant differences between the groups for these outcomes (very low-certainty evidence). Two studies (149 participants) reported no serious complications (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics with steroids in improving the resolution of ear discharge in patients with CSOM because of the limited amount of low-certainty evidence available. Amongst this uncertainty, we found no evidence that the addition of steroids to topical antibiotics affects the resolution of ear discharge. There is also low-certainty evidence that some types of topical antibiotics (without steroids) may be better than topical antibiotic/steroid combinations in improving resolution of discharge. There is also uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine with any certainty whether or not quinolones are better or worse than aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, adverse effects were poorly reported.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^115gLMcf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) initial corticosteroids — Clinicians may offer corticosteroids as initial therapy to patients with SSNHL within 2 weeks of symptom onset, categorized as an Option based on systematic reviews of RCTs and new RCTs and a balance of benefit and harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C and the level of confidence in the evidence is Medium, with the benefit of hearing improvement. Risks for systemic steroids include suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and Cushing's-like syndrome (minimal with 10- to 14-day treatment), aseptic necrosis of the hip, and hyperglycemia, whereas IT corticosteroids have minimal systemic effect but can cause local reactions of pain, tympanic membrane perforation, and transient dizziness, and entail high cost and multiple office visits. Exceptions for systemic steroids include medical conditions affected by corticosteroids, such as insulin-dependent or poorly controlled diabetes, tuberculosis, and peptic ulcer disease. There is a large role for shared decision making with patients, and although several group members were reluctant to endorse the 2-week time frame, the time frame of 2 weeks was retained to encourage early care. The majority of trials use a 1- to 2-week window from symptom onset as the initial therapy.

### Considerations in the etiology, treatment, and repair of septal perforations [^113Cvdsq]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Nasal septal perforations present a distinct challenge to the facial plastic surgeon. A clearcut causal factor must be established from a long, diverse list of potential causes. Surgical repair presents a complex technical challenge, because a septal perforation is a hole in three distinct contiguous layers composed of both right and left septal mucoperichondral flaps and the intervening cartilage, all three of which must be separated from each other and repaired individually. This article describes presenting symptoms and findings for septal perforations, the history and physical examination, causes, helpful hints for prevention of perforations, and surgical and nonsurgical treatment options and outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^115pV9GM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Intratympanic steroid therapy (IT) for active Ménière's disease not responsive to noninvasive treatment — Clinicians may offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, IT steroids; this is an Option based on a systematic review and a randomized controlled trial with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C, based on 1 Cochrane review and 1 small RCT looking at dexamethasone and gentamicin with 90% symptom reduction, and the level of confidence in evidence is High. Benefits include improved vertigo control, no risk of hearing loss, less risk of systemic side effects, improved quality of life (QOL; dizziness handicap), and no loss of vestibular function, while risks/costs include cost, perforation, possible need for multiple injections, infection, discomfort of the procedure, and time for treatment; the benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments note that while this is less definitive than gentamicin therapy, the favorable risk-benefit profile makes this a good option for patients, and intentional vagueness clarifies that noninvasive refers to medical therapy and lifestyle modification; the role of patient preferences is Medium, and differences of opinion included debate over grade B versus grade C with some panel members feeling this should be a recommendation rather than an option. Supporting text notes IT steroid therapy was first described in 1991 and that there have been RCTs and a Cochrane review performed.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112R4BHy]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) guideline — action statements report that the development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^111rjMjf]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparison with existing literature

We initiated this trial after establishing the superiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops over oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge. Our current findings in a small sample of children without ventilation tubes who present with AOMd indicate that these findings cannot be extrapolated to this patient population. While there is a patent passage between the ear canal and the middle ear in children with ventilation tubes, the spontaneous eardrum perforation in children with AOMd may close too early to allow antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to completely resolve the middle ear inflammation.

During the preparation of our trial, we collaborated with the UK-based team developing the REST (Runny Ear Study, trial registry number ISRCTN12873692) addressing the same topic. We harmonized design and outcomes to enable future meta-analysis. This trial however was also terminated early due to issues with its electronic health record system platform and no formal statistical analysis was performed on its sample of 22 children.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^1161poeu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Table 7 — Acute otitis media (AOM) with and without a tympanostomy tube differs by symptoms, antibiotic needs, and complication risks as follows: ear pain is "None, unless skin irritated or tube occluded" vs "Mild to severe"; otorrhea is "Yes, unless tube obstructed" vs "No, unless eardrum ruptures"; middle ear effusion (MEE) after infection "Usually resolves promptly" vs "Can last weeks or months"; oral antibiotics are needed "Rarely" vs "Often", while antibiotic eardrops are "First-line treatment" vs "No benefit"; eardrum rupture risk is "No, unless tube obstructed" vs "Yes"; suppurative complications are "Likely very rare since infection can drain through the tube" vs "Rare but reported, since the infection occurs in a closed space"; and bacterial resistance impact is "Topical antibiotics generally do not cause resistance" vs "Systemic antibiotics can promote resistance".

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^114LmLKU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting describes processes for manually cleaning the ear, including dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope), or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics. This is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM. This is the first update of a Cochrane review published in 2020.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of aural toilet procedures for people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The searches were run on 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults or children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. We included any aural toileting method as the intervention, at any frequency, and for any duration. The main comparisons were aural toileting versus placebo or no intervention, and one aural toileting method versus another aural toileting method. Within each comparison, we separated studies into those in which both groups received other concomitant treatments (e.g. antiseptics or antibiotics) and those without concomitant treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at one week to up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and adverse events (dizziness/vertigo/balance problems, ear bleeding). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update did not find any new studies. We included three studies with 431 participants (465 ears) reporting on two comparisons. Two studies included only children with CSOM in the community (351 participants) and the other study (80 participants) included children and adults with chronic ear discharge for at least six weeks. One study recruited participants from the Solomon Islands, who were considered a 'high-risk' Indigenous group. None of the included studies reported health-related quality of life, ear pain, or ear bleeding. 1. Daily aural toileting versus no treatment Two studies (351 children; 370 ears) compared daily dry mopping with no treatment. For resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, only one study reported the results per person. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference at 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.72; 1 study, 217 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for the adverse events of dizziness, vertigo, or balance problems. Only one study reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these participants were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment, and therefore the certainty of evidence was very low. One study reported hearing, but the results were presented by treatment outcome rather than by treatment group, so it was not possible to determine whether there was a difference between the two groups. 2. Daily aural toileting versus single aural toileting episode (both in addition to topical ciprofloxacin) One study (80 participants; 95 ears) compared daily aural toileting (suction) with administration of topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) ear drops in a clinic, to a single aural toileting (suction) episode followed by daily self-administered topical antibiotic drops, in participants of all ages. We are very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were presented by ear, not person, and could not be adjusted to by person. The authors only reported qualitatively that there was no difference between the two groups in hearing results (very low-certainty evidence). One participant in the group with single aural toileting and self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops reported the adverse event of dizziness, which the authors attributed to the use of cold topical ciprofloxacin. It is very uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for the other adverse events of vertigo or balance problems, or for serious complications.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain whether treatment with aural toileting is effective in resolving ear discharge in people with CSOM when compared to no treatment, due to a lack of data and the poor quality of the available evidence. The evidence was considered very low-certainty as there were concerns over risk of bias, indirectness, imprecision, and suspected publication bias. We also remain uncertain about other outcomes, including adverse events, as these were not well reported. Similarly, we are very uncertain whether daily suction clearance, followed by antibiotic ear drops administered at a clinic, is better than a single episode of suction clearance followed by self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112TDfG3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa with nonintact tympanic membrane — topical therapy selection and evaluation are as follows: When the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, reasoning from first principles, and Grade X, exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed. Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate. Benefit: Reduce the possibility of hearing loss and balance disturbance. Risk, harm, cost: Eardrops without ototoxicity may be more costly. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: None. Differences of opinion: None. Supporting text notes that antibiotics placed into the middle ear can cross the round window membrane and reach the inner ear and that clinical experience with tympanic membrane perforation suggests that hearing loss does not occur after a single short course of therapy; however, severe hearing loss has been observed after prolonged or repetitive administration of topical drops. Evaluation points include that tympanometry can sometimes be helpful in establishing the presence of an intact tympanic membrane, that when tympanometry shows a normal type A tracing the tympanic membrane is assumed to be intact unless there is a reason to believe it is not, and that most tympanostomy tubes remain in the tympanic membrane for at least 6 to 12 months so a patent tube should be assumed if placed less than a year ago.

### Prosthetics for nasal perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113FWUEu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Prosthetics serve as an option for nasoseptal perforation treatment in patients who have active systemic disease, are poor surgical candidates, or wish to avoid surgery. Through systematic review of the literature on prosthetics for nasoseptal perforation treatment, the objective of the present study is to critically appraise previous studies, evaluate the success rate for nasoseptal prosthetics, provide evidence-based guidelines for nasoseptal prosthetic use, and identify areas for further investigation.

Data Sources

Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science.

Review Methods

Data sources were queried for relevant articles published from 1965 to 2013. Articles were selected for inclusion if they presented primary data for human nasoseptal perforation treatment utilizing prosthetic materials. Each included article's level of evidence and risk of bias were identified and grades of recommendation were assigned. A quantitative meta-analysis was performed on articles with low risk of bias.

Results

The search yielded 4756 abstracts for review, with 23 included case series and 5 case reports; 706 total cases of prosthetic nasoseptal perforation treatment were identified. All articles provided level 4 evidence, with an overall conclusion grade of C for improvement in nasoseptal perforation symptoms, prosthetic in situ rate, and complication rate. Meta-analysis of 6 low-risk-of-bias studies with 297 patients demonstrated an overall success rate of 65%.

Conclusions

The literature provides level 4 evidence for the efficacy and safety of prosthetics for nasoseptal perforation treatment with favorable success rates and few reports of complications — only 1 fungal infection and 9 unspecified infections-in 706 cases.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^115dHsq4]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have studied OM in Aboriginal communities where almost all children have persistent middle ear disease from an early age; nevertheless, our results could also be relevant for other high-risk groups. The primary outcome from our double-blind RCT is that amoxicillin significantly increased the proportion of children achieving normal middle ears (bilaterally aerated) at consecutive monthly examinations. Amoxicillin also reduced the proportion of children with any perforation. The proportion with any suppurative OM was also less in the amoxicillin group at the end of therapy, but not significantly so (Table 2). The proportion of children on amoxicillin experiencing at least two episodes of AOMwiP during therapy was less than for placebo children (4% versus 18%, respectively). There was no difference between placebo and amoxicillin in the proportion of children with OME (~52% in each group) or AOMwoP (~22%) at the end of therapy. Risk differences during therapy (supplementary material) were consistent with the end of therapy findings. Pneumococcal non-susceptibility was similar in amoxicillin and placebo groups, however a greater proportion of children in the amoxicillin group were colonised by beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae at both baseline and at end of therapy.

Our findings can be understood in terms of the natural history of OM in high-risk populations. In Aboriginal children, AOM is usually asymptomatic with parents unaware that their child is unwell. In community-based screening, some 20% to 30% of Aboriginal children have bulging eardrums. Only a minority have the typical symptoms (sudden onset of middle ear effusion with pain or fever) which define AOM in low-risk populations. To explain our findings in this high-risk population, we suggest that in placebo recipients, asymptomatic middle ear infection often progresses to AOM with perforation, whereas continuous amoxicillin helps to prevent that progression. This is consistent with our previous study of short-term antibiotics for asymptomatic AOM which indicated that the majority of children still satisfy the criteria for AOM despite treatment for 7 to 14 days. The present study suggests that therapy can be more successful if it is maintained long-term. We believe that this can be explained by the association of bacterial load with increased severity of OM. It may be that continuous antibiotics maintain bacterial load below a critical threshold for more severe disease.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^114yhws4]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our study shows that Aboriginal infants with OME receiving continuous amoxicillin had more normal ears, fewer perforations and less pneumococcal carriage. There was no statistically significant increase in resistant pneumococci or NCHi in amoxicillin children compared to placebo children who received regular paediatric care and antibiotic treatment for symptomatic illnesses. The option to use long-term antibiotics would be less relevant for western populations where the outcome of untreated OM is less severe, and the balance of benefit and risk is less influenced by the risk of a severe clinical outcome, and more influenced by the potential for increased antibiotic resistance in the child and the community.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^111NKsrV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière's disease — intratympanic (IT) gentamicin recommendation is presented for active MD not responsive to noninvasive treatment with Level of confidence in evidence: High and Policy level: Recommendation, and the Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Benefits include "Improved vertigo control, improved QOL, faster return to work, Avoidance of general anesthetic, a risk of hearing loss (relative to surgical labyrinthectomy), improved safety", while risks are listed as "Hearing loss, ear drum perforation, persistent imbalance, need for multiple treatments". Exclusions specify "Patients with contralateral disease or hypofunction. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides", with "Role of patient preferences: Large regarding timing and when to initiate therapy", "Intentional vagueness: The term inadequate control may vary for different patients", "Value judgments: None", and "Differences of opinion: None".

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1155AYug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting is a term describing a number of processes for manually cleaning the ear. Techniques used may include dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope) or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Dry mopping may be effective in removing mucopurulent discharge. Compared to irrigation or microsuction it is less effective in removing epithelial debris or thick pus. Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics.

Objectives

To assess the effects of aural toilet procedures for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving people (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. We included any aural toileting method as the intervention, at any frequency and for any duration. The comparisons were aural toileting compared with a) placebo or no intervention, and b) any other aural toileting method. We analysed trials in which background treatments were used in both arms (e.g. topical antiseptics or topical antibiotics) separately.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and the adverse events of ear bleeding and dizziness/vertigo/balance problems.

Main Results

We included three studies with a total of 431 participants (465 ears), reporting on two comparisons. Two studies included only children with CSOM in the community (351 participants) and the other study (80 participants) included children and adults with chronic ear discharge for at least six weeks. None of the included studies reported the outcomes of health-related quality of life, ear pain or the adverse event of ear bleeding. Daily aural toileting (dry mopping) versus no treatment Two studies (351 children; 370 ears) compared daily dry mopping with no treatment. Neither study presented results for resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks or between two to four weeks. For resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, one study reported the results per person. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference at 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.72; 1 study; 217 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. No results were reported for the adverse events of dizziness, vertigo or balance problems. Only one study reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these patients were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment. One study reported hearing, but the results were presented by treatment outcome rather than by treatment group so it is not possible to determine whether there is a difference between the two groups. Daily aural toileting versus single aural toileting on top of topical ciprofloxacin One study (80 participants; 95 ears) compared daily aural toileting (suction) with administration of topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) ear drops in a clinic, to a single aural toileting (suction) episode followed by daily self-administered topical antibiotic drops, in participants of all ages. We are unsure whether there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30; 1 study; 80 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. There were no results reported for resolution of ear discharge at between two to four weeks. The results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were presented by ear, not person, and could not be adjusted to by person. One patient in the group with single aural toileting and self administration of topical antibiotic ear drops reported the adverse event of dizziness, which the authors attributed to the use of cold topical ciprofloxacin. It is very uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95; 1 study; 80 participants, very low-certainty). No results were reported for the other adverse events of vertigo or balance problems, or for serious complications. The authors only reported qualitatively that there was no difference between the two groups in hearing results (very low-certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain whether or not treatment with aural toileting is effective in resolving ear discharge in people with CSOM, due to a lack of data and the poor quality of the available evidence. We also remain uncertain about other outcomes, including adverse events, as these were not well reported. Similarly, we are very uncertain whether daily suction clearance, followed by antibiotic ear drops administered at a clinic, is better than a single episode of suction clearance followed by self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112G2Tdw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116TrQum]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Ear tubes — complications and tube course include perforation, tube position, and extrusion/retention timelines. Perforation risk is reported as "About 1–2 out of every 100 children" after a short-term tube, with "up to 1 in every 5 children" after a long-term tube, and "The hole will often close on its own" or can be repaired. Tubes almost always fall out into the ear canal, though "Very rarely" one can fall "into the middle ear". Most tubes come out "within 12 to 24 months", while tubes still present "after 2 to 3 years" can be removed; early extrusion can occur "before 6 months". Scarring on the eardrum is "usually of no concern".

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^113GCxbA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — Table 8 shared decision grid (key action statement [KAS]) outlines options of observation, cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, and manual removal with key precautions and time requirements. For cerumenolytic agents, they are "not recommended for ages < 3 years and in patients with nonintact ear drums", patients "Instill several drops of earwax-softening products once or twice daily for 3 to 5 days", and application takes " < 5 minutes to instill drops". Irrigation "Should not take > 30 minutes (includes preparation time)", offers "Immediate resolution of symptoms caused by the cerumen impaction", but is "Not recommended for patients with pressure equalization tubes, nonintact eardrum, and susceptibility to ear infection (see KAS 2B)". Manual removal provides "Immediate resolution of symptoms caused by the cerumen impaction", and its method is described as "Earwax is removed by the clinician inserting a curette, forceps, or suction tip into the ear, dislodging the wax, and retracting it", with risks including "Trauma to the ear canal skin leading to bleeding or infection; discomfort from the instruments or noise of the suction; and/or rare tinnitus or hearing loss from the noise of the suction". With observation, a "Small amount of cerumen could progress to impaction".

### Age-related hearing loss [^116Suj5h]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The disease chronic hearing loss can be associated with asymmetric hearing loss, cerumen impaction, Exposure to loud noise, inflammation, traumatic injury, inner ear hair cell damage, tinnitus, ear pain, SLE, ménière's disease, genetic abnormality, vertigo, elderly age, dizziness, medications, perforated eardrum, ear fullness, hearing loss, autoimmune disorders, age-related hearing loss, congenital hearing loss, infection, sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114aMwxC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management and therapy selection begins with patients age 2 y or older with diffuse AOE, for whom clinicians prescribe analgesics based on pain severity. If there is extension outside the ear canal or host factors requiring systemic therapy, prescribe systemic antimicrobial active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with or without topical therapy, plus other management based on underlying condition; factors requiring systemic therapy include diabetes, immune deficiency, or inability to effectively deliver topical therapy despite aural toilet. If no such extension or factors, assess for a perforated tympanic membrane (known or suspected) or tympanostomy tube; if present, prescribe topical therapy with a non-ototoxic preparation, and if absent, prescribe topical therapy based on benefits, cost, compliance, preference. If the ear canal is obstructed, perform aural toilet to remove obstructing debris and place a wick if edema prevents drug delivery; if not obstructed, educate the patient or caregiver on how to administer topical drops.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^111q8jcD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 8, manual removal — clinicians may use manual removal requiring instrumentation in the management of cerumen impaction and this is an option based on case series and expert opinion with a balance of benefit and harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C, observational case series and expert opinion, with a high level of confidence in the evidence. Benefits include removal of cerumen impaction under direct visualization, while risks, harms, and costs include bleeding, laceration, tympanic membrane perforation, otalgia, and procedural and equipment cost; the policy level is option and the role of patient preferences is large. Adequate training, experience, and availability of appropriate equipment will minimize the risk of adverse events and maximize the likelihood of successful cerumen removal. Reported concerns include trauma to the external auditory canal, perforation of the tympanic membrane, and rarely infection; suctioning can produce loud noise, may startle the patient, may reach noise levels that are unsafe, and can create a cooling effect eliciting a caloric response with nystagmus and vertigo. The use of cerumenolytic agents during the week prior to the office visit can reduce potential side effects of suction removal such as pain or vertigo.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112f1pT9]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media guideline — evidence-based statement definitions and implications set four tiers with specific clinician guidance: For Strong Recommendation, "A strong recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits of the recommended intervention clearly exceed the harms (as a strong recommendation against an action is made when the anticipated harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent", and "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". For Recommendation, "A recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong", with the implication that "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". For Option, "Options define courses that may be taken when either the quality of evidence is suspect or carefully performed studies have shown little clear advantage to 1 approach over another", and "Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role". For No Recommendation, "No recommendation indicates that there is a lack of pertinent published evidence and that the anticipated balance of benefits and harms is presently unclear", and "Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm".

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^111Q6azU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — posttreatment assessment and additional treatment emphasizes verifying successful removal and symptom resolution; efficacy is variable, with "effectiveness of the various treatments ranging from 65% to 90%", and "nearly 10% of attempts at removal were unsuccessful" with manual removal with microsuction. Posttreatment "reevaluation of the patient is necessary after the impaction has been resolved", and outcome assessment requires both ear examination and patient symptom assessment. Because procedures "have been associated with otitis externa, bleeding, pain, dizziness, syncope, tinnitus, and tympanic membrane perforation", the posttreatment otoscopic and symptom findings "should be documented in the medical record". Impaction is resolved when the ear can be examined or tested "without the interference of cerumen" and symptoms have resolved. If removal is inadequate to resolve symptoms or permit testing, "additional treatment should be prescribed", which may include repeating the initial method or an alternative strategy such as "softening agents before repeating manual removal", and if the provider cannot clear the impaction safely, "he or she should refer the patient to a provider who has the necessary skills or equipment for proper treatment".

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^1132tbYL]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Statement 2 — modifying factors in diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE): Clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy). Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over risk. The action statement profile characterizes the aggregate evidence quality as Grade C, observational studies, the level of confidence in evidence as High, the benefits-harms assessment as a Preponderance of benefits over harm, and the policy level as Recommendation. Key clinical history components that can modify management include diabetes, HIV infection or other immunocompromised states, history of radiotherapy, and presence of tympanostomy tubes or a perforated tympanic membrane (nonintact tympanic membrane).

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^116xeQFw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Intratympanic steroid therapy versus intratympanic gentamicin — complete vertigo control was less for IT steroid therapy (31%-90% of subjects) than for IT gentamicin therapy (70%-87% of subjects), and the risk of treatment-associated hearing loss was 0% to 8% versus 12.5% to 15.4%, respectively; a similar improvement in aural fullness was reported with IT steroid (38%) and IT gentamicin therapy (31%). Intratympanic steroid therapy has shown greater improvement in vertigo symptoms (85%-90% vs 57%-80%), and one RCT versus placebo showed improvement in tinnitus (48% vs 20%), hearing loss (35% vs 10%), and fullness (48% vs 20%). Reported complications include postprocedure otitis media (7%) and persistent tympanic perforation (3%-38%).

### The gelfoam® plug: an alternative treatment for small eardrum perforations [^1129qDPd]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

To examine if a Gelfoam® plug in combination with surgical removal of the perforation edges could be an alternative to the widely accepted fat plug treatment for smaller ear drum perforations.

Materials and Methods

A prospective study of 17 consecutive patients with persistent small ear drum perforations considered for myringoplasty. The perforations were central perforations 2 to 4 mm in diameter. Patient ages ranged from 6 to 83 years, and the operation was performed under general anesthesia with mask ventilation in children and under topical local anesthesia in adults. A Gelfoam® plug was inserted into the perforation after surgical removal of the perforation edges. The follow-up time was more than 3 months.

Results

The closure rate of the ear drum was 83% (15/18). Pure tone average (PTA) was 19 dB preoperatively and 16 dB postoperatively.

Conclusions

We show for the first time in humans that a Gelfoam® plug in combination with surgical removal of the perforation edges seems to result in about the same closure rate as the fat plug technique in persistent small ear drum perforations. Moreover, the method using Gelfoam® is simpler and faster than the fat plug technique. We suggest that randomized studies comparing the Gelfoam® plug technique with the fat plug technique should be performed.

### Updated guidelines for the management of acute otitis media in children by the Italian Society of Pediatrics: diagnosis [^114LbU7C]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In recent years, new progress has been made regarding the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM). The Italian Pediatric Society therefore decided to issue an update to the previous guidelines published in 2010.

Methods

Literature searches were conducted on MEDLINE by Pubmed, including studies in children, in English or Italian, published between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations (GRADE) methodology. In particular, the quality of the systematic reviews was evaluated using the AMSTAR 2 appraisal tool. The guidelines were formulated using the GRADE methodology by a multidisciplinary panel of experts.

Results

The diagnosis of AOM is based on acute clinical symptoms and otoscopic evidence; alternatively, the presence of otorrhea associated with spontaneous tympanic membrane perforation allows the AOM diagnosis. The diagnosis of AOM must be certain and the use of a pneumatic otoscope is of fundamental importance. As an alternative to the pneumatic otoscope, pediatricians can use a static otoscope and a tympanometer. To objectively establish the severity of the episode for the formulation of a correct treatment program, an AOM severity scoring system taking into account clinical signs and otoscopic findings was developed.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of AOM is clinical and requires the introduction of specific medical training programs. The use of pneumatic otoscopes must be promoted, as they are not sufficiently commonly used in routine practice in Italy.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^113dCaQC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Irrigation for cerumen impaction — clinicians may use irrigation in the management of cerumen impaction as an option based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and with a balance of benefit and harm; the action statement profile notes aggregate evidence quality Grade B with 1 RCT verifying absolute efficacy but multiple treatment arms of comparative studies verifying benefit over cerumenolytic alone, a high level of confidence in the evidence, benefits of resolving cerumen impaction, and risks including external otitis, vertigo, tympanic membrane perforation, otalgia, and temporal bone osteomyelitis with costs of supplies and procedure; it also specifies a large role of patient preferences, medical exceptions including nontintact tympanic membrane, active dermatitis or infection of the ear canal and surrounding tissue, previous intolerance or adverse reaction to this technique, anatomic abnormalities of the ear canal, or history of surgery of the ear or canal (including ear tubes), and a policy level of option.

Diagnosis and Outcome assessments

Eligibility and scheduling

Baseline characteristics and pre-enrolment ear disease were assessed from clinical records. Infants were examined fortnightly from enrolment to randomization, and monthly over the 24 week intervention period or until success was documented.

Assessments

At each study visit a paediatrician or pediatric nurse trained by an Australian expert used video pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry (Grason Stadler GSI 38) to assess ear status. Clinic notes were reviewed to assess inter-current illness and side effects. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline and at each post-randomisation visit, and processed as previously reported to detect pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis.

Criteria for otitis media categories (Table 1)

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria and severity scale for worse ear

Diagnostic criteria were as previously reported. Table 1 gives definitions and the severity scale used to assign the worse (highest score) ear diagnosis at each examination. In this study, ear examinations that demonstrated type B tympanogram, reduced mobility on pneumatic otoscopy and a marked or moderately bulging TM were categorised as AOM without perforation (AOMwoP) even if the child was asymptomatic.

Success

The primary outcome ('success'), was detection of bilateral aerated middle ears (confirmed with tympanometry) at two consecutive monthly visits.

Statistical power and methods

We aimed to achieve a sample size of 118 that would provide 80% power to detect a 20% increase in success rate (5% to 25%). This would also give 88% power to detect a 30% reduction in perforation at the end of therapy (60% to 30%). Interim analysis and stopping rule was intended to be applied if the success rate in the active arm was 40%.

Data were analysed according to a pre-determined plan. We used the outcome in the worse ear (the ear with the highest severity score) to avoid dependence between ears. Estimates of treatment effect are given as the difference between amoxicillin and placebo groups in the prevalence of each outcome at the end of therapy, as a difference in the proportion of examinations during therapy (risk difference and unadjusted 95% confidence interval) or as a adjusted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (adjusted for repeat child examinations using generalised linear models – Poisson). For children who failed to complete therapy, the last available assessment was used. Two sided significance tests were used throughout. All calculations used Stata version 9.

### Achieving a successful closure of an anterior tympanic membrane perforation: evidence-based systematic review [^112Dnn2G]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives Surgical repair of a tympanic membrane perforation is a common otologic procedure. However, achieving a successful closure can be challenging, especially if the anterior margin of the tympanic membrane is involved. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on evidence published in closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforations. Data Sources The following data sources were searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1997 to August, 3 2017), MEDLINE (February 1948 to August 3, 2017), and Embase (1975 to August 3, 2017). Data Extraction Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines were followed. For the purpose of this study, the inclusion criteria were as follows; (1) studies reporting surgical technique for closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforations, (2) primary cases only, (3) articles published in the English language, (4) minimum 6-month follow-up, and (5) recorded pre- and postoperative audiometry. The exclusion criteria were non-English language articles, revision surgery, and no audiometric outcomes. Results On initial search, a total of 181 articles were identified (PubMed, n = 136; Cochrane, n = 28; Embase, n = 17). Based on the criteria, 136 articles were excluded. Full text of 45 articles was reviewed, and a further 24 articles were excluded. A total of 21 articles fulfilled the criteria for study inclusion. Conclusions All published evidence is level 4. High-quality controlled studies are required to determine the most effective method for closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforation.

### Can nasal decongestants improve eustachian tube function? [^112g1P3C]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of nasal decongestants on eustachian tube (ET) opening.

Study Design

A prospective nonrandomized study.

Setting

A tertiary referral center.

Patients

Twenty-four patients (44 ears) with intact eardrums, 39 patients (43 ears) having a noninfected eardrum defect, and six patients with an upper airway infection.

Interventions

Nasal or intratympanal (in perforated ears) application of a nasal decongestant (xylometazoline 0.1%).

Main Outcome Measures

Change of tube opening quality (yes or no; better or worse) measuring tube opening parameters (pressure, latency) using the Estève method and pressure equalization tests (swallowing at negative and positive external ear canal pressures).

Results

In most cases, nasal decongestion or intratympanal use of decongestants have no effect on ET opening. Improvement in tube opening is rather an exception and, in a minority of patients, a reduced ET function was evident.

Conclusion

Our acute studies revealed no improvement in eustachian ventilatory tube function with the administration of nasal decongestants.

### Retained tympanostomy tubes: who, what, when, why, and how to treat? [^111r4xUY]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Tympanostomy tube placement is one of the most common surgical procedures performed across the globe. Controversies exist regarding what to do when a tube is considered to be retained in the tympanic membrane for too long.

Materials and Methods

Review of the PubMed medical literature starting in 1990, focusing on English language studies reporting on the definition, complications, and management of retained tympanostomy tubes.

Results

The medical literature reporting on outcomes regarding retained tympanostomy tubes is relatively sparse. Most studies recommend prophylactic removal of tubes after a defined period of time, usually around 2 to 3 years after placement. A preferred method of myringoplasty after tympanostomy tube retrieval has not been established, but most studies recommend grafting the perforation at the time of tube removal.

Conclusions

Although a consensus as to the optimal management of retained tympanostomy tubes is not yet established in the medical literature, a preponderance of studies recommend prophylactic removal at defined period of time (> 2–3 years) before the onset of complications such as otorrhea and granulation tissue formation. Due to a lack of best evidence, the surgeon's preference remains the guiding principle as to the best technique for myringoplasty at the time of removal.

### Childhood disability in Malawi: a population based assessment using the key informant method [^112dffUC]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Physical impairment: Diagnosis and service needs

A total of 1265 diagnoses of physical impairment were made for 1094 children (some children had multiple diagnosis, Table 3). A neurological diagnosis was the most common (n = 591, 54%), followed by congenital e.g. club foot (n = 215, 20%), acquired non-traumatic e.g. angular limb deformity (n = 194, 18%) and trauma (n = 145, 13%) diagnoses. The most common health condition was cerebral palsy (accounting for a quarter of all children with physical impairment).

Table 3
Diagnosis of moderate/severe physical impairment

a Some children had multiple diagnoses. Percentages in this table are calculated out of the total number of diagnoses (n = 1265) rather than individual children

The most common services recommended following examination at the screening camp were physical therapy (44% of children with physical impairment) surgery (17%), occupational therapy (14%), wheelchair (8%), medication (7%) and appliances/orthosis (3%, data not shown). Extrapolating these data suggests that there are approximately 1600 children per million population who could benefit from physical therapy, 700 from surgery, 500 from occupational therapy and 300 from a wheelchair, and 250 from medication. Caregivers were asked if their child had previously received any of these services. The majority (60%) had not received any services in the past, 17% had previously had physical therapy and 12% had received surgery.

Hearing impairment: Diagnosis and service needs

Just under half of the children (45%) with hearing impairment had a perforated ear drum and 36% had evidence of discharge in the middle ear. Wax was evident in one third of the children. Inflammation, foreign bodies, retraction and red/bulging ears were less common (< 5%). The majority (73%) of children with bilateral hearing impairment had one or more of symptoms indicating conductive hearing loss (sound unable to pass from outer to inner ear, usually because of a blockage). The remainder did not have any of these symptoms indicating sensorineural causes of hearing loss (caused by damage to hair cells inside the inner ear or auditory nerve damage). Extrapolating these findings, we estimate that, there are approximately 1800 children per million population with conductive causes of hearing impairment that could be treated or prevented through the provision of basic primary ear and hearing care services.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114aCnLQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) outcome assessment — STATEMENT 8: The clinician should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Action statement profile notes Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, Policy level: Recommendation, Exceptions: None, and Intentional vagueness: Time frame of 48 to 72 hours is specified since there are no data to substantiate a more precise estimate of time to improvement. Appropriate treatment of uncomplicated AOE should be followed by symptom improvement within 48 to 72 hours, although symptom resolution may take up to 2 weeks in some cases; patient-reported ear pain generally decreases after 1 day of treatment and most pain resolves within 4 to 7 days; a Cochrane review recommended follow-up in 2 weeks if any symptoms persist, while diary data showed most patients show rapid improvement within 72 hours even if complete resolution may take a week or more.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^116yKq2Q]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) with suspected or confirmed tympanic membrane perforation — topical agent selection and ototoxicity cautions are specified as follows: If the tympanic membrane is known or suspected to be nonintact, topical drops that contain alcohol, have a low pH (most acidifying/antiseptic agents), or both should be avoided because of pain and potential ototoxicity, and substances with ototoxic potential (eg, aminoglycosides, alcohol) should not be used when the tympanic membrane is perforated and the middle ear space is open, because the risk of ototoxic injury outweighs the benefits compared with non-ototoxic antimicrobials with equal efficacy; the only topical antimicrobials approved by the FDA (December 2005) for middle ear use are quinolone drops; warnings for neomycin-containing products note that neomycin can induce permanent sensorineural hearing loss, therapy should be limited to 10 consecutive days, and CORTISPORIN Otic Suspension should not be used in any patient with a perforated tympanic membrane; identification of persistent patency is aided by the facts that children with tubes inserted more than 1 year ago should also have the tympanic membrane carefully assessed, since in some cases the tube may remain functional for 3 years or longer, and individuals who taste substances placed into their ear or who can expel air out of their ear canal by pinched nose blowing can be assumed to have a perforation.

### Surgery for tympanic membrane retraction pockets [^115RNL97]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Tympanic membrane retractions are commonly managed by ENT surgeons. There is currently no consensus as to the indications, timing and options for management of this condition.

Objectives

To study the effectiveness of different surgical options in the management of tympanic membrane retractions.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2010 Issue 1); PubMed (1950 to 2010); EMBASE (1974 to 2010); CINAHL (1982 to 2010); BIOSIS Previews; ISI Web of Science; CAB Abstracts; LILACS; KoreaMed; IndMed; PakMediNet; China National Knowledge Infrastructure; ISCTRN; UKCRN; ICTRP and Google. The date of the search was 17 March 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the surgical management of tympanic membrane retraction pockets in adults or children. Staging of the retraction using a known system must have been performed. Studies of cholesteatoma or perforations were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently collected and analysed data to minimise the effects of selection and reporting bias.

Main Results

Two RCTs were included, involving 71 participants. The first study showed no statistically significant benefit of cartilage graft tympanoplasty over a watch and wait policy for either disease progression or hearing outcome. The second showed no additional benefit from the insertion of ventilation tubes over cartilage tympanoplasty alone with regards to hearing outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

No evidence currently exists to either support or refute the role of surgery in the management of tympanic membrane retractions. Higher quality studies are much needed to ascertain this.

### Early paper patching versus observation in patients with traumatic eardrum perforations: comparisons of anatomical and functional outcomes [^11794TBZ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients with acute tympanic membrane perforation after spontaneous healing and paper-patching procedure.

Methods Design, Setting, and Participants

In this study, we performed a retrospective chart review with a prospective follow-up in 63 patients with tympanic membrane perforations. The patients undergoing a paper-patching procedure were assigned to group 1 (n = 33), whereas the patients that healed spontaneously were included in group 2 (n = 30). Retrospective analyses of the otoscopic examination findings and audiometric test results of the groups at the sixth-week follow-up were compared.

Results

Eardrum healing was achieved in 90.9% of the patients in group 1 and 76.7% of the patients in group 2 at the sixth week (P > 0.05). The mean values of air conduction were significantly improved, and the air-bone gap was markedly decreased in the patients treated with paper patching, when compared with the patients in group 2 (P < 0.001). The area of perforation was found to be inversely related to the healing success.

Conclusions

Early intervention by paper patching, which is a readily applicable procedure, may be offered to the patients with acute perforation of the tympanic membrane, because of the slightly better closure rates and significantly higher hearing functions when compared with simple observation.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113qYyU9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tube otorrhea and complications — frequencies and management — are reported as follows: Acute TTO occurs in up to 50% of children who are closely monitored in RCTs, with cohort studies finding 16% postoperative otorrhea (first 30 days), 26% delayed otorrhea, 7% recurrent otorrhea, and 4% chronic otorrhea. Caregivers should be counseled that TTO responds to topical antibiotic ear drops, does not usually require oral antibiotics, and benefits from water precautions until the discharge is no longer present. Up to 3% of tubes may fail to extrude and require active removal; persistent tympanic membrane perforation occurs with about 2% of short-term tubes and up to 20% of long-term tubes; and localized cholesteatoma may be seen in 0.5% of cases.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^115Ssjx4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion guideline — evidence-based statements and clinical judgment state that guidelines are intended to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, produce optimal health outcomes for patients, and minimize harm; the evidence-based approach requires that evidence be identified, appraised, and summarized with an explicit link between evidence and statements, and statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm. Guidelines are never intended to supplant professional judgment; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than with a recommendation, options offer the most opportunity for practice variability, and Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations.

### Does topical steroid use increase the risk for subsequent tympanoplasty? [^114RuzoS]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Although the current data support the notion that combination therapy of topical steroids with antibiotics is a safe, and often superior, option for suppurative otitis media when compared to topical antibiotics alone, little is known about the impact of topical steroids on tympanic membrane (TM) healing and risk of residual perforation. This study aims to describe the long-term impact the addition of topical steroids to antibiotics has on TM healing, as measured by rates of subsequent tympanoplasty.

Methods

Electronic health records were queried using TriNetX Research Network to construct cohorts of adult patients with "infected" TM perforation (ICD-10 code H66) and "noninfected" TM perforation (ICD-10 code H72). Both groups were further divided based on treatment with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone (RxNorm codes). The measured outcome was whether or not the patient underwent tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy or ossicular reconstruction within 2 years following diagnosis and treatment.

Results

In "infected" patients, the ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone cohort demonstrated a small but significantly increased risk of undergoing tympanoplasty (1.12%) compared to the ofloxacin cohort (0.76%, p < 0.05). In "noninfected" patients, the ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone cohort demonstrated a significantly increased risk of undergoing tympanoplasty (6.87%) compared to the ofloxacin cohort (5.67%, p < 0.05).

Conclusion

In the setting of acute suppurative otitis media, there is a small but statistically significant increased risk of residual TM perforation when patients receive ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone compared to ofloxacin. However, the clinical significance of this risk must be weighed against the curative and symptomatic benefits of ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone over ofloxacin.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^113wezBs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

We identified data for four of our proposed comparisons, from a total of 30 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that analysed 2133 participants. No data were found for the comparisons of intratympanic corticosteroids versus no treatment/placebo as primary therapy, intratympanic corticosteroids versus systemic corticosteroids as secondary therapy, or intratympanic corticosteroids plus systemic corticosteroids versus placebo/no treatment as either primary or secondary therapy.

The following is a summary of the key findings for each comparison:

Intratympanic corticosteroids versus systemic corticosteroids as primary therapy

We identified 16 studies and analysed 1108 patients for this comparison (Table 1). Intratympanic corticosteroids may result in a trivial or no difference in the change in hearing threshold, as compared with systemic steroids (low‐certainty evidence). They probably also result in little to no difference in the number of participants whose hearing improves, and may result in little to no difference in the final hearing threshold. The confidence intervals of all outcomes do not overlap the thresholds for clinical relevance, and these results persisted after sensitivity analysis. Overall, vertigo and dizziness may be increased, and ear pain is probably more common for those who receive intratympanic corticosteroids. However, adverse effects commonly associated with steroid use (such as blood glucose problems) may be reduced among those who receive intratympanic steroids. Persistent tympanic membrane perforation, ear pain at the time of the injection and vertigo/dizziness at the time of the injection were noted among those who received intratympanic injection, but we could not be certain how often these effects would occur.

Intratympanic plus systemic corticosteroids (combined therapy) versus systemic corticosteroids alone as primary therapy

We identified 10 studies and analysed 788 patients for this comparison (Table 3). The change in hearing threshold may be slightly increased (better) among those who received combined therapy, but it is unclear whether this increase would be noticeable and important to patients (low‐certainty evidence). The evidence regarding the number of patients whose hearing improved, and the final hearing threshold, was very uncertain, although both outcomes favoured the combined treatment group. Adverse effects were only reported for those who received combined therapy, therefore we were unable to compare the intervention to systemic corticosteroids. Persistent tympanic membrane perforation, vertigo/dizziness at the time of the injection and ear pain at the time of the injection were all reported in the intervention group, but we could not be certain how often these effects would be seen.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^115YBo3g]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — short-term versus long-term devices differ in duration, indications, and trade-offs. Short-term tubes ventilate for "8 to 18 months, on average; some stay in place 3 years or longer", are the "Routine choice for first ear tube surgery for a child", have "Reduced incidence (vs long-term tubes) of perforation, chronic otorrhea, granulation tissue, myringosclerosis; ease of insertion", but carry "Potential for early extrusion and need for repeat tube surgery". Long-term tubes provide ventilation for "15 months or longer, usually 2 to 3 years; some stay in place 5 years or longer", are a "Selective choice for first ear tube surgery for a child when a need for prolonged ventilation is anticipated; option for repeat tube surgery", offer "Longer period of middle ear ventilation, potential to avoid repeat insertion of short-term tubes and exposure to general anesthesia; ability to insert silastic T-tube in stenotic canal", but have "Increased incidence (vs short-term tube) of perforation, chronic otorrhea, granulation tissue, myringosclerosis, medialization (if short shaft with no outer flange); more difficult to insert". Relative uses include, for short-term tubes, "Repeat ear tube surgery in children without significant risk factors or anatomic changes in the eardrum that would warrant a long-term tube", and for long-term tubes, "Cleft palate, stenotic ear canal, abnormal tympanic membrane (atrophy, atelectasis, retraction pocket), premature extrusion of multiple prior short-term tubes".

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116jf9iY]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Tympanic membrane (TM) perforation is commonly encountered in the clinical setting. It can be iatrogenic, or caused by trauma or infections. In the United States, it is estimated that 1 to 3% of the population will have a TM perforation some time in their life. In specific groups (e.g. Indigenous Australians), the prevalence reported has been as high as 28 to 43%. Some perforations may lead to chronic otorrhea and hearing loss, and limit water sports, which may significantly reduce the quality of life. Moreover, chronic TM perforations, if left untreated, serve as a conduit for further infections, acquired cholesteatoma, facial nerve palsy, labyrinthitis, and subperiosteal abscess. Although traumatic TM perforations tend to heal spontaneously, large or chronic perforations may fail to heal and require surgical interventions. In addition, the long-term spontaneous healing rate can sometimes be unsatisfactory. Kristensen reported that healing rate for spontaneous perforations to be 78.7%, which appears to vary depending on the cause of perforation. To repair TM perforations, patients may suffer from complications from conventional surgery. Hence, it is crucial to explore options that may improve the efficacy of repair.

With the advancement in the field of tissue engineering, various bioscaffolds and bioactive molecules have been applied with encouraging results. Among them, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is one of the most commonly used bioactive molecules. Until recently, a majority of the studies were in animal models. However, in the recent years, we have witnessed a surge in the use of bFGF in human trials (,–). Although a majority of trials reported promising benefits, the perforation closure rates varied across the different studies, and there does not appear to be a consensus for hearing benefits. Recently, a literature review supported the role of bFGF in the repair of TM perforation, but to the best of our knowledge, no quantitative analysis has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of bFGF.

Thus, the aim of this comprehensive meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of bFGF for the repair of TM perforations both in healing and hearing by evaluating the current best evidence.

### Clinical evaluation of an over-the-counter hearing aid (TEO first ®) in elderly patients suffering of mild to moderate hearing loss [^1127Qx1e]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Method

Location and subjects

This prospective monocentric open label study carried out by the University Hospital of Nice (reference 12-pp-17). The study took place from July 15, 2013, to September 18, 2014. All audiometric assessments were performed by the same audiologist at the IUFC (Institut Universitaire de la Face et du Cou) at the Nice University Hospital (VAT number FR 72 260 600 705). The study was approved by the South Mediterranean V Ethical Review Board (Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud Méditérrannée V, authorization 13.017), as well as by the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (ANSM, n°ID-RCB 2013-A00149–36). The study was also declared on ClinicalTrials.gov with the number NCT01815788. Patients who agreed to participate gave their written informed consent.

Inclusion criteria were: age over 60 years old with a mild to moderate presbycusis (a bilateral hearing loss in the range between 20 and 50 dB calculated on the average threshold for the tonal frequencies 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz), wish for a hearing improvement, commitment to use the device daily and sufficient cognitive capacity to use the device. Non-inclusion criteria were: profound hearing loss that cannot be rehabilitated with a prosthetic device, previous use of hearing aid device, previous rejection of hearing aid because of discomfort, aestheticism or local intolerance (ear discharge, perforated eardrum, eczema, mastoiditis sequelae), acute pathology, and legally protected patient. Patients who agreed to participate had to be covered by social insurance. Patients who withdrew consent were excluded from the study. They could also be excluded by the investigator and the study coordinator (mainly for unexpected medical or ethical concerns).

### Comparison of the medical costs and effects of large traumatic eardrum perforations treatment [^1171wQf9]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated the medical costs and effects of ofloxacin drops (OFLX), gelatin sponge patches, spontaneous healing, and endoscopic myringoplasty on healing in large tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs).

Methods

In total, 100 patients with large traumatic TMPs involving > 50% of the eardrum were randomly assigned to OFLX, gelatin sponge, spontaneous healing, or endoscopic myringoplasty treatment groups. Medical costs, closure times, and closure rates were compared among groups at 6 months.

Results

The closure rates in the OFLX, gelatin sponge, spontaneous healing, and endoscopic myringoplasty groups were 95.7%, 82.6%, 58.3%, and 91.7%, respectively (P = 0.05). The mean closure time was 13.73 ± 6.14 days in the OFLX group, 15.89 ± 4.95 days in the gelatin sponge group, 48.36 ± 10.37 days in the spontaneous healing group, and 12 days in the endoscopic myringoplasty group (P < 0.001). The mean medical costs in US dollars were $15.53 ± 3.15, $103.64 ± 111.58, $11.17 ± 1.33, and $715.90 in the OFLX, gelatin sponge, spontaneous healing, and endoscopic myringoplasty groups, respectively (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Although the gelatin sponge and myringoplasty treatments significantly shortened the closure time compared with spontaneous healing, the gelatin sponge patch did not significantly improve the closure rate, and the medical cost of myringoplasty was significantly higher than that of the other treatments. In contrast, OFLX significantly shortened closure time and had a higher closure rate than spontaneous healing, and the medical costs were lower than those of the gelatin sponge and myringoplasty procedures.

### Diagnosis and management of primary ciliary dyskinesia [^113PXohG]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

ENT

Poor MCC of the upper respiratory tract leads to mucus pooling within the middle ear cleft, nose and paranasal sinuses. This results in a high incidence of otitis media with effusion (46–86% of patients), hearing loss (25–36%) and nasal discharge or blockage (76–88%). Where one would normally expect resolution of glue ear and nasal discharge in an otherwise healthy child by 8 years, symptoms in PCD children persist longer and not infrequently into adulthood.

The main ENT concern is persistent hearing loss that is linked to otitis media with effusion. The role of ventilation tubes (VT) is controversial. Most reports advise avoiding VTs as they simply divert the mucus flow through the ear drum causing longstanding mucopurulent discharge. Hearing loss therefore tends to be managed conservatively with hearing aids, educational support for hearing issues and, where appropriate, speech therapy. Several reports challenge this, claiming good hearing restoration following VT insertion with episodic discharge causing no greater burden than in non-PCD patients. Should tympanic membrane perforations develop (particularly after repeated VT insertion), tympanoplasty is generally successful, but the glue ear often reoccurs.

Nasal symptoms usually manifest as persistent nasal discharge and blockage. Nasal polyposis in childhood is rare. Nasal discharge is best managed by irrigation. Prophylactic antibiotics help minimise infective rhinosinusitis. Rarely is sinus surgery necessary or found to be effective in reducing nasal discharge. The sphenoid and frontal sinuses can be hypoplastic or even aplastic. There is no proven role for the use of intranasal steroids or antihistamines, but they are useful in treating any additional allergic rhinosinusitis.

The role of adenotonsillectomy in removing any reservoir of infection is yet unproven. Obstructive sleep apnoea and sleep-disordered breathing are greater in PCD than in the general population, but neither have been found to be directly linked to increased adenotonsillar hypertrophy.

IDSA/ASTMH cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) monitoring and consequences — Potential consequences of inadequate treatment include poor cosmetic outcome due to scarring or superinfection, persistence of a chronic wound(s), and, with some Leishmania species, destructive and disfiguring mucosal leishmaniasis (ML); in immunocompromised persons, cutaneous, mucosal, and visceral dissemination may occur (fact, no grade). Persons with CL should be actively monitored by clinical appearance, including careful nasal and oropharyngeal examination periodically up to 1 year, or at least 2 years if at increased risk for ML, and educated to seek medical attention anytime signs or symptoms of relapse or ML appear (strong, low). Symptoms such as chronic nasal stuffiness, epistaxis, hoarseness, or findings such as septal perforation in anyone with a prior or current diagnosis of CL or a scar consistent with prior CL should prompt evaluation for ML, including fiber-optic examination of the affected area if relevant (strong, moderate).

### Surgical interventions for Ménière's disease [^115fqk62]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Selective reporting

Kitahara 2016 used a ratio of pre/post‐treatment values to define vertigo control as "better", "worse" or "no change". However, the authors only report the number of participants in whom vertigo resolved completely over the course of the study. Although the study was prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, the only outcome listed here is "all cause mortality". This seems a surprising choice of primary outcome measure (and is also not reported in the publication). There was no report of any adverse events, including relatively common complications of ventilation tube placement, such as otorrhoea or tympanic membrane perforation. We rated it as high risk.

Thomsen 1981 did not publish a protocol. It was unclear if all outcomes are fully reported. Also, there were no adverse events published at the 12‐month follow‐up. We rated it as unclear risk.

Other potential sources of bias

No additional sources of bias were identified in Kitahara 2016.

We are aware that the data presented in Thomsen 1981 were subsequently re‐analysed leading to different conclusions (Welling 2000). Also, there was no control around how patients were treated medically during the nine‐year follow‐up study, which could have a significant impact on the results. We rated it as high risk.

Effects of interventions

See: Table 1; Table 2

### Management of complex perianal Crohn's disease [^113zsfSW]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HOT)

HOT involves breathing 100% oxygen while under increased atmospheric pressure. This leads to an increase in the plasma O 2 partial pressure, thus enhancing oxygenation of hypoxic bowel tissues and also of non-healing perianal fistulas. In addition, it has been reported that HOT may have immunomodulatory properties, reducing IL-1, IL-2 and TNF-α levels and upregulating molecular pathways (hypoxia-inducible factor-1, heme oxygenase-1) with an essential role in hypoxia tolerance.

In 2014, Dulai et al performed a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of HOT in IBD. They incorporated data from 17 different studies, most of which were case reports, with only one randomized clinical trial. In their analysis they included 40 patients with PCD for a median of 2 years prior to initiation of HOT; 21 had fistulas, with a predominance of complex fistulas. Most of these patients responded poorly to 5-aminosalicylic acid, steroids and immunomodulatory therapy. The overall response rate was 88% (18/40 complete healing, 17/40 partial healing), while two patients abandoned the treatment because of side effects. It should be highlighted that there was high heterogeneity in the assessment of response to therapy, symptom evaluation, number of sessions and time of follow up.

Adverse effects are uncommon (0.01%) and it seems that HOT is better tolerated than in other indications, such as radiation proctitis (0.2%). Eardrum perforation and psychological intolerance (claustrophobia) are the most frequent side effects. Pneumothorax, myopia, bowel perforation and seizures have also been described.

Since the completion of this systematic review no further relevant data have emerged.

### Evaluating adverse outcomes after myringotomy or tube placement in head and neck cancer [^111znoNs]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition of Adverse Outcomes

In our study, we aimed to define the potential outcomes following surgical intervention for patients with HN cancer, particularly those undergoing radiation therapy, who may experience a variety of ear‐related complications due to treatment side effects and the nature of the disease. We gathered outcomes from the last known status of the patient at their latest follow‐up. We categorized these outcomes into several distinct groups: persistent perforation, where a perforation in the TM fails to heal over time, potentially leading to chronic discomfort or hearing loss; recurrent effusion, repeat buildup of fluid in the middle ear after we had classified the ear as resolved; repeat placements of tympanostomy tubes, required to manage ongoing effusions or prevent recurrence thereof; and healed or resolved ear, indicating successful recovery without further intervention. Lastly, we also assessed the probability of experiencing any adverse outcome, encompassing persistent perforation, recurrent effusion, or repeat placements, as these events necessitated continued treatment or surveillance.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^112TJvKj]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — irrigation and manual removal safety notes state that irrigation (ear syringing) uses a jet of warm water ideally at body temperature, is generally safe and effective but carries a small risk of eardrum perforation, and should be avoided in certain at risk populations. Manual removal uses ear curettes, probes, hooks, forceps, or microsuction, is generally safe and effective but can abrade the canal, and suction occlusion can generate excessive noise potentially leading to tinnitus or hearing loss. No direct comparison has been performed between same‑day, in‑office softening plus irrigation/manual removal and home softening followed by irrigation and manual removal.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^1121cmkY]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

What are the microbiological implications of long-term amoxicillin? Our study shows a significant reduction in pneumococcal carriage during amoxicillin therapy. Despite the positive results from our RCT it is unclear whether withholding antibiotics in an asymptomatic child at risk of perforation will result in a clinical deterioration that outweighs the theoretical risk of increasing antibiotic resistance should the child be treated. It is reassuring that in our RCT there was no increase in the carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci as a result of treatment, nor any difference in antibiotics prescribed for intercurrent illnesses between amoxicillin and placebo children. Indeed there was a tendency for fewer children in the amoxicillin group to be colonised by penicillin-resistant pneumococci. On the other hand, although beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae were uncommon in both groups, they were detected more frequently in children receiving amoxicillin; however, as this non-significant trend was also present before the start of trial therapy, it could be a chance finding.

Empirical studies of resistance are not available from other randomised controlled trials of long term antibiotics for otitis media. The study of perforation in Alaska natives, which also found that long-term antibiotics were beneficial, did not report on antibiotic resistance. We note that by 1997, 25% of Australian clinical isolates were penicillin non-susceptible, and high levels of penicillin resistance were reported from Aboriginal communities from the mid 1980s.

We have previously shown that OM is more advanced when multiple pathogens colonise the nasopharynx simultaneously and at high density We suggest that the effect of long-term amoxicillin is to reduce the density and multiplicity of bacterial carriage by reducing the rate of acquisition of new strains and/or the rate of proliferation of those already acquired. In the Finnish OM study 28% of new pneumococcal acquisitions were associated with pneumococcal AOM, compared with only 11% for established carriage.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116gkRs4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Guideline action term strength and implied obligation — strong recommendation, recommendation, and option — define clinician expectations. For a strong recommendation, the benefits clearly exceed the harms with high-quality evidence (grade A or B), and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A recommendation indicates benefits exceed harms but with lower-quality evidence (grade B or C), and clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. An option indicates suspect evidence (grade D) or well-done studies (grade A, B, or C) showing little clear advantage between approaches, and clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Option is similar to the weak recommendation in the GRADE classification.

### Efficacy of EGF and gelatin sponge for traumatic tympanic membrane perforations: a randomized controlled study [^113m9YAd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the outcomes of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and gelatin sponge patch treatments for traumatic tympanic membrane perforations.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled.

Setting

University-affiliated teaching hospital.

Subjects and Methods

In total, 141 perforations encompassing > 50% of the eardrum were randomly divided into 3 groups: EGF (n = 47), gelatin sponge patch (n = 47), and observation (n = 47). The edges of the perforations were not approximated. The closure rate, mean closure time, and infection rate were evaluated at 6 months and the related factors analyzed.

Results

A total of 135 perforations were analyzed. At 6 months, the closure rates were 97.8%, 86.7%, and 82.2% in the EGF, gelatin sponge patch, and spontaneous healing groups, respectively (P = 0.054). The mean ± SD closure time was 11.12 ± 4.60, 13.67 ± 5.37, and 25.65 ± 13.32 days in the EGF, gelatin sponge patch, and spontaneous healing groups, respectively (P < .001). In addition, the presence of infection was not significantly associated with rate of closure in any group.

Conclusions

As compared with spontaneous healing, daily application of EGF and gelatin sponge patching reduced the closure time of traumatic tympanic membrane perforations. EGF treatment had a higher closure rate and shorter closure time but resulted in otorrhea. By contrast, gelatin sponge patches did not improve the closure rate or cause otorrhea but required repeated patch removal and reapplication. Thus, the appropriate treatment should be selected according to patient need.

Table 3
Primary outcome of acceptable hearing at 5 weeks by treatment group

Secondary outcomes are presented in table 4 and in the appendix. There was a significant increase in acceptable hearing from 5 weeks to 6 months and 12 months (p = 0.0001), with a constant albeit non-significant difference of 7–8% in favour of oral steroid (table 4). Although the rate of tympanometry resolution did not differ significantly over time or between groups (oral steroids vs placebo averaged across all three follow-up timepoints), the treatment groups had a different resolution trajectory over time (in the oral steroid group the rate of resolution increased over time whereas in the placebo group it decreased after 6 months). There was no treatment effect in the proportion of children with otoscopic evidence of a tympanic membrane perforation present in at least one ear, evidence of a middle ear effusion, or bubbles behind the ear drum (table 4).

Table 4
Secondary outcomes based on clinical assessment, functional health status (OM8–30) and health-related quality-of-life (PedsQL and HUI3) scores over time and by treatment group

39 (23%) of 173 children in the oral steroid group and 38 (22%) of 170 in the placebo group had ventilation tubes inserted between 5 weeks and 6 months, as did an additional 23 in each group between 6 months and 12 months (table 4). There was no evidence of an effect on ventilation tube insertion rates from oral steroids. The mean time to insertion of ventilation tubes was 168.0 days (SD 96.1) in the oral steroid group and 165.5 days (104.5) in the placebo group, with no difference between groups (adjusted hazard ratio 1.04 [95% CI 0.71–1.53], p = 0.84).

### Myringoplasty for pediatric chronic otitis media: an uncritical closure of a natural middle ear drainage? [^116wL11R]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Performing tympanoplasty for tympanic perforations in children and adolescents is often considered to be less successful than in adults.

Objectives

The aim of our study was to evaluate the surgical outcome of tympanoplasty type I in patients under 15 years of age with chronic otitis media and to identify potential factors that influence the success rate.

Materials Und Methods

The present study was based on a retrospective analysis of the medical records of all patients under the age of 15 who were treated for chronic otitis media by means of type I tympanoplasty between 2005 and 2020. The minimum follow-up period was 6 months. The data were analyzed with regard to epidemiological parameters, tube-related pathologies in the contralateral ear, the local condition and the extent of the eardrum perforation as well as the extent of the surgical intervention (tympanoplasty type I with or without adenotomy).

Results

83 cases were included in our study. The mean age at the time of the surgery was 8.9 years. The mean follow-up time was 46 months (6–182 months). The anatomical closure rate was 88.0%. Children with "dry" tympanic perforations tended to perform better (p = 0.052). The average improvement in the air bone gap was 2.0 dB.

Conclusion

Detailed preoperative counseling about the advantages and disadvantages as well as the expected success rate of an early myringoplasty in this age group is just as important as an individualized approach for a high level of patient satisfaction.

Objective

The purpose of the present study was to assess the rate of tympanic membrane perforation in patients with otomycosis and to discuss the literature regarding the difficulties in managing this condition.

Data Sources

Literature review from 1999 to 2019, Web of Science, PubMed, and Medline.

Study Selection

We searched for eligible articles concerning the clinical entity of tympanic membrane perforation secondary to otomycosis. Case series and clinical trials were the types of articles included for this review.

Data Extraction

All the articles described in the study selection were used for this review.

Data Synthesis

Statistical techniques were not used.

Conclusion

Based on the available literature, it seems that tympanic membrane perforation secondary to otomycosis is not uncommon. The presence of this complication is associated with 2 problems: Antimycotic solutions are irritant to middle ear and may be ototoxic to the cochlea. Although most cases of fungus caused tympanic membrane (TM) perforation resolve with proper medical treatment, in a few patients a tympanoplasty may be required.

### Prognosis of inner ear function in pneumolabyrinth: case report and literature review [^111ibw1W]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2009). Low credibility.

Pneumolabyrinth, the presence of air within the labyrinth, is a rare radiologic finding associated with a well-known perilymphatic fistula (PLF). As there are only 24 published case reports in medical literature, multiple treatment options for the pneumolabyrinth are available. We report a case of a 20-year-old man with a pneumolabyrinth secondary to tympanic membrane and ossicular trauma. Despite conservative treatment, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) had progressed rapidly, and his profound deafness had not recovered after surgical exploration with closure of the PLF. Functional prognostic factors of SNHL are revised and compared with this case.

### Prognostic factors of successful tympanoplasty in pediatric patients: a cohort study [^113DwTek]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Arguments in favor of surgery at an earlier age (under 5 years) are the following: 1) reduction in the number of visits to the doctor, which are required for the follow-up of a minor with perforated eardrum; 2) hypoacusis and privation of aquatic activities with affect on the quality of life; 3) higher incidence of severe secondary complications due to chronic otitis media in younger children; 4) better cochlear reserve at younger ages, with greater potential to restore and preserve hearing; 5) limitation of the damage that chronic infection can cause to other structures in the middle ear; and 6) auditory loss that alters the development and the quality of academic activities. Despite this arguments, the recommendation to delay tympanoplasty, generally until six years of age, is widely accepted. In support of said recommendation are the following aspects: alterations in the healing process or re-perforation of the graft by repetitive infections of the superior respiratory tracts; unpredictable function of the Eustachian tubes; immunological immaturity; possibility of spontaneous resolution; difficulty of post-operative care; lack of confidence of the part of the parents in the procedure; and equivalence of the perforation to the function of the ventilation tube. There is evidence that tympanoplasty is more successful in children over six years of age, although other studies have not demonstrated significant differences in this respect.

In addition to age, other factors have been suggested as interfering with the success of the surgery: the size and site of the perforation; cause of the perforation; active infection at the time of surgery; the state of the auditory ossicles and of the mucosa of the middle ear; state of the contralateral ear (as a measure of the function of the Eustachian tube), and the surgical technique utilized. The presence of adenoid tissue, whether it be hypertrophic or chronically infected, has been proposed as a prognostic factor; however, no statistically significant association has been demonstrated, above all in short-term results. A factor that could have interfered in the result was the definition of success that was used. Children with craniofacial syndromes, with or without cleft palate, present a different evolution; for these children, the results reported in the literature are controversial.

The objectives of the present work were to analyze which factors are predictive of success of tympanoplasty in pediatric patients and to construct and validate a prognostic index that could be used as a tool to predict the success of tympanoplasty in children.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^114nm2aE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Follow-up setting and triggers for referral — Periodic follow-up for all children with tubes is essential to detect and manage complications, which may vary by the type of tube and its composition. Once adequate postoperative tympanostomy tube function and hearing improvement are established within 3 months by the surgeon or designee, some follow-up care may occur in primary care offices; if this approach is chosen, the specialist should ideally be informed of the visit, with referral to otolaryngology implemented upon any complication such as early extrusion, tube obstruction, tube medialization, otorrhea, retained tube, or tympanic membrane perforation.

### Healing large traumatic eardrum perforations in humans using fibroblast growth factor applied directly or via gelfoam [^112R68ke]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of conservative treatment and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) applied directly or via Gelfoam on the healing of large traumatic tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs) in humans.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

Methods

A randomized prospective analysis was performed between February 2009 and January 2011 for the treatment of traumatic TMPs in humans that affected greater than 50% of the TM. The closure rate, closure time, hearing gain, and rate of otorrhea were compared among the direct application of FGF, FGF via Gelfoam, and conservative treatment.

Results

A total of 94 patients were analyzed. The closure rates of large perforations in the direct FGF application, FGF via Gelfoam, and observation groups were 100%, 97%, and 55%, respectively. FGF-treated groups had significantly improved closure rates compared with the observation group (p < 0.05). However, the closure rate did not differ significantly between patients who received FGF only and those who received FGF via Gelfoam (p > 0.05). FGF-treated groups showed shorter mean closure times compared with the observation group (p < 0.05). However, the closure time did not differ significantly between FGF-treated groups (p > 0.05). All perforations were closed within 2 weeks, regardless of the presence of curled edges in the FGF-treated groups.

### Assessment and spontaneous healing outcomes of traumatic eardrum perforation with bleeding [^116cs53C]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

This study investigated the influence of the degree of bleeding from the remnant eardrum on the spontaneous healing of human traumatic tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs).

Study Design

A case series with chart review.

Setting

A tertiary university hospital.

Materials and Methods

The clinical records of traumatic TMP patients who met the case selection criteria were retrieved and categorized into two groups based on the documented degree of bleeding from the remnant eardrum: with and without bleeding. The demographic data and spontaneous healing outcomes (i.e., healing rate and duration) of these two TMP types were analyzed using the chi-squared test or t-test.

Results

One-hundred and eighty-eight cases met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Of these, 58.5% had perforations without bleeding and the remaining 41.5% had perforations with bleeding. The overall closure rate at the end of the 3-month follow-up period was 90.9% for perforations without bleeding and 96.2% for perforations with bleeding; the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). However, the average closure time differed significantly between the two groups (P < 0.05): 29.4 ± 3.7days for perforations without bleeding and 20.6 ± 9.2days for perforations with bleeding. The closure rate was significantly different between the groups (62 vs. 15.6%, P < 0.01) within 2weeks for medium-sized perforations. In total, 11 (39.3%) large-sized perforations achieved complete closure in the group with bleeding, while none of the large-sized perforations closed in the group without bleeding within 2weeks. The closure rate of medium-sized perforations was not significantly different (79.2 vs. 92%, P > 0.05) between the groups without and with bleeding within 4weeks, while the closure rate of large-sized perforations was significantly different between the groups without and with bleeding (27.2 vs. 75%, P = 0.0).

Conclusion

This study shows that traumatic TMPs with bleeding significantly shortened the closure time compared to TMPs without bleeding. This finding indicates a significant correlation between the prognosis of traumatic TMPs and the degree of eardrum bleeding: severe bleeding from and a hematoma in the remnant eardrum appear to be good signs.

### Surgical management of complications after hearing aid fitting [^111Dhht7]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Standard procedures for hearing aid fitting performed in accordance with established guidelines are well tolerated, safe, and effective. In this article, we present unusual complications after hearing aid fitting that required surgical management.

Methods

Four otologists at a major university center with a combined 65 years of experience performed a retrospective analysis of their surgical practice. Six patients were identified that had encountered severe complications from improper earmold fitting that required surgical intervention.

Results

One patient had a perforation of the tympanic membrane with earmold material found to have migrated into the middle ear cleft. The tympanic membrane healed spontaneously, resulting in persistent otalgia and a maximum air-bone gap. The earmold cast was successfully removed by means of a tympanomastoidectomy. Two patients with presbycusis and normal ear canals developed eardrum perforations and conductive hearing deficits. In both patients, earmold material was found partially occupying the middle ear cleft and removed by way of a transcanal approach. Three patients with prior canal wall down mastoidectomy defects and narrow external ear canals required microtoscopy under general anesthesia or canaloplasty for removal of impacted material.

Conclusion

Proper fitting of hearing aids performed by well-trained medical professionals results in a very low incidence of significant complications. Perforation of the tympanic membrane with impaction of earmold material in the middle ear or mastoid bowl may occur and can be successfully managed by standard otologic surgical techniques.

### Repair of complete tympanic membrane perforations… [^116LJBVC]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

COMPLETE or "pantympanic" perforations denote total loss of the tympanic membrane with the exception of a rim of pars tensa left as a remnant which is actually the annulus of the pars tensa. This perforation usually excludes the pars flaccida of the drum. Initial grafting procedures to perforations of the tympanic membrane were first reported about ten years ago. 1, 2 A significant improvement in results occurred with evolution to the use of external canal skin grafts in the repair of these perforations. 3–5 Additional materials, namely vein or fascia, soon followed the use of canal skin in the evolution of this surgical procedure. 6, 7. The cases reported in this paper are restricted to those persons having complete loss of the tympanic membrane before grafting. The grafting procedure shown uses two tissues, namely vein and canal skin in combination. The use of this combination was first introduced and reported by TABOR JR. Repair of Complete Tympanic Membrane Perforations.

### Myringoplasty… [^111qCJ6k]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Myringoplasty is the procedure of surgically closing a perforation in the eardrum. Myringoplasty is indicated when one desires to accomplish one of two things; to improve the hearing or to seal the middle ear. Diagnostic Survey of the Patient for Myringoplasty. The primary question to be answered by the surgeon in his preoperative evaluation of the patient for myringoplasty is, "Is the perforated tympanic membrane the only defect in the patient's ear mechanism. " He must rule out cholesteatoma or disease in the attic, aditus, or antrum, damage to the ossicular chain, or obstruction of the Eustachian tube. History The patient's history is of primary importance. One must determine the length of time the patient has had a hearing loss, whether or not there has been recent drainage, and whether the patient has any vertigo or pain. Usually the patient who is suitable for myringoplasty has had his perforation for several HOUSE WF. Myringoplasty. AMA Arch Otolaryngol. 1960; 71: 399–404.

### Tympanic membrane regeneration therapy… [^1115VEZM]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

After 1 year of follow-up, 101 patients achieved complete closure, 30 patients had residual pinhole perforations, and 22 patients had larger residual perforations. Minimally invasive ambulatory surgical procedures, using growth factors such as autologous serum eardrops1 and basic fibroblast growth factor, 2–4 have recently been developed in efforts to achieve closure of perforated tympanic membranes. Such approaches are effective even when perforations are large because the regenerative activity of the TM is reduced at the perforation margins. 3 However, preoperative factors affecting therapy outcomes remain controversial. Perforation margin identified on microscopy: patients without markedly curved ear canals such that the entire circumference of the TM perforation margin could be viewed microscopically.

Perforation margin without epithelial migration: patients in whom the perforation margin had not partially migrated to the back of the TM but with no CT evidence of secondary cholesteatoma. The causes of the perforated TM in the 153 patients in whom the duration of perforation was longer than 6 months prior to treatment and who were observed for at least 1 year after treatment included chronic otitis media in 98 patients, traumatic perforation in 13 patients, perforation following myringotomy or tube placement in 19 patients, and reperforation following tympanoplasty in 14 patients. Of the 30 patients with residual pinhole perforations, the mean improvement in hearing was 8. 9 dB, which was not significantly different from that in the complete closure group. During 24 months of postoperative follow-up, pinhole perforations developed a mean of 7. 5 months after the regeneration therapy.

Patients with residual pinhole perforations were observed every 3 to 4 months on an outpatient basis and were advised to undergo a second operation if enlargement of the pinhole perforations and worsening of hearing were observed. At last follow-up, 4 patients with pinhole perforations were found to have progressed to small perforations and had undergone a second session of regeneration therapy. Of the 22 patients with residual perforations, during 21 months of posttreatment follow-up, reperforations developed a mean of 2. 3 months after the regeneration therapy.
