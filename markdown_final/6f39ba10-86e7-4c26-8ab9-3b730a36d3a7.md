## Question

Max dose lunesta women

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a sex-specific maximum dose of eszopiclone (Lunesta) for women and, if so, what it should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dosing and whether any sex-based dose limits are specified. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetic data by sex to see if women have higher exposure that would justify a lower maximum. Next, I will check major guidelines for any sex-specific recommendations. After that, I need to consider indirect evidence from related sedative-hypnotics that do have sex-based dosing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically sound recommendation with safety counseling and monitoring points.

> Let me first confirm the FDA labeling, because that is the most authoritative source for dosing. The FDA prescribing information for Lunesta recommends a starting dose of 1 mg at bedtime, with the option to increase to 2 mg or 3 mg if clinically indicated, and it explicitly states the total dose should not exceed 3 mg once nightly; importantly, there is no sex-specific maximum dose listed in the label, and the pharmacokinetics section notes that exposure in men and women is similar, which argues against a sex-based dose cap for eszopiclone [^117GtNBM] [^114DiEVv].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic claim about sex differences. The FDA clinical pharmacology states that the pharmacokinetics of eszopiclone are similar between men and women, which would not support a lower maximum dose for women on pharmacokinetic grounds alone. This contrasts with zolpidem, where women have higher exposure and a sex-specific lower recommended dose, a distinction that is explicitly made in the zolpidem label and not echoed in the eszopiclone label [^114DiEVv] [^112pMHRT].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure I'm not missing a consensus recommendation. The AASM guideline suggests eszopiclone as a treatment option for adult insomnia without specifying a sex-based dose limit, and the VA/DoD guideline provides practical dosing that lists an initial 1 mg dose with a maximum of 3 mg, again without a sex-specific cap. Notably, the VA/DoD does include a sex-specific starting dose for zolpidem (5 mg for females, 5–10 mg for males), underscoring that when a sex-based difference exists, it is explicitly stated, which is absent for eszopiclone [^112HrsPY] [^115gibaN] [^112pMHRT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should consider indirect signals from the broader sedative-hypnotic class. The FDA mandated a lower initial dose for women with zolpidem due to higher morning blood levels and next-morning impairment risk, but this sex-based adjustment has not been extended to eszopiclone in labeling or major guidelines; moreover, meta-analytic data suggest that while Z-drugs have small average benefits on sleep latency, they also carry risks of cognitive and behavioral adverse effects, reinforcing the principle of using the lowest effective dose and cautioning against unnecessary dose escalation rather than imposing a sex-specific ceiling for eszopiclone [^112pMHRT] [^1117ChMy] [^112AiBos].

> I need to ensure I account for special populations and drug–drug interactions that do warrant dose reductions. The FDA label advises that elderly or debilitated patients, those with severe hepatic impairment, or those taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should not exceed 2 mg, and coadministration with other CNS depressants increases next-day impairment risk; these are the scenarios where a lower maximum applies regardless of sex, and they should guide individualized dosing decisions rather than a blanket sex-based cap [^117GtNBM] [^113WVr58] [^116BaKSZ].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the bottom line. For adult women without geriatric vulnerability, hepatic impairment, or interacting drugs, the maximum recommended dose of eszopiclone is 3 mg once nightly, the same as for men; if any of those risk factors are present, the maximum should be reduced to 2 mg, and in all cases the lowest effective dose should be used with counseling about next-day impairment, complex sleep behaviors, and avoidance of alcohol and other CNS depressants [^117GtNBM] [^11769ipn] [^113WVr58].

> But wait, what if a patient asks why zolpidem has a lower dose for women and eszopiclone does not? I should explain that zolpidem shows higher exposure in women due to its pharmacokinetics, which led regulators to specify a sex-based starting dose, whereas eszopiclone's exposure does not demonstrate a consistent sex difference in the FDA's analysis, so no sex-specific maximum has been established for eszopiclone; this distinction helps prevent overgeneralization from one hypnotic to another [^114DiEVv] [^112pMHRT].

> Finally, I should confirm practical safety steps that apply regardless of sex. Advise taking the dose immediately before bedtime with at least 7–8 hours available before awakening, avoid taking it with or right after a high-fat meal, and counsel on complex sleep behaviors and next-day driving risk, especially at 3 mg. Reassess efficacy and adverse effects regularly and prefer the lowest effective dose, consistent with guideline principles and labeling precautions [^117GtNBM] [^117DWVKV] [^113WVr58].

---

The maximum recommended dose of Lunesta (eszopiclone) for women is **3 mg once nightly** [^117GtNBM], the same as for men, because pharmacokinetics do not differ by sex [^114DiEVv]. Start at 1 mg and titrate to 2–3 mg if needed, but do not exceed 3 mg due to next-day impairment and CNS depressant effects [^113WVr58]. Use the lowest effective dose, avoid use with alcohol or other CNS depressants [^116BaKSZ], and monitor for complex sleep behaviors and next-day impairment [^11769ipn].

---

## Recommended dosing guidelines

- **Initial dose**: 1 mg orally once nightly, immediately before bedtime, with at least 7–8 hours before planned awakening [^117GtNBM].

- **Titration**: If clinically indicated, increase to 2 mg or 3 mg once nightly [^117GtNBM].

- **Maximum dose**: 3 mg once nightly [^117GtNBM].

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

- **Sex differences**: Pharmacokinetics of eszopiclone are similar in men and women; no dose adjustment is needed based on sex [^114DiEVv].

- **Metabolism**: Eszopiclone is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2E1; potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) increase exposure and may require dose reduction to 2 mg [^114DiEVv] [^117GtNBM].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing recommendations

Clinical trials show eszopiclone improves sleep latency and maintenance at 1–3 mg, with **3 mg providing the greatest benefit** but also increasing next-day impairment risk [^1117ChMy] [^113WVr58]. Safety data indicate that adverse effects — somnolence, dizziness, headache, and next-day impairment — are dose-related and more frequent at higher doses [^113WVr58] [^114EJDzD].

---

## Special considerations and precautions

- **Pregnancy**: Use only if clearly needed; limited human data, animal studies show fetal toxicity at high doses [^112sKuEH].

- **Lactation**: Excretion into breast milk is unknown; use caution [^notfound].

- **Elderly patients**: Lower doses may be needed due to increased sensitivity and risk of falls [^1138cY7F].

- **Hepatic impairment**: Maximum dose 2 mg in severe hepatic impairment [^114TatYb].

- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment needed [^111fbQYq].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

- **Common side effects**: Headache, somnolence, dizziness, unpleasant taste, dry mouth, and next-day impairment [^115mEXCb].

- **Serious risks**: Complex sleep behaviors (sleepwalking, sleep-driving), dependence, withdrawal, and anaphylactic reactions [^11769ipn].

- **Overdose**: CNS depression, respiratory depression, and coma; fatalities reported with multi-drug overdoses [^117FzUnt].

---

## Comparison with other hypnotic medications

| **Medication** | **Maximum recommended dose for women** | **Sex-specific dosing considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Eszopiclone (Lunesta) | 3 mg once nightly | No sex-specific adjustment |
| Zolpidem (Ambien) | 5 mg once nightly (immediate-release) | Lower dose recommended for women due to higher exposure |
| Zaleplon (Sonata) | 10 mg once nightly | No sex-specific adjustment |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

AASM guidelines recommend eszopiclone for sleep-onset and maintenance insomnia, using the lowest effective dose and monitoring for adverse effects [^112HrsPY]. VA/DoD guidelines similarly advise starting at 1 mg and titrating to 3 mg if needed, with close monitoring for adverse effects [^112pMHRT].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Maximum dose**: 3 mg once nightly for women [^notfound].

- **Start low**: Begin at 1 mg and titrate based on response and tolerability [^117GtNBM].

- **Monitor**: Watch for next-day impairment, complex sleep behaviors, and adverse effects [^11769ipn].

- **Use lowest effective dose**: Minimize risks of dependence and adverse effects [^117GtNBM].

---

The maximum recommended dose of Lunesta for women is **3 mg once nightly**, with dosing individualized to balance efficacy and safety [^111isPbJ].

### Pharmacologic treatment of insomnia disorder: an evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^112AiBos]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacologic interventions are often prescribed for insomnia disorder.

Purpose

To assess the benefits, harms, and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for adults with insomnia disorder.

Data Sources

Several electronic databases (2004-September 2015), reference lists, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents.

Study Selection

35 randomized, controlled trials of at least 4 weeks' duration that evaluated pharmacotherapies available in the United States and that reported global or sleep outcomes; 11 long-term observational studies that reported harm information; FDA review data for nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics and orexin receptor antagonists; and product labels for all agents.

Data Extraction

Data extraction by single investigator confirmed by a second reviewer; dual-investigator assessment of risk of bias; consensus determination of strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant improved short-term global and sleep outcomes compared with placebo, although absolute effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-strength evidence). Evidence for benzodiazepine hypnotics, melatonin agonists, and antidepressants, and for most pharmacologic interventions in older adults, was insufficient or low strength. Evidence was also insufficient to compare efficacy within or across pharmacotherapy classes or versus behavioral therapy. Harms evidence reported in trials was judged insufficient or low strength; observational studies suggested that use of hypnotics for insomnia was associated with increased risk for dementia, fractures, and major injury. The FDA documents reported that most pharmacotherapies had risks for cognitive and behavioral changes, including driving impairment, and other adverse effects, and they advised dose reduction in women and in older adults.

Limitations

Most trials were small and short term and enrolled individuals meeting stringent criteria. Minimum important differences in outcomes were often not established or reported. Data were scant for many treatments.

Conclusion

Eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant may improve short-term global and sleep outcomes for adults with insomnia disorder, but the comparative effectiveness and long-term efficacy of pharmacotherapies for insomnia are not known. Pharmacotherapies for insomnia may cause cognitive and behavioral changes and may be associated with infrequent but serious harms.

### A user-driven framework for dose selection in Pregnancy: proof of concept for sertraline [^111rN6xt]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Part 1: Dose recommendation

The first FDSP section — previously section 4 in the prototype — outlines the final dose recommendation derived from subsequent analyses. The wording should convey the degree of certainty in available evidence following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines, as endorsed by FDSP reviewers.

Antenatal sertraline dose

Patients should be informed of a possible decrease in the effect of sertraline during pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimester, due to increased sertraline metabolism. If symptoms worsen, a dose increase should be considered.
For women who initiated sertraline use before pregnancy: maintain the pre‐pregnancy dose. If symptoms worsen during pregnancy, a dose increase should be considered, following titration steps for non‐pregnant adults. Doses exceeding 150 mg daily require careful consideration and discussion with the patient.
For women starting sertraline during pregnancy: follow standard guidance for dose selection and titration. The antenatal dose recommendation for women who started sertraline before pregnancy otherwise applies.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19 variants can impact the required sertraline dose. Pharmacogenetic testing should be considered if unexplained side effects or an inadequate response to sertraline are reported during pregnancy, especially in women with a history of such issues for medications metabolized by CYP2C19:
Normal or ultrarapid metabolizers: maintain the pre‐pregnancy dose in prior sertraline users, and adjust as needed based on response and side effects. For new sertraline users, follow guidance for non‐pregnant adults.
Poor metabolizers: the same recommendations apply with a maximum dose of 150 mg daily.

Therapeutic drug monitoring is not routinely advised for sertraline in the Netherlands.

Part 2: Drug selection

This section specifies the indication(s) for which the dose is reviewed, alternative treatments and rationales for selecting the drug for antenatal dose review.

Drug and indications

Sertraline is a commonly prescribed antidepressant in pregnancy in the Netherlands and internationally. Indications include depression and anxiety disorders.

Alternatives

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a second‐line treatment for depression and anxiety disorders. Initial or combined treatment involves non‐pharmacological interventions including psychotherapy. During pregnancy, the relative preference for non‐pharmacological interventions is greater to minimize potential fetal risks.

Rationales for antenatal dose review

Pregnancy‐induced changes in sertraline distribution and metabolism may lower maternal exposure to the drug, potentially impacting treatment efficacy during pregnancy.

### Hypnotics and injuries among older adults with Parkinson's disease: a nested case-control design [^114rH6Vv]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2016, the number of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) worldwide was approximately 6.1 million, and the prevalence increases with age. Patients with PD experience not only motor symptoms, such as tremors and rigid muscles, but also non-motor symptoms, such as sleep disorders, including insomnia, daytime somnolence, and sleep-related movement disorders. These symptoms appear during the early stage of PD, and their frequency increases with disease progression. Clinical practice guidelines for PD in Japan suggest pharmacotherapy, phototherapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of sleep disorders in patients with PD. However, there is currently insufficient evidence on the efficacy of any therapy.

In a previous cross-sectional study in Sweden, patients using antiparkinsonian agents had a significantly higher fall risk (odds ratio [OR]: 1.68) than patients who did not use antiparkinsonian agents when they used hypnotics. Although the results suggested that using both antiparkinsonian agents and hypnotics might increase the risk of falls, the effect of hypnotics among patients with PD was not clear. Hypnotics are classified into barbiturates, benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepines, melatonin receptor agonists, and orexin receptor antagonists. According to the 2019 Beers Criteria published by the American Geriatrics Society, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and non-benzodiazepines should not be administered to older adults. Similarly, the Guidelines for Medical Treatment and Its Safety in the Elderly 2015 published by the Japan Geriatrics Society suggest that benzodiazepines should not be administered to older adults because of potential side effects, whereas non-benzodiazepines may be administered with care in small doses, but they should not be used long-term. Guidelines also report that barbiturates have not been used in recent years. Medical fees are deducted from the standard fee by the Japanese government when multiple psychotropic drugs, including hypnotics, are prescribed or when benzodiazepines are prescribed for more than 1 year. Although there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of eszopiclone for the treatment of insomnia in patients with PD, the Movement Disorder Society suggested that eszopiclone can improve global and sleep outcomes associated with insomnia. However, eszopiclone is associated with infrequent but serious injuries, such as fractures. Therefore, the preference to prescribe this medication depends on the physician. Effectively treating sleep disorders is crucial for improving the quality of life of patients with PD and their caregivers.

### Eszopiclone [^116BaKSZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

CNS Depressants: Additive CNS-depressant effects with combination use. Use with ethanol causes additive psychomotor impairment (7.1)
Rifampicin: Combination use may decrease exposure and effects of eszopiclone (7.2)
Ketoconazole: Combination use increases exposure and effect of eszopiclone. Dose reduction of eszopiclone is needed (7.2)

7.1 CNS Active Drugs

Ethanol: An additive effect on psychomotor performance was seen with coadministration of eszopiclone and ethanol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

Olanzapine: Coadministration of eszopiclone and olanzapine produced a decrease in DSST scores. The interaction was pharmacodynamic; there was no alteration in the pharmacokinetics of either drug.

7.2 Drugs that Inhibit or Induce CYP3A4

Drugs that Inhibit CYP3A4 (Ketoconazole)

CYP3A4 is a major metabolic pathway for elimination of eszopiclone. The exposure of eszopiclone was increased by coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, troleandomycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) would be expected to behave similarly. Dose reduction of eszopiclone is needed for patient co-administered eszopiclone with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Drugs that Induce CYP3A4 (Rifampicin)

Racemic zopiclone exposure was decreased 80% by concomitant use of rifampicin, a potent inducer of CYP3A4. A similar effect would be expected with eszopiclone. Combination use with CYP3A4 inducer may decrease the exposure and effects of eszopiclone.

### Efficacy of recommended drugs against soil transmitted helminths: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1139WYmG]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction and assessment of risk bias

From each eligible randomised controlled trial we extracted number of infected participants at baseline, number of cured participants at follow-up, mean number of eggs at baseline, mean number of eggs at follow-up, percentage of egg reduction, measure of central tendency (arithmetic, geometric, or not described), information on the number of treatment arms, number of eligible treatment arms, year of publication, country, diagnostic method, age range, and time between treatment and follow-up.

Two independent reviewers (WM and JK) screened titles and abstracts for potential studies. When articles met the inclusion criteria, the entire manuscripts were scrutinised, and, for eligible trials, the data were extracted independently by the same reviewers. All included trials were assessed for quality by two different methods: that described by Jadad and colleagues, with scores ranging between 1 (lowest level) and 5 (highest level), and according to the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (table A in appendix 2). The latter criteria assess studies for risk of bias in six different domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting. Each domain is categorised into low, high, or unclear risk of bias. In case of discrepancies over extraction of data or scoring of the study quality, a third person (CS) was involved and the results discussed until consensus was reached.

### Eszopiclone (Lunesta) [^1128HF7o]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein

Eszopiclone is not highly bound to plasma proteins (52–59% bound); therefore, the disposition of eszopiclone is not expected to be sensitive to alterations in protein binding. Administration of eszopiclone 3 mg to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein-bound would not be expected to cause an alteration in the free concentration of either drug.

Safety and efficacy of interventions

Between 1997 and 2000, ten drugs were withdrawn from the US market because of serious side effects; eight posed greater risks for women than for men. The fact that these data date back to over 25 years ago, and we are unaware of updates, typifies the dearth of evidence regarding sex differences in the safety and efficacy of interventions. Randomised controlled trials are typically not designed to assess sex-specific drug effects, neither in terms of efficacy nor safety. Meta-analyses of previous trials have addressed this issue of power to some extent, but issues of limited representativeness and the evaluation of only a selection of outcomes remain. Nevertheless, recent studies using observational data suggest that women might achieve their maximum treatment benefit at a lower drug dosage than men. These sex differences in optimal treatment or treatment intensity could be explained by sex differences in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics, amongst others. For example, given that women generally have a lower bodyweight, higher proportion of body fat, and lower plasma volume, the duration of action of lipophilic (i.e. fat-soluble) drugs may be longer and the peak plasma concentrations of hydrophilic (i.e. water-soluble) drugs may be higher in women. The sedative Ambien is the only drug on the market for which the FDA has different suggested doses based on sex, even though many other drugs are also metabolised differently by men and women.

Provision and utilisation of healthcare services

In general, individuals at high risk of a disease and those with established disease require intensive risk factor control. For CHD, there is overwhelming evidence for the effectiveness of drug therapy and lifestyle modification, and hence such measures are universally recommended in clinical guidelines. However, such evidence is often not sex-specific, which can lead to decisions based on personal beliefs or preferences and variation in treatment between the sexes that is not underpinned by guideline recommendations.

### Elagolix and estradiol and norethisterone (Oriahnn) [^114iS1YQ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

One capsule (elagolix 300 mg, estradiol 1 mg, norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in the morning and one capsule (elagolix 300 mg) in the evening for up to 24 months. (2.1)

2.1 Important Dosing Information

Exclude pregnancy before starting ORIAHNN or start ORIAHNN within 7 days from the onset of menses [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.3)].
The recommended dosage of ORIAHNN is:

○ One elagolix 300 mg, estradiol 1 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg capsule in the morning (AM), and

○ One elagolix 300 mg capsule in the evening (PM).
Take the morning and evening capsules at approximately the same time each day, with or without food.
The recommended duration of treatment with ORIAHNN is 24 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.2 Missed Dose

Instruct the patient to take the missed dose of ORIAHNN within 4 hours of the time that it was supposed to be taken and then the next dose at the usual time. If more than 4 hours have passed since a capsule is usually taken, instruct the patient not to takethe missed dose and take the next dose at the usual time. Take only one morning capsule and one evening capsule per day.

### Review of safety and efficacy of sleep medicines in older adults [^116F41KQ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Insomnia is problematic for older adults. After behavioral modifications fail to show adequate response, pharmacologic options are used. The pharmacokinetics of agents used to treat insomnia may be altered. This review focuses on the safety and efficacy of medications used to treat insomnia.

Methods

A literature search of Medline, PubMed, and Embase was conducted (January 1966-June 2016). It included systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and case series that had an emphasis on insomnia in an older population. Search terms included medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for insomnia: benzodiazepines (triazolam, estazolam, temazepam, flurazepam, and quazepam), nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists (non-BzRAs; zaleplon, zolpidem, and eszopiclone), suvorexant, ramelteon, doxepin and trazodone. Off-label drugs such as other antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics, gabapentin, pramipexole, tiagabine, valerian, and melatonin were also included.

Findings

Cognitive behavioral therapy and sleep hygiene are considered initial therapy for insomnia. Benzodiazepines are discouraged in the geriatric population, especially for long-term use. Although non-BzRAs have improved safety profiles compared with benzodiazepines, their side effects include dementia, serious injury, and fractures, which should limit their use. Ramelteon has a minimal adverse effect profile and is effective for sleep-onset latency and increased total sleep time, making it a valuable first-line option. Although the data on suvorexant are limited, this drug improves sleep maintenance and has mild adverse effects, including somnolence; residual daytime sedation has been reported, however. Sedating low-dose antidepressants should only be used for insomnia when the patient has comorbid depression. Antipsychotic agents, pramipexole, and tiagabine have all been used for insomnia, but none has been extensively studied in an older population, and all have considerable adverse effects. Gabapentin may be useful in patients with restless leg syndrome or chronic neuropathic pain and insomnia. Diphenhydramine should be avoided in the elderly. Valerian and melatonin are unregulated products that have a small impact on sleep latency and can produce residual sedation.

Implications

An ideal treatment for insomnia should help to improve sleep latency and sleep duration with limited awakenings and be without significant adverse effects such as daytime somnolence or decreased alertness. Cognitive behavioral therapy should always be first line treatment. Clinical inertia regarding previous prominent use of benzodiazepines and non-BzRAs will be a significant challenge for patients accustomed to their issuance. The future direction of insomnia treatment should have an emphasis on nonpharmacologic interventions, treating comorbid conditions, and focusing therapy on using benzodiazepines and non-BzRAs as last resorts.

Methods

Recent studies, abstracts, reviews, and consensus statements published in English were identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-December 2005), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 December 2005), and PharmaProjects (1990-December 2005) using the search terms eszopiclone, cyclopyrrolone, insomnia, nonbenzodiazepine, and zopiclone enantiomer. Selected information provided by the manufacturer of eszopiclone was included, as were all pertinent clinical trials.

Results

Eszopiclone is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with Tmax achieved within approximately 1 hour and a terminal-phase elimination half-life of approximately 6 hours. Approximately 52% to 59% of a dose is weakly bound to plasma protein. Eszopiclone is extensively metabolized by oxidation and demethylation. In vitro studies have indicated that the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 are involved in the biotransformation of eszopiclone; therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit these CYP isozymes may affect the metabolism of eszopiclone. Eszopiclone is excreted in the urine as racemic zopiclone at < 10% of the orally administered dose. Six Phase III clinical trials were identified that evaluated the safety profile and efficacy of eszopiclone, 1 in healthy subjects with transient insomnia and 5 in patients with primary chronic insomnia (3 in younger adults and 2 in the elderly). In the trials in younger adults, eszopiclone significantly improved sleep efficiency, sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, number of awakenings, number of nights awakened weekly, total sleep time, and quality and depth of sleep compared with placebo (P < 0.05). In the trials in elderly patients, who received eszopiclone 2 mg or placebo for 2 weeks, eszopiclone was associated with significantly shorter sleep latency compared with placebo (P < 0.004), as well as a significant decrease in the cumulative number of naps (P < 0.05). The most commonly reported drug-related, dose-responsive adverse event in clinical trials of eszopiclone 2 and 3 mg was bitter taste (17% and 34%, respectively), followed by dizziness (5% and 7%) and dry mouth (5% and 7%). Somnolence occurred at an incidence of 4% to 9% with both doses. Tolerance or rebound insomnia was not reported.

Conclusions

Eszopiclone represents an effective and well-tolerated option for the treatment of insomnia. In the absence of published studies comparing eszopiclone with similar hypnotic agents (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon, zopiclone), it is not yet possible to evaluate its efficacy relative to other agents used for insomnia.

### Eszopiclone [^116PpQ7P]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Paroxetine: Coadministration of single dose of eszopiclone and paroxetine produced no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose administration does not predict the complete absence of a pharmacodynamic effect following chronic administration.

Lorazepam: Coadministration of single doses of eszopiclone and lorazepam did not have clinically relevant effects on the pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics of either drug. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose administration does not predict the complete absence of a pharmacodynamic effect following chronic administration.

Drugs with a Narrow Therapeutic Index Digoxin: A single dose of eszopiclone 3 mg did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin measured at steady state following dosing of 0.5 mg twice daily for one day and 0.25 mg daily for the next 6 days.

Warfarin: Eszopiclone 3 mg administered daily for 5 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of (R)- or (S)-warfarin, nor were there any changes in the pharmacodynamic profile (prothrombin time) following a single 25 mg oral dose of warfarin.

Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein

Eszopiclone is not highly bound to plasma proteins (52 to 59% bound); therefore, the disposition of eszopiclone is not expected to be sensitive to alterations in protein binding. Administration of eszopiclone 3 mg to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein-bound would not be expected to cause an alteration in the free concentration of either drug.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Use the lowest effective dose for the patient.

Use the lowest dose effective for the patient (2)
Recommended initial dose is 1 mg, immediately before bedtime, with at least 7–8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening. May increase dose if clinically indicated, to a maximum of 3 mg (2.1)
Geriatric or debilitated patients: Dose should not exceed 2 mg (2.2)
Patients with severe hepatic impairment, or taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: Dose should not exceed 2 mg (2.3)
Do not take with or immediately after a meal (2.5)

2.1 Dosage in Adults

The recommended starting dose is 1 mg. Dosing can be raised to 2 mg or 3 mg if clinically indicated. In some patients, the higher morning blood levels of LUNESTA following use of the 2 mg or 3 mg dose increase the risk of next day impairment of driving and other activities that require full alertness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The total dose of LUNESTA should not exceed 3 mg, once daily immediately before bedtime [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

2.2 Geriatric or Debilitated Patients

The total dose of LUNESTA should not exceed 2 mg in elderly or debilitated patients.

2.3 Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment, or Taking Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors

In patients with severe hepatic impairment, or in patients coadministered LUNESTA with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, the total dose of LUNESTA should not exceed 2 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

2.4 Use with CNS Depressants

Dosage adjustments may be necessary when LUNESTA is combined with other central nervous system (CNS) depressant drugs because of the potentially additive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.5 Administration with Food

Taking LUNESTA with or immediately after a heavy, high-fat meal results in slower absorption and would be expected to reduce the effect of LUNESTA on sleep latency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Elimination

After oral administration, eszopiclone is eliminated with a mean t1/2of approximately 6 hours. Up to 75% of an oral dose of racemic zopiclone is excreted in the urine, primarily as metabolites. A similar excretion profile would be expected for eszopiclone, the S-isomer of racemic zopiclone. Less than 10% of the orally administered eszopiclone dose is excreted in the urine as parent drug.

Effect of Food

In healthy adults, administration of a 3 mg dose of eszopiclone after a high-fat meal resulted in no change in AUC, a reduction in mean Cmaxof 21%, and delayed tmaxby approximately 1 hour. The half-life remained unchanged, approximately 6 hours. The effects of eszopiclone on sleep onset may be reduced if it is taken with or immediately after a high-fat/heavy meal.

Specific Populations Age

Compared with nonelderly adults, subjects 65 years and older had an increase of 41% in total exposure (AUC) and a slightly prolonged elimination of eszopiclone (t1/2approximately 9 hours). Cmaxwas unchanged. Therefore, in elderly patients the dose should not exceed 2 mg.

### Eszopiclone [^111Mi9fn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When eszopiclone (doses from 1 to 50 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to young dogs from weaning through sexual maturity, neurotoxicity (convulsions) was observed at doses ≥ 5 mg/kg/day. Hepatotoxicity (elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular vacuolation and degeneration) and reproductive toxicity (adverse effects on male reproductive organ weights and histopathology) were noted at doses ≥ 10 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose (1 mg/kg) was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) to eszopiclone and (S)-DMZ approximately 3 and 2 times, respectively, plasma exposures in humans at the MRHD in adults.

8.5 Geriatric Use

A total of 287 subjects in double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trials who received eszopiclone were 65 to 86 years of age. The overall pattern of adverse events for elderly subjects (median age = 71 years) in 2-week studies with nighttime dosing of 2 mg eszopiclone was not different from that seen in younger adults [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Eszopiclone 2 mg exhibited significant reduction in sleep latency and improvement in sleep maintenance in the elderly population. Compared with nonelderly adults, subjects 65 years and older had longer elimination and higher total exposure to eszopiclone. Therefore, dose reduction is recommended in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. Exposure was increased in severely impaired patients compared with healthy volunteers. The dose of eszopiclone should not exceed 2 mg in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Eszopiclone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Inform patients and their families about the benefits and risks of treatment with LUNESTA. Inform patients of the availability of a Medication Guide and instruct them to read the Medication Guide prior to initiating treatment with LUNESTA and with each prescription refill. Review the LUNESTA Medication Guide with every patient prior to initiation of treatment. Instruct patients or caregivers that LUNESTA should be taken only as prescribed.

Complex Sleep Behaviors

Instruct patients and their families that LUNESTA may cause complex sleep behaviors, including sleep-walking, sleep-driving, preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex while not being fully awake. Serious injuries and death have occurred during complex sleep behavior episodes. Tell patients to discontinue LUNESTA and notify their healthcare provider immediately if they develop any of these symptoms [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

CNS Depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment

Tell patients that LUNESTA can cause next-day impairment even when used as prescribed, and that this risk is increased if dosing instructions are not carefully followed. Caution patients taking the 3 mg dose against driving and other activities requiring complete mental alertness the day after use. Inform patients that impairment can be present despite feeling fully awake. Advise patients that increased drowsiness and decreased consciousness may increase the risk of falls in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions

Inform patients that severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have occurred with eszopiclone. Describe the signs/symptoms of these reactions and advise patients to seek medical attention immediately if any of them occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Alcohol and Other Drugs

Ask patients about alcohol consumption, medicines they are taking, and drugs they may be taking without a prescription. Advise patients not to use LUNESTA if they drank alcohol that evening or before bed.

Tolerance, Abuse, and Dependence

Tell patients not to increase the dose of LUNESTA on their own, and to inform you if they believe the drug "does not work".

### Effectiveness of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics in treatment of adult insomnia: meta-analysis of data submitted to the food and drug administration [^113zijyx]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data source

For this systematic review we adhered to PRISMA guidelines. We obtained data on all currently approved (non-benzodiazepine) Z drugs: eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem from the FDA website (see appendix 1).

Study selection

The criteria for inclusion were randomised double blind controlled trials, recruitment of adults with primary insomnia (transient or chronic), an intervention comparing a Z drug with a placebo control, submission to the FDA before approval, sponsored by the manufacturer, and studies from any country or reported in any language (although we found only reports in English). Studies were excluded if they were crossover designs, included healthy patients with normal sleep, were single night studies with induced insomnia, or did not report any inference test or enough descriptive information (for instance, percentages or means and a variability measure for both groups and/or both time measures) as included studies were too heterogeneous and not large enough to estimate the missing information to calculate an effect size. We excluded crossover trials because of problems associated with reactivity, learning, carry over effects, and failure of blinding. Blinding failure is more likely with crossover studies, leading to an enhanced placebo effect in the drug treatment arm, thereby increasing the likelihood of a false positive (type I) error. We did not include post-approval trials in our analysis because it is not possible to obtain access to all unpublished data for those trials.

Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) include desvenlafaxine 100–150 mg/d (start with 25–50 mg/d and titrate up by that amount each day) and venlafaxine 37.5–150 mg/d (start with 37.5 mg/d). Gabapentinoids: gabapentin 900–2,400 mg/d (start with 100–300 mg at night, then add 300 mg at night, then a separate dose of 300 mg in the morning; start 100 mg if concerned about sensitivity). Neurokinin B antagonists: fezolinetant 45 mg/d (single dose, no titration needed).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^1123XTC7]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea — safety and implementation considerations for non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists: Patient preferences for pharmacologic assistance should be considered in light of potential risks such as dependency and other adverse effects, especially in older adults, and literature discusses the potential risk of abuse, dependence, motor vehicle accidents, falls in older adults, and diversion. For service members on active-duty, or for those with a commercial driver's license, limitations in duties and temporary medical profiles may need to be implemented if a sedative hypnotic medication is prescribed. In April 2019, the FDA released a safety announcement advising healthcare professionals of the risk of serious injuries or deaths caused by sleep behaviors including sleepwalking, sleep driving, and engaging in other activities while not fully awake associated with the non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists, including eszopiclone. Although these injuries are rare, they have occurred in patients with and without a history of such behaviors, even at the lowest recommended doses, and even after taking one dose. To minimize the incidence of adverse events, a non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist, if prescribed, should be at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration possible, and all patients offered non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists should be counseled on these potential risks.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available pharmacovigilance data with eszopiclone use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits throughout organogenesis, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Administration of eszopiclone to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in offspring toxicities at all doses tested; the lowest dose was approximately 200 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3 mg/day based on mg/m2body surface area (See Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Data Animal Data

Oral administration of eszopiclone to pregnant rats (62.5, 125, or 250 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (4, 8, or 16 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis showed no evidence of teratogenicity up to the highest doses tested. In rats, reduced fetal weight and increased incidences of skeletal variations and/or delayed ossification were observed at the mid and high doses. The no-observed-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development is 200 times the MRHD of 3 mg/day on a mg/m2basis. No effects on embryofetal development were observed in rabbits; the highest dose tested is approximately 100 times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis.

Oral administration of eszopiclone (60, 120, or 180 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats throughout the pregnancy and lactation resulted in increased post-implantation loss, decreased postnatal pup weights and survival, and increased pup startle response at all doses. The lowest dose tested is approximately 200 times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis. Eszopiclone had no effects on other developmental measures or reproductive function in the offspring.

### Safety, pharmacokinetics, and mosquito-lethal effects of ivermectin in combination with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and primaquine in healthy adult Thai subjects [^1161hNAD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

All drugs were well tolerated. The only apparent safety concern was a presumed drug–drug interaction in a 40‐year‐old female subject, which occurred on both occasions when ivermectin was co‐administered with dihydroartemisinin‐piperaquine. Her AST and ALT levels rose quickly postdose but returned to normal within 10 days (Figure 1) without a concomitant rise in bilirubin (i.e. no violation of Hy's Law) and without symptoms. Further investigation revealed no alternative cause for these increases in liver enzymes, and the ivermectin and piperaquine concentrations were not elevated compared with other volunteers.

Piperaquine has been rarely associated with liver injury. A multicountry study in Africa with dihydroartemisinin‐piperaquine treatment of > 10,000 malaria‐infected patients found elevated levels of AST and ALT (> 2 × ULN) on day 7, in 19 and 13 patients, respectively. 26 It is unclear whether those elevations were related to malaria or to its treatment. One case of mild hepatitis was linked to dihydroartemisinin‐piperaquine in a P. falciparum ‐infected patient. 27 There are some reports of hepatotoxicity associated with ivermectin. A previous trial reported an increased ALT and gamma‐glutamyl transferase, possibly linked to ivermectin, in a 37‐year‐old woman with cholelithiasis after ivermectin treatment with a dose of 2 mg/kg, which is five times higher than doses used in this trial. 28 Minor increases in AST and ALT were observed in three elderly Japanese patients when treated with ivermectin (200 µg/kg twice 1 week apart) for scabies who were also on zopiclone, amlopidine, lansoprazole, zolpidem, and rabeprazole. 29 There are two reports of ivermectin alone inducing liver damage, resulting in hepatitis in a 20‐year‐old female with Loa loa 30 and prolonged liver dysfunction in an 85‐year‐old man with scabies. 31 In a previously published trial, 3 of 90 patients with falciparum who received ivermectin (300 or 600 µg/kg) and dihydroartemisinin‐piperaquine for 3 consecutive days had elevated AST and/or ALT values (grade 3). Two patients had grade 1 levels and one patient had grade 3 levels at enrollment. 25 The findings of increased AST and ALT following ivermectin and dihydroartemisinin‐piperaquine in the current and previous 25 trials warrant further investigation.

### Eszopiclone [^114DiEVv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Gender

The pharmacokinetics of eszopiclone in men and women are similar.

Race

In an analysis of data on all subjects participating in Phase 1 studies of eszopiclone, the pharmacokinetics for all races studied appeared similar.

Hepatic Impairment

Pharmacokinetics of a 2 mg eszopiclone dose were assessed in 16 healthy volunteers and in 8 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe liver disease. Exposure was increased 2-fold in severely impaired patients compared with the healthy volunteers. Cmaxand tmaxwere unchanged. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. Dose reduction is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment. Eszopiclone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Renal Impairment

The pharmacokinetics of eszopiclone were studied in 24 patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. AUC and Cmaxwere similar in the patients compared with demographically matched healthy control subjects. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment, since less than 10% of the orally administered eszopiclone dose is excreted in the urine as parent drug.

Drug Interactions

Eszopiclone is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 via demethylation and oxidation. There were no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions between eszopiclone and paroxetine. When eszopiclone was coadministered with olanzapine, no pharmacokinetic interaction was detected in levels of eszopiclone or olanzapine, but a pharmacodynamic interaction was seen on a measure of psychomotor function. Eszopiclone and lorazepam decreased each other's Cmaxby 22%. Coadministration of eszopiclone 3 mg to subjects receiving ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, 400 mg daily for 5 days, resulted in a 2.2-fold increase in exposure to eszopiclone. Cmaxand t1/2were increased 1.4-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively. Eszopiclone would not be expected to alter the clearance of drugs metabolized by common CYP450 enzymes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Eszopiclone (Lunesta) [^113P7pXE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When eszopiclone (doses from 1 to 50 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to young dogs from weaning through sexual maturity, neurotoxicity (convulsions) was observed at doses ≥ 5 mg/kg/day. Hepatotoxicity (elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular vacuolation and degeneration) and reproductive toxicity (adverse effects on male reproductive organ weights and histopathology) were noted at doses ≥ 10 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose (1 mg/kg) was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) to eszopiclone and (S)-DMZ approximately 3 and 2 times, respectively, plasma exposures in humans at the MRHD in adults.

8.5 Geriatric Use

A total of 287 subjects in double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trials who received eszopiclone were 65 to 86 years of age. The overall pattern of adverse events for elderly subjects (median age = 71 years) in 2-week studies with nighttime dosing of 2 mg eszopiclone was not different from that seen in younger adults [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. LUNESTA 2 mg exhibited significant reduction in sleep latency and improvement in sleep maintenance in the elderly population. Compared with nonelderly adults, subjects 65 years and older had longer elimination and higher total exposure to eszopiclone. Therefore, dose reduction is recommended in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. Exposure was increased in severely impaired patients compared with healthy volunteers. The dose of LUNESTA should not exceed 2 mg in patients with severe hepatic impairment. LUNESTA should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.7 Timing of Drug Administration

LUNESTA should be taken immediately before bedtime. Taking a sedative/hypnotic while still up and about may result in short-term memory impairment, hallucinations, impaired coordination, dizziness, and lightheadedness.

5.8 Special Populations

Use in Elderly and/or Debilitated Patients

Impaired motor and/or cognitive performance after repeated exposure or unusual sensitivity to sedative/hypnotic drugs is a concern in the treatment of elderly and/or debilitated patients. The dose should not exceed 2 mg in elderly or debilitated patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness

Clinical experience with eszopiclone in patients with concomitant illness is limited. Eszopiclone should be used with caution in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses.

A study in healthy volunteers did not reveal respiratory-depressant effects at doses 2.5-fold higher (7 mg) than the recommended dose of eszopiclone. Caution is advised, however, if LUNESTA is prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function.

The dose of LUNESTA should not exceed 2 mg in patients with severe hepatic impairment, because systemic exposure is doubled in such subjects. No dose adjustment appears necessary for subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment appears necessary in subjects with any degree of renal impairment, since less than 10% of eszopiclone is excreted unchanged in the urine.

The dose of LUNESTA should be reduced in patients who are administered potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, while taking LUNESTA. Downward dose adjustment is also recommended when LUNESTA is administered with agents having known CNS-depressant effects.

Use in Patients with Depression

In primarily depressed patients treated with sedative-hypnotics, worsening of depression, including suicidal thoughts and actions (including completed suicides), have been reported in association with the use of sedative/hypnotics.

Sedative/hypnotic drugs should be administered with caution to patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of depression. Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients, and protective measures may be required. Intentional overdose is more common in this group of patients; therefore, the least amount of drug that is feasible should be prescribed for the patient at any one time.

Elimination

After oral administration, eszopiclone is eliminated with a mean t1/2of approximately 6 hours. Up to 75% of an oral dose of racemic zopiclone is excreted in the urine, primarily as metabolites. A similar excretion profile would be expected for eszopiclone, the S-isomer of racemic zopiclone. Less than 10% of the orally administered eszopiclone dose is excreted in the urine as parent drug.

Effect of Food

In healthy adults, administration of a 3 mg dose of eszopiclone after a high-fat meal resulted in no change in AUC, a reduction in mean Cmaxof 21%, and delayed tmaxby approximately 1 hour. The half-life remained unchanged, approximately 6 hours. The effects of LUNESTA on sleep onset may be reduced if it is taken with or immediately after a high-fat/heavy meal.

Specific Populations

Age

Compared with nonelderly adults, subjects 65 years and older had an increase of 41% in total exposure (AUC) and a slightly prolonged elimination of eszopiclone (t1/2approximately 9 hours). Cmaxwas unchanged. Therefore, in elderly patients the dose should not exceed 2 mg.

10 OVERDOSAGE

In clinical trials with eszopiclone, one case of overdose with up to 36 mg of eszopiclone was reported in which the subject fully recovered. Since commercial marketing began, spontaneous cases of eszopiclone overdoses up to 270 mg (90 times the maximum recommended dose of eszopiclone) have been reported, in which patients have recovered. Fatalities related to LUNESTA overdoses were reported only in combination with other CNS drugs or alcohol.

10.1 Signs and Symptoms

Signs and symptoms of overdose effects of CNS depressants can be expected to present as exaggerations of the pharmacological effects noted in preclinical testing. Impairment of consciousness ranging from somnolence to coma has been described. Rare individual instances of fatal outcomes following overdose with racemic zopiclone have been reported in European postmarketing reports, most often associated with overdose with other CNS-depressant agents. Methemoglobinemia in association with overdoses of racemic zopiclone has been reported.

10.2 Recommended Treatment

General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate. Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed. Flumazenil may be useful. As in all cases of drug overdose, respiration, pulse, blood pressure, and other appropriate signs should be monitored and general supportive measures employed. Hypotension and CNS depression should be monitored and treated by appropriate medical intervention. Consider monitoring methemoglobin in the setting of high-dose overdosage. The value of dialysis in the treatment of overdosage has not been determined.

As with the management of all overdosage, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. The physician may wish to consider contacting a poison control center for up-to-date information on the management of hypnotic drug product overdosage.

### Hypnotics and injuries among older adults with Parkinson's disease: a nested case-control design [^111XLFku]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Orexin receptor antagonists are considered to be as safe as melatonin receptor agonists. A previous study in older adults showed that suvorexant, an orexin receptor antagonist, is associated with a lower risk of falls than placebo; however, somnolence was more common with suvorexant than with placebo. Another previous study demonstrated that lemborexant, another orexin receptor antagonist that was approved in Japan in 2020, significantly lowered the risk of falls. In contrast, we found that orexin receptor antagonists did not increase the risk of injuries. However, few studies have evaluated the adverse events of orexin receptor antagonists; therefore, further studies are required.

A large proportion of patients in our study were prescribed benzodiazepines, which significantly increased the risk of injuries. However, current guidelines advise that benzodiazepines should be avoided in older adults. Moreover, medical fees in Japan are deducted from the standard when multiple psychotropic drugs, including hypnotics, are prescribed or when benzodiazepines are prescribed for more than 1 year. Chronic benzodiazepine use is associated with a significantly greater risk of fractures than intermittent benzodiazepine use. We observed a similar trend, where the risk of injuries increased with the increase in the number of benzodiazepines prescribed per day, although the risk of fractures was not significantly different. Therefore, patients who are at a low risk of experiencing adverse events induced by hypnotics may be prescribed benzodiazepines. Taken together, although the risk of milder injuries may be significantly higher with benzodiazepine use, the risk of fractures, which considerably impact activities of daily living, was not significantly increased by benzodiazepines. To adhere to guidelines and minimize adverse events, including injuries, it is crucial to determine the reasons for prescribing benzodiazepines. Although similar to benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepines are discouraged in older adults because of the risk of falls and fractures; however, we did not observe significant differences in outcomes. Eszopiclone for the treatment of insomnia in patients with PD showed a similar safety profile to that of placebo, although the number of patients prescribed this drug was only 15. We showed a similar result; therefore, we suggest that non-benzodiazepines may be prescribed following an assessment of the risk of adverse events by a physician and informing patients and their families of these risks. Previous studies have found that hypnotics increase the risk of pneumonia, except for pneumonia caused by viruses, as well as the risk of cognitive and physical impairment due to trauma and pressure ulcers. Therefore, assessing the risk of such adverse events is crucial when prescribing hypnotics.

### Insomnia: pharmacologic therapy [^116KiadC]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Insomnia accounts for more than 5.5 million visits to family physicians each year. Although behavioral interventions are the mainstay of treatment, pharmacologic therapy may be necessary for some patients. Understanding the risks and benefits of insomnia medications is critical. Controlled-release melatonin and doxepin are recommended as first-line agents in older adults; the so-called z-drugs (zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon) should be reserved for use if the first-line agents are ineffective. For the general population with difficulty falling asleep, controlled-release melatonin and the z-drugs can be considered. For those who have difficulty staying asleep, low-dose doxepin and the z-drugs should be considered. Benzodiazepines are not recommended because of their high abuse potential and the availability of better alternatives. Although the orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant appears to be relatively effective, it is no more effective than the z-drugs and much more expensive. Sedating antihistamines, antiepileptics, and atypical antipsychotics are not recommended unless they are used primarily to treat another condition. Persons with sleep apnea or chronic lung disease with nocturnal hypoxia should be evaluated by a sleep specialist before sedating medications are prescribed.

### Eszopiclone (Lunesta) [^116E2PmS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9.1 Controlled Substance

LUNESTA is a Schedule IV controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. Other substances under the same classification are benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics zaleplon and zolpidem. While eszopiclone is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, it shares some of the pharmacologic properties of the benzodiazepines.

9.2 Abuse

Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug and/or administration of an antagonist. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug's effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects.

Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.

In a study of abuse liability conducted in individuals with known histories of benzodiazepine abuse, eszopiclone at doses of 6 and 12 mg produced euphoric effects similar to those of diazepam 20 mg. In this study, at doses 2-fold or greater than the maximum recommended doses, a dose-related increase in reports of amnesia and hallucinations was observed for both LUNESTA and diazepam.

### Effectiveness of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics in treatment of adult insomnia: meta-analysis of data submitted to the food and drug administration [^1117ChMy]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objectives To investigate the effectiveness of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (Z drugs) and associated placebo responses in adults and to evaluate potential moderators of effectiveness in a dataset used to approve these drugs.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data source US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Study selection Randomised double blind parallel placebo controlled trials of currently approved Z drugs (eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem).

Data extraction Change score from baseline to post-test for drug and placebo groups; drug efficacy analysed as the difference of both change scores. Weighted raw and standardised mean differences with their confidence intervals under random effects assumptions for polysomnographic and subjective sleep latency, as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included waking after sleep onset, number of awakenings, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep quality. Weighted least square regression analysis was used to explain heterogeneity of drug effects.

Data synthesis 13 studies containing 65 separate drug-placebo comparisons by type of outcome, type of drug, and dose were included. Studies included 4378 participants from different countries and varying drug doses, lengths of treatment, and study years. Z drugs showed significant, albeit small, improvements (reductions) in our primary outcomes: polysomnographic sleep latency (weighted standardised mean difference, 95% confidence interval −0.57 to −0.16) and subjective sleep latency (−0.33, −0.62 to −0.04) compared with placebo. Analyses of weighted mean raw differences showed that Z drugs decreased polysomnographic sleep latency by 22 minutes (−33 to −11 minutes) compared with placebo. Although no significant effects were found in secondary outcomes, there were insufficient studies reporting these outcomes to allow firm conclusions. Moderator analyses indicated that sleep latency was more likely to be reduced in studies published earlier, with larger drug doses, with longer duration of treatment, with a greater proportion of younger and/or female patients, and with zolpidem.

Conclusion Compared with placebo, Z drugs produce slight improvements in subjective and polysomnographic sleep latency, especially with larger doses and regardless of type of drug. Although the drug effect and the placebo response were rather small and of questionable clinical importance, the two together produced to a reasonably large clinical response.

### Efficacy and safety of albendazole in hookworm-infected preschool-aged children, school-aged children, and adults in Côte D'ivoire: a phase 2 randomized, controlled dose-finding trial [^115hsUov]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design, Area, and Population

A phase 2, parallel, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in 21 villages surrounding the town of Rubino in southeastern Côte d'Ivoire from 5 January 2019 to 17 April 2019. PSAC aged 2–5 years, SAC aged 6–12 years, and adults aged ≥ 21 years were invited to participate in the trial.

Ethical Considerations

Ethical permission from the Comité National d'Éthique des Sciences de la Vie et de la Santé in Côte d'Ivoire was issued on 3 July 2018, while the Northwestern and Central Switzerland Ethics Committee provided ethical clearance on 20 July 2018. Written informed consent was obtained from adult participants and from the parents/guardians of participating children after they had attended a community-wide information meeting. Additionally, SAC provided written consent.

Eligibility Criteria

Participants were eligible for the trial if they were willing to provide informed consent and two stool samples. Only participants with hookworm infection intensity of ≥ 24 eggs per gram (EPG) of stool were included. Those with acute or uncontrolled systemic illness (eg, severe anemia defined as hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL, infection, clinical malaria with fever) as assessed by a medical doctor, those who had received anthelmintics within the previous four weeks, those with allergies to benzimidazoles, and women who were pregnant or breastfeeding were excluded.

Randomization and Treatment

A computer-generated, stratified block randomization code was generated by the trial statistician who was not involved in participation recruitment, treatment administration, or outcome assessment. The randomization list with varying blocks of three and six for PSAC or five and ten for SAC and adults was stratified by baseline hookworm infection intensity (either light or moderate/heavy) per WHO guidelines. After a lengthy period of recruitment, it was decided to eliminate the placebo group for the PSAC cohort. PSAC were randomized 1:1:1 to albendazole at 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg. SAC and adults were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to albendazole at 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, or 800 mg or placebo. Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. Participants were potentially aware of the treatment arm that they were assigned due to the different number of tablets provided by unblinded study investigators.

### Hormone therapy in postmenopausal women and risk of endometrial hyperplasia [^114j5jMk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Reduced circulating estrogen levels around the time of the menopause can induce unacceptable symptoms that affect the health and well-being of women. Hormone therapy (both unopposed estrogen and estrogen/progestogen combinations) is an effective treatment for these symptoms, but is associated with risk of harms. Guidelines recommend that hormone therapy be given at the lowest effective dose and treatment should be reviewed regularly. The aim of this review is to identify the minimum dose(s) of progestogen required to be added to estrogen so that the rate of endometrial hyperplasia is not increased compared to placebo.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to assess which hormone therapy regimens provide effective protection against the development of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched January 2012), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2012), EMBASE (1980 to January 2012), Current Contents (1993 to May 2008), Biological Abstracts (1969 to 2008), Social Sciences Index (1980 to May 2008), PsycINFO (1972 to January 2012) and CINAHL (1982 to May 2008). Attempts were made to identify trials from citation lists of reviews and studies retrieved, and drug companies were contacted for unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of unopposed estrogen therapy, combined continuous estrogen-progestogen therapy, sequential estrogen-progestogen therapy with each other or placebo, administered over a minimum period of 12 months. Incidence of endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma assessed by a biopsy at the end of treatment was a required outcome. Data on adherence to therapy, rates of additional interventions, and withdrawals owing to adverse events were also extracted.

Data Collection and Analysis

In this update, 46 studies were included. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. The small numbers of studies in each comparison and the clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis for many outcomes.

Main Results

Unopposed estrogen is associated with increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia at all doses, and durations of therapy between one and three years. For women with a uterus the risk of endometrial hyperplasia with hormone therapy comprising low-dose estrogen continuously combined with a minimum of 1 mg norethisterone acetate (NETA) or 1.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is not significantly different from placebo at two years (1 mg NETA: OR 0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0 to 2.8; 1.5 mg MPA: no hyperplasia events).

Authors' Conclusions

Hormone therapy for postmenopausal women with an intact uterus should comprise both estrogen and progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^112XBzDj]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Estradiol concentration: low and high levels

Low (subtherapeutic) estradiol levels were defined clinically as < 200 pmol/L. - In the whole cohort (N = 1,508), 378 women (25.07%) had low levels. Two hundred ninety-six of 933 women (31.73%) using licensed doses (1–4 PE) had estradiol levels of < 200 pmol/L, including 116 of 467 women (24.84%) using the highest licensed dose (4 PE), compared with 82 of 562 women (14.59%) using off-label doses (Fig. 3, Supplemental Table 7).

FIG. 3
The percentage of women with low estradiol levels (< 200 pmol/L) in each dose category. Dose (number of pump equivalents, PE) was treated as a categorical variable. The number of women with low or subtherapeutic levels (< 200 pmol/L) decreases as the dose increases, but up to 1 in four women using the maximum licensed dose (4 PE) have low levels, and around 1 in 6 women using high off-label doses (5–8 PE) have low levels.

### Meta-analyses of hypnotics and infections: eszopiclone, ramelteon, zaleplon, and zolpidem [^115MDZdy]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Recent meta-analyses raising concern about risks of hypnotics suggest a need for more clarification of these risks.

Methods

Because of preliminary suggestions that eszopiclone causes infections, we studied US Food and Drug Administration files on the 4 most-recently approved hypnotics, combined with published studies, to compile the risk ratios of infections for groups randomly assigned to receive hypnotics versus those assigned to receive placebos in controlled trials. Parallel controlled clinical trials of eszopiclone, ramelteon, zaleplon, and zolpidem were included when data on subjects, duration of exposure, and adverse effects were available. Results of trials were combined by meta-analyses.

Results

Of 8828 participants assigned to the 4 hypnotics and 4383 participants who randomly received placebos, 606 in the hypnotics groups and 200 in the placebo groups were reported to develop some kind of infection (risk ratio = 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.25–1.64, p < 0.00001). Most infections were apparently mild and did not lead to dropouts. Subanalyses for individual drugs indicated that eszopiclone and zolpidem individually were associated with reported infections. There were insufficient data concerning individual studies of zaleplon and ramelteon for valid secondary meta-analyses of zaleplon or ramelteon by themselves.

Conclusions

Research is needed to objectively determine whether the use of hypnotics increases the risk of infections. Immune compromise or esophageal reflux and aspiration should be studied as possible mechanisms.

### The NK3 receptor antagonist ESN364 suppresses sex hormones in men and women [^112R7D5j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Women's health disorders are commonly treated by agents that suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. NK3 receptor antagonism modulates this axis with distinct pharmacology compared to existing therapies.

Objective

The study aim was to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics on gonadotropins and sex hormones after single- and multiple-dose administration of an NK3R antagonist to healthy men and women.

Design and Setting

This was a first-in-human, double-blind, placebo-controlled, combined single and multiple ascending dose trial.

Participants

Forty-one men and 24 regularly cycling women participated in the study.

Intervention(S)

In part 1 of the study, men received single oral doses of 3–180 mg or placebo. In part 2, men received placebo or 20, 60, or 180 mg each day for 10 days. In part 3, women received placebo or 20, 60, or 180 mg each day for 21 days, where dosing was initiated on day 3 ± 2 after menses.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics on circulating levels of LH, FSH, testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone, in addition to physiological biomarkers of endometrial thickening, follicle growth, and the duration of the menstrual cycle were evaluated.

Results

ESN364 was well-tolerated and rapidly bioavailable with linear pharmacokinetics and no drug accumulation with repeated, daily oral administration. Drug treatment dose-dependently decreased basal LH, but not FSH, and consequently decreased estradiol and progesterone (in women) as well as testosterone (in men). The hormonal changes in women corresponded to delayed ovulation, decreased endometrial thickening, impeded follicular maturation, and prolongation of the menstrual cycle. Drug effects were rapidly reversible.

Conclusions

Oral administration of the NK3R antagonist, ESN364, suppressed the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in healthy volunteers by selective modulation of gonadotropin secretion, leading to a restrained decrease in ovarian hormone levels in women. These results suggest that ESN364 may offer therapeutic benefit in the treatment of women's health disorders with a mitigated risk of menopausal-like adverse events.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Use the lowest effective dose for the patient.

Use the lowest dose effective for the patient (2)
Recommended initial dose is 1 mg, immediately before bedtime, with at least 7 to 8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening. May increase dose if clinically indicated, to a maximum of 3 mg (2.1)
Geriatric or debilitated patients: Dose should not exceed 2 mg (2.2)
Patients with severe hepatic impairment, or taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: Dose should not exceed 2 mg (2.3)
Do not take with or immediately after a meal (2.5)

2.1 Dosage in Adults

The recommended starting dose is 1 mg. Dosing can be raised to 2 mg or 3 mg if clinically indicated. In some patients, the higher morning blood levels of eszopiclone tablets following use of the 2 mg or 3 mg dose increase the risk of next day impairment of driving and other activities that require full alertness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The total dose of eszopiclone tablets should not exceed 3 mg, once daily immediately before bedtime [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

2.2 Geriatric or Debilitated Patients

The total dose of eszopiclone tablets should not exceed 2 mg in elderly or debilitated patients.

2.3 Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment, or Taking Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors

In patients with severe hepatic impairment, or in patients coadministered eszopiclone tablets with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, the total dose of eszopiclone tablets should not exceed 2 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

2.4 Use with CNS Depressants

Dosage adjustments may be necessary when eszopiclone tablets are combined with other central nervous system (CNS) depressant drugs because of the potentially additive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.5 Administration with Food

Taking eszopiclone tablets with or immediately after a heavy, high-fat meal results in slower absorption and would be expected to reduce the effect of eszopiclone tablets on sleep latency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^114tJUcC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The Guideline further highlights the importance of managing expectations of both clinicians and patients. The process of tapering long-term benzodiazepine therapy is often slow and non-linear. Although some patients may have no trouble with a relatively fast taper (e.g. 25% daily dose reduction every 2–4 weeks), others may experience significant challenges even with a much slower taper (e.g. 5% daily dose reduction every 4–6 weeks); patient tolerance of the pace of the taper can also change during the process (e.g. with minimal symptoms at the beginning of the taper (i.e. at higher dose), and substantial challenges at the end of the process, at the "tail-end" of tapering). For some patients, especially those who have been taking benzodiazepines for a long time, the tapering process may last for more than a year. They may need to pause at certain points along the way to adjust to the reduced dose. Sometimes, when withdrawal or other symptoms are intolerable, the patient may need to be maintained on a lower, safer dose of benzodiazepines (or, sometimes, even on the original dose) for an extended period or indefinitely.

A panel of patients with lived experience with tapering benzodiazepine medications were engaged throughout the Guideline development process, providing input on the key clinical questions and outcomes of interest for the systematic review, as well as on the Guideline recommendations and narrative discussion. They emphasized the importance of clinician awareness of heterogeneity in patient response to benzodiazepine tapering, and education on how to manage challenges that may arise. In particular, the patient-advisors expressed the hope that clinicians:
Have awareness of the broad range of potential symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal and the risk for protracted withdrawal symptoms, which can last for months or years after the medication has been discontinued;,
Know how to support patients who require very slow tapers, for example, by using "microdosing" (or "microtapering") strategies with liquid benzodiazepine formulations when needed;
Understand, and help patients understand, the importance of giving time for the brain's GABA receptors to return to homeostasis (e.g. avoiding the use of alcohol and sedatives, including other benzodiazepine medications and z-drugs (zolpidem, zopiclone, and zaleplon)).

### Eszopiclone for insomnia [^111TPr2a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy data, and adverse effects of eszopiclone in the treatment of transient and chronic insomnia in adult and geriatric patients.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE literature search (1966-May 2005) was conducted to retrieve articles and abstracts involving eszopiclone. The manufacturer of the drug provided a general summary of clinical data and abstracts of unpublished Phase III clinical trials.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles identified from the data sources were reviewed, and information deemed relevant was included for this review.

Data Synthesis

Food and Drug Administration approval of eszopiclone was based on 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Five trials published in abstract or study form were reviewed. The sixth trial was not available for evaluation. An open-label continuation trial was also reviewed. All studies showed statistically significant improvements in sleep parameters in adult and elderly patients treated for insomnia with eszopiclone.

Conclusions

The results of the 5 available double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (and 1 open-label, 6-month extension) showed that eszopiclone was safe and effective in the treatment of transient and chronic insomnia in adult and geriatric patients. Tolerance with long-term exposure (6 mo) and rebound insomnia were not observed. The results of the 6-month, open-label extension trial demonstrated that improvements in sleep parameters were sustained. Future studies comparing eszopiclone with other non benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon) are needed with cost data to clearly define the role of eszopiclone in the pharmacotherapy of chronic insomnia.

### Eszopiclone (Lunesta) [^111NrkX2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Eszopiclone is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 via demethylation and oxidation. There were no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions between eszopiclone and paroxetine. When eszopiclone was coadministered with olanzapine, no pharmacokinetic interaction was detected in levels of eszopiclone or olanzapine, but a pharmacodynamic interaction was seen on a measure of psychomotor function. Eszopiclone and lorazepam decreased each other's Cmaxby 22%. Coadministration of eszopiclone 3 mg to subjects receiving ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, 400 mg daily for 5 days, resulted in a 2.2-fold increase in exposure to eszopiclone. Cmaxand t1/2were increased 1.4-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively. LUNESTA would not be expected to alter the clearance of drugs metabolized by common CYP450 enzymes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Paroxetine: Coadministration of single dose of eszopiclone and paroxetine produced no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose administration does not predict the complete absence of a pharmacodynamic effect following chronic administration.

Lorazepam: Coadministration of single doses of eszopiclone and lorazepam did not have clinically relevant effects on the pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics of either drug. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose administration does not predict the complete absence of a pharmacodynamic effect following chronic administration.

Drugs with a Narrow Therapeutic Index

Digoxin: A single dose of eszopiclone 3 mg did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin measured at steady state following dosing of 0.5 mg twice daily for one day and 0.25 mg daily for the next 6 days.

Warfarin: Eszopiclone 3 mg administered daily for 5 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of (R)- or (S)-warfarin, nor were there any changes in the pharmacodynamic profile (prothrombin time) following a single 25 mg oral dose of warfarin.

### Β blockers for heart failure [^112zfz2W]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The authors should be applauded for also focusing on age and sex specific discontinuation rates and prescribed dose of β blocker (as a percentage of the maximum recommended dose). These data provide important information on intolerability of β blockers; an important cause of suboptimal prescribing particularly among older adults who have a high prevalence of comorbidity and polypharmacy. Interestingly, both discontinuation rates and the dose reached were similar across age and sex subgroups; about one in every six to seven patients discontinued treatment with a β blocker and patients received 70–75% of the maximum dose, including those in the oldest age group. Importantly, these numbers were similar in the placebo groups, indicating that when possible side effects occur during treatment with β blockers, they might not be caused by the drug.

Why do we need this IPD meta-analysis? Apparently, clinicians are more hesitant to prescribe β blockers in older patients and in women, although clinical guidelines recommend treatment irrespective of age and sex. Perhaps, this is because individual trials do not show convincing benefit of β blockers in women and older adults. Indeed, both groups are under-represented in trials. In daily practice the mean age of patients with HFrEF is around 75, and about 50% of patients are women. Yet, the mean age of patients included in this IPD meta-analysis was 63 and only 23% were women. Consequently, firm conclusions about effectiveness in patient subgroups are difficult from individual trials, forcing readers to make unsubstantiated assumptions that effects will be similar. Subgroup analyses in individual trials are rarely powerful enough to generate reliable results. This is illustrated by the inconsistent relative effects in men and women observed in subgroup analyses from the individual β blocker trials.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available pharmacovigilance data with LUNESTA use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits throughout organogenesis, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Administration of eszopiclone to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in offspring toxicities at all doses tested; the lowest dose was approximately 200 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3 mg/day based on mg/m2body surface area (See Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Data

Animal Data

Oral administration of eszopiclone to pregnant rats (62.5, 125, or 250 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (4, 8, or 16 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis showed no evidence of teratogenicity up to the highest doses tested. In rats, reduced fetal weight and increased incidences of skeletal variations and/or delayed ossification were observed at the mid and high doses. The no-observed-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development is 200 times the MRHD of 3 mg/day on a mg/m2basis. No effects on embryofetal development were observed in rabbits; the highest dose tested is approximately 100 times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis.

Oral administration of eszopiclone (60, 120, or 180 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats throughout the pregnancy and lactation resulted in increased post-implantation loss, decreased postnatal pup weights and survival, and increased pup startle response at all doses. The lowest dose tested is approximately 200 times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis. Eszopiclone had no effects on other developmental measures or reproductive function in the offspring.

### Sex differences in the risk of receiving potentially inappropriate prescriptions among older adults [^116gGR8H]. Age and Ageing (2016). Low credibility.

As shown in Table 3, higher income was associated with lower odds of filling potentially inappropriate prescriptions for men but not for women. Being married reduced the odds that a man would receive a potentially inappropriate prescription (AOR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.89–0.94), but did not have a significant effect on those odds for women. Ethnicity had statistically significant effects on the odds that a woman received a potentially inappropriate prescription, but no statistically significant effects for men. For women, having a Chinese surname reduced the odds of receiving a potentially inappropriate prescription by 25% (sex-stratified AOR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.73–0.78), having a South Asian surname reduced those odds by 17% (sex-stratified AOR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.79–0.87). Tests for interactions between sex and ethnicity confirmed that being female significantly modified the effects of ethnicity.

Table 4 presents sex-stratified prevalence of exposure to leading types of drugs on the Beers list among community-dwelling British Columbians over age 65 in 2013. It also lists odd ratios of such exposures for women (compared with men) after adjusting for age, health status, polypharmacy, receipt of prescriptions from multiple doctors, income, marital status, ethnicity and neighbourhood urbanisation. (Results for the population residing in long-term care facilities are in the.) By far, the potentially inappropriate medications most frequently prescribed for older adult British Columbians were benzodiazepines and other non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (e.g. eszopiclone) for long-term use. A greater proportion of women (12.9%) than men (8.4%) were prescribed 90 or more days' worth of these medicines in 2013. Women had 55% greater adjusted odds of such long-term hypnotic use than men (AOR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.52–1.58).

Regulatory perspectives on the conduct of clinical lactation studies

Challenges associated with the conduct of clinical lactation studies to collect clinical exposure and safety data relate to ethical considerations and operational, enrolment and study design issues. These lactation studies may be recommended prior to approval when it is anticipated that a drug is likely to be used in WOCBP, or after approval when it becomes apparent that the drug is being used by these women, either for the original or a new indication. The FDA recommendations of 2019, including the commonly reported variables of milk to plasma ratio (M:P ratio), estimated infant dose (EID) and relative infant dose (RID) are summarised in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2
Summary of FDA 2019 draft guidance for lactation studies, with some additional author reflections.

C max maximum observed concentration, EID estimated infant dose, FDA Food and Drug Administration, M:P milk:plasma, PK pharmacokinetic(s), RID relative infant dose, T max time to maximum observed concentration, WOCP women of childbearing potential.

In order to fully assess the potential of a drug to clinically affect a breastfeeding infant, the concentration-time profiles of the drug in breast milk and maternal plasma are required, with infant plasma where possible. Ideally, sufficient drug concentrations are measured to allow calculation of an area-under-the- concentration–time curve (AUC) for milk (AUC milk) and an average milk concentration (AUC/milk sampling duration), which can then be used to estimate a daily EID assuming a daily milk intake of 150 mL/kg. Thereafter, the RID (the percent of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage consumed in breast milk over 24 h) is determined. A World Health Organization (WHO) Working Group proposed that drugs with an RID > 10% may not be safe in infants, and that those with an RID greater than 25% should be avoided in nursing mothers. However, it is important to note that these are arbitrary thresholds lacking any pharmacological basis and nor do they provide any indication of clinical adverse events in the breastfeeding infants.

Considerations in Special Populations

Pregnant or Lactating Women

As a group, ergots are associated with increased sympathetic activity and vasoconstriction. Use in pregnancy has been associated with decreased uterine blood flow and increased uterine muscle contractility, predisposing to spontaneous abortion. Therefore, its use in pregnancy is not recommended,–and DHE and other ergot alkaloids are considered contraindicated in the USA.

There are no studies prospectively evaluating adverse events and outcomes of DHE use in pregnant women. The available data come mainly from registries and animal studies. In a pregnancy registry done in Quebec, evaluating 53 pregnant women exposed to DHE, the use of DHE in pregnancy was associated with a fourfold increase risk of prematurity. In one animal study, DHE did not demonstrate teratogenic effects, but in another, a dose of 617 mg/kg produced 50% embryonic mortality in rats, and with lower doses, congenital malformations were observed including cleft palate, bilateral limb defects, and lens opacity.

The use of DHE during lactation also is not recommended. Under Hale's lactation risk, it is classified as L4 (potentially hazardous) due to reported cases of gastrointestinal distress and weakness in infants. In addition, it can suppress milk production.

Pediatric Use

Despite its utility, relatively little has been written about DHE in this population, and therefore, its use has been limited mostly to specialists in pediatric migraine who are familiar with its effects. Intranasal DHE has been used successfully in children and adolescents who do not respond to intranasal triptans. IV DHE has been shown to be effective in status migrainosus in children and adolescents.–There are two inpatient dosing schedules for pediatric patients described in the literature, based on weight, age, and tolerability. A lower dose protocol calls for 0.1–0.2 mg/dose (based on age) along with a neuroleptic (eg, metoclopramide) administered every 6 hours for a maximum of 16 doses or until headache freedom is achieved. A higher dose protocol (for patients with inadequate response to lower doses, or who are deemed unlikely to respond to a lower dose but likely to tolerate a higher dose) utilizes 0.5–1 mg/dose (based on age and weight) administered with a neuroleptic (eg, prochlorperazine) every 8 hours for a maximum of 20 doses. Two retrospective studies of these dosing regimens revealed that 74–80% of patients have an excellent response.

2.2 Patients

Adult (18‐65 years) patients with bipolar I disorder using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM‐5) 24 criteria without psychotic features and a current major depressive episode ≥ 4 weeks and < 12 months confirmed by the Mini‐International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) were included in the study. Patients were required to have a 17‐item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD‐17) 25 total score ≥ 20 and item‐1 score ≥ 2, Clinical Global Impressions ‐ Severity (CGI‐S) score ≥ 4, 26 and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) 27 score ≤ 12.

For study inclusion, physical examination, clinical laboratory, and ECG results were normal or not judged to be clinically significant by investigators. Pregnancy in women with childbearing potential was excluded with negative serum β‐human chorionic gonadotropin testing. Patients with 4 or more mood episodes in the prior 12 months or any current psychiatric diagnoses, including personality disorders of significant severity to interfere with the study (as judged by the principal investigator), besides bipolar I disorder, or specific phobias, were excluded from the study. Patients were not permitted to have an alcohol or substance use disorder within the previous 6 months; suicide risk (based on Columbia‐Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C‐SSRS] 28 assessment, suicide attempt in the last year, HAMD‐17 item‐3 score ≥ 3, or MADRS item‐10 score ≥ 4) or risk of injury to self or others (based on investigator's judgment); nonresponse in the current depressive episode to ≥ 2 antidepressant trials of adequate dose; or treatment failure (in current depressive episode) of quetiapine, lurasidone, or olanzapine and fluoxetine combination. Patients with concurrent medical conditions were excluded if they were judged to have the potential to interfere with study participation, confound interpretation of results, or endanger the patient's well‐being. The only psychotropic drugs permitted for use during the study were eszopiclone, zolpidem, zopiclone, chloral hydrate, or zaleplon (for insomnia), lorazepam or equivalent benzodiazepine (maximum daily dosage 2.0 mg if the dose had been stable for 1 month prior to screening), rescue doses of lorazepam or equivalent benzodiazepine (for agitation/restlessness/hostility; maximum daily dose 2.0 mg for a maximum of 3 consecutive days), rescue doses of diphenhydramine or benztropine (for extrapyramidal symptoms [EPS]), or propranolol (for akathisia that emerged or worsened during the study).

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Inform patients and their families about the benefits and risks of treatment with eszopiclone. Inform patients of the availability of a Medication Guide and instruct them to read the Medication Guide prior to initiating treatment with eszopiclone and with each prescription refill. Review the eszopiclone Medication Guide with every patient prior to initiation of treatment. Instruct patients or caregivers that eszopiclone should be taken only as prescribed.

Complex Sleep Behaviors

Instruct patients and their families that eszopiclone may cause complex sleep behaviors, including sleep-walking, sleep-driving, preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex while not being fully awake. Serious injuries and death have occurred during complex sleep behavior episodes. Tell patients to discontinue eszopiclone and notify their healthcare provider immediately if they develop any of these symptoms [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

CNS Depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment

Tell patients that eszopiclone can cause next-day impairment even when used as prescribed, and that this risk is increased if dosing instructions are not carefully followed. Caution patients taking the 3 mg dose against driving and other activities requiring complete mental alertness the day after use. Inform patients that impairment can be present despite feeling fully awake. Advise patients that increased drowsiness and decreased consciousness may increase the risk of falls in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Eszopiclone (Lunesta) [^113WVr58]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 CNS Depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment

LUNESTA is a CNS depressant and can impair daytime function in some patients at the higher doses (2 mg or 3 mg), even when used as prescribed. Prescribers should monitor for excess depressant effects, but impairment can occur in the absence of symptoms (or even with subjective improvement), and impairment may not be reliably detected by ordinary clinical exam (i.e., less than formal psychomotor testing). While pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some adverse depressant effects of LUNESTA may develop, patients using 3 mg LUNESTA should be cautioned against driving or engaging in other hazardous activities or activities requiring complete mental alertness the day after use.

Additive effects occur with concomitant use of other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol), including daytime use. Downward dose adjustment of LUNESTA and concomitant CNS depressants should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

The use of LUNESTA with other sedative-hypnotics at bedtime or the middle of the night is not recommended.

The risk of next-day psychomotor impairment is increased if LUNESTA is taken with less than a full night of sleep remaining (7- to 8 hours); if higher than the recommended dose is taken; if coadministered with other CNS depressants; or coadministered with other drugs that increase the blood levels of eszopiclone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Because Lunesta can cause drowsiness and a decreased level of consciousness, patients, particularly the elderly, are at higher risk of falls.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112JJKpB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is clinically indicated. Unlike previous meta-analyses, which focused on broad classes of drugs, this guideline focuses on individual drugs commonly used to treat insomnia. It includes drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, as well as several drugs commonly used to treat insomnia without an FDA indication for this condition. This guideline should be used in conjunction with other AASM guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of chronic insomnia in adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of four experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, and patient values and preferences. Literature reviews are provided for those pharmacologic agents for which sufficient evidence was available to establish recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guideline for clinicians in choosing a specific pharmacological agent for treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is indicated. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, follow. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients, but should not be construed as an indication of ineffectiveness. GRADE recommendation strengths do not refer to the magnitude of treatment effects in a particular patient, but rather, to the strength of evidence in published data. Downgrading the quality of evidence for these treatments is predictable in GRADE, due to the funding source for most pharmacological clinical trials and the attendant risk of publication bias; the relatively small number of eligible trials for each individual agent; and the observed heterogeneity in the data. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. We suggest that clinicians use suvorexant as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use eszopiclone as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use zaleplon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use zolpidem as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use triazolam as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use temazepam as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use ramelteon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use doxepin as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use trazodone as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use tiagabine as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use diphenhydramine as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use melatonin as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use tryptophan as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use valerian as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK).
