## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what number should be placed in the box for n = 5 in the table where the second column is n³ + n − 1. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formula and whether it applies consistently to the given rows. Then, I should verify the calculations for n = 1 through 4 to ensure the pattern is correct. Next, I will compute the value for n = 5. Finally, I will match the result to the provided options and confirm the answer.

> Let me first confirm the formula and the pattern. The expression is n³ + n − 1, and the table shows that for n = 1 the result is 1, for n = 2 it is 9, for n = 3 it is 29, and for n = 4 it is 67. I should double-check that these align with the formula before proceeding to n = 5.

> I will now examine n = 1: 1³ + 1 − 1 equals 1 + 1 − 1, which is 1. That matches the table, so the formula is consistent here.

> Next, I should review n = 2: 2³ + 2 − 1 equals 8 + 2 − 1, which is 9. Again, this matches the table, so the pattern holds.

> Let me verify n = 3: 3³ + 3 − 1 equals 27 + 3 − 1, which is 29. This is correct as well, reinforcing the consistency of the formula.

> I will now check n = 4: 4³ + 4 − 1 equals 64 + 4 − 1, which is 67. This confirms the pattern is intact through the fourth row.

> Now, I need to compute n = 5: 5³ + 5 − 1 equals 125 + 5 − 1, which is 129. Wait, let me verify the arithmetic one more time to avoid a mistake: 125 + 5 is 130, minus 1 is indeed 129.

> Finally, I should match this result to the options. The choices are 27, 247, 79, 19, and 129. My calculation yields 129, which corresponds to option E.

---

The missing value is **129**, which corresponds to option E. This is calculated by substituting (n = 5) into the expression (n³ + n − 1): (5³ + 5 − 1 = 125 + 5 − 1 = 129).

---

## Calculation

Substitute (n = 5) into the expression:

n³ + n − 1 = 5³ + 5 − 1 = 125 + 5 − 1 = 129

---

## Verification of the pattern

To ensure consistency, verify the pattern with the given values:

| **N** | **N³ + n - 1** | **Result** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | 1³ + 1–1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2³ + 2–1 | 9 |
| 3 | 3³ + 3–1 | 29 |
| 4 | 4³ + 4–1 | 67 |
| 5 | 5³ + 5–1 | 129 |

---

The pattern holds, confirming that the missing value for (n = 5) is **129**.

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **E. 129**.

Allergen specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentration — probability distributions and early-life testing: Summary Statement 129 states that the probability distribution of specific IgE for several anaphylactogenic foods (peanuts, egg white, cow's milk, and codfish) can define clinical sensitivity as verified by double-blind oral challenge tests, with similar relationships for several respiratory allergens (A). Allergen specific IgE is rarely detectable in cord blood, and based on current information there is no clinical indication for attempting to measure allergen specific IgE in cord blood; however, elevated food specific IgE in early infancy may predict respiratory sensitization at a later age. A recent study reported virtually equivalent specific IgE sensitivity between a blood spot test and serum; the blood spot test used paper-absorbed or -eluted blood obtained by finger prick, and preliminary results suggested successful determination of IgE sensitization in preschool children.

### Large-scale analysis of BAP1 expression reveals novel associations with clinical and molecular features of malignant pleural mesothelioma [^111EWRBY]. The Journal of Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

staining patterns are associated withexpression levels and molecular clusters

RNAseq and gene expression‐based unsupervised clustering analyses were available for 174/596 cases (supplementary material, Table S2) [4]. In this sub‐cohort, non‐epithelioid histology (p = 0.021) and single‐pattern nuclear staining (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with higher BAP1 gene expression, whereas single‐pattern cytoplasmic (p = 0.005), single‐pattern absent (p < 0.001), and combination absent/cytoplasmic staining (p = 0.012) were associated with lower BAP1 expression. Four molecular clusters (E, BE, BS, S) related to the spectrum from epithelioid to sarcomatoid histology were previously identified [4]. Comparison of cluster E with clusters BE, BS, and S (combined) in this subset demonstrated that the proportions of single‐pattern cytoplasmic staining (E: 15/45, 33%; others: 19/129, 15%; p = 0.009) and of combination absent/cytoplasmic staining (E: 14/45, 31%; others: 13/129, 10%; p = 0.002) were significantly higher in cluster E, whereas single‐pattern nuclear staining was more common in clusters EB, SB, and S (others: 51/129, 40%; E: 7/45, 16%; p = 0.003) (Figure 3A, B).

Regulation of miR-129-5p inhibitor on prostate cancer cells

Transfection silencing of PITPNA-AS1 elevated miR-129-5p levels in PC3 cells, whereas the involvement of miR-129-5p inhibitor restored miR-129-5p level (Fig. 4 A). Silencing of PITPNA-AS1 suppressed the growth ability of prostate cancer cells, whereas downregulation of miR-129-5p restored cell growth activity (Fig. 4 B). Meanwhile, downregulation of PITPNA-AS1 repressed the biological functions of the cells, while the migratory (Fig. 4 C) and invasive (Fig. 4 D) abilities of the cells were reversed after transfection with si + miR-129-5p inhibitor. Meanwhile, the levels of vimentin and N-cadherin proteins were increased, while the E-cadherin protein level was decreased after treatment with si-PITPNA-AS1 and miR-129-5p inhibitor (Fig. 4 E).

Finally, the regulation of pri-129-1 processing by KSRP was investigated during the development of zebrafish embryos. Transcribed GFP-pri-129-1 fusion mRNAs and the KSRP mRNA were microinjected into zebrafish zygotes (Fig. 7d), and GFP alone was injected with the KSRP mRNA as a control. As expected, KSRP decreased the fluorescence of 129_WT in 4 h.p.f. and 24 h.p.f. zebrafish embryos after the microinjection (Fig. 7e, f; and Supplementary Fig. 5d, e). However, the fluorescence of the 129_MutF and GFP control was similar with or without KSRP expression (Fig. 7e; and Supplementary Fig. 5d, e).

### Vitamin E and the Y4 agonist BA-129 decrease prostate cancer growth and production of vascular endothelial growth factor [^115sPWag]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2002). Low credibility.

Background

A biologically active form of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol succinate (ATS), has been shown to induce apoptosis of hormone-refractory prostate cancer in vitro and inhibit cell growth in vivo. The gastrointestinal hormone peptide YY (PYY) has growth inhibitory activity against multiple cancer cell lines and is synergistic with ATS against breast and pancreatic cancer growth. BA-129, a specific Y4 receptor agonist, has growth inhibitory effects on pancreatic cancer in vitro. We investigated the effects of BA-129 and ATS on prostate cancer growth and evaluated their effects on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.

Methods

A hormone-refractory human prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, was treated with ATS alone at 10 pg/ml, PYY or BA-129 alone at doses of 75 and 500 pmol/ml, or a combination of the two agents. Cell growth was measured by MTT assay and hemocytometry using trypan blue. Quantitative measurement of VEGF was performed by ELISA. Statistical analysis was achieved by ANOVA.

Results

ATS exhibited significant (P < 0.05) growth inhibitory effects in prostate cancer cells. PYY also inhibited growth (P < 0.05). ATS treatment reduced VEGF production (P < 0.05). PYY treatment increased VEGF. When ATS was given in combination with BA-129, VEGF production was further reduced (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Both PYY and ATS inhibit growth in hormone-refractory prostate cancer, with augmentation when used in combination. VEGF production is inhibited by vitamin E, but increased by PYY. ATS abolishes the augmented VEGF response to PYY. Our data suggest that PYY is involved in the regulation of VEGF production and prostate cancer growth.

### KSRP specifies monocytic and granulocytic differentiation through regulating miR-129 biogenesis and RUNX1 expression [^114mE7dg]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

miR-129 regulates myeloid differentiation

The association of KSRP and pri-129-1 processing prompted us to question whether miR-129 also has important roles in myeloid differentiation. HPCs were transduced with lentiviruses expressing miR-129 (lenti-129), miR-129 inhibitors (miRZIP-129) or their controls and then induced to differentiate into monocytes or granulocytes to examine the role of miR-129 in myeloid differentiation. In both gain- and loss-of-function analyses, miR-129 inhibited monocyte differentiation but promoted granulocyte differentiation, as indicated by changes in the percentages of CD14 + /CD11b + or CD11b + cells (Fig. 8a, b; and Supplementary Fig. 6a, b), cell morphological maturation (Fig. 8c; and Supplementary Fig. 6a, b), colony formation (Fig. 8d, e) and CD14 or CD11b mRNA expression (Fig. 8f, g). Meanwhile, functional analyses were also performed in THP-1 and NB4 cells, which were first transfected with the miR-129 mimic (miR-129) or control mimic (NC) and then stimulated with PMA and ATRA (Supplementary Fig. 7a, e), respectively. miR-129 transfection decreased the percentage of CD14 + cells, CD14 mRNA expression and the proportion of mature monocytes after PMA treatment (Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). In contrast, miR-129 transfection increased the percentage of CD11b + cells, CD11b mRNA expression and the proportion of mature granulocytes after ATRA treatment (Supplementary Fig. 7e–h).

### Foldamers reveal and validate therapeutic targets associated with toxic α-synuclein self-assembly [^115NitN6]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Identification of the binding site of SK-129 on αS

The N-terminal domain spanning residues 1–90 plays a significant role in αS aggregation. Therefore, we hypothesized that SK-129 could be interacting with the N-terminus of αS for the potent inhibition of αS aggregation. We utilized 2D heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR spectroscopy (2D HSQC NMR) for atomic-level insight into the binding site of SK-129 on αS. We collected the HSQC NMR of 70 μM 15 N- 1 H-uniformly labeled αS in the absence and presence of SK-129 at an equimolar ratio (Fig. 2a–e) and compared the signal intensity of the amide peaks. The total changes in the intensity in the presence of SK-129 suggest that the binding site of SK-129 is toward the N-terminus of αS (Fig. 2a–e), more specifically SK-129 interacts and changes the conformation of four αS sequences, including 6–12, 15–23, 36–45, and 48–53 (Fig. 2a–e). The binding sites of SK-129 on αS contain lysine and hydrophobic residues; therefore, we propose that the carboxylic acid and the propyl side chains of SK-129 are involved in binding interactions with lysine and hydrophobic residues of αS.

### A randomized study of electronic mail versus telephone follow-up after emergency department visit [^113pPupy]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to determine whether electronic mail (e-mail) increases contact rates after patients are discharged from the emergency department (ED). Following discharge, patients were randomized to be contacted by telephone or e-mail. The main outcome was success of contact. Secondary outcome was the median time of response. There were 1561 patients initially screened. Of these, 444 had e-mail and were included in the study. Half were contacted by telephone and the rest via e-mail. Our telephone contact rate was 58% (129/222) after two calls in a 48-h period and our e-mail contact was 41% (90/222). The telephone was nearly two times better than e-mail. The median time of response was 48 h for e-mail and 18 h for telephone. It is concluded that the telephone is a better modality of contact than e-mail for patients discharged from the ED.

### Anatomical, functional and metabolic imaging of radiation-induced lung injury using hyperpolarized MRI [^1115dyRR]. NMR in Biomedicine (2014). Low credibility.

MRI of hyperpolarized (129)Xe gas and (13)C-enriched substrates (e.g. pyruvate) presents an unprecedented opportunity to map anatomical, functional and metabolic changes associated with lung injury. In particular, inhaled hyperpolarized (129)Xe gas is exquisitely sensitive to changes in alveolar microanatomy and function accompanying lung inflammation through decreases in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of alveolar gas and increases in the transfer time (T(tr)) of xenon exchange from the gas and into the dissolved phase in the lung. Furthermore, metabolic changes associated with hypoxia arising from lung injury may be reflected by increases in lactate-to-pyruvate signal ratio obtained by magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging following injection of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate. In this work, the application of hyperpolarized (129)Xe and (13)C MRI to radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is reviewed and results of ADC, T(tr) and lactate-to-pyruvate signal ratio changes in a rat model of RILI are summarized. These results are consistent with conventional functional (i.e. blood gases) and histological (i.e. tissue density) changes, and correlate significantly with inflammatory cell counts (i.e. macrophages). Hyperpolarized MRI may provide an earlier indication of lung injury associated with radiotherapy of thoracic tumors, potentially allowing adjustment of treatment before the onset of severe complications and irreversible fibrosis.

### Prodding tardy reviewers: a randomized comparison of telephone, fax, and e-mail [^1126tHM4]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

To compare telephone, fax, and e-mail methods of prodding tardy reviewers.

Methods

Randomized trial conducted January 1998 through June 1999 at the main editorial office of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Reviewers who had failed to file reviews by 28 days after being sent manuscripts (7 days after deadline) were sent identical messages in oral (telephone) or written (fax and e-mail) form inquiring as to the status of review, asking for its completion as soon as possible, and requesting it be sent by fax or e-mail.

Results

Of 378 reviewers, proportions returning reviews within 7 days were essentially identical: telephone, 85 (68%) of 125; fax, 86 (67%) of 129; and e-mail, 84 (67%) of 124 (P = 0.59). In the two thirds who responded, the mean time to return reviews did not differ among the 3 groups.

Conclusion

Contacting tardy reviewers resulted in a review being received within 7 days in about two thirds of cases, and it made no difference if the contact was made by telephone, fax, or e-mail.

### Pulmonary functional MRI and CT in a survivor of bronchiolitis and respiratory failure caused by e-cigarette use [^115nsJwQ]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Although nearly 3,000 e-cigarette-related hospitalizations have been reported in North America, the long-term outcomes in these patients have not been described. We followed an 18-year-old boy who survived acute critical illness and respiratory failure related to 5 months of e-cigarette use. Chronic irreversible airflow obstruction and markedly abnormal 129 Xe MRI ventilation heterogeneity was observed and persisted 8 months after hospital discharge, despite improvement in quality-of-life and chest CT findings. Lung clearance index and oscillometry measures were also highly abnormal at 8 months postdischarge. Although 129 Xe MRI ventilation abnormalities were dominant in the lung apices and central lung regions, the pattern of ventilation defects was dissimilar to ventilation heterogeneity observed in patients with obstructive lung disease, such as asthma and COPD. Our findings underscore the long-term functional impacts of e-cigarette-related lung injury in survivors of critical illness; longitudinal evaluations may shed light on the pathophysiologic mechanisms that drive e-cigarette-related lung disease.

Effect of SK-129 on αS aggregation mediated PD phenotypes in an in vivo model

The antagonist activity of SK-129 against αS aggregation was tested in vivo using a C elegans -based PD model (NL5901). The ability of SK-129 to efficiently permeate cell membranes was confirmed by the parallel artificial membrane permeation assay (Fig. 5a) and confocal microscopy (using SK-129 F, Fig. 5b). The NL5901 strain is a well-established PD model that expresses WT αS-YFP in the body wall muscle cells, and PD phenotypic readouts include a gradual increase in inclusions (αS-YFP) in body wall muscle cells and a decline in motility during aging (Fig. 5c, e–g). The NL5901 strain was treated with 15 μM SK-129 at the larval stage and incubated with and without SK-129 for 9 days. The inclusions (αS-YFP) were counted manually using confocal microscopy. We observed a high number of inclusions (~33 inclusions/ C elegans) (Fig. 5c, e and Movie S1); however, there was a substantial decline in inclusions in the presence of SK-129 (~8–9 inclusions/ C elegans) (Fig. 5d, e and Movie S2), suggesting that SK-129 permeates the body wall muscle cell membrane and inhibits αS aggregation (Fig. 5d, e). The motility rate of the NL5901 strain decreases during the aging process as a consequence of αS inclusions. We utilized a newly developed WMicroTracker ARENA plate reader to measure the locomotion (overall activity counts) of NL5901 in the absence and presence of SK-129. The overall activity of NL5901 displayed a gradual decline in the activity in comparison to the WT model of C elegans (N2) (Fig. 5f, g and Supplementary Fig. 28); however, NL5901 treated with 15 µM SK-129 at the larval stage resulted in a significant improvement in the overall activity (Fig. 5f, g and Supplementary Fig. 28). The overall activity of NL590 treated with SK-129 was closer to the N2 strain (Fig. 5f, g and Supplementary Fig. 28).

### Xenon xe 129 hyperpolarized (Xenoview) [^1149K2E6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

11 DESCRIPTION

XENOVIEW (xenon Xe 129 hyperpolarized) is a hyperpolarized contrast agent produced on site by the HPX Hyperpolarization System from the isotopically enriched Xenon Xe 129 Gas Blend. The Gas Blend cylinder distributed by Polarean contains xenon (1% total; > 80% isotopic purity Xe 129), nitrogen, NF (10%), and helium, NF (89%).

The active pharmaceutical ingredient in XENOVIEW is hyperpolarized xenon Xe 129. Hyperpolarized xenon Xe 129 is chemically identical to non-polarized xenon Xe 129. Xenon is a clear, colorless, monoatomic, inert, stable, noble gas. It is naturally abundant in air at a level of 0.087 ppm. Atmospheric xenon is composed of nine non-radioactive isotopes, of which xenon Xe 129 comprises 26.4%. The atomic weight of xenon Xe 129 is 128.9.

XENOVIEW is a clear, colorless, odorless gas for oral inhalation use. Each XENOVIEW Dose Delivery Bag contains a Dose Equivalent (DE) volume of hyperpolarized xenon Xe 129 in a volume of 250 mL to 750 mL total xenon with additional nitrogen, NF (99.999% purity) added as an inert buffer to ensure the total volume of gas reaches the dose delivery bag volume (300 mL, 500 mL, 750 mL, or 1,000 mL). The minimum DE for a dose of XENOVIEW is 75 mL with a recommended DE target range of 75 to 100 mL. DE of greater than 100 mL is acceptable.

### Mutations in the basic core promoter region of hepatitis B virus. relationship with precore variants and HBV genotypes in a Spanish population of HBV carriers [^112StkRM]. Journal of Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To determine the prevalence and significance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) basic core promoter (BCP) mutations and to establish their relationship with precore (preC) mutations, HBV genotypes and HBV-DNA levels.

Methods

BCP and preC mutations and genotypes were determined by sequencing.

Results

Genomic analysis was performed in 129 (71%) of 182 patients. BCP mutations were detected in 83% of 18 HBeAg-negative (e-) chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with fluctuating ALT levels, and in 76% of 58 e- CHB with elevated ALT. The prevalence was lower and similar, 55% in 30 HBeAg-positive CHB (e+ CHB) with elevated ALT and in 23 e- inactive carriers. Frequency of preC mutations was higher in e- CHB (80%) than in e- inactive carriers (65%). Among e- CHB, patients with elevated ALT and preC mutations at nt 1896 showed highest HBV-DNA, regardless of BCP mutations. BCP mutations were similar in genotypes A and D, while preC mutations were most common in genotype D (82 vs. 40%). Simultaneous presence of the main BCP (1762, 1764) and preC (1896, 1899) mutations was associated with the degree of histological injury.

Conclusions

Combined BCP and preC mutational and genotype analysis provides clinically relevant information in the study of HBV infection.

### Left ventricular dysfunction in patients with primary aldosteronism: a propensity score-matching follow-up study with tissue Doppler imaging [^113n8BUY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In the overall APA group (129 patients), the clinical characteristics and echocardiographic parameters were significantly better 1 year after adrenalectomy compared with the baseline parameters (Table 4), including decreases in SBP, DBP, number of antihypertensive medications, PAC, ARR, and LVMI, and increases in creatinine and PRA. Eighty‐eight (68.2%) APA patients were cured 1 year after adrenalectomy.

Table 4
Parameter Comparison in APA Patients Before and After Adrenalectomy (n = 129)

In echocardiography (Figure 2), there were no significant differences between baseline and postadrenalectomy LVEF, E/A ratio, and E‐wave deceleration time. In contrast, LVMI significantly decreased (121 ± 32 versus 110 ± 25; P < 0.001), e′ significantly increased (6.5 ± 1.9 versus 7.0 ± 2.1; P = 0.003), and E/e′ significantly decreased (12.5 ± 4.2 versus 11.3 ± 3.7; P = 0.002). In factor analysis of changes in E/e′ (ΔE/e′ = postadrenalectomy E/e′−preadrenalectomy E/e′), univariate regression analysis showed that ΔE/e′ was significantly correlated with BMI, duration of hypertension, baseline SBP, ΔSBP, ΔDBP, baseline E/e′, baseline LVMI, and ΔLVMI. In multivariate analysis, only baseline E/e′ and ΔLVMI were significantly correlated with ΔE/e′ (Table 5).

### Experimental capture of miRNA targetomes: disease-specific 3' UTR library-based miRNA targetomics for Parkinson's disease [^112jURmk]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The semiautomated reporter assay validated up to 80% of the MTIs for miR-129-1-3p

To experimentally validate the MTIs between the in silico-identified UTRs of the library and the four miRNAs, we performed our semiautomated HiTmIR assays for all 705 predicted MTIs. Following cotransfection of a miRNA with the reporter plasmid, the assay indicated functional binding of the tested miRNAs to the respective 3′UTR as a reduction in RLUs. We distributed the 705 MTIs along with positive and negative controls on 35.25 96-well plates. Each dual luciferase assay was then performed four times, resulting in 35.25 × 4 × 96 = 13,536 single transfections (Fig. 2a–d). The validated MTIs are shown in the upper left quadrant of a volcano plot (Fig. 2g). In line with the original miRATBase criteria, we required a mean reduction to < 90% of the relative light units (RLU) compared to the empty miRNA expression vector. As a second criterion, we required a significant nominal p value at an alpha level of 0.05. Notably, the results were presented as the maximal reduction and the maximal significance of all 3′UTR sequences representing that gene. Interestingly, the four miRNAs varied significantly with respect to the number of targeted 3′UTRs and the target effect size (Fig. 2f, g). Out of a total of 320 predicted and tested 3′UTR constructs (i.e. predicted and tested MTIs), 215 were suppressed by miR-129-5p (i.e. verified MTIs). Out of 95 predicted and tested 3′UTR constructs (i.e. predicted and tested MTIs), 76 were suppressed by miR-129-1-3p (i.e. verified MTIs). Out of 190 predicted and tested 3′UTR constructs (i.e. predicted and tested MTIs), 96 were suppressed by miR-873-5p (i.e. verified MTIs). Out of 100 predicted and tested 3′UTR constructs (i.e. predicted and tested MTIs), 55 were suppressed by miR-133 (i.e. verified MTIs). Among these, the validation rate was highest for miR-129-1-3p (80%), while the lowest rate was 50.5% for miR-873-5p.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^116DNcxj]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 blood pressure targets — benefit–harm balance and subgroup considerations indicate that targeting SBP to < 120 mm Hg under standardized conditions "reduces CV events and all-cause mortality in CKD", and "in most people with high BP, including the frail and elderly", benefits appear to outweigh harms; however, certainty is less in CKD G4–G5 and with diabetes. For individuals with SBP 120–129 mm Hg, observational data show higher CV risk than SBP < 120 mm Hg but randomized trials did not include SBP 120–129 mm Hg, so lowering to < 120 mm Hg is "tentative". Very low baseline diastolic BP (e.g., < 50 mm Hg) with coronary artery disease raises theoretical MI risk, though SPRINT showed similar benefits. Etiology generally does not modify CV benefit, but in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease kidney benefits "may be greater with an SBP of 95–110 mm Hg than SBP 120–130 mm Hg". Proteinuria "may no longer be an effect modifier" at an SBP target of < 120 mm Hg. At older ages the benefit–harm ratio is less certain (e.g., > 90 years), though people with a mean age of 83 ± 3 years seemed to benefit; it is also less certain in younger adults. Frailty and nursing home residence did not appear to modify beneficial effects. With "white-coat" hypertension, office BP is higher than ambulatory or home BP and risks to achieve office BP < 120 mm Hg may be higher, with less certain benefits.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — blood pressure thresholds and treatment algorithm specifies: Normal BP (BP < 120/80 mm Hg) prompts "Promote optimal lifestyle habits"; Elevated BP (BP 120–129/ < 80 mm Hg) leads to "Nonpharmacological therapy (Class I)". For Stage 1 hypertension (BP 130–139/80–89 mm Hg), the pathway assesses "Estimated 10-y CVD risk ≥ 10%"; at this threshold the action is "Nonpharmacological therapy and BP-lowering medication (Class I)" and when not at this threshold the action is "Nonpharmacological therapy (Class I)". Stage 2 hypertension (BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg) is treated with "Nonpharmacological therapy and BP-lowering medication (Class I)".

Angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors — In a Class II crossover study, candesartan reduced the mean number of headache days vs placebo (18.5 with placebo vs 13.6 with candesartan; p = 0.001), and secondary endpoints favored candesartan (e.g., headache hours 139 vs 95; migraine days 12.6 vs 9.0; migraine hours 92.2 vs 59.4; headache severity index 293 vs 191) with no serious adverse events (AEs) and common AEs including "dizziness" 31%, "symptoms of the respiratory system" 21%, and fatigue 14%; a Class II lisinopril study showed reductions in headache hours (129 vs 162 [mean change 20; CI 5–36]), headache days (17.9 vs 23.7 [20, CI 5–30]), and migraine days (14.5 vs 18.5 [21, CI 9–34]) with AEs of cough (26%; 10% discontinued), dizziness (23%), and "tendency to faint" (10%) and no serious AEs; in a single Class II trial, telmisartan 80 mg did not differ from placebo for reduction in migraine days (−1.65 vs −1.14); overall, "Lisinopril and candesartan are possibly effective for migraine prevention (1 Class II study each). Telmisartan is possibly ineffective for reducing the number of migraine days (1 negative Class II study)".

Results

Study population

In total, 129 patients were identified and included in this study, of whom 45 (35%) had a genetic diagnosis. The median (IQR) age of death was 24.3 years (19.1–29.0). The most common leading cause of death was heart complications (n = 54, 41.9%), followed by respiratory-related causes (n = 49, 38.0%) and non-cardiopulmonary causes (n = 26, 20.1%) (Table 1). The median (IQR) age of death due to respiratory-related causes was 23.4 (18.9–30.0) years. Acute respiratory failure accounted for 63.3% of respiratory-related causes of death at a median (IQR) age of 21.4 years (19.2–27.9). There was no age difference between patients who died of respiratory-related causes compared to other causes of death (log rank p = 0.68; Fig. 1). Demographics and clinical events for the total study population and for the subgroups of patients born in the 80 s and the 90 s are presented in Table 1.

Individual residues affect how YFV binds mouse brain MRPs

To obtain a more detailed understanding of E protein residues involved in binding to AG129 mouse brain MRPs we utilized our panel of Asibi and 17D i.c.-derived chimeric viruses.

17D residues E-200, E-299, and E-305 were each able to induce binding to mouse brain when substituted into the Asibi backbone [E-200 (1.6 log 10 reduction, p < 0.0001), E-299 (1.5 log 10 reduction, p < 0.0001) and E-305 (3.3 log 10 reduction, p < 0.0001)] but did not bind when the Asibi residues at those positions were exchanged in the 17D backbone [E-200 (0.5 log 10 reduction, p = 0.0021) E-299 (0.7 log 10 reduction, p < 0.0001), and E-305 (0.4 log 10 reduction, p = 0.047)] (Table 1). Thus, residue E-305 appears critical to 17D virus binding to mouse brain MRPs.

The exchange of E-170, E-173, and E-407 did not affect the binding of Asibi to brain [E-170 (0.8 log 10 reduction, p < 0.0001), E-173 (0.09 log 10 reduction, p = 0.81), and E-407 (0.5 log 10 reduction, p = 0.0083)] but did ablate the ability of 17D to bind brain MRP [E-170 (0.4 log 10 reduction, p = 0.040), E-173 (0.2 log 10 reduction, p = 0.35), and E-407 (0.2 log 10 reduction, p = 0.44)]. The data for Asibi/17D E-170 were equivocal. Though the reduction in titer was statistically significant, the virus bound < 1.0 log 10, making it not significant by our definition.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) admixture heparin — central vein thrombosis risk: Adult studies report mixed effects by dose. With unfractionated heparin 1 unit/mL, subclavian thrombosis was 2/17 (11.8%) vs 1/20 (5%) at 2 weeks and 4/17 (23.5%) vs 1/20 (5%) at 4 weeks (NS). With unfractionated heparin 3000 units/L of PN, thrombosis was 2/24 (8.3%) vs 15/48 (31.8%) (P < 0.05). A retrospective review comparing 1000 units/L, 6000 units/L, and little or no heparin found central vein thrombosis in 7/129 (5.4%), 10/858 (1.2%), and 4/23 (17%), respectively. The GRADE table states that at 3000 units/L favors heparin in PN, but at 1000 units/L does not, with GRADE Low and overall evidence grade Low.

At intermediate likelihood, TPs were 390 (330–430), 355 (310–390), and 315 (265–390); FNs were 110 (70–170), 145 (110–190), and 185 (110–235); TNs were 285 (200–360), 345 (310–375), and 365 (325–400). Comments state that TPs would be eligible to undergo treatment adjustment, FNs would be falsely reassured, and TNs would be reassured and obviate the need for invasive testing with endoscopy; GRADE certainty of evidence is reported as LOWb, c and VERY LOWd, e.

### Detection in Escherichia coli of the genes encoding the major virulence factors, the genes defining the O157: H7 serotype, and components of the type 2 Shiga toxin family by multiplex PCR [^115dnjYX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

Strains of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) have been associated with outbreaks of diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans. Most clinical signs of disease arise as a consequence of the production of Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1), Stx2 or combinations of these toxins. Other major virulence factors include enterohemorrhagic E. coli hemolysin (EHEC hlyA), and intimin, the product of the eaeA gene that is involved in the attaching and effacing adherence phenotype. In this study, a series of multiplex-PCR assays were developed to detect the eight most-important E. coli genes associated with virulence, two that define the serotype and therefore the identity of the organism, and a built-in gene detection control. Those genes detected were stx(1), stx(2), stx(2c), stx(2d), stx(2e), stx(2f), EHEC hlyA, and eaeA, as well as rfbE, which encodes the E. coli O157 serotype; fliC, which encodes the E. coli flagellum H7 serotype; and the E. coli 16S rRNA, which was included as an internal control. A total of 129 E. coli strains, including 81 that were O157:H7, 10 that were O157:non-H7, and 38 that were non-O157 isolates, were investigated. Among the 129 samples, 101 (78.3%) were stx positive, while 28 (21.7%) were lacked stx. Of these 129 isolates, 92 (71.3%) were EHEC hlyA positive and 96 (74.4%) were eaeA positive. All STEC strains were identified by this procedure. In addition, all Stx2 subtypes, which had been initially identified by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, were identified by this method. A particular strength of the assay was the identification of these 11 genes without the need to use restriction enzyme digestion. The proposed method is a simple, reliable, and rapid procedure that can detect the major virulence factors of E. coli while differentiating O157:H7 from non-O157 isolates.

### Loss of pulmonary capillaries in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension with low diffusion capacity is accompanied by early diffuse emphysema detected byXe MRI [^115uTSuh]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies showed that even in patients with no or minimal changes in CT, histopathology may detect emphysematous and fibrotic changes. However, as autopsies are rarely performed, verifying the existence of a vanishing pulmonary capillary syndrome histologically proved difficult.

Hyperpolarised gas MRI may assess lung microstructure and, e.g. emphysematous changes through increases in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) noninvasively. Since xenon is taken up in lung tissue and blood and 129 Xe experiences strong chemical shifts, 129 Xe MRI is sensitive to alveolar-capillary diffusion and microvascular pulmonary blood volume. With the appropriate choice of sequence parameters, 129 Xe MRI metrics are specific to the gas uptake region and pulmonary capillaries as opposed to, e.g. dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Imaging of the 129 Xe dissolved phase and dynamic acquisition of cardiogenic oscillations of 129 Xe in red blood cells (RBC) may differentiate cardiopulmonary diseases and may provide information on pre- or postcapillary involvement in PH. Although widespread clinical application is hampered by limited dissemination of necessary equipment, hyperpolarised 129 Xe MRI is a useful tool for clinical research and the field of 129 Xe MRI continues to grow.

We hypothesise that patients with IPAH and low D LCO differ from other patient groups by a loss of pulmonary capillaries, as judged by the ratio of 129 Xe in RBCs and membrane tissues (M). The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis and to evaluate alveolar microstructure by comparing results from 129 Xe MRI in IPAH with low D LCO with those from IPAH with preserved D LCO, as well as with those from PH patients with CPFE and with those from patients with emphysema without echocardiographic signs of PH.

Protein restriction in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Prescribed dietary protein at 1.3 g/kg/d (n = 294), 0.6 g/kg/d (n = 291), 0.6 g/kg/d (n = 129), or 0.3 g/kg/d + keto-acid supplement (n = 126) showed mean decline in GFR not different between groups, with the very low protein group marginally slower (P = 0.07). A 0.2 g/kg/d decrease in protein intake resulted in 1.15 mL/min/y slower decline in GFR (P = 0.01) and ~41% prolongation of time to dialysis; keto acids had no effect. Renal survival was greater for 0.6 vs 1 g/kg/d (P < .06) with no difference in CKD-V after 2 y.

Objective

Endoscopic assessment is observer dependent and patient history may influence the interpretation of images. This study assessed the impact of knowledge bias in a large sample of endoscopists.

Design

The same 2-minute video sequence of a normal gastroscopy was shown twice as part of a diagnostic quiz. The 129 endoscopists were unaware that they participated in a validation experiment. Two fictional patient histories accompanied the videos. The first case suggested reflux-like symptoms. The second case described epigastric pain in an elderly woman. Endoscopists gave diagnoses in free writing. The diagnostic suggestions were categorized into five classes: (a) normal findings; (b) reflux-related findings (e.g., erosions, hiatal hernia, Barrett's metaplasia); (c) peptic ulcer or atrophic gastritis; (d) other specified pathology; (e) no diagnostic suggestion.

Results

Only 30/129 (23%) endoscopists gave the same diagnosis for the two identical video cases. The patient history had a major impact on the diagnostic suggestions: In case 1 (reflux symptoms) 54/129 (42%) of the diagnoses were related to reflux disease compared with only six diagnoses of ulcer or atrophic gastritis (P < 0.0001). In case 2 (epigastric pain) 56 endoscopists (43%) diagnosed ulcer or atrophic gastritis whereas only 16 (12%) suggested reflux-related findings (P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Endoscopists are biased by the patient history when they interpret endoscopic images.

### Association between e-cigarette use and depression in the behavioral risk factor surveillance system, 2016–2017 [^113rc4WX]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Results

Of 892 394 participants (414 326 [29.0%] aged ≥ 60 years; 502 448 [51.3%] women), 28 736 (4.4%) were current e-cigarette users, 111 337 (16.5%) were former e-cigarette users, and 752 321 (79.1%) were never e-cigarette users (Table 1). Compared with never e-cigarette users, current e-cigarette users were more likely to be single, men, and younger than 40 years and to concurrently use combustible cigarettes (single, 120 797 [24.3%] vs 10 517 [48.4%]; men, 318 970 [46.6%] vs 14 962 [60.1%]; aged 18–39 years, 129 085 [32.2%] vs 13 071 [62.1%]; current combustible cigarette use, 217 895 [7.9%] vs 8823 [51.8%]) (Table 1). Similar patterns were observed when comparing never e-cigarette users with former e-cigarette users (single, 120 797 [24.3%] vs 38 940 [46.7%]; men, 318 970 [46.6%] vs 55 727 [55.6%]; aged 18–39 years, 129 085 [32.2%] vs 48 808 [60.6%]; current combustible cigarette use, 217 895 [7.9%] vs 27 116 [46.7%]) (Table 1).

### Alterations in vascular function associated with the use of combustible and electronic cigarettes [^114rXMKG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been proposed as a potential harm reduction tool for combustible cigarette smokers. The majority of adult e-cigarette users continue to smoke combustible cigarettes and are considered dual users. The vascular impact of e-cigarettes remains incompletely defined. Methods and Results We examined the association of e-cigarette use with measures of vascular function and tonometry, preclinical measures of cardiovascular injury. As part of the CITU (Cardiovascular Injury due to Tobacco Use) study, we performed noninvasive vascular function testing in individuals without known cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease risk factors who were nonsmokers (n = 94), users of combustible cigarettes (n = 285), users of e-cigarettes (n = 36), or dual users (n = 52). In unadjusted analyses, measures of arterial stiffness including carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, carotid-radial pulse wave velocity, and central blood pressures differed across the use groups. In multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, race, and study site, combustible cigarette smokers had higher augmentation index compared with nonusers (129.8 ± 1.5 versus 118.8 ± 2.7, P = 0.003). The augmentation index was similar between combustible cigarette smokers compared with sole e-cigarette users (129.8 ± 1.5 versus 126.2 ± 5.9, P = 1.0) and dual users (129.8 ± 1.5 versus 134.9 ± 4.0, P = 1.0). Endothelial cells from combustible cigarette smokers and sole e-cigarette users produced less nitric oxide in response to A23187 stimulation compared with nonsmokers, suggestive of impaired endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling. Conclusions Our findings suggest that e-cigarette use is not associated with a more favorable vascular profile. Future longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the long-term risks of sustained e-cigarette use.

### Alterations in vascular function associated with the use of combustible and electronic cigarettes [^111fceLi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Electronic cigarettes (e‐cigarettes) have been proposed as a potential harm reduction tool for combustible cigarette smokers. The majority of adult e‐cigarette users continue to smoke combustible cigarettes and are considered dual users. The vascular impact of e‐cigarettes remains incompletely defined.

Methods and Results

We examined the association of e‐cigarette use with measures of vascular function and tonometry, preclinical measures of cardiovascular injury. As part of the(Cardiovascular Injury due to Tobacco Use) study, we performed noninvasive vascular function testing in individuals without known cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease risk factors who were nonsmokers (n = 94), users of combustible cigarettes (n = 285), users of e‐cigarettes (n = 36), or dual users (n = 52). In unadjusted analyses, measures of arterial stiffness including carotid‐femoral pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, carotid‐radial pulse wave velocity, and central blood pressures differed across the use groups. In multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, race, and study site, combustible cigarette smokers had higher augmentation index compared with nonusers (129.8 ± 1.5 versus 118.8 ± 2.7, P = 0.003). The augmentation index was similar between combustible cigarette smokers compared with sole e‐cigarette users (129.8 ± 1.5 versus 126.2 ± 5.9, P = 1.0) and dual users (129.8 ± 1.5 versus 134.9 ± 4.0, P = 1.0). Endothelial cells from combustible cigarette smokers and sole e‐cigarette users produced less nitric oxide in response to A23187 stimulation compared with nonsmokers, suggestive of impaired endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that e‐cigarette use is not associated with a more favorable vascular profile. Future longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the long‐term risks of sustained e‐cigarette use.

### E-cigarette screening in primary care [^112zVPKF]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary care visits present an opportune time to assess behaviors that contribute to patient health. Smoking, alcohol use, and illicit drugs are routinely documented in electronic health records, but less is known about screening for E-cigarette use and the prevalence of E-cigarette use in primary care settings.

Methods

Data include 134,931 adult patients who visited 1 of 41 primary care clinics within a 12-month period (June 1, 2021-June 1, 2022). Data on demographics, combustible tobacco, alcohol, illicit drug, and E-cigarette use were extracted from electronic medical records. Logistic regression was utilized to examine the variables associated with differential odds of being screened for E-cigarette use.

Results

Rates of E-cigarette screening (n = 46,997; 34.8%) were significantly lower than that of tobacco (n = 134,196; 99.5%), alcohol (n = 129,766; 96.2%), and illicit drug (n = 129,766; 92.6%) use. Of those assessed for E-cigarette use, 3.6% (n = 1,669) reported current use. Of those with documented nicotine use (n = 7,032), 17.2% (n = 1,207) used mono E-cigarettes exclusively, 76.3% (n = 5,364) used combustible tobacco exclusively, and 6.6% (n = 461) reported dual use (both E-cigarette use and combustible tobacco use). Those who used combustible tobacco or illicit substances as well as younger patients were more likely to have been screened for E-cigarette use.

Conclusions

Overall rates of E-cigarette screening were significantly lower than those of other substances. The use of combustible tobacco or illicit substances was associated with an increased likelihood of being screened. This finding may be because of the relatively recent proliferation of E-cigarettes, the recent addition of E-cigarette documentation to the electronic health record, or a lack of training on screening for E-cigarette use.

### Amyloid-β accumulation in the CNS in human growth hormone recipients in the UK [^114r3wN4]. Acta Neuropathologica (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 3
Typical neuropathological phenotypes in UK hGH-iCJD. PRNP codon 129 VV hGH-iCJD cases show microvacuolation in the cerebral cortex (a) with a combination of granular, perineuronal and plaque-like accumulations of PrP in the cerebral cortex (e). The cerebellar cortex in VV hGH-iCJD cases shows a predominantly granular pattern of PrP accumulation (i). PRNP codon 129 MV hGH-iCJD were characterised by the presence of kuru plaques in the cerebellar and occasionally in the cerebral cortex (b, f, j). PRNP codon 129 MM hGH-iCJD cases show widespread microvacuolation in the cerebral cortex (c) with a predominantly granular accumulation of PrP in the cerebral (g) and cerebellar cortex (k). Case hGH-iCJD31 shows atypical neuropathological features in comparison with the codon 129 MM hGH-iCJD cases. Microvacuolation was observed in the lower layers of the cerebral cortex (d) with a combination of granular, perineuronal and plaque-like accumulations of PrP in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex (h, l). No kuru-type amyloid plaques were present in any brain region. These features show some similarities to the VV2 histotype in sCJD. Sections a, c, e, and g, are stained with H&E and sections b, d, f, and h are stained with the KG9 antibody. The bar in a represents 25 µm for a, c – l; and 15 µm for b

### Management of communication disability in the first 90 days after stroke: a scoping review [^1143UvpG]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

People with communication disability after stroke need interventions to optimise healthcare communication and rehabilitation outcomes. Current evidence syntheses do not adequately inform the management of communication disability during the first 90days post-stroke.

Purpose

To explore the scope of literature for the management of communication disability in the first 90days after stroke.

Materials and Methods

A scoping review was conducted using a systematic keyword search of six databases. A descriptive synthesis was generated using communication-related domains related to the biopsychosocial framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF).

Results

A total of 129 studies met eligibility criteria. Aphasia was the most frequently addressed communication disability after stroke (76/129 studies) with a paucity of evidence investigating other acquired neurogenic communication impairments. Management predominantly focused on communication-related: body functions and structures (62 studies) (e.g., linguistic-behavioural therapies), followed by environmental factors (39 studies) (e.g., communication partner training/support); activities and participation (15 studies) (e.g., augmentative and alternative communication); and personal factors (13 studies) (e.g., assessment of depression after aphasia).

Conclusion

A coordinated, integrated approach to developing and testing acute and subacute interventions for all communication disabilities across all communication-related domains is required. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONInterdisciplinary stroke clinicians need to manage communication disabilities in the first 90 days after stroke to optimise healthcare communication and rehabilitation outcomes. There is some evidence to guide clinicians in aphasia management but less in other disabilities of speech and cognitive functioning. Most interventions to inform clinical practice address communication-related body functions and structures (e.g., linguistic and speech therapies). Clinicians need to address all domains and more evidence is needed to address environmental factors (e.g., communication support); activities and participation (e.g., person-centred goal setting); and personal factors (e.g., psychological care).

### Quantifying abnormal alveolar microstructure in cystic fibrosis lung disease via hyperpolarizedXe diffusion MRI [^114MjWmk]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) progresses through recurrent infection and inflammation, causing permanent lung function loss and airway remodeling. CT scans reveal abnormally low-density lung parenchyma in CF, but its microstructural nature remains insufficiently explored due to clinical CT limitations. To this end, diffusion-weighted 129 Xe MRI is a non-invasive and validated measure of lung microstructure. In this work, we investigate microstructural changes in people with CF (pwCF) relative to age-matched, healthy subjects using comprehensive imaging and analysis involving pulmonary-function tests (PFTs), and 129 Xe MRI.

Methods

38 healthy subjects (age 6–40; 17.2 ± 9.5 years) and 39 pwCF (age 6–40; 15.6 ± 8.0 years) underwent 129 Xe-diffusion MRI and PFTs. The distribution of diffusion measurements (i.e., apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) and morphometric parameters) was assessed via linear binning (LB). The resulting volume percentages of bins were compared between controls and pwCF. Mean ADC and morphometric parameters were also correlated with PFTs.

Results

Mean whole-lung ADC correlated significantly with age (P < 0.001) for both controls and CF, and with PFTs (P < 0.05) specifically for pwCF. Although there was no significant difference in mean ADC between controls and pwCF (P = 0.334), age-adjusted LB indicated significant voxel-level diffusion (i.e. ADC and morphometric parameters) differences in pwCF compared to controls (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

129 Xe diffusion MRI revealed microstructural abnormalities in CF lung disease. Smaller microstructural size may reflect compression from overall higher lung density due to interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, or other pathological changes. While elevated microstructural size may indicate emphysema-like remodeling due to chronic inflammation and infection.

### Comparative pathogenicity of bacteraemic isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae [^112Bi26Q]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Two bacteraemic isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Ah-2743 and Kp-129, respectively, were studied for their relative pathogenicity in comparison with Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Ah-2743 caused significantly higher serum levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta or IL-6 in human whole blood, and higher serum IL-1beta and IL-6 levels in infected mice, than did Kp-129 and E. coli ATCC 25922. In addition, in BALB/c mice infected by intraperitoneal inoculation, Ah-2743 caused a higher fatality rate (80%) than did Kp-129 (0%). With intramuscular inoculation, Ah-2743 caused more rapid and intense local accumulation of inflammatory cells than did Kp-129, and myonecrosis was present only in Ah-2743-infected mice. These data indicate that Ah-2743 is more pathogenic than Kp-129 or E. coli ATCC 25922 for BALB/c mice. The cellular components or extracellular factors associated with increased cytokine induction and pathogenicity of A. hydrophila in mice merit further investigation.

### Phenotypic diversity of genetic creutzfeldt-jakob disease: a histo-molecular-based classification [^112GNdFk]. Acta Neuropathologica (2021). Medium credibility.

The current classification of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) includes six major clinicopathological subtypes defined by the physicochemical properties of the protease-resistant core of the pathologic prion protein (PrP Sc), defining two major PrP Sc types (i.e., 1 and 2), and the methionine (M)/valine (V) polymorphic codon 129 of the prion protein gene (PRNP). How these sCJD subtypes relate to the well-documented phenotypic heterogeneity of genetic CJD (gCJD) is not fully understood. We analyzed molecular and phenotypic features in 208 individuals affected by gCJD, carrying 17 different mutations, and compared them with those of a large series of sCJD cases. We identified six major groups of gCJD based on the combination PrP Sc type and codon 129 genotype on PRNP mutated allele, each showing distinctive histopathological characteristics, irrespectively of the PRNP associated mutation. Five gCJD groups, named M1, M2C, M2T, V1, and V2, largely reproduced those previously described in sCJD subtypes. The sixth group shared phenotypic traits with the V2 group and was only detected in patients carrying the E200K-129M haplotype in association with a PrP Sc type of intermediate size ("i") between type 1 and type 2. Additional mutation-specific effects involved the pattern of PrP deposition (e.g., a "thickened" synaptic pattern in E200K carriers, cerebellar "stripe-like linear granular deposits" in those with insertion mutations, and intraneuronal globular dots in E200K-V2 or -M"i"). A few isolated cases linked to rare PRNP haplotypes (e.g. T183A-129M), showed atypical phenotypic features, which prevented their classification into the six major groups. The phenotypic variability of gCJD is mostly consistent with that previously found in sCJD. As in sCJD, the codon 129 genotype and physicochemical properties of PrP Sc significantly correlated with the phenotypic variability of gCJD. The most common mutations linked to CJD appear to have a variable and overall less significant effect on the disease phenotype, but they significantly influence disease susceptibility often in a strain-specific manner. The criteria currently used for sCJD subtypes can be expanded and adapted to gCJD to provide an updated classification of the disease with a molecular basis.

Post-endovascular thrombectomy blood pressure targets — trial outcomes indicate no benefit and potential harm with very low targets. In BP TARGET, rates of any and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage were similar between systolic blood pressure (SBP) goals of 110 to 129 mm Hg and 130 to 185 mm Hg. ENCHANTED-2 MT, comparing SBP goals of < 120 mm Hg and 140 to 180 mm Hg, was stopped early due to increased worse global disability in the < 120-mm Hg group (OR: 1.53 [95% CI: 1.18–1.97]). OPTIMAL BP, which compared SBP goals of < 140 mm Hg versus 140 to 180 mm Hg, was also stopped early with lower rates of improved outcomes at 90 days, with modified Rankin scale score 0 to 2 of 39.4% in the < 140-mm Hg group versus 54.4% in the 140- to 180-mm Hg group. The BEST-II trial showed that an SBP target of < 140 mm Hg was potentially harmful and indicated a low probability of benefit of post-endovascular thrombectomy BP lowering in a prespecified analysis.

### Application of the defect distribution index to functional lung MRI of pediatric cystic fibrosis lung disease and controls [^114PsnNr]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lung usually assesses lung impairment as ventilation defect percentage (VDP). However, VDP only reflects the overall burden of disease and does not characterize the regional distribution (i.e. pattern) of defects. The defect distribution index (DDI) is a metric which shows quantitatively how clustered versus scattered defects are with a higher DDI indicating more clustered defects.

Aim

To assess the applicability and validity of the DDI to 129 Xe-MRI and PREFUL-MRI of CF lung disease.

Methods

The DDI algorithm was applied to fractional ventilation maps previously acquired with 129 Xe-MRI and PREFUL-MRI of 37 children with CF and 13 healthy controls.

Results

The calculation of DDI was feasible for all MRI data. DDI was significantly higher in patients with CF compared to healthy controls (mean difference [95% CI] 129 Xe-MRI DDI 60%mean -1.94 [-2.86 - -1.02], p = 0.0001), strongly correlated with other functional outcomes such as VDP and the lung clearance index, and decreased significantly in CF patients with pulmonary exacerbations after antibiotic treatment (e.g. 129 Xe-MRI DDI 60% mean -1.03 [-0.44 - -1.63], p = 0.002).

Conclusion

The DDI is applicable to functional 129 Xe-MRI and PREFUL-MRI data providing complementary information to VDP by assessing defect distribution rather than defect size. It shows meaningful clinimetric properties and improves with treatment. The DDI shows potential as a parameter for comprehensive monitoring of CF lung disease and treatment.

### Sucralfate (Carafate) [^117PZFVy]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

A D VE R S E R E A C T I O NS

Adverse reactions to sucralfate in clinical trials were minor and only rarely led to discontinuation of the drug. In studies involving over 2700 patients treated with sucralfate tablets, adverse effects were reported in 129 (4.7%).

Constipation was the most frequent complaint (2%). Other adverse effects reported in less than 0.5% of the patients are listed below by body system:

G a s t r oin t e s t inal: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, gastric discomfort, indigestion, flatulence, dry mouth

De r ma t olo g i c a l: pruritus, rash

Ne r v ous S y s t em: dizziness, insomnia, sleepiness, vertigo

Ot he r: back pain, headache

P os t- ma r k e t in g: cases of hypersensitivity have been reported with the use of sucralfate tablets, including dyspnea, lip swelling, pruritus, rash, and urticaria.

Cases of anaphylactic reactions, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, edema of the mouth, Pharyngeal edema, respiratory tract edema and swelling of the face have been reported with an unknown oral formulation of sucralfate.

Bezoars have been reported in patients treated with sucralfate. The majority of patients had underlying medical conditions that may predispose to bezoar formation (such as delayed gastric emptying) or were receiving concomitant enteral tube feedings.

Inadvertent injection of insoluble sucralfate and its insoluble excipients has led to fatal complications, including pulmonary and cerebral emboli. Sucralfate is n ot intended for intravenous administration.

### Entamoeba species in south Africa: correlations with the host microbiome, parasite burdens, and first description of entamoeba Bangladeshi outside of Asia [^113dd3i6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Diarrhea is frequent in communities without clean water, which include low-income South African populations in Giyani and Pretoria. In these populations, the amount of diarrhea caused by Entamoeba histolytica, inclusive of all ages, sexes, and human immunodeficiency virus status, is uncertain. Infection with E. histolytica can modulate the host microbiota, and a key species indicative of this is the Prevotella copri pathobiont.

Methods

A cross-sectional study of patients attending gastroenterology clinics was conducted to determine the frequency and burden of 4 Entamoeba species and P. copri.

Results

Entamoeba species were present in 27% of patients (129/484), with E. histolytica detected in 8.5% (41), E. dispar in 8% (38), E. bangladeshi in 4.75% (23), and E. moshkovskii in 0%. This is the first description of E. bangladeshi outside Bangladesh. In E. histolytica-positive samples, the levels of both the parasite and P. copri were lower in nondiarrheal samples, validating the results of a study in Bangladesh (P = 0.0034). By contrast, in E. histolytica-negative samples positive for either of the nonpathogenic species E. dispar or E. bangladeshi, neither P. copri nor Entamoeba levels were linked to gastrointestinal status.

Conclusions

Nonmorphologic identification of this parasite is essential. In South Africa, 3 morphologically identical Entamoeba were common, but only E. histolytica was linked to both disease and changes in the microbiota.

### Comparison of LDL-cholesterol direct measurement with the estimate using the friedewald formula in a sample of 10, 664 patients [^114BNdyo]. Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "LDL Calculated" for coronary artery disease, hypertriglyceridemia and dyslipidemia.

The Friedewald formula estimates LDL cholesterol from total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, a key marker of cardiovascular risk. LDL targets vary based on risk, with stricter goals for high-risk patients.

The LDL Cholesterol Calculator is designed to estimate the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood, providing an essential insight into cardiovascular health. It achieves this by requiring input values for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. These values can be entered in either mg/dL or mmol/L, and if needed, the calculator will convert the values to mg/dL using precise conversion factors: 38.67 for total and HDL cholesterol, and 88.57 for triglycerides.

With the necessity of unit conversion addressed, the LDL cholesterol is calculated using the following formula:

LDL cholesterol = total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - (triglycerides / 5)

This equation effectively estimates the LDL cholesterol, delivering the result in mg/dL and rounding it to two decimal places for precision.

The calculator then categorizes the LDL cholesterol level into one of several interpretation ranges, providing clarity on the result and its implications:

- LDL Cholesterol < 100 mg/dL is considered "Optimal", suggesting a lower cardiovascular risk.
- A reading between 100 and 129 mg/dL is "Near optimal/above optimal", signifying a slightly increased risk.
- Values from 130 to 159 mg/dL are labeled as "Borderline high", hinting at moderate risk levels.
- Results ranging from 160 to 189 mg/dL are classified as "High", indicating a significant risk that may necessitate intervention.
- An LDL level ≥ 190 mg/dL is "Very high", clearly pointing to a need for medical attention and lifestyle changes.

This categorization aligns with clinical guidelines, assisting individuals and healthcare providers in understanding cardiovascular risk and making informed decisions regarding health management.

### Locally-adapted reproductive photoperiodism determines population vulnerability to climate change in burying beetles [^112B9kE6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Study site

The burying beetle Nicrophorus nepalensis (Coleoptera: Silphidae) occurs widely across mountain ranges throughout Asia. We quantified the monthly population densities of N. nepalensis at 100 m intervals along elevational gradients at five mountain ranges in Asia located from 24 °N to 30 °N that varied in maximum elevation from 700 m to 4100 m (Fig. 2). We define the breeding season of N. nepalensis as the months that at least one beetle appeared in the trap. The mountain ranges, which differed in both their thermal environment (due to elevation) and daylength (due to latitude), included two low mountain ranges — Wulai in Taiwan, with natural habitats ranging from 200 m (121° 51′ E, 24° 83′ N) to 900 m (121° 54′ E, 24° 85′ N) above sea level and Amami Oshima in Japan, ranging from 60 m (129° 27′ E, 28° 32′ N) to 700 m (129° 32′ E, 28° 30′ N) — and three high mountain ranges — Mt. Lala in Taiwan, ranging from 400 m (121° 51′ E, 24° 60′ N) to 2000 m (121° 43′ E, 24° 73′ N), Mt. Hehuan in Taiwan, ranging from 500 m (121° 00′ E, 23° 98′ N) to 3200 m (121° 27′ E, 24° 13′ N), and Mt. Jiajin in China, ranging from 800 m (102° 84′ E, 30° 23′ N) to 4100 m (102° 68′ E, 30° 86′ N).

The NHLBI convened a working group on October 23, 2019, to identify the most relevant and urgent research priorities and prevailing challenges in e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). Experts across multiple disciplines discussed the complexities of the EVALI outbreak, identified research priorities, and recommended strategies to address most effectively its causal factors and improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this disease. Many research priorities were identified, including the need to create national and international registries of patients with EVALI, to track accurately those affected and assess outcomes. The group concluded that biospecimens from subjects with EVALI are urgently needed to help define EVALI pathogenesis and that vaping has disease risks that are disparate from smoking, with the occurrence of EVALI highlighting the importance of broadening e-cigarette research beyond comparators to smoking-related diseases.

### Safety and efficacy of a recombinant hepatitis E vaccine [^114xR5MA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important cause of viral hepatitis. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of an HEV recombinant protein (rHEV) vaccine in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Methods

In Nepal, we studied 2000 healthy adults susceptible to HEV infection who were randomly assigned to receive three doses of either the rHEV vaccine or placebo at months 0, 1, and 6. Active (including hospital) surveillance was used to identify acute hepatitis and adverse events. The primary end point was the development of hepatitis E after three vaccine doses.

Results

A total of 1794 subjects (898 in the vaccine group and 896 in the placebo group) received three vaccine doses; the total vaccinated cohort was followed for a median of 804 days. After three vaccine doses, hepatitis E developed in 69 subjects, of whom 66 were in the placebo group. The vaccine efficacy was 95.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 85.6 to 98.6). In an intention-to-treat analysis that included all 87 subjects in whom hepatitis E developed after the first vaccine dose, 9 subjects were in the vaccine group, with a vaccine efficacy of 88.5% (95% CI, 77.1 to 94.2). Among subjects in a subgroup randomly selected for analysis of injection-site findings and general symptoms (reactogenicity subgroup) during the 8-day period after the administration of any dose, the proportion of subjects with adverse events was similar in the two study groups, except that injection-site pain was increased in the vaccine group (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

In a high-risk population, the rHEV vaccine was effective in the prevention of hepatitis E. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00287469 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).

Whilst we have presented an overview of the literature linking gamma and beta power/frequency to E/ I activity and associated pharmacological studies, indeed, all oscillatory activity, regardless of the frequency band measured using EEG, is due to reciprocal interactions of excitatory and inhibitory neurons within reciprocal feedback loops. However, gamma and beta power have been more specifically investigated within the context of preclinical work and pharmacological studies examining how they are modulated. The specific cell networks have hence been described more thoroughly. Moreover, the modulation of gamma and beta power/frequency, as the result of a pharmacological challenge, may be the result of a frequency shift and an accompanying up or downregulation of oscillations in a separate frequency band. We encourage future research to focus more specifically on the network of up/downregulation across the frequency spectrum in response to pharmacological manipulation.

### Evaluation after a first seizure in adults [^113J8fXZ]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for first seizure in adults, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, AAFP 2022 guidelines recommend to assess for history of medication or substance use that can provoke seizures through normal use, withdrawal, overdose, drug-drug interaction, or impaired metabolism due to comorbidities.

### ESTES guidelines: acute mesenteric ischaemia [^116Px8T7]. European Journal of Trauma and Emergency Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute mesenteric ischemia, more specifically with respect to second-look procedures, ESTES 2016 guidelines recommend to perform exteriorization of the bowel if there is still doubt about its viability during the second-look procedure.
