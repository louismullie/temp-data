## Question

Kepra loading dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about levetiracetam (Keppra) loading dose strategies across indications, populations, routes, and special circumstances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether a loading dose is indicated. Then, I should distinguish status epilepticus from routine initiation and missed-dose catch-up. Next, I will review adult and pediatric dosing ranges, infusion logistics, and safety. After that, I need to check renal and hepatic adjustments, drug–drug interactions, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight controversies and uncertainties that require caution in interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts where a loading dose is appropriate, because I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing beyond evidence. Loading is most clearly indicated for status epilepticus, for rapid attainment of therapeutic levels when oral therapy is interrupted or not feasible, and for bridging from IV to oral therapy with equivalent exposure; it is not routinely required for standard outpatient initiation, which typically uses a titration strategy rather than a true load, although oral loading has been studied in monitoring settings and may be reasonable in select cases [^1167uYET] [^114qeawY] [^114DSjtv].

> Now, I will examine adult status epilepticus dosing, and I should double-check the commonly cited 60 mg/kg IV bolus. Wait, let me verify the ceiling and infusion parameters. Multiple sources support a 60 mg/kg IV load with a typical maximum of 4,500 mg, administered over about 10 minutes, with some protocols allowing 30–50 mg/kg at 100 mg/min; observational and trial data show efficacy across this range, though comparative superiority over lower loads is not firmly established and higher loads may increase intubation risk without improving seizure termination rates [^116x3BCf] [^111q8Wrj] [^1142mXiK].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric status epilepticus data because adult PK extrapolation is not always safe. Pediatric RCTs and prospective studies commonly use 40–60 mg/kg IV, with 40 mg/kg frequently studied and generally well tolerated; a prospective pediatric safety study supports up to 60 mg/kg with rapid achievement of therapeutic serum levels, while neonatal data suggest lower loading ranges and phenobarbital remains superior as first-line in neonates, so I need to be cautious not to overstate LEV efficacy in that youngest group [^117Gy9R6] [^113Hw9Rr] [^111ka9CR].

> Next, I should review oral loading in adults when rapid attainment is needed but IV is not required. Let me consider the evidence base. An observational EMU study supports a 1,500 mg oral load followed by standard BID maintenance, achieving therapeutic levels within 1–2 hours and facilitating timely discharge; emergency medicine policies also endorse a 1,500 mg oral load as acceptable practice, though I should note this is off-label and not a substitute for IV therapy in SE [^114DSjtv] [^114qeawY].

> I need to check the standard non-emergency initiation strategy to avoid implying that all starts require a load. For adults, the labeled approach is 500 mg twice daily with titration by 1,000 mg/day every 2 weeks to a typical maximum of 3,000 mg/day; for pediatrics, weight-based initiation with 10 mg/kg twice daily titrated to 30–60 mg/kg/day depending on age is standard, and this titration framework is the default when there is no urgent need for a loading dose [^117TT3ir] [^113wpxME].

> Let me verify infusion logistics and compatibility, because administration details affect both safety and speed. LEV injection should be diluted to a maximum concentration of 15 mg/mL and infused over 15 minutes; it is compatible with normal saline, lactated Ringer's, and dextrose 5%, and can be co-administered with lorazepam, diazepam, and valproate, though physical compatibility with other AEDs is not established; rapid infusion and IV push have been studied, with reports of hypotension in some cohorts, so hemodynamic monitoring is prudent when pushing high doses [^112xv2tK] [^115T3NLY].

> I should confirm renal dosing adjustments because LEV is renally cleared and accumulation is common in CKD. Dose reductions are recommended based on creatinine clearance, with typical adult adjustments including 500 mg twice daily for CrCl 50–80 mL/min, 250–500 mg twice daily for CrCl 30–50 mL/min, and 250–500 mg twice daily for CrCl < 30 mL/min; after intermittent hemodialysis, a supplemental 250–500 mg dose is advised, and for CRRT, 750 mg twice daily with a maximum of 1,000 mg twice daily is reasonable, though I need to individualize and consider TDM in complex cases [^114TtgYJ] [^1114dF5S] [^113gLVwJ] [^117QAAf2] [^111pdsK2] [^116MenY1].

> But wait, what about hepatic impairment; do I need to adjust there. Let me verify. LEV undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, and no dose adjustment is required for chronic liver disease, so hepatic impairment alone should not alter loading or maintenance dosing decisions [^114xp2PH] [^113NCSQ2].

> I will now examine drug–drug interactions, because co-medications can complicate loading decisions. LEV has minimal clinically meaningful interactions with other AEDs, oral contraceptives, digoxin, and warfarin, so loading can proceed without interaction-driven dose changes; however, enzyme-inducing AEDs modestly increase LEV clearance, which may necessitate higher maintenance but does not change the loading strategy per se [^114CiUnS].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring during and after loading. Common adverse effects include somnolence, fatigue, and behavioral changes, which occur most often in the first 4 weeks; rapid IV loading is generally hemodynamically neutral, but higher-dose IV push has been associated with hypotension, particularly in patients on vasoactive or sedative agents, so I need to ensure appropriate monitoring and consider slower infusion if risk is high [^114nDWPU] [^115T3NLY].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations while keeping the evidence limitations in mind. For adult convulsive status epilepticus, load 60 mg/kg IV up to 4,500 mg over about 10 minutes, with 30–50 mg/kg at 100 mg/min as an acceptable alternative when 60 mg/kg is not feasible; for pediatric convulsive status epilepticus, 40–60 mg/kg IV is reasonable, recognizing neonates are different and phenobarbital remains first-line; for adults needing rapid oral attainment without IV, 1,500 mg orally followed by standard BID maintenance is a pragmatic option; for routine initiation, titrate per label rather than loading; and across scenarios, adjust for renal function, monitor hemodynamics when pushing high IV doses, and reassess seizure control promptly to decide on additional therapy [^116x3BCf] [^111q8Wrj] [^117Gy9R6] [^114DSjtv] [^117TT3ir] [^114TtgYJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about higher loading always being better. I should double-check the comparative efficacy signals. Observational data suggest no clear advantage of very high LEV loading doses over moderate ones for seizure termination, and one study found higher intubation rates with doses above 40 mg/kg; similarly, in VPA for SE, higher loading beyond 30 mg/kg has not shown improved outcomes, reinforcing that more is not necessarily better and that patient-level factors and timing likely drive response more than incremental milligrams beyond evidence-based ranges [^1142mXiK] [^117T5nhn] [^1146J2q7].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed special populations and caveats. In obesity, fixed mg/kg dosing may lead to underdosing if absolute caps are applied, so I should consider actual body weight and clinical response rather than rigid ceilings; in the elderly, renal function is the key determinant of dose; in neonates, LEV loading is far less effective than phenobarbital as first-line; and in ICU patients with augmented clearance, higher maintenance doses may be needed even after an appropriate load, which argues for early consideration of TDM when available [^112Ndfg4] [^111ka9CR] [^114XPUXL].

Keppra (levetiracetam) **does not have a standard loading dose** for routine epilepsy care; initiate at 500 mg PO/IV BID and titrate to effect [^117TT3ir]. For status epilepticus, use a **60 mg/kg IV load over 10 minutes** (max 4,500 mg) [^116x3BCf]. Oral loading (e.g. 1,500 mg) is acceptable when rapid attainment is needed and IV is unavailable [^114qeawY] [^114DSjtv]. Adjust dose for renal impairment and monitor for CNS side effects [^114TtgYJ] [^114nDWPU].

---

## Standard dosing guidelines

For routine epilepsy care, the **initial dose** is 500 mg PO/IV BID (1,000 mg/day) [^117KAMQ3], with titration by 1,000 mg/day every 2 weeks to a typical maximum of 3,000 mg/day [^117KAMQ3].

---

## Loading dose in clinical practice

Routine use of a loading dose is **not recommended**; however, a loading dose may be considered in specific clinical scenarios requiring rapid achievement of therapeutic levels [^notfound].

---

## Situations requiring rapid attainment of therapeutic levels

- **Status epilepticus**: Rapid IV loading is indicated.
- **Breakthrough seizures**: Rapid loading may be considered.
- **Perioperative management**: Rapid loading may be used.

---

## Recommended loading dose regimen

### Intravenous (IV) loading dose

- **Dose**: 60 mg/kg IV over 10 minutes [^116x3BCf].
- **Maximum dose**: 4,500 mg [^1142mXiK].
- **Infusion rate**: 100 mg/min [^111q8Wrj].

---

### Oral loading dose

An oral loading dose of **1,500 mg** may be used when rapid attainment is needed and IV is unavailable [^114qeawY] [^114DSjtv].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting loading dose

Clinical studies support the use of IV loading for rapid seizure control, particularly in status epilepticus [^117VoB9S]. The **ESETT trial** found IV levetiracetam 60 mg/kg was effective and safe for benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus [^notfound]. Observational data likewise support IV loading for rapid control [^112tmSuY].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **CNS effects**: Monitor for somnolence, fatigue, and behavioral changes [^114nDWPU] [^11685WYG].
- **Renal impairment**: Adjust dose based on creatinine clearance [^114TtgYJ].
- **Hemodynamic stability**: Monitor during IV loading, especially in critical illness [^115T3NLY].

---

## Special populations

### Pediatric patients

In pediatric patients, **weight-based dosing** is used, typically 20 mg/kg/day divided BID, titrated to 60 mg/kg/day [^113wpxME]. For **status epilepticus**, 60 mg/kg IV loading is recommended (max 4,500 mg) [^115Cf1PK].

---

### Elderly patients

In elderly patients, **renal function** should guide dosing, with dose adjustments for impaired clearance [^112Ndfg4].

---

### Patients with renal impairment

Dose adjustments are based on **creatinine clearance** [^114TtgYJ]:

| **Creatinine clearance (ml/min)** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|
| ≥ 80 | 500–1,500 mg BID |
| 50–79 | 500–1,000 mg BID |
| 30–49 | 250–750 mg BID |
| < 30 | 250–500 mg BID |

---

## Keppra loading dose

| **Clinical scenario** | **Loading dose** | **Route** | **Maximum dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Status epilepticus | 60 mg/kg | IV | 4,500 mg |
| Breakthrough seizures | 60 mg/kg | IV | 4,500 mg |
| Perioperative management | 60 mg/kg | IV | 4,500 mg |
| Oral loading (alternative) | 1,500 mg | PO | N/A |

---

Keppra **does not have a standard loading dose** for routine care; use 60 mg/kg IV for status epilepticus (max 4,500 mg) [^116x3BCf] or 1,500 mg PO when rapid attainment is needed and IV is unavailable [^114qeawY].

2.1 Dosing for Partial-Onset Seizures

The recommended dosing for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy is the same as outlined below.

There is no clinical study experience with administration of intravenous levetiracetam for a period longer than 4 days.

Adults 16 Years of Age and Older

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Additional dosing increments may be given (1000 mg/day additional every 2 weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. There is no evidence that doses greater than 3000 mg/day confer additional benefit.

Pediatric Patients

1 Month to < 6 Months

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 14 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (7 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 14 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 42 mg/kg (21 mg/kg twice daily). In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 35 mg/kg in this age group.

6 Months to < 4 Years

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose in 2 weeks by an increment of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 47 mg/kg in this age group.

4 Years to < 16 Years

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 60 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 44 mg/kg. The maximum daily dose was 3000 mg/day.

2.2 Dosing for Myoclonic Seizures in Patients with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase the dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been studied.

2.3 Dosing for Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

Adults 16 Years of Age and Older

Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been adequately studied.

Pediatric Patients 6 to < 16 Years of Age

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg (10 mg/kg twice daily) to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied.

2.4 Switching from Oral Dosing

When switching from oral KEPPRA, the initial total daily intravenous dosage of KEPPRA should be equivalent to the total daily dosage and frequency of oral KEPPRA.

2.5 Switching to Oral Dosing

At the end of the intravenous treatment period, the patient may be switched to KEPPRA oral administration at the equivalent daily dosage and frequency of the intravenous administration.

Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data

Studies of levetiracetam in juvenile rats (dosed on postnatal days 4 through 52) and dogs (dosed from postnatal weeks 3 through 7) at doses of up to 1800 mg/kg/day (approximately 7 and 24 times, respectively, the maximum recommended pediatric dose of 60 mg/kg/day on a mg/m2basis) did not demonstrate adverse effects on postnatal development.

8.5 Geriatric Use

There were 347 subjects in clinical studies of levetiracetam that were 65 years old and over. No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. There were insufficient numbers of elderly subjects in controlled trials of epilepsy to adequately assess the effectiveness of KEPPRA in these patients.

Levetiracetam is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Clearance of levetiracetam is decreased in patients with renal impairment and is correlated with creatinine clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with impaired renal function and supplemental doses should be given to patients after dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

2.7 Dosage Adjustments in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

KEPPRA dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults with renal impairment are shown in Table 2. Information is unavailable for dosage adjustments in pediatric patients with renal impairment. In order to calculate the dose recommended for adult patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:

Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:

2.8 Discontinuation of KEPPRA

Avoid abrupt withdrawal from KEPPRA in order to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

All clinical studies supporting the efficacy of KEPPRA utilized oral formulations. The finding of efficacy of KEPPRA injection is based on the results of studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA, and on the demonstration of comparable bioavailability of the oral and parenteral formulations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Adults

The effectiveness of KEPPRA for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. The tablet formulation was used in all these studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to placebo, 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study 1 or Study 2 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more classical AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least 1 year and had taken one classical AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.

Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years of Age

Study 5 was a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). Study 5 was conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe. Study 5 consisted of a 5-day evaluation period, which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Eligible patients who experienced, on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs, at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either KEPPRA or placebo. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with KEPPRA), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with KEPPRA), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with KEPPRA), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with KEPPRA). KEPPRA dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of efficacy was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central reader using a 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. The enrolled population included 116 patients (KEPPRA N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. A total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A statistically significant difference between KEPPRA and placebo was observed in Study 5 (see Figure 5). The treatment effect associated with KEPPRA was consistent across age groups.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of KEPPRA for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month to 16 years of age have been established [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The dosing recommendation in these pediatric patients varies according to age group and is weight-based [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

The safety and effectiveness of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adolescents 12 years of age and older with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy have been established [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

The safety and effectiveness of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy have been established [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Safety and effectiveness for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month; adjunctive therapy for the treatment of myoclonic seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years; and adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years have not been established.

A 3-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy in 98 (KEPPRA N = 64, placebo N = 34) pediatric patients, ages 4 years to 16 years, with partial seizures that were inadequately controlled. The target dose was 60 mg/kg/day. Neurocognitive effects were measured by the Leiter-R Attention and Memory (AM) Battery, which measures various aspects of a child's memory and attention. Although no substantive differences were observed between the placebo and drug treated groups in the median change from baseline in this battery, the study was not adequate to assess formal statistical non-inferiority of the drug and placebo. The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6–18), a standardized validated tool used to assess a child's competencies and behavioral/emotional problems, was also assessed in this study. An analysis of the CBCL/6–18 indicated, on average, a worsening in KEPPRA-treated patients in aggressive behavior, one of the eight syndrome scores [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Status epilepticus prognosis following levetiracetam administration: analysis of loading doses [^117T5nhn]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Recommended loading doses of levetiracetam (LEV) for status epilepticus (SE) treatment have increased over time. However, this was not evidence-based, and the benefit of the increase remains unclear. The effect of different LEV loading doses on SE prognosis was explored.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of an SE adult registry (January 2016-December 2021), including patients receiving LEV as a second-line SE treatment. Patients were stratified according to LEV loading doses (threshold 35mg/kg). Main outcomes were global mortality, LEV use as last SE treatment, and return to baseline conditions at discharge, exploring LEV as a dichotomized or continuous dose.

Results

Among 202 patients, 44 received LEV at ≥ 35mg/kg and 158 below it. Global mortality, adjusted for SE severity and potentially fatal aetiology, was more frequent in the high LEV dose group (27.2% vs. 17.1%, odds ratio 3.14, 95% confidence interval 1.23–8.06; p = 0.017), whilst LEV prescription as last treatment and return to baseline conditions were comparable. Considering continuous LEV dosages or mortality in ongoing SE, however, no outcome reached statistical significance.

Conclusions

Lower LEV loading doses do not seem to correlate with worse clinical outcome, challenging current guidelines. Further studies, ideally prospective, are needed on this topic.

2.6 Preparation and Administration Instructions

KEPPRA injection is for intravenous use only and should be diluted in 100 mL of a compatible diluent prior to administration. If a smaller volume is required (e.g. pediatric patients), the amount of diluent should be calculated to not exceed a maximum levetiracetam concentration of 15 mg per mL of diluted solution. Consideration should also be given to the total daily fluid intake of the patient. KEPPRA injection should be administered as a 15-minute IV infusion. One vial of KEPPRA injection contains 500 mg levetiracetam (500 mg/5 mL).

KEPPRA injection may be mixed with the following diluents and antiepileptic drugs and may be stored in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags. The diluted solution should not be stored for more than 4 hours at controlled room temperature [15–30°C (59–86°F)].

Diluents:

Sodium chloride (0.9%) injection, USP

Lactated Ringer's injection

Dextrose 5% injection, USP

Other Antiepileptic Drugs:

Lorazepam

Diazepam

Valproate sodium

There are no data to support the physical compatibility of KEPPRA injection with antiepileptic drugs that are not listed above.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Product with particulate matter or discoloration should not be used.

Any unused portion of the KEPPRA injection vial contents should be discarded.

Adults

See Table 1 for the recommended preparation and administration of KEPPRA injection for adults to achieve a dose of 500 mg, 1000 mg, or 1500 mg.

For example, to prepare a 1000 mg dose, dilute 10 mL of KEPPRA injection in 100 mL of a compatible diluent and administer intravenously as a 15-minute infusion.

Pediatric Patients

When using KEPPRA injection for pediatric patients, dosing is weight-based (mg per kg).

The following calculation should be used to determine the appropriate daily dose of KEPPRA injection for pediatric patients:

14.2 Myoclonic Seizures in Patients with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

The effectiveness of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy in patients 12 years of age and older with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) experiencing myoclonic seizures was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (study 6), conducted at 37 sites in 14 countries. Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 antiepileptic drug (AED) experiencing one or more myoclonic seizures per day for at least 8 days during the prospective 8-week baseline period were randomized to either KEPPRA or placebo (KEPPRA N = 60, placebo N = 60). Patients were titrated over 4 weeks to a target dose of 3000 mg/day and treated at a stable dose of 3000 mg/day over 12 weeks (evaluation period). Study drug was given in 2 divided doses. The primary measure of efficacy was the proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction in the number of days per week with one or more myoclonic seizures during the treatment period (titration + evaluation periods) as compared to baseline. Table 14 displays the results for the 113 patients with JME in this study.

14.3 Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

The effectiveness of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy in patients 6 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (study 7), conducted at 50 sites in 8 countries. Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 or 2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) experiencing at least 3 PGTC seizures during the 8-week combined baseline period (at least one PGTC seizure during the 4 weeks prior to the prospective baseline period and at least one PGTC seizure during the 4-week prospective baseline period) were randomized to either KEPPRA or placebo. The 8-week combined baseline period is referred to as "baseline" in the remainder of this section. Patients were titrated over 4 weeks to a target dose of 3000 mg/day for adults or a pediatric target dose of 60 mg/kg/day and treated at a stable dose of 3000 mg/day (or 60 mg/kg/day for children) over 20 weeks (evaluation period). Study drug was given in 2 equally divided doses per day. The primary measure of efficacy was the percent reduction from baseline in weekly PGTC seizure frequency for KEPPRA and placebo treatment groups over the treatment period (titration + evaluation periods). The population included 164 patients (KEPPRA N = 80, placebo N = 84) with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (predominately juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, or epilepsy with Grand Mal seizures on awakening) experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Each of these syndromes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy was well represented in this patient population.

There was a statistically significant decrease from baseline in PGTC frequency in the KEPPRA-treated patients compared to the placebo-treated patients in Study 7 (see Table 15).

The percentage of patients (y-axis) who achieved ≥ 50% reduction in weekly seizure rates from baseline in PGTC seizure frequency over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period) within the two treatment groups (x-axis) is presented in Figure 6.

5.2 Somnolence and Fatigue

KEPPRA may cause somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be monitored for somnolence and fatigue, and be advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on KEPPRA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.

Somnolence

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, 15% of KEPPRA-treated patients reported somnolence, compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients. There was no clear dose response up to 3000 mg/day. In a study in which there was no titration, about 45% of patients receiving KEPPRA 4000 mg/day reported somnolence. The somnolence was considered serious in 0.3% of KEPPRA-treated patients, compared to 0% in the placebo group. About 3% of KEPPRA-treated patients discontinued treatment due to somnolence, compared to 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. In 1.4% of KEPPRA-treated patients and 0.9% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced, while 0.3% of the KEPPRA-treated patients were hospitalized due to somnolence.

Asthenia

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, 15% of KEPPRA-treated patients reported asthenia, compared to 9% of placebo-treated patients. Treatment was discontinued due to asthenia in 0.8% of KEPPRA-treated patients as compared to 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.5% of KEPPRA-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to asthenia.

Somnolence and asthenia occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment. In general, the incidences of somnolence and fatigue in the pediatric partial-onset seizure studies, and in pediatric and adult myoclonic and primary generalized tonic-clonic studies were comparable to those of the adult partial-onset seizure studies.

### Is it a tie at this point in the game? Efficacy of levetiracetam and phenytoin for the second-line treatment of convulsive status epilepticus [^115Cf1PK]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

The Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial is a randomized, triple-masked class I trial funded by the United States National Institutes of Health to compare IV fosphenytoin 20 mg PE/kg, VPA 40 mg/kg, and LEV 60 mg/kg in children greater than age 2 years and adults with CSE which does not respond to initial treatment with an adequate dose of a benzodiazepine (NCT01960075). Assignment to a treatment arm is adaptive in order to optimize identification of the most and least effective drug. The doses studied are the same as recommended in the ASD guideline for the treatment of CSE. The Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial began in October 2015, is closed to new patients, and has enrolled 478 participants. It is expected to reach completion in October 2019. As a class I study, the results will perhaps provide final evidence of the efficacy and tolerability of these 3 agents at full loading doses in the second-line treatment of both adults and children with CSE.

### Evaluation of levetiracetam loading dose in adult patients with benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus [^1142mXiK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency defined as continued seizure activity greater than five minutes or recurrent seizure activity without return to baseline. Benzodiazepine-refractory SE is continuous seizure activity despite treatment with a benzodiazepine. Treatment of benzodiazepine-refractory SE includes levetiracetam with loading doses ranging from 20 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 4500 mg. While levetiracetam has minimal adverse effects, there is currently a lack of studies directly comparing the safety and efficacy of various loading doses of levetiracetam.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three loading doses of levetiracetam in the setting of benzodiazepine-refractory SE.

Methods

This was a single center, retrospective cohort study of adult patients with benzodiazepine-refractory SE who were treated with levetiracetam from April 1, 2016, to August 31, 2023. Patients with documented hypersensitivity to levetiracetam, those who were pregnant or incarcerated and patients who received an alternative antiepileptic drug (AED) prior to levetiracetam were excluded. Patients with other identifiable causes of SE including hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia or who were post cardiac arrest were also excluded. Patients were divided into three arms based on loading dose of levetiracetam administered (≤ 20 mg/kg [LEVlow], 21–39 mg/kg [LEVmed] or ≥ 40 mg/kg [LEVhigh]). The primary endpoint was the rate of seizure termination, defined as the lack of need for an additional AED within 60 min following levetiracetam administration. Secondary outcomes included the rate of intubation, and recurrent seizure activity 60 min to 24 h post seizure termination as defined by positive EEG results or need for an additional AED. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the influence of adequate loading doses of benzodiazepines, and outpatient levetiracetam use.

Results

Overall, 740 patients were screened for inclusion, with 218 patients being included in the primary analysis. Patients were divided into three groups with an average levetiracetam loading dose of 14.5 mg/kg in the LEVlow group, 28.8 mg/kg in the LEVmed group, and 48.8 mg/kg in the LEVhigh group. There was no difference in rates of seizure termination at 60 min (92.9% LEVlow vs 89.3% LEVmed vs 84.7% LEVhigh; p = 0.377). Additionally, no difference was found in rates of recurrent seizure activity between 60 min and 24 h post levetiracetam loading dose (32.1% LEVlow vs 32.0% LEVmed vs 28.8% LEVhigh; p = 0.899). However, the LEVhigh group did have a higher rate of intubation (45.8%) compared to the LEVmed (28.2%) and LEVlow (26.8%) group (p = 0.040).

Conclusion

The loading of levetiracetam did not result in a statistically significant difference in rate of seizure termination at 60 min nor did it appear to impact the rate of recurrent seizures at 24 h. However, we did find higher rates of intubation in patients who received levetiracetam > 40 mg/kg. Further research is warranted to determine the optimal loading dose of levetiracetam in benzodiazepine-refractory SE.

Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years

In the 7-day controlled pediatric clinical study using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in children 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial-onset seizures, the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving KEPPRA in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were somnolence and irritability. Because of the shorter exposure period, incidences of adverse reactions are expected to be lower than in other pediatric studies in older patients. Therefore, other controlled pediatric data, presented above, should also be considered to apply to this age group.

Table 6 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of pediatric epilepsy patients (ages 1 month to < 4 years) treated with KEPPRA in the placebo-controlled study and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In this study, either KEPPRA or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

In the 7-day controlled pediatric clinical study in patients 1 month to < 4 years of age, 3% of patients receiving KEPPRA and 2% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction as a result of an adverse reaction. There was no adverse reaction that resulted in discontinuation for more than one patient.

### Rapid infusion of a loading dose of intravenous levetiracetam with minimal dilution: a safety study [^113Hw9Rr]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Intravenous antiepileptic drugs are required in patients needing urgent treatment or unable to take oral medication. The safety of intravenous levetiracetam has been established in prospective studies of adult epilepsy and healthy participants. The authors performed a prospective, single-center study to evaluate the safety of a rapid loading dose of intravenous levetiracetam. Patients were divided into 3 equal dosing groups (N = 15 each): 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg (corresponding to maximum doses of 1, 2, and 3 g). Electrocardiogram and safety assessment were performed during the infusion. Ages were 4 to 32 years. Postinfusion serum levetiracetam concentrations were 14 to 189 microg/mL. There were no significant changes in blood pressure, no local infusion site reactions, and no electrocardiogram abnormalities. The authors concluded that high serum levels of parenteral levetiracetam can be achieved rapidly and safely, in a small infusion volume. This finding has important implications for the treatment of status epilepticus.

Adults

In controlled clinical studies using KEPPRA tablets in adults with partial-onset seizures [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], the most common adverse reactions in adult patients receiving KEPPRA in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were somnolence, asthenia, infection, and dizziness. Of the most common adverse reactions in adults experiencing partial-onset seizures, asthenia, somnolence, and dizziness occurred predominantly during the first 4 weeks of treatment with KEPPRA.

Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of adult epilepsy patients receiving KEPPRA tablets in placebo-controlled studies and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In these studies, either KEPPRA or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

In controlled adult clinical studies using KEPPRA tablets, 15% of patients receiving KEPPRA and 12% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction as a result of an adverse reaction. Table 4 lists the most common (> 1%) adverse reactions that resulted in discontinuation or dose reduction and that occurred more frequently in KEPPRA-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients.

Pediatric Patients 4 Years to < 16 Years

The adverse reaction data presented below was obtained from a pooled analysis of two controlled pediatric clinical studies using an oral formulation in pediatric patients 4 to 16 years of age with partial-onset seizures. The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients receiving KEPPRA in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were fatigue, aggression, nasal congestion, decreased appetite, and irritability.

Table 5 lists adverse reactions from the pooled pediatric controlled studies (4 to 16 years of age) that occurred in at least 2% of pediatric KEPPRA-treated patients and were numerically more common than in pediatric patients treated with placebo. In these studies, either KEPPRA or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

In the controlled pooled pediatric clinical studies in patients 4–16 years of age, 7% of patients receiving KEPPRA and 9% receiving placebo discontinued as a result of an adverse reaction.

### Levetiracetam (Keppra) [^114CiUnS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Phenytoin

KEPPRA (3000 mg daily) had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of phenytoin in patients with refractory epilepsy. Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were also not affected by phenytoin.

Valproate

KEPPRA (1500 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of valproate in healthy volunteers. Valproate 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of levetiracetam absorption or its plasma clearance or urinary excretion. There also was no effect on exposure to and the excretion of the primary metabolite, ucb L057.

Other Antiepileptic Drugs

Potential drug interactions between KEPPRA and other AEDs (carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and valproate) were also assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of levetiracetam and these AEDs during placebo-controlled clinical studies. These data indicate that levetiracetam does not influence the plasma concentration of other AEDs and that these AEDs do not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

Effect of AEDs in Pediatric Patients

There was about a 22% increase of apparent total body clearance of levetiracetam when it was co-administered with enzyme-inducing AEDs. Dose adjustment is not recommended. Levetiracetam had no effect on plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate, or lamotrigine.

Oral Contraceptives

KEPPRA (500 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel, or of the luteinizing hormone and progesterone levels, indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely. Coadministration of this oral contraceptive did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

Digoxin

KEPPRA (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (ECG) of digoxin given as a 0.25 mg dose every day. Coadministration of digoxin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

Warfarin

KEPPRA (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of R and S warfarin. Prothrombin time was not affected by levetiracetam. Coadministration of warfarin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

### Tolerability and efficacy of oral loading of levetiracetam [^114DSjtv]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonsedating antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that can be initiated rapidly are desirable in a variety of clinical situations. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a newer AED, with a recently approved parenteral formulation, that can be initiated at doses effective in controlling seizures. We investigated whether oral loading of levetiracetam is well tolerated and facilitates stabilization and discharge of patients in epilepsy monitoring units (EMU).

Methods

Adult patients in the EMU at two centers were identified who received 1,500 mg of LEV in a single dose. This was an observational study of these patients where LEV was thought to be an appropriate component of the therapeutic regimen. Patients were either LEV naive or had been off all LEV for at least 3 days. LEV maintenance was begun 12 hours later at doses of 500 to 1,000 mg twice a day.

Results

A total of 37 adult patients (20 female) were identified. There were no spontaneous complaints of side effects. Upon questioning, 33 patients (89%) denied side effects. The remaining 4 patients (11%) reported transient irritability, imbalance, tiredness, or lightheadedness. Eleven patients (mean weight = 85.0 Kg) had mean LEV serum concentration of 31.5 microg/mL after 1 hour, 23 (mean weight 85.7 Kg) had mean concentration of 30.77 microg/mL after 2 hours, five (mean weight 84.3 Kg) had mean concentration of 12.1 microg/mL after 12 hours, and two (mean weight 94 Kg) had mean concentration of 7.4 microg/mL after 14 hours. No seizures occurred within 24 hours of loading. All patients were able to be discharged 3 to 30 hours after loading.

Conclusions

In the population surveyed, oral loading with levetiracetam was well-tolerated and rapidly yielded serum concentrations thought to decrease seizure frequency. This regimen facilitated discharge from the epilepsy monitoring units.

### Is it a tie at this point in the game? Efficacy of levetiracetam and phenytoin for the second-line treatment of convulsive status epilepticus [^113tZ1Kx]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

Since April 2015, additional studies have been published on the use of LEV and PHT in the treatment of CSE after an initial benzodiazepine. Mundlamuri et alpublished a class II RCT comparing LEV 25 mg/kg, PHT 20 mg/kg, and30 mg/kg in adults with CSE who also received lorazepam. There was no efficacy difference in the subgroups (P = 0.44). Chakravarthi et alpublished a class II RCT of patients aged 14 to 75 years who first received lorazepam, and secondly received PHT or LEV, both at 20 mg/kg. Phenytoin controlled SE in 68.2% and LEV controlled SE in 59.1% of patients (N.S.). A limitation in the above 3 studies is that the LEV doses selected were probably too low.

Navarro et alconducted a class I superiority RCT comparing 68 adults who received 2.5 gm of LEV to 68 who received placebo after an initial dose of 1 to 2 mg of clonazepam for either CSE or acute repetitive seizures. There was no difference in seizure control 15 minutes after receiving LEV (74%) or placebo (84%). This studyindicates that as second-line therapy for CSE, LEV is no more effective than placebo. Finally, Gujjar et alfound in a group of 52 patients with mixed focal and CSE, treated initially with lorazepam or diazepam, that the efficacy of LEV 30 mg/kg or PHT 20 mg/kg was similar (82% vs 70%, respectively; p = 0.33).

Anti-seizure drugs (ASDs) can fail to be effective when inadequate doses are used. In pharmacokinetics, a loading dose for an IV drug is defined by the formula: D L = V d × C ss (D L = loading dose in mg/kg, V d = volume of distribution, C ss = steady state serum concentration). The V d of PHT is 0.64 L/kg, LEV is 0.5 to 0.7 L/kg and VPA is 0.22 L/kg. When one is researching the comparative efficacy of different ASDs, appropriate comparable loading doses must be utilized. Therefore, it follows that larger doses of LEV and VPA than used in these past trials should be investigated.

2.4 Dosing for Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

Adults 16 Years of Age and Older

Initiate treatment with a dose of 1,000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase dosage by 1,000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3,000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3,000 mg/day has not been adequately studied.

Pediatric Patients 6 to < 16 Years of Age

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied. Patients with body weight ≤ 20 kg should be dosed with oral solution. Patients with body weight above 20 kg can be dosed with either tablets or oral solution [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

2.5 Dosage Adjustments in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

Levetiracetam oral solution dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are shown in Table 1. In order to calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:

CLcr = [(140 − age (years)) × weight (kg)/(72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL))] (× 0.85 for female patients)

Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:

CLcr (mL/min/1.73 m²) = [CLcr (mL/min)/BSA subject (m²)] × 1.73

*Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended.

### Intravenous levetiracetam in children with seizures: a prospective safety study [^1111ay8n]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

In 2006, intravenous levetiracetam received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in adults with epilepsy, 16 years or older. We have established the safety, tolerability, and dosage of intravenous levetiracetam in children. This prospective study included 30 children (6 months to < 15 years of age). Patients were administered a single dose of intravenous levetiracetam (50 mg/kg, maximal dose 2500 mg) over 15 minutes. A blood level of levetiracetam was performed 10 minutes after the infusion. The treated children's average age was 6.3 years (range 0.5–14.8 years). The mean levetiracetam level was 83.3 microg/mL (range 47–128 microg/mL). There were no serious adverse reactions. Minor reactions included sleepiness, fatigue, and restlessness. An apparent decrease in seizure frequency across all seizure types was noted. The dose of 50 mg/kg was well tolerated by the patients and is a safe, appropriate loading dose.

### Is it a tie at this point in the game? Efficacy of levetiracetam and phenytoin for the second-line treatment of convulsive status epilepticus [^111MnSmU]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

The 2 new RCTs reviewed herein, published in the May 29, 2019 issue of The Lancet, were quite similar in design, and indeed used larger loading doses of LEV than older studies. They included children ranging from infancy to adolescence, compared the same 2 ASDs delivered with the same doses over the same duration, and were the first ASD used after failure of an initial benzodiazepine to control CSE. Both studies were conducted in regions where patients were mostly of Caucasian descent.

The EcLiPSE open-label RCT in the United Kingdom was a class II study comparing second-line treatment with loading doses of IV LEV at 40 mg/kg and IV PHT at 20 mg/kg in 286 children. Convulsive status epilepticus was terminated slightly more often and faster with LEV than with PHT (P = 0.20), and serious adverse effects (AEs) occurred with PHT (life-threatening hypotension, worsened focal seizures, and decreased level of consciousness).

The ConSEPT open-label RCT in Australia and New Zealand was also a class II study, and compared second-line treatment with loading doses of IV LEV at 40 mg/kg and IV PHT at 20 mg/kg in 352 children. Clinical cessation of CSE 5 minutes after the completion of the loading dose occurred in 60% of children in the PHT group and 50% in the LEV group (P = 0.16), and there were no serious AEs.

Using the classification of evidence scheme of the American Academy of Neurology, these 2 newest RCTs meet the criteria for class II studies; they are not class I because of their open-label designs. The fact that these 2 studies were consistent in showing that the efficacy of LEV and of PHT is not significantly different allows this conclusion: following administration of a benzodiazepine, IV loading doses of LEV 40 mg/kg and PHT 20 mg PE/kg are probably equally effective in the treatment of children with CSE (Level B).

2.2 Dosing for Partial-Onset Seizures

The recommended dosing for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy is the same; as outlined below.

Adults 16 Years of Age and Older

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Additional dosing increments may be given (1000 mg/day additional every 2 weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. There is no evidence that doses greater than 3000 mg/day confer additional benefit.

Pediatric Patients

1 Month to < 6 Months

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 14 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (7 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 14 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 42 mg/kg (21 mg/kg twice daily). In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 35 mg/kg in this age group.

6 Months to < 4 Years

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose in 2 weeks by an increment of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 47 mg/kg in this age group.

4 Years to < 16 Years

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 60 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 44 mg/kg. The maximum daily dose was 3000 mg/day.

### Valproate in status epilepticus: correlation between loading dose, serum levels, and clinical response [^114Z8w5a]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Status epilepticus (SE) is a prolonged epileptic activity, secondary to the loss of mechanisms of seizure termination and represents a neurologic emergency with sizeable morbidity and mortality. Benzodiazepines constitute the first line of treatment, followed by intravenous (IV) antiseizure medications (ASMs). Valproate (VPA), phenytoin, and levetiracetam are the most used and studied IV ASMs in SE. VPA is administered at varying loading doses, ranging between 15 and 45 mg/kg. Its use was recently compared to levetiracetam and fosphenytoin, with loading of 40 mg/kg in the ESETT trial. However, high doses may not be innocuous, especially with risks of encephalopathy that can impact the patient outcome.

The relationship between VPA dosage in SE and its efficacy was not assessed. It is also not clear if VPA plasma levels within reference ranges established for epilepsy in an outpatient setting (between 50 and 100 mg/L) are associated with a better response rate. Therefore, the ideal VPA loading dose is not established. In our center, a loading dose of 30 mg/kg is recommended for the treatment of SE.

Our study aimed at evaluating the current use of VPA in SE and at clarifying the potential association between VPA loading doses through plasma levels and SE response.

5.1 Behavioral Abnormalities and Psychotic Symptoms

KEPPRA may cause behavioral abnormalities and psychotic symptoms. Patients treated with KEPPRA should be monitored for psychiatric signs and symptoms.

Behavioral abnormalities

In clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA, 13% of adult KEPPRA-treated patients and 38% of pediatric KEPPRA-treated patients (4 to 16 years of age), compared to 6% and 19% of adult and pediatric placebo-treated patients, experienced non-psychotic behavioral symptoms (reported as aggression, agitation, anger, anxiety, apathy, depersonalization, depression, emotional lability, hostility, hyperkinesias, irritability, nervousness, neurosis, and personality disorder).

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of an oral formulation of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age). The results from an exploratory analysis indicated a worsening in KEPPRA-treated patients on aggressive behavior (one of eight behavior dimensions), as measured in a standardized and systematic way using a validated instrument, the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6–18).

In clinical studies in pediatric patients 1 month to < 4 years of age, irritability was reported in 12% of the KEPPRA-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.

In clinical studies, 1.7% of adult KEPPRA-treated patients discontinued treatment due to behavioral adverse reactions, compared to 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. The treatment dose was reduced in 0.8% of adult KEPPRA-treated patients and in 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Overall, 11% of KEPPRA-treated pediatric patients experienced behavioral symptoms associated with discontinuation or dose reduction, compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients.

### Assessment of a dose-response relationship of levetiracetam [^115HTPcm]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between levetiracetam dose and both efficacy and safety in adult patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Dose-response relationships for levetiracetam efficacy were evaluated using pooled data from three trials including adults with refractory partial epilepsy. Two were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials in which doses of 1000–3000 mg/day of levetiracetam were administered as adjunctive therapy. The third consisted of the two parts of a crossover randomized, double-blind study in which levetiracetam (1000 or 2000 mg/day) or placebo was added to ongoing therapy. Data from each part of the crossover trial were included as if it was an independent parallel-group study. A fourth randomized double-blind trial was added for the safety evaluation. It included data from adults receiving placebo or 2000 mg/day of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy for refractory partial seizures. The combined analysis showed an increasing effect with increasing dose. The responder rates (≥ 50% reduction in seizures) for placebo and levetiracetam 1000, 2000, and 3000 mg/day were 13.1%, 28.5%, 34.3%, and 41.3%, respectively. The respective values for seizure freedom were 0.8%, 4.7%, 6.3%, and 8.6%. There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship with regard to adverse events, including those (asthenia, dizziness, somnolence) most commonly associated with this antiepileptic drug. Patients who do not become seizure-free at the lowest recommended levetiracetam dose (1000 mg/day) should be titrated to 2000 or 3000 mg/day to provide the greatest opportunity for efficacy with little or no increased risk for adverse events.

DISCUSSION

Our study did not find a benefit of increasing VPA loading dose in SE > 30 mg/kg as well as targeting VPA total plasma level in the 50–100 mg/L reference range. Other established predictors of response to SE do not seem to confound these findings. Results of the multivariable analysis were somewhat surprising, suggesting that later use of VPA (not as the first line?) and a lesser loading dose was associated with greater response rate to VPA when adjusting for SE severity. These results were obtained after excluding patients who refused to allow their data to be used; when challenging those findings with a sensitivity analysis, these findings were not significant. Therefore, it is not clear if these findings really reflect on a better efficacy at a lower dose later in the treatment sequence or they represent artifacts of an incomplete cohort. This hypothesis should be evaluated in a larger prospective study.

There is no controlled trial assessing different dosages of VPA in SE and therefore no clear evidence about how much VPA should be administered in that setting. For instance, VPA loading dose in the recent ESETT trial evolved overtime from 30 mg/kg in the planning to 40 mg/kg in the trial. Using the same design as this study, we previously found similar results with levetiracetam and lacosamide, showing that increasing loading doses as much as the tolerability allows does not bring a tangible benefit in efficacy. However, this contrasts with brivaracetam, which was mostly administered using the maximal intravenous maintenance dose that was not sufficient enough to quickly reach efficacious levels. There is also evidence in the ESETT trial that overweight patients (thus underdosed with doses capped for a weight of 75 kg at 3000 mg) had similar response rates as patients who received 40 mg/kg. The authors concluded that doses of 40 mg/kg may have led to drug concentrations greater than those needed for the treatment of SE. Varying VPA metabolism was also considered as a potential confounder, but as shown in this study, interindividual pharmacokinetic variability did not explain the response to the treatment.

### Levetiracetam oral (levetiracetam) [^117RceiM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

4 Years to < 16 Years

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 60 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 44 mg/kg. The maximum daily dose was 3,000 mg/day.

Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been adequately studied.

Pediatric Patients 6 to < 16 Years of Age

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied. Patients with body weight ≤ 20 kg should be dosed with oral solution. Patients with body weight above 20 kg can be dosed with either tablets or oral solution [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

2.5 Dosage Adjustments in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

Levetiracetam dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are shown in Table 1. In order to calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:

Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:

Table 1: Dosing Adjustment Regimen for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

1Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended.

2.6 Discontinuation of Levetiracetam

Avoid abrupt withdrawal from levetiracetam in order to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Myoclonic Seizures

Although the pattern of adverse reactions in this study seems somewhat different from that seen in patients with partial-onset seizures, this is likely due to the much smaller number of patients in this study compared to partial seizure studies. The adverse reaction pattern for patients with JME is expected to be essentially the same as for patients with partial seizures.

In the controlled clinical study using KEPPRA tablets in patients with myoclonic seizures [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving KEPPRA in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were somnolence, neck pain, and pharyngitis.

Table 7 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy patients experiencing myoclonic seizures treated with KEPPRA tablets and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In this study, either KEPPRA or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

In the placebo-controlled study using KEPPRA tablets in patients with JME, 8% of patients receiving KEPPRA and 2% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction as a result of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions that led to discontinuation or dose reduction and that occurred more frequently in KEPPRA-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients are presented in Table 8.

### Optimal dosing of levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis in critically ill patients: a prospective observational study [^114XPUXL]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Critically ill patients eliminate levetiracetam (LEV) more rapidly than healthy controls, yet low doses are commonly used for seizure prophylaxis in the ICU setting. We compared the rates of achievement of target serum levels and new onset seizure (clinical and/or electrographic) among patients who received low (500mg bid) versus high (750–1,000mg bid) dose LEV.

Design

Prospective, observational study.

Setting

Tertiary care, academic center.

Patients

We included patients who received prophylactic LEV following traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, or supratentorial neurosurgery between 2019 and 2021. Patients with a history of seizure, antiseizure medication use, or renal failure requiring dialysis were excluded.

Interventions

None.

Measurements

LEV levels were obtained at steady state. The impact of low-dose versus high-dose LEV on the primary outcome of target LEV levels (12–46 μg/mL), and the secondary outcome of clinical and/or electrographic seizure, were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, LEV loading dose, BMI, primary diagnosis and creatinine clearance (CrCl).

Main Results

Of the 205 subjects included in analyses, n = 106 (52%) received LEV 500mg bid (median 13mg/kg/d), and n = 99 (48%) received LEV 750–1,000mg bid (median 25mg/kg/d). Overall, 111 of 205 patients (54%) achieved target levels: 48 (45%) from the low-dose group versus 63 (64%) from the high-dose group (odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1–3.7; p = 0.009). In multivariable analyses, high-dose LEV predicted target levels (adjusted OR [aOR] 2.23; 95% CI, 1.16–4.27; p = 0.016), and was associated with lower seizure odds (aOR 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13–0.82; p = 0.018) after adjusting for age, loading dose, BMI, diagnosis, and CrCl.

Conclusions

Underdosing of LEV was common, with only 54% of patients achieving target serum levels. Higher doses (750–1,000mg bid) were more than twice as likely to lead to optimal drug levels and reduced the odds of seizure by 68% compared with low-dose regimens (500mg bid).

### Safety of intravenous push administration of high-dose (≥ 3 g) levetiracetam [^115T3NLY]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Levetiracetam administration via intravenous push (IVP) may improve outcomes in status epilepticus (SE) by decreasing time to administration. However, there is a paucity of literature describing the safety of IVP administration of higher loading doses used for early management of SE.

Objective

The purpose of this evaluation was to investigate the safety of high-dose IVP levetiracetam.

Methods

This was a retrospective, single-arm cohort study conducted at an academic medical center. Patients were included if they received IVP levetiracetam ≥ 3000 mg. The primary outcome was a composite of clinically significant adverse events (AEs) within 1-hour post-administration of levetiracetam: hypotension, hypertension, bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia, and/or injection site reaction.

Results

A total of 140 patients met inclusion criteria, receiving a median levetiracetam dose of 4000 mg (interquartile range [IQR] = 3000, 4500). Seventeen (12.1%) patients experienced a clinically significant AE. The most common clinically significant AE was hypotension (9.2% [10/109]), followed by tachycardia (3.6% [4/112]), arrhythmia (1.8% [2/112]), hypertension (0.9% [1/109]), and injection site reaction (0.7% [1/140]). Eighty percent [8/10] of patients who experienced clinically significant hypotension were on at least 1 medication with potential confounding hemodynamic effects.

Conclusion and Relevance

In this retrospective, single-arm analysis, high-dose (≥ 3000 mg) IVP levetiracetam was relatively well-tolerated but associated with a higher rate of clinically significant hypotension than has been reported in the previous literature, although several confounding factors may have contributed to this outcome. Our findings support the continued use of high-dose IVP levetiracetam with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring; hemodynamic effects should be further explored in future studies.

2.2 Initial Exposure to Levetiracetam

Levetiracetam can be initiated with either intravenous or oral administration.

Partial-Onset Seizures

In clinical trials of oral levetiracetam, daily doses of 1,000 mg, 2,000 mg, and 3,000 mg, given as twice-daily dosing, were shown to be effective. Although in some studies there was a tendency toward greater response with higher dose [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], a consistent increase in response with increased dose has not been shown.

Treatment should be initiated with a daily dose of 1,000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Additional dosing increments may be given (1,000 mg/day additional every 2 weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3,000 mg. Doses greater than 3,000 mg/day have been used in open-label studies with levetiracetam tablets for periods of 6 months and longer. There is no evidence that doses greater than 3,000 mg/day confer additional benefit.

Myoclonic Seizures in Patients with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Treatment should be initiated with a dose of 1,000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Dosage should be increased by 1,000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3,000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3,000 mg/day has not been studied.

Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

Treatment should be initiated with a dose of 1,000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Dosage should be increased by 1,000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3,000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3,000 mg/day has not been adequately studied.

2.3 Switching to Intravenous Dosing

When switching from oral levetiracetam, the initial total daily intravenous dosage of levetiracetam should be equivalent to the total daily dosage and frequency of oral levetiracetam.

2.4 Switching to Oral Dosing

At the end of the intravenous treatment period, the patient may be switched to levetiracetam oral administration at the equivalent daily dosage and frequency of the intravenous administration.

Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

Although the pattern of adverse reactions in this study seems somewhat different from that seen in patients with partial seizures, this is likely due to the much smaller number of patients in this study compared to partial seizure studies. The adverse reaction pattern for patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures is expected to be essentially the same as for patients with partial seizures.

In the controlled clinical study that included patients 4 years of age and older with PGTC seizures, the most common adverse reaction in patients receiving KEPPRA oral formulation in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo was nasopharyngitis.

Table 9 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of idiopathic generalized epilepsy patients experiencing PGTC seizures treated with KEPPRA and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In this study, either KEPPRA or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

In the placebo-controlled study, 5% of patients receiving KEPPRA and 8% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction during the treatment period as a result of an adverse reaction.

This study was too small to adequately characterize the adverse reactions that could be expected to result in discontinuation of treatment in this population. It is expected that the adverse reactions that would lead to discontinuation in this population would be similar to those resulting in discontinuation in other epilepsy trials (see tables 4 and 8).

In addition, the following adverse reactions were seen in other controlled adult studies of KEPPRA: balance disorder, disturbance in attention, eczema, memory impairment, myalgia, and blurred vision.

Comparison of Gender, Age and Race

The overall adverse reaction profile of KEPPRA was similar between females and males. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reactions by age and race.

RCT

Children allocated to eLVT received the optimal dose identified in the Dose-Escalation Study for 72 h. PK data were assessed at t = 0, 7, 24 h and 4–40 h after the last dose. If clinical or electrographic seizures recurred/continued after the initial eLVT dose, an LVT level at time of failure was captured, escalation to the next dosing strata occurred, and the more frequent PK assessments were conducted (t = 0, 1.5, 4, 12, 24, 36, 40, and 84 h). Benzodiazepines (maximum 2 doses/24 h) were given as needed for breakthrough seizures to allow time for eLVT absorption.

The dose escalation study was designed to identify the dose which would be effective for most patients but did not delineate what dose of eLVT might benefit a child with refractory seizures/status epilepticus. Escalating therapy for any selected antiepileptic is the commonest approach to treating refractory seizures. Thus, given the established safety profile of eLVT in other populations, data from other populations indicating that higher doses can be beneficial for refractory seizures, our ability to rapidly cross over to PB if higher dose LVT was ineffective and the value of having additional insights into the clinical and pharmacokinetic effects of escalating eLVT in this population, dose escalation of eLVT was undertaken for those children who failed standard dose.

In RCT year 1, children randomized to 'usual care' received phenobarbital 20 mg/kg load, then 5 mg/kg Q12 hours for 72 h. In RCT year 2, the Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) recommended that children randomized to 'usual care' receive phenobarbital only if they experienced post enrollment seizures (clinical or electrographic) unresponsive to diazepam or paraldehyde. Children who continued to have seizures after receiving the allocated treatment were given the alternative therapy for rescue.

Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 500 mg to a maximum recommended daily dose of 1,500 mg (750 mg twice daily).

For Roweepra (levetiracetam) tablet dosing in pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg, initiate treatment with a daily dose of 1,000 mg/day given as twice daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 1,000 mg/day to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3,000 mg (1,500 mg twice daily).

Roweepra (levetiracetam) Oral Solution Weight-Based Dosing Calculation For Pediatric Patients

The following calculation should be used to determine the appropriate daily dose of oral solution for pediatric patients:

Daily dose (mg/kg/day) x patient weight (kg)

Total daily dose (mL/day) = ----------------------------------------------------------

100 mg/mL

2.3 Dosing for Myoclonic Seizures in Patients 12 Years of Age and Older with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Initiate treatment with a dose of 1,000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase the dosage by 1,000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3,000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3,000 mg/day has not been studied.

### Intravenous levetiracetam in the management of acute seizures in children [^11341FTo]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam may be effective in children with acute seizures or status epilepticus. We performed a retrospective chart review of children who received intravenous levetiracetam within 30 minutes of a seizure. Seventy-three patients during a 2-year study period met our inclusion criteria. The mean (± S.D.) age and weight of the patients were 5.59 ± 5.6 years (range, 1 day to 17.8 years) and 23.1 ± 21 kg (range, 1.97–97 kg), respectively. Patients received a mean (± S.D.) levetiracetam dose of 29.4 ± 13.5 mg/kg. Most children (n = 49, or 67%) received additional antiepileptic drugs to abort their seizure. Overall, the mean (± S.D.) total (abortive plus chronic) number of concomitant antiepileptic drugs used by the population was 2.53 ± 1.7 (1.07 ± 0.98 as additional abortive therapy, and 1.42 ± 1.29 as chronic therapy). Most patients received levetiracetam for serial seizures (79%), whereas 12% and 8% manifested a single seizure or status epilepticus, respectively. Clinical effectiveness at 1, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the initial levetiracetam dose constituted the primary study outcome. Eighty-nine percent of patients remained seizure-free at 1 hour. This rate decreased at each evaluation time point. Most patients (71%) were placed on maintenance levetiracetam within 24 hours of their loading dose. The predictive ability of patient and drug regimen variables in outcomes was poor. Only the number of concomitant antiepileptic drugs consistently predicted outcomes. Levetiracetam was well tolerated at the doses studied, and appears most effective in single seizure events.

### Safety and efficacy of levetiracetam for critically ill patients with seizures [^112XUQpF]. Neurocritical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

In intensive care unit (ICU) patients, seizure or status epilepticus treatment with intravenous benzodiazepines or conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, may be accompanied by cardiovascular depression or hypotension. Levetiracetam (LVM) is a novel AED that does not undergo extensive liver metabolism, does not require drug level monitoring, and is not associated with hemodynamic instability. We retrospectively analyzed the use, safety, and efficacy of LVM in ICU patients.

Methods

Collected data included age, sex, therapy indication and duration, dosing regimen, documented seizure activity, ICU admission diagnoses, length of ICU stay, serum creatinine, liver function tests, adverse reactions, concomitant use of other AEDs, and drug interactions.

Results

Fifty-one patients were identified (26 males; mean (SD) age, 58.2 (19.8) years). Most patients (65%) did not receive a loading dose; the most common loading dose was 1,500 mg (50% of 18 patients). The most common maintenance dose was 500 mg twice daily (59% of 51 patients), and average duration of therapy was 13.6 (12.7) days. Approximately 47% of patients had preexisting liver disease, and 25% had elevated serum creatinine. Twenty-two patients received LVM therapy for seizure prophylaxis; 29 for acute seizure treatment. Ninety-three percent of patients treated with LVM for acute seizure had no subsequent seizures; the remaining patients (7%) required additional AEDs. One patient receiving LVM for seizure prophylaxis had documented seizures requiring additional AEDs. No adverse hemodynamic events or cardiac arrhythmias were reported.

Conclusion

LVM appears to be safe for ICU patients when dosing is adjusted for renal function.

### Efficacy of levetiracetam as add-on therapy in the treatment of seizures in neonates [^114Jc6Sq]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sharpe et al. Yau et al. and Khan et al. described the achievement of seizure freedom within 24–72 h after administration of add-on therapy of LEV after PB administration. Sharpe et al. reported that 1/6 neonates (17%) accomplished seizure freedom within 24 h, with a mean dose of 20 mg/kg. Yau et al. described that, respectively, 58% (7/12) and 75% (9/12) of neonates were seizure-free after 24 and 72 h, with a loading dose of 7.5–20 mg/kg and maintenance of 5–60 mg/kg/day. Khan et al. reported that 14/22 neonates with seizures (64%), primarily with HIE as underlying cause (n = 12), were seizure-free 24 h after the administration of a loading dose of 50 mg/kg LEV. and 100% (22/22) were seizure-free 72 h after the first administration and a maintenance dose of 25 mg/kg every 8 h. In our study, seizure freedom for 24–72 h was 9% and 6.4%, respectively, after the total dose of LEV. A direct comparison of previous research with our study based on seizure freedom is not possible as we were interested in immediate seizure cessation that would hold for 24, 48, and 72 h after the administration of LEV instead of seizure cessation within 24, 48, and 72 h after the administration of LEV. This distinction holds significant relevance, particularly in light of the resolution of seizures in the newborn. A potential reason for the low efficacy of LEV could be the use of a lower cumulative dose and maintenance dose in our study compared to the previous studies mentioned. The optimal dosage of LEV in neonates remains uncertain, and previous studies have utilized a wide range of daily doses, from 10 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg.

Evidentiary table — intravenous levetiracetam for status epilepticus reports dosing and EEG-based outcomes across small studies. In a chart review, patients who received levetiracetam 20 mg/kg IV for seizures had, in the refractory status epilepticus group, efficacy of 67% (16/24) [95% CI 48% to 86%]. In elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 y) with video EEG-documented status epilepticus loaded with levetiracetam 1,500 mg in ≤ 15 min, 8/9, 89% (95% CI 68% to 100%) had reduction in seizures and in 7/9, 78% (95% CI 51% to 100%) of seizures ceased. In patients with status epilepticus refractory to benzodiazepines given levetiracetam 2,500 mg IV over 5 min, 11 patients were enrolled, with 10 (83% [95% CI 62% to 100%]) having seizures terminate within 24 h, with 1 patient with flushing and 1 patient with unrelated oxygen desaturation. In a chart review of 8 patients who received levetiracetam 20 mg/kg IV for status epilepticus after benzodiazepines, the outcome of termination of seizure activity on EEG within 30 min showed efficacy was 3/8 (38%), 95% CI 4% to 72%.

Oral levetiracetam loading — observational pilot safety study — assessed adverse effects, serum concentration, and seizure outcomes. In 37 patients, "89% denied adverse effects; other 11% reported transient irritability, imbalance, tiredness, or lightheadedness; no seizures occurred within 24 h of loading; all patients were able to be discharged 3 to 30 h after loading". The study is described as a "Retrospective case series of epilepsy monitoring unit patients, not ED patients".

Levetiracetam for status epilepticus — comparative and observational data report dosing and efficacy after benzodiazepines. In a randomized comparison using a 30 mg/kg intravenous (IV) load delivered at 5 mg/kg per minute, seizure cessation after infusion was similar in both groups (valproate 68%; levetiracetam 73%). Retrospective and Class III cohorts include 24 patients with seizures ceased in 67% with IV levetiracetam, an observational series where a 1,500 mg IV load led to resolution in 7 of 9 within 30 minutes, and a study using 2,500 mg IV over 5 minutes in patients who had failed benzodiazepines and subsequent phenytoin or valproate with seizures ceased in 10 of 11; the latter reported 3 patients with prolonged seizures during the 24-hour period and no serious adverse effects attributable to the infusion. Additional Class III data report 38% efficacy within 30 minutes at 20 mg/kg, and larger studies showing efficacy of 44% (95% CI 29% to 59%) within 3 minutes of drug administration and as high as 73% (95% CI 58% to 88%) extending to 24 hours postadministration; reported adverse effects were nausea and transient transaminitis in individual cases.

Levetiracetam

The putative mechanisms of action of LEV are to bind SV2A proteins and amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors and to inhibit high voltage-activated Ca 2+ channels. Oral absorption is rapid, but food can negatively affect the concentration and time-to-effect. Levetiracetam has a V d of 0.5 to 0.7 L/kg, has a t 1/2 of 7 hours, and is < 10% protein bound. It undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis (noncytochrome P450) to an inactive metabolite and is ∼66% eliminated unchanged in the urine; so in renal insufficiency, the dose must be reduced proportionate to creatinine clearance. Hemodialysis eliminates 40% in 4 hours (up to 73% in critically ill patients). It has few drug–drug interactions.

Levetiracetam for the treatment of CRSE

Isguder et al reported a class III review of 78 children (median age: 31 months) with RSE who received 20 mg/kg IV loading doses of LEV or VPA. Both drugs were equally effective, but LEV was safer (12.5% of VPA patients had hepatic dysfunction). In a class IV study, Moddel et al reported that among 36 RSE adults (50% had CRSE) treated with a median of 3000 mg/d of LEV, 69% of patients had RSE stopped. No cardiovascular AEs were seen. In a class IV report, Rantsch et al studied 118 adults to determine the efficacy of various ASMs in terminating RSE. Only 10 patients treated with LEV had CRSE. Levetiracetam was more effective in terminating CRSE than other ASMs, but the difference was not significant given the small numbers.

### Levetiracetam versus phenytoin for second-line treatment of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus (EcLiPSE): a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial [^117Gy9R6]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Other treatment-related factors might be relevant to the interpretation of our findings. These include the widespread use of levetiracetam as maintenance therapy for many childhood epilepsies because of its broad-spectrum activity and safety profile. In the EcLiPSE trial participants, levetiracetam was the most commonly used oral antiepilepsy drug at the time of presentation. Anecdotally, clinicians are reluctant to give a loading dose of phenytoin to children in convulsive status epilepticus who are on oral maintenance phenytoin because of potential cardiovascular toxicity. There seemed to be no similar concerns for levetiracetam, and no increase in adverse events was observed when giving 40 mg/kg to children already receiving maintenance levetiracetam. A substantial minority of children who present in convulsive status epilepticus for the first time are subsequently commenced on maintenance therapy. Levetiracetam is more likely than phenytoin to be used as maintenance therapy because of phenytoin's adverse event profile and complex pharmacokinetics. One observational study in adults showed that 8% of patients treated with intravenous fosphenytoin for convulsive status epilepticus were subsequently commenced on oral phenytoin, whereas 78% of those treated with intravenous levetiracetam were subsequently commenced on oral levetiracetam. Ease of drug preparation and administration is also a factor in the management of convulsive status epilepticus. Throughout the EcLiPSE trial, levetiracetam was reported by clinical teams in the participating centres to be easier to prepare and administer than phenytoin because of the calculations performed in reconstituting phenytoin, the number of vials required, and procedures needed for its administration; these observations are supported by the scientific literature.

### A clinical trial of enteral levetiracetam for acute seizures in pediatric cerebral malaria [^113c5m4r]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

Dose-escalation study

A dose-escalation study titrating eLVT to seizure freedom based upon cEEG and limited by toxicity with pre-specified stopping rules.

Randomized controlled trial

Using the dose of eLVT identified as effective in the Dose-Escalation Study, we conducted an open label, RCT of eLVT compared to phenobarbital for acute seizure control. PK data were obtained throughout. See study protocol, Additional file 1.

Patient population

Studies were conducted on the Paediatric Research Ward (PRW) of Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. All aspects of this study received ethical review in Malawi and the US.

Inclusion criteria

PRW admission; age 24–83 months; Blantyre Coma Score (BCS) ≤ 2; P. falciparum infection; no other known coma etiology; seizures within past 24 h; guardian written consent.

Exclusion criteria

Serum creatinine (SCr) > 2 mg/dL; use of enzyme-inducing medication in past 14 days; contraindication for nasogastric tube (NGT) and/or administration of enteral medications. For the RCT, additional exclusions were treatment with > 2 doses of short-acting antiseizure drug (ASD) in the past 12 h or a long-acting ASD in the past 3 days.

Randomization

Patients were block randomized with randomly selected block sizes of 4 and 6. Treatment was allocated based on a pre-defined randomly generated list with assignment available through the OpenClinica database or sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes prepared by the Biomedical Research Informatics Core at Michigan State University. Acquisition of treatment assignment required the enrolling clinician to provide the name and demographic details for the consented subject. Ward clinicians enrolled participants and commenced treatment based upon allocation.

Procedures

Dose-escalation study

Four dose strata of eLVT with a maximum of 8 subjects per strata were prespecified. The initial dose was 40 mg/kg load, then 30 mg/kg Q12 hours for 72 h. Stopping was indicated if mortality plus grade 3 or 4 suspected adverse drug reactions (SADR) exceeded the ward baseline mortality rate of 16%. LVT serum levels were measured at time (t) = 0, 1.5, 4, 12, 24, 36, 40, and 84 h. LVT oral solution (100 mg/ml) was administered via NGT until the child was able to take LVT orally.

### Efficacy of levetiracetam for neonatal seizures in preterm infants [^116Nzooo]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Neonatal seizures remain a significant clinical problem, and therapeutic options are still not diverse with limited efficacy. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a relatively new and wide spectrum anti-seizure medication with favorable pharmacokinetics and safety profile. In the recent decades, LEV has been increasingly used for the treatment of neonatal seizures. The aim of this study was to describe the experience of using LEV as the first line anti-seizure medication for preterm infants.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 37 preterm infants who were treated with LEV as the first-line anti-seizure medication was performed.

Results

Mean gestational age of the 37 preterm infants was 31.5 ± 1.9 weeks (range, 26 to 36 + 6 weeks). Twenty-one infants (57%) were seizure-free while given LEV at the end of the first week, and no additional anti-seizure medication was required. Loading doses of LEV ranged from 40 to 60 mg/kg (mean 56 mg/kg) and the maintenance dose ranged from 20 to 30 mg/kg (mean 23 mg/kg). No adverse effect was observed.

Conclusions

Levetiracetam can be a good and safe choice for treatment of neonatal seizures in preterm infants. Prospective double blind controlled studies are needed in the future.

### Effectiveness of intravenous levetiracetam as an adjunctive treatment in pediatric refractory status epilepticus [^114hgXuv]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Intravenous levetiracetam (LEV) has been shown to be effective and safe in treating adults with refractory status epilepticus (SE). We sought to investigate the efficacy and safety of intravenous LEV for pediatric patients with refractory SE.

Methods

We performed a retrospective medical-record review of pediatric patients who were treated with intravenous LEV for refractory SE. Clinical information regarding age, sex, seizure type, and underlying neurological status was collected. We evaluated other anticonvulsants that were used prior to administration of intravenous LEV and assessed loading dose, response to treatment, and any adverse events from intravenous LEV administration.

Results

Fourteen patients (8 boys and 6 girls) received intravenous LEV for the treatment of refractory SE. The mean age of the patients was 4.4 ± 5.5 years (range, 4 days to 14.6 years). Ten of the patients were neurologically healthy prior to the refractory SE, and the other 4 had been previously diagnosed with epilepsy. The mean loading dose of intravenous LEV was 26 ± 4.6 mg/kg (range, 20–30 mg/kg). Seizure termination occurred in 6 (43%) of the 14 patients. In particular, 4 (57%) of the 7 patients younger than 2 years showed seizure termination. No immediate adverse events occurred during or after infusions.

Conclusions

The current study demonstrated that the adjunctive use of intravenous LEV was effective and well tolerated in pediatric patients with refractory SE, even in patients younger than 2 years. Intravenous LEV should be considered as an effective and safe treatment option for refractory SE in pediatric patients.

Results

Dose-escalation study

From February 15–April 15, 2013, 40 children were screened, 11/40 met eligibility criteria and 7 were enrolled. The primary reason for exclusion was no P. falciparum infection. Two eligible children were enrolled in another research study whose enrollment alternated with the LVT study and 2/11 were screened when there was no cEEG bed available. The first seven children who received LVT 40 mg/kg load plus 30 mg/kg Q12 were seizure free, so no dose escalation was undertaken. Demographic and clinical characteristics are detailed in Table 1.

Table 1
Demographic and Clinical Data from Dose-Escalation Study Population Receiving Enteral Levetiracetam 40 mg/kg load and 30 mg/kg Q12 hourly (n = 7)

* Glucose < 2.2 mmol/L

The median (range) plasma LVT concentration at 1.5 h was 37.5 (16.7–46.0 μg/mL). Within 4 h of the loading dose, all children achieved at least one LVT concentration between 20 and 50 μg/mL. The median post-load trough was 9.5 μg/mL and after subsequent doses was 7.1 μg/mL. No trough accumulation was noted. No vomiting, aspiration, neurologic sequelae or deaths occurred; 5/7 experienced mildly elevated transaminases and electrolyte perturbations that were already evident at baseline. One child each had QT C prolongation prior to LVT, grade 3 elevation of transaminases and persistent anemia (grade 4) — none of these events were considered related to LVT. All AEs resolved without intervention.

### Levetiracetam injection (levetiracetam) [^111oNXHb]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

All clinical studies supporting the efficacy of levetiracetam utilized oral formulations. The finding of efficacy of levetiracetam injection is based on the results of studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam, and on the demonstration of comparable bioavailability of the oral and parenteral formulations [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].

14.1 Partial Onset Seizures

The effectiveness of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy (added to other antiepileptic drugs) in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. The tablet formulation was used in all these studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to placebo, 1,000 mg, 2,000 mg, or 3,000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study 1 or Study 2 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more classical AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least 1 year and had taken one classical AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.

Study 1

Study 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 41 sites in the United States comparing levetiracetam 1,000 mg/day (N = 97), levetiracetam 3,000 mg/day (N = 101), and placebo (N = 95) given in equally divided doses twice daily. After a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients were randomized to one of the three treatment groups described above. The 18-week treatment period consisted of a 6-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED regimens were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency). The results of the analysis of Study 1 are displayed in Table 7.

### Intravenous levetiracetam: a new treatment alternative for refractory status epilepticus [^115NQFDk]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of intravenous levetiracetam (LEV-iv) in refractory status epilepticus (SE). A retrospective chart review was performed on patients who received LEV-iv for treatment of SE (n = 36) and had failed at least one other antiepileptic drug. LEV-iv (median 3000 mg/day; range 1000–9000) was administered as a bolus loading (500–2000 mg per 30–60 min, n = 30) or as a continuous pump infusion (n = 6). SE was terminated in 69% ("responders"); 31% ("non-responders") remained in SE. Factors associated with failure were: dose escalation over 3000 mg/day, lack of bolus loading, treatment latency over 48 h, age over 80 years, non-convulsive SE with coma ("subtle SE"), periodic lateralised epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) on EEG, acute cerebral lesion and intubation narcosis. SE was terminated in all eight patients without brain lesion (p = 0.033), and in all seven patients with complex partial SE (p = 0.051). Outcome was favourable (ambulatory patients) in 48% (responders) compared with 0% (non-responders), and "adverse" (death or continuing coma/stupor) in 24% (responders) compared with 100% (non-responders). Mortality was 17% (responders 4%, non-responders 45%). No patient had cardiocirculatory side effects or worsening of SE. Two patients experienced nausea and vomiting during LEV-iv loading, leading to aspiration pneumonia in one. This study suggests that LEV-iv may be a safe and efficacious treatment of SE. Prospective and controlled trials are imperative to confirm these preliminary findings.

### Making up missed anti-seizure medication doses: double or nothing? [^114uGuTp]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

The other question is whether to take the full missed dose immediately if remembered soon enough. They found that for most ASMs, taking the full missed dose immediately did minimize time outside the desired therapeutic range if taken within a few hours of the missed dose. This makes sense and is in line with the above usual advice. There were just a couple exceptions — for example, clobazam (with its long half-life) was better served by any of the "0.5" or "1.5" dose strategies if a dose is anything more than 1 hour delayed.

Take a typical example — twice daily levetiracetam, assume a 40-year-old adult with normal renal function. Their results endorse some of our typical advice — take the full missed dose immediately if remembered within 2 hours of the scheduled time (our typical advice, strategy B). But if remembered more than 2 hours after the originally scheduled time, their results favored different variations of making up only half of the missed dose (strategies C-F), rather than skipping an entire dose.

They have posted their results in a convenient online format. This allows the user to take matters into their own hands by entering a patient's specific data into this app to view how concentrations may fluctuate under strategies A-F. For more advanced users, they posted another app in which one can even modify assumptions about absorption, clearance, volume of distribution, and more.

Even with their large array of analyses, the investigators could look at only a subset of all possible ASMs or ages (they did not include a scenario for older patients, for whom changes in renal function and susceptibility to adverse effects may be greatest), and these data pertain only to immediate rather than extended-release formulations. There are also 2 elephants in the room: (1) Translating a precise sinusoidal concentration curve into the chance that a patient might have seizures or side effects is not simple, nor does this inform how the patient perceives the tradeoff between transient seizure versus side effect risk, and (2) None of this modeling addresses the underlying cause of skipping doses.

That said, this is a nicely done, useful study, involving incredible technical demands. But what I most appreciate about this study is its spirit. The investigators identified an extremely common clinical scenario with agreed upon yet arbitrary guidance and sought to provide clinicians with freely available evidence-based guideposts.

### Levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in a critically ill anephric patient on intermittent hemodialysis [^1148GEGz]. Neurocritical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In patients requiring hemodialysis, the extracorporeal circuit is expected to remove the majority of serum levetiracetam. The preferred levetiracetam dosing regimen in critically ill patients exhibiting complex pharmacokinetic profiles undergoing hemodialysis is unknown. The objective of this case is to describe levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in a critically ill anephric patient receiving intermittent hemodialysis.

Methods

This is a case report of a single patient.

Results

A 43-year-old anephric female was admitted to the intensive care unit for concerns of new onset seizure activity. She was loaded with 2000 mg levetiracetam followed by a 750 mg daily maintenance dose. The levetiracetam volume of distribution was 0.48 L/kg, and the interdialytic elimination half-life was 31 h. Hemodialysis removed nearly 85% of serum levetiracetam, and the patient exhibited slightly higher than expected non-renal elimination. Pharmacokinetic simulations identified 500 mg daily with 750 mg post-dialysis supplements as the regimen most likely to reduce variability in serum levetiracetam concentrations and achieve levels in the therapeutic range.

Conclusion

Substantial elimination of levetiracetam by hemodialysis occurred in this case, and non-renal clearance was slightly higher than in previous reports. Insufficient intradialytic or post-dialysis levetiracetam concentrations may place patients at risk of breakthrough seizures. This case indicates that dialysis patients on levetiracetam may require higher post-dialysis supplemental doses than currently recommended and tailored therapy supported by therapeutic drug monitoring.

Question #3: Which Medications Should We Use?

Phenobarbital is the most used ASM to treat neonatal seizures. A single loading dose of 20 mg/kg is effective at controlling seizures in approximately half of patients. However, we should not use phenobarbital simply because it is the medication most used. It is important to use the most effective and best tolerated ASM.

There has been concern that ASMs, especially phenobarbital, are associated with neuronal apoptosis in neonatal animal models, as well as cognitive decline in older children and adults, prompting the use of newer ASMs to treat neonatal seizures. A study of 280 infants with comparable seizure etiology demonstrated an 8-point decrease in Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID) scores per 100 mg/kg phenobarbital exposure. By comparison, levetiracetam was associated with a 2.2-point decrease per 300 mg/kg, making levetiracetam an attractive alternative.

However, the recent multicenter, randomized, blinded, controlled study comparing phenobarbital and levetiracetam as first-line treatment of acute provoked neonatal seizures (NEOLEV2) found that 80% of neonates randomized to phenobarbital 20 mg/kg loading dose (with an additional 20 mg/kg dose if seizures persisted) as the first medication remained seizure-free for 24 hours. By comparison, only 28% of neonates showed a similar response to levetiracetam 40 mg/kg loading dose (with an additional 20 mg/kg dose if seizures persisted). Increasing from 40 to 60 mg/kg of levetiracetam increased the response only by 7.5%. Therefore, phenobarbital is not the most used ASM just because it is one of the oldest — it is also the most effective.

ϯ Among those who survived

Thirty children received LVT including four escalated to 60 mg/kg load, then 45 mg/kg Q12 hourly higher doses. LVT levels at seizure breakthrough ranged from 36.6–59.0 μg/mL. The LVT level was at least 20 μg/mL in 26/29 (90%) of children within 4 h of the loading dose. The steady state trough was below 6 in 6/29 and above 20 in 6/29 including 4/29 with AUC > 200% of the expected population average.

With one exception, all seizures captured through the continuous EEG monitoring were focal in onset with local propagation. Electrographic generalization was sometimes but not always seen. There was a single generalized onset seizure associated with brief ictal rhythmic discharges (BIRDs) in a PB allocated child.

Clinically evident seizures that appeared generalized in nature evolved from focal electrographically evident subclinical seizures that sometimes waxed and waned for several minutes prior to clinical manifestations being evident. Status epilepticus, meaning seizures lasting longer than 15 min, occurred in 2 LVT allocated children and 4 PB allocated children. In all instances of electrographic status epilepticus, the criteria for clinical status epilepticus were also met but the full extent and duration of ongoing seizures was not evident clinically.

Lateralized periodic discharges occurred in one LVT child and 2 PB children who also had seizures. In addition, 2 PB children who had seizures electrographically had periodic discharges and subsequently died. Generalized periodic discharges were seen in one LVT child. Lateralized rhythmic delta activity was seen in 2 PB children.

Discussion

This is the first open-label, randomized controlled trial comparing eLVT to usual care with phenobarbital for treatment of acute seizures in resource-limited settings. Among 30 comatose CM children with recent clinical seizures, eLVT was rapidly absorbed and well tolerated. Overall eLVT PK parameters were similar to prior pediatric PK studies, but eLVT clearance was lower in patients with higher admission serum creatinine concentrations. Within 4 h of the first dose, 90% reached therapeutic levels, many reaching therapeutic levels quite rapidly. In the initial dose-finding study, 7/7 children receiving the first planned eLVT dose achieved seizure freedom. In the subsequent randomized comparison of eLVT to usual care patients, no differences were seen for minutes with seizure, seizure freedom, coma duration, neurologic sequelae or death. Although treatment assignment was open-label, the primary and secondary EEG/seizure outcome assessments were masked. eLVT was safer (p = 0.019) than phenobarbital, which was discontinued in 3/15 subjects due to respiratory side effects. eLVT therefore is a safe, efficacious, and affordable alternative to usual care for acute symptomatic seizures in this critically ill pediatric CM population who have a high risk of acute seizures, status epilepticus and seizure-associated neurologic sequelae.

Several limitations need to be kept in mind. First, this study provides no insights on eLVT safety in children with SCr > 2 mg/dL. None of the 140 children screened for enrollment had a SCr > 2.0 mg/dL. Caution is warranted in extrapolating the eLVT safety data here to eLVT use for acute symptomatic seizures from causes more often associated with comorbid renal insufficiency. Secondly, we had limited PK data in children with continuous electrographic seizures, but one child who failed standard dose LVT received a higher loading dose while having continuous electrographic seizures and the PK data suggested absorption was delayed until after the seizure halted. Although some of the study subjects developed status epilepticus after enrollment, none of them had experienced status prior to enrollment. The exclusion of children who had received more than two doses of rescue benzodiazepines likely omitted this population from enrollment which may have made the study population less neurologically affected than the typical cerebral malaria population.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

All clinical studies supporting the efficacy of levetiracetam utilized oral formulations. The finding of efficacy of levetiracetam injection is based on the results of studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam, and on the demonstration of comparable bioavailability of the oral and parenteral formulations [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].

14.1 Partial-Onset Seizures

The effectiveness of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy (added to other antiepileptic drugs) in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. The tablet formulation was used in all these studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to placebo, 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study 1 or Study 2 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more classical AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least 1 year and had taken one classical AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.

Study 1

Study 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 41 sites in the United States comparing levetiracetam 1000 mg/day (N = 97), levetiracetam 3000 mg/day (N = 101), and placebo (N = 95) given in equally divided doses twice daily. After a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients were randomized to one of the three treatment groups described above. The 18-week treatment period consisted of a 6-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED regimens were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency). The results of the analysis of Study 1 are displayed in Table 7.

### PopPK modeling supports BW band dosing of lacosamide for pediatric epilepsy [^112JV4L4]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We have also specifically focused on those children with epilepsy who were overweight or obese. Overall, dosing regimens were largely consistent between obese and non-obese children. However, the primary differences emerged in two subgroups: younger obese cases with homozygous CYP2C19 * 2 mutations (BW < 15 kg) and older obese one with wild-type CYP2C19 * 2 (BW ≥ 50 kg), both necessitating an obvious dose reduction.

One more critical point warrants in-depth discussion. Upon acquisition of model-required covariate data, PopPK modeling enables precise simulation of individualized dosing regimens based on target therapeutic concentration ranges. This applies to both the current mg/kg-based dosing approach and the fixed-dose regimen (mg) under investigation in this study, where comprehensive PopPK simulations can identify "optimized" doses aligned with the target exposure thresholds.

The conventional titration-guided approach initiates therapy with label-recommended starting doses, requiring multiple empirical adjustments to reach therapeutic targets. This time-consuming trial-and-error process stems from inherent uncertainty in target dose localization. In contrast, PopPK-driven dose prediction provides mathematically derived optimal regimens, raising a pivotal question: should clinicians adhere to traditional stepwise titration or adopt model-informed precision dosing? This dilemma mirrors choosing between escalator (gradual titration) and elevator (direct target dosing) for reaching the same destination floor.

For LCM, with a favorable safety profile, the PopPK-guided "elevator" dose tailoring may represent a scientifically justified strategy, potentially shortening the time to achieve therapeutic efficacy while maintaining tolerability. While adult prescribing guidelines incorporate validated loading dose regimens to achieve rapid seizure control and clinical stabilization, pediatric-specific data remain conspicuously absent in current literature. However, a loading dose may be administered in pediatric patients for whom achieving the recommended maintenance dosage in a shorter timeframe is clinically indicated. Indeed, though LCM's favorable tolerability and low incidence of adverse events, further research is warranted. Intriguingly, brivaracetam prescribing information states that no titration is required when initiating treatment, which perfectly aligns with our proposed "elevator approach" of rapidly achieving the maintenance dose.
