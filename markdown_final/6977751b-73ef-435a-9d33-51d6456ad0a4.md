## Question

is lymphoid tissue in colon polyp precancerous

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether lymphoid tissue in a colon polyp is precancerous. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "lymphoid tissue" in this context actually represents histologically. Then, I should verify whether there is any evidence that such lymphoid proliferations participate in epithelial neoplastic pathways like the adenoma–carcinoma or serrated pathways. Next, I will examine data on malignant associations, making sure I don't conflate risks for lymphoma with those for colorectal adenocarcinoma. After that, I should consider diagnostic pitfalls where lymphoid aggregates may obscure or mimic true neoplasia and how deeper levels can clarify. Finally, I will synthesize management implications and surveillance guidance so we do not overcall benign reactive findings as precancerous lesions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities behind "lymphoid tissue" in colonic polyps. This term can reflect nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, which is composed of benign lymphoid follicles with germinal centers and mantle zones, or incidental mucosal lymphoid aggregates seen within or adjacent to mucosal lesions, both of which are usually reactive rather than neoplastic, and are distinct from primary lymphoid malignancies such as MALT lymphoma or other GI lymphomas [^113feGP5].

> I should verify the histopathology. Wait, let me verify the architectural features that would flag neoplasia versus reactivity. In nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, histology characteristically shows benign lymphoid nodules with enlarged germinal centers and intact mantle zones, without epithelial dysplasia, which supports a diagnosis of reactive hyperplasia rather than an epithelial precancerous lesion along the adenoma–carcinoma sequence [^113feGP5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "malignancy" risk. The gut-associated lymphoid tissue can, under chronic antigenic stimulation, undergo monoclonal proliferation predisposing to lymphoid malignancy, but that pathway leads to lymphoma, not to epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma; I should double-check that I am not mixing these two distinct oncogenic processes, and the literature indeed links inducible lymphoid tissues with lymphoma development rather than with the adenoma–carcinoma sequence of CRC [^113V3wFL] [^111zrDEt].

> Let me consider the epithelial precancer pathways now. The recognized precursors to colorectal adenocarcinoma are conventional adenomas and serrated lesions, not reactive lymphoid proliferations, and surveillance guidance is built around the number, size, histology, and completeness of resection of epithelial polyps rather than the presence of mucosal lymphoid aggregates or hyperplasia, which are not classified as neoplastic precursors in CRC prevention algorithms [^114x3TMG] [^1159eVzW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could lymphoid aggregates still mask or mimic real polyps and lead us to miss a true precursor lesion. I need to check whether deeper levels uncover occult adenomas in initially "lymphoid-only" biopsies. Indeed, studies show that when initial sections show only lymphoid aggregates or are nondiagnostic, deeper step sections can reveal previously occult polyps, including adenomas, which means lymphoid tissue may coexist with, obscure, or mimic small epithelial lesions rather than represent a precursor itself [^114bBnsZ] [^114yckb6].

> Next, I should review broader inflammatory contexts to avoid conflation. Postinflammatory polyps in IBD may look alarming but are non-neoplastic; importantly, contemporary data do not show an increased risk of advanced colorectal neoplasia in IBD patients solely due to postinflammatory polyps, underscoring that inflammatory and lymphoid components within "polypoid" tissue are not themselves precancerous drivers for CRC development [^114dPqzz].

> But wait, what if lymphoid tissue appears as polypoid lesions in other benign conditions, could that change risk. Polypoid appearances can occur in settings like lymphocytic colitis or reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and may require careful pathologic correlation to avoid overcalling neoplasia, and in rare hereditary contexts such as FAP, dense lymphoid aggregates may mimic adenomas endoscopically and occasionally coexist with lymphoid neoplasia, so appropriate ancillary testing like flow cytometry can help when lymphoma is a concern while keeping in mind that this is a distinct diagnostic pathway from epithelial CRC precursors [^116Lz521] [^113p2fxn].

> I will now examine management implications so that practice aligns with risk. I need to ensure that we do not escalate CRC surveillance solely due to reactive lymphoid tissue, and that we continue to follow established polypectomy and surveillance guidance based on epithelial histology and resection quality; endoscopically suspicious epithelial lesions should be resected en bloc when feasible and managed per guideline algorithms, while isolated lymphoid hyperplasia or aggregates without dysplasia do not mandate intensified CRC surveillance beyond routine recommendations [^115EC1Qv] [^114x3TMG].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. No, lymphoid tissue identified within or as polypoid colonic lesions is not a precancerous finding for colorectal adenocarcinoma; it is generally benign and reactive, may reflect mucosal immune responses, can coincide with or obscure small true epithelial polyps requiring careful histologic evaluation and deeper levels, and has a separate and infrequent association with lymphoid malignancy that should not be conflated with the epithelial adenoma–carcinoma pathway of CRC [^113feGP5] [^114bBnsZ] [^113V3wFL].

No, lymphoid tissue in colon polyps is **not precancerous**. It represents **benign lymphoid hyperplasia or aggregates** [^113feGP5], which are normal immune structures without malignant potential [^114x3TMG]. These lesions **do not progress to colorectal cancer** and do not require intensified surveillance. However, rare lymphoid proliferations (e.g. MALT lymphoma) can occur and should be distinguished histologically from benign lymphoid tissue [^113V3wFL].

## Histological characteristics of lymphoid tissue in colon polyps

Lymphoid tissue in colon polyps typically reflects **benign lymphoid hyperplasia or aggregates** [^113SSWD3]. **Benign lymphoid hyperplasia** (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, NLH) is a benign proliferation that often presents as multiple small, flat, whitish nodules throughout the colon and rectum [^113feGP5]. **Lymphoid aggregates** are clusters of lymphoid cells commonly found in the colon — particularly in the terminal ileum and cecum [^111nqa5Z] — associated with immune responses to antigenic stimulation [^113SSWD3]. Histologically, these tissues show **normal lymphoid architecture**, including germinal centers and mantle zones, without dysplasia or malignant transformation [^113feGP5].

---

## Clinical significance and malignant potential

The presence of lymphoid tissue in colon polyps is generally **benign and non-neoplastic** [^113feGP5]. Lymphoid hyperplasia and aggregates are common in the colon, often reflecting immune responses to infections, allergies, or chronic inflammation [^113SSWD3] [^111nqa5Z]. These lesions show no dysplasia or malignant transformation and are **not considered precancerous**. Rarely, **mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma** arises in the colon; it is distinct from benign hyperplasia and requires specific histological and immunohistochemical criteria for diagnosis [^113V3wFL]. MALT lymphoma is uncommon and represents only a small subset of colonic lymphoid proliferations.

---

## Molecular and genetic markers

Benign lymphoid hyperplasia and lymphoid aggregates in colon polyps **typically do not exhibit molecular or genetic features of malignant transformation**. These lesions lack dysplasia, atypia, and the mutations commonly associated with precancerous or malignant lesions. By contrast, precancerous colon polyps — such as adenomas or serrated polyps — harbor alterations including APC, KRAS, and BRAF mutations, microsatellite instability (MSI), and the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) [^1153LQ8t] [^113A3P7i]. These alterations are **absent in benign lymphoid hyperplasia and lymphoid aggregates**.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines do not consider lymphoid tissue in colon polyps precancerous. Benign lymphoid hyperplasia or lymphoid aggregates **do not necessitate intensified surveillance** or additional management beyond routine colonoscopic follow-up. If malignancy is suspected (e.g. MALT lymphoma), further evaluation with **immunohistochemistry and molecular testing** is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate management [^113V3wFL].

---

## Conclusion

Lymphoid tissue in colon polyps is **benign and non-neoplastic**, representing normal immune structures such as lymphoid hyperplasia or aggregates [^113feGP5]. These lesions lack malignant potential and are **not considered precancerous**. However, rare lymphoid proliferations, such as MALT lymphoma, can occur and require specific diagnostic criteria for identification [^113V3wFL]. Overall, the presence of lymphoid tissue in colon polyps **does not warrant intensified surveillance** or heightened concern for malignant transformation.

### Ileo-colonic lymphoma: Presentation, diagnosis, and management [^113V3wFL]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), primarily located in the ileo-colonic region, consists of the lymphoid cells of the gastrointestinal tract and provides specific immunological responses. Repetitive antigenic stimulation of these cells predisposes them to monoclonal proliferation, eventually leading to lymphoma development. The gastrointestinal tract is the most commonly involved site of extranodal lymphomas. This review focuses on lymphomas of the ileo-colonic region (defined as the terminal ileum, colon, and rectum), exploring the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and presentation along with practices in diagnosis and management.

Despite most GALT being located in the ileo-colonic region, lymphomas in this site are relatively rare. However, the overall annual incidence of ileo-colonic lymphomas is steadily increasing. This condition presents a varied spectrum of clinical manifestations. Ileo-colonoscopy with targeted biopsies can serve as a gold standard for definitive diagnosis. Ileo-colonic lymphomas may be managed with chemotherapy alone, reserving surgery for highly aggressive tumors or clinical emergencies. Radiation is not favored as an adjuvant treatment for lymphomas in this area of the gut. There is a lack of adequate endoscopic surveillance measures and tools to potentially prevent recurrence and improve the overall prognosis of this disease.

### Flat nodular lymphoid hyperplasia resembling "apple tree branches" in the colon [^113feGP5]. Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

A 19-year-old woman with a history of adjustment disorder presented with abdominal pain, bloating, and chronic diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed multiple flat whitish areas, less than 3 mm in diameter, diffusely distributed throughout the entire colon and rectum. These findings were prominent under narrow-band imaging (NBI) (Fig. 1a) and more difficult to distinguish with white-light imaging (Fig. 1b). The flat areas and the surrounding superficial vessels were described in the report as resembling "apple tree branches" (Video 1). Inspection of the terminal ileum was unremarkable, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy was unrevealing.

Histologic examination of the colonic biopsy specimens showed nodules of benign lymphoid tissue with enlarged germinal centers and an intact mantle zone, consistent with a diagnosis of nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH) (Fig. 2). Laboratory investigations and fecal calprotectin were within normal limits. Stool pathogen testing was negative. The patient was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and diffuse flat NLH.

- **Figure 2: Histologic appearance**: Showing a nodule of benign lymphoid tissue with an enlarged germinal center and an intact mantle zone.

A prior study reported that functional gastrointestinal disorders, now called disorders of gut–brain interaction (DGBI), were diagnosed in 63% of the symptomatic patients with NLH, with 91% of these patients fulfilling the Rome III criteria for IBS, mainly IBS-D subtype.

### Clinical significance of lymphoid hyperplasia of the lower gastrointestinal tract [^113SSWD3]. Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Lymphoid hyperplasia of the intestine has been associated with multiple diseases and symptoms. This study was undertaken to analyze the number and topographical distribution of the lymphoid follicles. A total of 302 adult consecutive patients were enrolled when they underwent elective colonoscopy. Standardized pictures from the terminal ileum and colon were taken using video colonoscopes. In each picture, the number, size, and mucosal elevation of lymphoid follicles were analyzed in relation to histological and immunological findings and medical history. Lymphoid hyperplasia was found to be most extensive in the terminal ileum and cecum. Patients with untreated gastrointestinally mediated allergy (GMA) showed the highest number of lymphoid follicles per visible field in the terminal ileum (P < 0.001) and cecum (P = 0.003) vs. the control group. Patients with infectious colitis also showed a high number of lymphoid follicles per endoscopic visible field in the transverse colon (P = 0.020). The presence of lymphoid hyperplasia is a frequent finding during colonoscopy and may indicate an enhanced immunological mucosal response to antigenic stimulation such as GMA or infection.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for colorectal polyps, specifically in the context of surveillance colonoscopy after polypectomy of sessile serrated polyps, the USMSTF 2020 guidelines recommend performing a repeat colonoscopy in 6 months for patients who have undergone piecemeal resection of adenomas or sessile serrated polyps larger than 20 mm.

### DNA-methylation variability in normal mucosa: A field cancerization marker in patients with adenomatous polyps [^1134Kes5]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2024). High credibility.

Molecular aberrations preceding cancer development have been documented in multiple tissues, even before the first clinically detectable lesions are apparent. Field cancerization refers to the replacement of normal cells with a cancer-prone population that has undergone some but not all of the necessary modifications for malignancy. Understanding the occurrence of field cancerization within a specific cancer type is critical to accurately determine the risk of developing a malignancy and, therefore, contribute to cancer prevention.

In colorectal cancer (CRC), field cancerization is of particular interest due to the considerable number of sporadic cases and the limitations of screening methods such as colonoscopy. Indeed, a high number of colonoscopies is required for CRC prevention, and one cannot exclude potential complications and post-colonoscopy cancer occurrence. Thus, better risk assessment through understanding polyp initiation and progression is essential to improve the effectiveness of screening and post-polypectomy surveillance.

Previous studies found evidence of field cancerization in the colon's normal mucosa during CRC development, mainly reporting DNA methylation changes. Yet, genome-wide characterization of field defects in pre-neoplastic colon lesions is lacking. Here, we focus on adenomatous polyps (AP), the primary precursor in CRC development, constituting more than 80% of polyps. As evidenced by studies of other organs, characterizing field defects associated with pre-neoplastic lesions requires large sample sizes to capture potentially weak signals.

### No increased risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and postinflammatory polyps [^114dPqzz]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) bear an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, IBD patients undergo surveillance colonoscopies to detect and remove premalignant dysplastic lesions such as low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD). This may prevent progression to CRC and allow early detection of CRC, minimizing the morbidity and mortality associated with invasive cancer.

The leading European surveillance guideline recommends surveillance intervals based on risk stratification, categorizing IBD patients into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups based on several risk factors. Likewise, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recommends an increased surveillance frequency in patients with certain risk factors. One of these risk factors includes the presence of postinflammatory polyps (PIPs), although evidence for PIPs as a risk factor for CRC in IBD patients is limited.

PIPs, commonly referred to as "pseudopolyps", are non-neoplastic lesions that look like polyps or loose mucosal tags. The overall prevalence of PIPs in IBD patients is estimated at 20%–40%. PIPs are the remnants of severe inflammation that are formed of stromal and epithelial components and inflammatory cells, and they are associated with longstanding IBD. Patients with PIPs may be at increased risk of advanced neoplasia (i.e. HGD or CRC), as PIPs may indicate longstanding severe inflammation, which is associated with an increased CRC risk. In addition, PIPs may mask otherwise visible and resectable dysplasia.

### Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and gut flora analysis in intestinal polyps patients [^114bk6Gd]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

The intestinal polyp is the precancerous lesion of colorectal cancer. DNA methylation and intestinal microbiota may play an important role in the development of intestinal polyps.

- **Materials and methods**: In this study, we included 10 patients with intestinal polyps who received the colonoscopy examination. We applied the Illumina Human Methylation 850K array to investigate the epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns. Then, we filtered out the hub genes in the protein-protein interaction networks using functional epigenetic modules analysis. We also analyzed the colonizing bacteria on the surface of polyps compared with those in normal colonic mucosal epithelium with 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing.

- **Results**: We identified 323 hypermethylated sites and 7992 hypomethylated sites between intestinal polyps and normal samples. Five hub genes, including CREB1, LPA, SVIL, and KRT18, were identified in five modules. Hypomethylation of CREB1 is a candidate marker of colorectal adenoma. Gut microbiota analysis showed that Butyricicoccus was significantly decreased in the intestinal polyp groups.

- **Conclusion**: In conclusion, we identified DNA methylation disparities in intestinal polyps compared with normal tissue, of which methylation of CREB1 may hold clinical significance in colorectal cancer progress. Colonizing bacteria in the colonic epithelium might be related to the formation of intestinal polyps.

### Oxysterols in intestinal immunity and inflammation [^112zGVN6]. Journal of internal medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Localized, microbiota-independent, 7α,25-OHC production occurs in colonic lymphoid structures. This is mediated by specialized podoplanin+ CD34− CXCL13+ stromal cells residing in cryptopatches and isolated lymphoid follicles. Based on their phenotype, they can be classified as fibroblastic stromal cells. A second subset of podoplanin+ stromal cells mainly resides outside of cryptopatches and isolated lymphoid follicles. This population is CD34+ and highly expresses the enzyme HSD3B7 that degrades the GPR183 ligand 7α,25-OHC. Therefore, these stromal cells likely act as a sink for 7α,25-OHC produced by podoplanin+ CD34− CXCL13+ stromal cells, thereby creating an oxysterol gradient that attracts GPR183+ ILCs to the sites where cryptopatches are formed.

Previous work indicated that oxysterols exert complex effects on IgA production in the intestine. It has been reported that 25-OHC suppresses IgA production through inhibiting class switching in vitro. Accordingly, CH25H-deficient mice have lower amounts of IgA. In contrast, IgA is moderately increased in mice lacking CYP7B1, suggesting that 7α,25-OHC-mediated B-cell positioning may stimulate IgA generation. However, we found that GPR183 deficiency does not significantly alter intestinal IgA concentrations.

### Molecular alterations in chronic ulcerative colitis-associated and sporadic hyperplastic polyps: A comparative analysis [^113yj9kG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

There is growing interest in the biological and molecular features and neoplastic potential of colonic hyperplastic polyps because of the recent finding of K-ras mutations in many of these lesions. Hyperplastic polyps may also develop in chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC), but it is unclear if these are biologically similar to the sporadic type. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the molecular profile of CUC-associated hyperplastic polyps with sporadic hyperplastic polyps of the colon.

- **Methods**: Thirty-nine hyperplastic polyps from 26 CUC patients, 39 sporadic hyperplastic polyps from 29 age- and sex-matched patients without CUC, and 26 colonic mucosal biopsies from 22 patients with CUC but without hyperplastic polyps were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for loss of heterozygosity of APC, 3p, p53, and p16, and for mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 of the K-ras gene. Immunohistochemical evaluations for the proliferation-associated nuclear peptide Ki67 (MIB-1) and p27 were also performed on a subset of hyperplastic polyps.

- **Results**: CUC-associated hyperplastic polyps showed a proportion of genetic alterations (47%) similar to that of sporadic hyperplastic polyps (33%) [p > 0.05], and neither significantly differed from chronically inflamed mucosae in CUC patients without hyperplastic polyps. Furthermore, in a small group of CUC patients in which informative tissue was available from both their hyperplastic polyps and adjacent flat colitic mucosae, the polyps contained mutations that were not present in the underlying mucosa.

### Current issues in inflammatory bowel disease neoplasia [^111J1HBb]. Histopathology (2015). Low credibility.

Recent histological criteria and developments in the field of endoscopic imaging have led to higher detection rates of neoplasms in ulcerative colitis. Once a lesion is detected, endoscopic resection is recommended to guide subsequent surveillance or therapy and to gain adequate material for histological diagnosis. Further management is based on the grade of neoplasia and on whether the neoplasia is categorized as sporadic or colitis-associated. Nevertheless, it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish colitis-associated neoplasms from sporadic neoplasms. A better way to report this may be ultimately classified. Here, we review endoscopic and histological parameters to help differentiate colitis-associated neoplasia from sporadic lesions and discuss pathogenesis and therapeutic options.

### Intestinal lymphoid tissues: Is variety an asset or a liability [^111zrDEt]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Advances in our understanding of lymphoid tissue development have led to an appreciation of the variety of these structures in the intestinal mucosa. This knowledge has translated into a more critical analysis of the function of mucosal lymphoid tissues and may lead to the manipulation of the development of these structures as a therapeutic modality. This review summarizes recent progress in understanding the variety, formation, and function of these structures.

- **Recent findings**: The intestinal mucosa and submucosa contain three types of lymphoid tissues ranging from the developmentally determined Peyer's patches to the inflammatory-derived tertiary lymphoid tissues. Intermediate to these is a unique lymphoid tissue, isolated lymphoid follicles, which shares properties of both Peyer's patches and tertiary lymphoid tissues. In the healthy intestine, Peyer's patches and isolated lymphoid follicles generate protective and homeostatic immune responses. During chronic inflammation, the function of the more inducible lymphoid tissues, isolated lymphoid follicles and tertiary lymphoid tissues, is unclear, but may include an ominous role propagating inappropriate responses and predisposing to malignancy.

- **Summary**: Understanding the variety of lymphoid tissues, how they function, and how they develop may offer strategies to manipulate these structures to optimize mucosal vaccines and treat intestinal inflammatory diseases.

### Expert opinions and scientific evidence for colonoscopy key performance indicators [^117QFNt2]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

After a polyp has been removed, it is currently necessary to retrieve it for histological assessment. Polyps with a diameter of ≥ 1 cm have an increased probability of advanced features such as high-grade dysplasia, villous components, or cancer. Polyps < 1 cm less frequently, but still potentially, contain these features and require retrieval. The histology of polyps is used to calculate surveillance intervals based on adenoma numbers and, in some countries, the numbers of serrated polyps. Polyp retrieval is also considered a reflection of the technical skill and application of the colonoscopist. Studies have shown no difference in the success rates of methods of polyp retrieval (e.g. suction, Roth nets), with some techniques limited by polyp size. The recommended polyp retrieval rates (PRRs) are ≥ 90% in the UK and ≥ 95% in the United States.

In the future, endoscopic visual assessment of polyps in vivo, using enhanced imaging modalities, may allow accurate optical identification of adenomatous polyps. This would eliminate the need for histological review and reduce histopathology workload. The so-called Detect InSpect Characterise Resect And Discard (DISCARD) strategy — mainly for polyps ≤ 5 mm — has been summarized in multiple reviews and meta-analyses, including a recent ASGE recommendation update. This review shows that almost all endoscopic techniques seem to achieve high accuracy rates in endoscopic polyp differential diagnosis, primarily based on studies from expert centers. The Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable Endoscopic Innovations (PIVI) statement issued by the ASGE has provided guidance on this matter.

### Evaluation of colonoscopic results of patients with incidental colonic FDG uptake in PET/CT imaging [^115AER4k]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is a significant global health concern, ranking as the second most deadly and third most common cancer worldwide. Early detection and removal of precancerous lesions play a crucial role in preventing cancer development and reducing mortality. Since FDG uptake is not specific for malignancy, incidental increased FDG uptake in the gastrointestinal tract may be challenging to interpret and may require further colonoscopic examination. This study aimed to investigate the features associated with malignant and premalignant pathology in patients with incidental colonic FDG uptake and determine the necessity of colonoscopy for each FDG uptake.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was performed on data from patients who underwent colonoscopies between January 2016 and December 2021. Patients with FDG uptake in known colorectal malignancy regions were excluded. The study included 56 patients with incidental colonic FDG uptake. PET/CT images were visually and quantitatively analyzed, and the corresponding colonoscopy and histopathological results were recorded. Statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between FDG uptake patterns, SUVmax values, and histopathological diagnoses. Colonoscopic findings were categorized as malignancy, polyps, and non-neoplastic lesions.

- **Results**: Among the 56 patients with incidental colonic FDG uptake, 36 lesions were identified, and histopathology revealed malignancy in 10 (17.9%) patients and premalignant polyps in 26 (46.4%) cases. Focal FDG uptake with corresponding wall thickening or soft tissue…

### Is the distal hyperplastic polyp a marker for proximal neoplasia [^112HnHi5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The literature is unclear about the association between distal hyperplastic polyps and synchronous neoplasia, which includes adenomatous polyps and cancer in the proximal colon. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of proximal neoplasia associated with distal hyperplastic polyps.

- **Data sources**: Database searches were conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1966 to 2001, along with a manual search of the bibliographies of included and excluded studies, case reports, editorials, review articles, and textbooks of gastroenterology.

- **Study selection**: Studies describing the prevalence of proximal neoplasia in individuals with distal hyperplastic polyps were selected.

- **Data extraction**: Information on demographics, clinical variables, study design, and prevalence of proximal neoplasia associated with various distal colorectal findings was extracted.

- **Data synthesis**: Of the 18 included studies, 12 involved asymptomatic individuals where the pooled absolute risk of any proximal neoplasia associated with distal hyperplastic polyps was found to be 25% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 21% to 29%). In 4 studies where colonoscopy was performed irrespective of distal findings, the absolute risk was 21% (95% CI, 14% to 28%). The relative risk of finding any proximal neoplasia in those with distal hyperplastic polyps was 1.3 (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.8) compared to those with no distal polyps. Among 6 studies of patients with symptoms or risk factors for neoplasia, the absolute risk of proximal neoplasia was 35% (95% CI, 32% to 39%) in individuals with distal hyperplastic polyps. In 2 studies of screening colonoscopy, advanced proximal neoplasia such as cancer, or a polyp with villous histology, was further assessed.

### Lymphocytic follicles and aggregates are a determinant of mucosal damage and duration of diarrhea [^113ZGZk4]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Nonspecific changes, such as nonspecific chronic inflammation, are the most common diagnosis in colorectal biopsy interpretation for patients with chronic diarrhea; however, these changes hold little clinical significance.

The objective of this study was to identify histologic and immunohistologic diagnostic criteria within this group to predict the duration and resolution of diarrhea. A cohort of 47 patients with chronic diarrhea, characterized by near-normal histology and no clear etiologic agent, was analyzed for detailed clinical features and histologic findings. Immunohistochemistry of mast cells (CD117) and Treg cells (FOXP3) was evaluated in 39 patients.

The results indicated that an increased number of lymphoid follicles and aggregates, an increased number of mast cells, and a paucity of Treg cells were key statistically significant findings (P = 0.003, P = 0.008, and P = 0.04, respectively). The duration of diarrhea correlated with several factors: the number of large lymphoid follicles and aggregates (P = 0.001, r = .48), total lymphoid follicles and aggregates (P = 0.003, r = .43), density of lymphoid follicles and aggregates (P = 0.009, r = .38), total lymphoid follicles and aggregates per biopsy (P = 0.004, r = .42), and the number of mast cells (P = 0.001, r = .52). Furthermore, the number of mast cells and Treg cells showed a significant difference between cases that resolved and those that did not (P = 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively).

In conclusion, the presence of lymphocytic follicles and aggregates colitis, previously considered of negligible diagnostic significance, provides a predictive marker for the behavior of chronic diarrhea in a subset of patients.

### Familial adenomatous polyposis and duodenal lymphoma: report of a case [^113p2fxn]. Diseases of the colon and rectum (2003). Low credibility.

The occurrence of duodenal polyposis is well recognized in familial adenomatous polyposis. Lymphoid hyperplasia in association with familial adenomatous polyposis usually occurs in the terminal ileum, but it can occur in the duodenum and may be endoscopically difficult to distinguish from an adenoma. A case report is presented in which a 54-year-old male with familial adenomatous polyposis, who 20 years earlier had a subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis, presented with a large rectal villous tumor and was found to have a duodenal extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. The role of lymphoid hyperplasia in the development of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma is discussed, as well as the issue of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma in familial adenomatous polyposis. In cases in which biopsies of polypoid lesions in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis show dense lymphoid aggregates, flow cytometry may assist in the diagnosis.

### Endoscopic characterization of neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions in inflammatory bowel disease: Systematic review in the era of advanced endoscopic imaging [^112yvUj9]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The accurate differentiation of neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions found during IBD surveillance endoscopy is of paramount importance, with the presence of mucosal inflammation, scarring, and inflammatory lesions leading to particular challenges unique to IBD. It is therefore critical that validated endoscopic criteria are used in combination with advanced endoscopic techniques to support lesion characterization. This approach involves the removal of only those lesions strongly suspected to be neoplastic, while the more frequent non-neoplastic lesions are left in situ.

The statistical thresholds that represent sufficient accuracy for optical diagnosis remain unclear, with guidelines proposing varying rates of sensitivity (ranging from 80% to 90%), specificity (80%), and negative predictive value (90%) to support 'diagnose and leave' or 'resect and discard' strategies in the non-colitis setting. These guidelines consider only diminutive polyps (1–5 mm) in either the recto-sigmoid or entire colon. However, these strategies have yet to be validated in IBD, particularly due to the failure to demonstrate a correlation between lesion size and neoplasia risk in IBD, which hinders decision-making.

Notably, it remains unclear which technology should be applied for lesion characterization following detection. Clinical judgment alone, even with experienced endoscopists, is insufficiently accurate, with a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 54%. In the absence of accurate diagnostic criteria, it could therefore be argued that all lesions found during IBD surveillance should be removed and sent for histopathological assessment. However, this approach clearly risks overtreatment.

### Lymphoid aggregates may contribute to the migration and epithelial commitment of bone marrow-derived cells in colonic mucosa [^112PJtGX]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Colonic inflammation is followed by regeneration supported by bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), including multipotent cells. These cells migrate to the colonic epithelial layer and may transdifferentiate into epithelial-like cells or retain their stem cell characteristics to produce progeny. The aim was to study the role of lymphoid aggregates in the migration and transition of BMDCs in both healthy colons and non-specific colitis (NSC).

Samples of normal colon (n = 5) and NSC (n = 5) from female patients initially transplanted with male bone marrow were studied. After detecting XY chromosomes using fluorescent in situ hybridization, tissue sections were digitized, the coverslips were removed, and the samples were double-stained for CD45 and cytokeratin with immunofluorescence. CDX2 expression, as a sign of intestinal epithelial commitment of Musashi-1+ stromal BMDCs, was also tested using both immunoperoxidase and parallel immunofluorescence stainings. The slides were digitized again and analyzed simultaneously.

A significant increase in intraepithelial CD45-BMDCs was found in regions adjacent to lymphoid aggregates (median: 1.01) compared with healthy epithelial regions (median: 0.0175) or NSC (median: 0.04) samples. The stromal Musashi-1+ cells were positive for CDX2, indicating epithelial differentiation. The CDX2+ cells bearing the Y chromosome confirmed the epithelial commitment of several stromal BMDCs.

An elevated number of intraepithelial CD45-BMDCs at lymphoid aggregates suggests that BMDCs play a role in epithelial differentiation and commitment.

### Serrated polyps of right colon: guilty or innocent [^117UDHjn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The features of serrated lesions are detailed in this study. The examination of serrated polyps, located primarily in the right colon, remains a subject of ongoing debate and inquiry. Their ambiguous nature poses a diagnostic challenge in gastroenterology. By identifying specific characteristics and classification criteria, researchers aim to clarify their biological significance and potential risk factors associated with their presence.

### Diagnostic and reporting issues of preneoplastic polyps of the large intestine with early carcinoma [^1133Xdwc]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2019). Low credibility.

Premalignant polyps of the large intestine are common specimens in surgical pathology. They consist of several different subtypes identifiable by histological criteria that are associated with different molecular characteristics and with the development of different types of colorectal carcinoma. The most common of these is the conventional adenoma, which most commonly leads to carcinomas with a low degree of methylation (CIMP-L) that are microsatellite stable. In Lynch syndrome patients, these polyps lead to CIMP-L carcinomas that are microsatellite instable. The second most common is the sessile serrated adenoma, which leads to carcinomas with a high degree of methylation (CIMP-H) that may be either microsatellite stable or instable. The least common premalignant polyp is the traditional serrated adenoma, which can lead to either CIMP-L or CIMP-H carcinomas, most often microsatellite stable. This paper reviews the histological features of these lesions, discusses problems in diagnosis, and explores the role of histology in management.

### Colonic lymphoid hyperplasia in melanosis coli [^111ERKs7]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a patient with Rett syndrome, a condition characterized by progressive infant encephalopathy, developmental delay, dementia, autism, ataxia, microcephaly, spastic paraparesis, and autonomic neuropathy with constipation. At colonoscopy, multiple foci of tiny white, sessile, polypoid lesions were observed throughout the colon and rectum, resembling small hyperplastic or adenomatous polyps, and were associated with generalized melanosis coli. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of melanosis coli in a patient with Rett syndrome. Since melanosis pigment deposition is typically not present in lymphoid tissue, the lymphoid tissue was identifiable at endoscopy as multiple white nodules mimicking generalized colonic polyposis throughout the colon. We discuss the likely mechanisms of lymphoid hyperplasia and coexistent melanosis coli in Rett syndrome.

### Mad1 upregulation sensitizes to inflammation-mediated tumor formation [^116gCFf8]. PLOS Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

Lesions identified by colonoscopy were subjected to histological analysis by a board-certified pathologist. Two hyperplastic polyps, two tubular adenomas with high-grade dysplasia, and one mucinous adenocarcinoma were identified in HA-MAD1 mice (Fig 5 and Table 1). In p53 ± mice, two lesions were identified by colonoscopy; histological analysis revealed that one was a tubular adenoma whereas the other was a lymphoid aggregate. Overall, DSS-treated HA-MAD1 colons showed a range of morphologies, from hyperplastic polyps to overt adenocarcinoma.

- **Pathology of colon tumors in DSS-treated HA-MAD1 mice**: Lesions in HA-MAD1 and p53 ± colons were excised, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with H&E, Ki-67, and β-catenin. Example images of normal colon, hyperplastic polyp, tubular adenoma, tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, and a mucinous adenocarcinoma are shown. Black insets in the first column are enlarged in the second column, and red insets in the second column are enlarged in the Ki-67 and β-catenin columns. Serial sections were used for staining with H&E, Ki-67, and β-catenin. Ki-67 staining is confined to the base of the crypts in the no-lesion control and the hyperplastic polyp. Ki-67 positive cells are identified higher up in the crypts in the tubular adenoma. The tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia loses crypt structure but has positive Ki-67 staining throughout. The adenocarcinoma had pockets of epithelial cells with positive Ki-67 lining the large mucin pools. Arrows indicate cells with positive Ki-67 staining.

### IL-17a-producing NKp44(-) group 3 innate lymphoid cells accumulate in familial adenomatous polyposis duodenal tissue [^112pKfZt]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Beyond their role in mediating immunity against pathogens and maintaining tissue homeostasis at mucosal sites, emerging data indicate that ILCs play an important role in tumor formation and progression. Regarding gastrointestinal tumors, however, the exact involvement of ILCs is currently not fully understood, and data on the role of ILCs in duodenal tumorigenesis are particularly scarce.

In this work, we analyze duodenal tissue from a large cohort of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients and present initial evidence that IL-17A-producing ILC3s may shape a duodenal microenvironment conducive to oncogenic transformation. Targeting these cells may, therefore, represent a promising therapeutic approach to prevent the formation of duodenal carcinoma.

### Comparative molecular pathology of sporadic hyperplastic polyps and neoplastic lesions from the same individual [^111MBSgS]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

The biology of colorectal hyperplastic polyps is of considerable relevance because recent evidence suggests that, under certain circumstances, hyperplastic polyps may be precursors of neoplasms. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the clinical and molecular characteristics of hyperplastic polyps and neoplastic lesions removed from patients without the hyperplastic polyposis syndrome.

- **Methods**: One hundred twenty-six patients were identified through a series of genetic epidemiological studies. Each patient had at least one neoplastic lesion and one hyperplastic polyp; there was a total of 147 hyperplastic polyps. All lesions were evaluated for K-ras mutations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, and microsatellite instability.

- **Results**: K-ras mutation was detected in 15 (10%) hyperplastic polyps, all from the rectosigmoid colon. No hyperplastic polyp had APC LOH or microsatellite instability. Patients with adenomas or carcinomas showing K-ras mutations were not more likely to have hyperplastic polyps with K-ras mutations. The average number of adenomas did not differ between patients with hyperplastic polyps with K-ras mutations and those without K-ras mutations. There was no association between the hyperplastic polyp and the adenoma regarding the colon segments from which the two lesions were removed.

- **Conclusions**: The sporadic hyperplastic polyp is a lesion with limited molecular change and no relation to patients' neoplastic lesions.

### Low-grade dysplasia in ulcerative colitis: Risk factors for developing high-grade dysplasia or colorectal cancer [^1166zEkg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

As one of the ultimate goals of managing low-grade dysplasia (LGD) is to promptly recognize high-risk lesions that warrant surgical intervention from those that can be appropriately managed endoscopically, there is a need for a study to assess the full spectrum of patients diagnosed with LGD. This would help characterize features associated with progression to more advanced neoplasia.

To fulfill this need, in this study, we investigated data collected from the ulcerative colitis (UC) surveillance program at a large tertiary center in the United Kingdom (UK) with the aim of identifying potential risk factors. These factors could be used to identify patients with a diagnosis of LGD who have a high risk of developing high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or colorectal cancer (CRC).

### To step or not to step: an approach to clinically diagnosed polyps with no initial pathologic finding [^114yckb6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

We determined whether there were additional diagnostic findings in additional level sections performed on polyps with no pathologic diagnosis (NPD), or those in which only lymphoid aggregates (LAs) were seen initially, and determined the level at which findings were identified. All colorectal biopsy specimens submitted with a clinical diagnosis of polyp during a 6-month period were included (N = 733). Initially, three level sections were cut for each polyp, and if a cause for the polyp was found, no additional levels were evaluated. If LAs or no cause for the polyp was found, five additional levels through each block were examined. Any diagnostic findings and the level at which they were identified were recorded.

- **Findings**: A discrete cause for the polyp was identified in routine levels in 574 cases (78.3%). Deeper levels were performed in 159 cases: 23 for clarification of a suspected diagnosis, 38 for LAs, and 98 for NPD. Findings were identified in 31 (22.8%) of 136 cases stepped for LA or NPD, with neoplastic findings in 13 (9.6%). Most diagnoses were identified in levels 4 or 5, but tubular adenomas were found in levels 7 and 8.

These results support level sectioning specimens submitted as polyps with NPD or LAs on initial sections.

### Serrated polyps of right colon: guilty or innocent [^114sMPXz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the efforts made through screening with colonoscopy and polypectomy, there is a significant decrease in CRCs of the left colon; however, this does not apply to CRCs of the right colon. CRCs of the right colon seem to express specific molecular features (CIMP-H, MSI-H), which differ from those of conventional adenomas. Currently, interest has shifted to studying these cancers because they present a challenge regarding optimal CRC prevention. These CRCs appear to have serrated polyps as precursor lesions, which were until recently included in the "innocent group" of hyperplastic polyps (HPs). Now, the malignant potential of these lesions has been recognized.

The rate of their progression to CRC has not yet been determined, but there is a theory suggesting that these lesions may actually progress faster than conventional adenomas. The World Health Organization (WHO) published a classification of these lesions in 2010, indicating that the most "dangerous" are the sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps). These are typically flat, sessile, and tend to be located in the right colon, often complicating their endoscopic detection. Tubular serrated adenomas (TSAs) also present a malignant potential, although they are rare and mainly located in the left colon compared to SSA/Ps. Generally, TSAs manifest molecular characteristics, distribution, and behavior closer to that of conventional adenomas.

In addition, there is an increased risk for CRC development recognized in patients with serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS) and their first-degree relatives. Recently, WHO published updated criteria for the diagnosis of this syndrome.

### The proto CPG island methylator phenotype of sessile serrated adenomas/polyps [^113A3P7i]. Epigenetics (2018). Low credibility.

At the precancerous level, the World Health Organization (WHO) currently recognizes three classes of serrated colorectal lesions: hyperplastic polyps, traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs), and sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps) [19]. The latter two are both thought to have malignant potential, but SSA/Ps are considered the most likely precursors of CIMP colon malignancies. Like CIMP cancers, large SSA/Ps develop mainly in the proximal colon and frequently express the constitutively activated BRAFV600E serine/threonine kinase [6, 15, 20, 21]. The hyperactive MAPK signaling caused by this mutant protein is thought to be responsible for many features of the serrated colorectal tumors, including the CIMP [22–25].

Early endoscopic removal of advanced precancerous lesions has proved to be the most effective way to reduce colon cancer-related mortality, and large proximal-colon SSA/Ps are now considered no less dangerous in this sense than cADNs, which are the most frequent colon cancer precursors [26]. However, SSA/Ps are easier to miss during endoscopy, partly because of their location but also because of their morphology [21, 27–29]. They are nearly always flat or sessile lesions with poorly defined borders and colors resembling those of the normal mucosa, features that impede both their detection and complete endoscopic resection [30]. Finally, pathologic diagnosis of serrated lesions is still subject to substantial inter-examiner variability, so endoscopically resected SSA/Ps are likely to be misclassified [6, 21, 29, 31]. These factors converge to create an obvio

### Endoscopic and surgical management of serrated colonic polyps [^112EwXAD]. The British Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Serrated polyps are an inhomogeneous group of lesions that harbor precursors of colorectal cancer. Research has been directed at further defining the histopathological characteristics of these lesions, but definitive treatment recommendations are unclear. The aim was to review the literature regarding classification, molecular genetics, and the natural history of these lesions in order to propose a treatment algorithm for surgeons to consider.

- **Methods**: The PubMed database was searched using the following search terms: serrated polyp, serrated adenoma, hyperplastic polyp, hyperplastic polyposis, adenoma, endoscopy, surgery, guidelines. Papers published between 1980 and 2010 were selected.

- **Results**: Sixty papers met the selection criteria. Most authors agree that recommendations regarding endoscopic or surgical management should be based on the polyp's neoplastic potential. Polyps greater than 5 mm should be biopsied to determine their histology so that intervention can be directed accurately. Narrow-band imaging or chromoendoscopy may facilitate the detection and assessment of the extent of lesions. Complete endoscopic removal of sessile serrated adenomas in the left or right colon is recommended. Follow-up colonoscopy is recommended in 2–6 months if endoscopic removal is incomplete. If the lesion cannot be entirely removed endoscopically, segmental colectomy is strongly recommended due to the malignant potential of these polyps. Left-sided lesions are more likely to be pedunculated, making them more amenable to successful endoscopic removal.

### Multiomic analysis of familial adenomatous polyposis reveals molecular pathways associated with early tumorigenesis [^113YUwQ8]. Nature Cancer (2024). High credibility.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a genetic disease causing hundreds of premalignant polyps in affected persons and serves as an ideal model to study transitions of early precancer states to colorectal cancer (CRC). We performed deep multiomic profiling of 93 samples, including normal mucosa, benign polyps, and dysplastic polyps from six persons with FAP. Transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic analyses revealed a dynamic choreography of thousands of molecular and cellular events that occur during precancerous transitions toward cancer formation. These involve processes such as cell proliferation, immune response, metabolic alterations (including amino acids and lipids), hormones, and extracellular matrix proteins. Interestingly, activation of the arachidonic acid pathway was found to occur early in hyperplasia; this pathway is targeted by aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, a preventative treatment under investigation in persons with FAP. Overall, our results reveal key genomic, cellular, and molecular events during the earliest steps in CRC formation and potential mechanisms of pharmaceutical prophylaxis.

### Colorectal carcinoma with dome-like phenotype: An under-recognised subset of colorectal carcinoma [^11244t88]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The term "dome carcinoma" has been applied to a variant of colorectal carcinoma, thought to derive from M-cells of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Its distinguishing morphological features include a non-polypoid plaque-like lesion composed of closely apposed cystically dilated glands lined by a single layer of non-mucinous cells, intensely PAS-positive intraluminal material, and a close spatial relation to lymphoid stroma.

- **Aims and methods**: A search in the literature for such cases and the authors' experience with carcinomas sharing morphological details with dome carcinoma are presented to direct focus on this unique phenotype of colorectal carcinoma and to expand on its morphology.

- **Results**: Four such examples, all stage pT1, pN0, have been previously reported. Here, two additional cases with several features of dome carcinoma, stage pT1 and pT2 respectively, are added. An extensive intramucosal component unassociated with adenomatous growth, a pink quality of the lesional cells, low-grade budding, absence of cytoplasmic pseudofragments, and absence of necrosis characterized the present cases as well. These cases also displayed intact MMR-proteins and loss of APC. In contrast to two of the previously reported cases, intraepithelial lymphocytes were unapparent in these cases and the lymphoid stroma was effaced along with tumor progression in one of the present cases. Hence, a range of appearances is encompassed by the dome carcinoma. The uncommon reporting of dome carcinoma may be due to lack of awareness of this particular subset of colorectal carcinoma. Indeed, one of the current…

### Development of a murine colonoscopic polypectomy model (with videos) [^115ownaE]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Colonoscopy provides a means for screening and removal of colon adenomas, preventing such lesions from progressing to late-stage carcinoma. No preclinical model currently exists that closely parallels the clinical scenario with respect to polyp resection and recovery after endoscopy.

- **Methods**: When we used the polyposis in rat colon (Pirc) model, a new polypectomy methodology was developed. A novel PLC classification system (polyp number/location/clockwise orientation) also was devised to accurately and reproducibly specify the location of each lesion within the colon.

- **Results**: One week after surgery, injuries to the polypectomy site were confined to the submucosa, indicating little or no damage occurred to the inner muscle layer of the colon. Polypectomy sites occasionally continued to show ulcer formation, whereas others exhibited tissue regeneration. A pilot study (n = 6 animals), involving a total of 37 polypectomies, confirmed that the new methodology could be applied using either air insufflation or water-assisted techniques, with either hot or cold snare. Generally, polyps tended to be more fully distended and less flattened against the colon mucosa using the water-assisted protocol, increasing the technical ease of ensnaring and resecting lesions. The PLC system proved to be straightforward and facilitated longitudinal studies by allowing the investigator to track each polypectomy site on repeated examination.

- **Conclusions**: The Pirc model was ideally suited to colonoscopy with polypectomy.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for colon cancer, particularly in relation to the choice of screening tests, the primary recommendation from the USMSTF 2020 guidelines is to schedule a repeat colonoscopy in 10 years. This applies to patients with 20 or fewer hyperplastic polyps, each less than 10 mm in size, located in the rectum or sigmoid colon, which were removed during a high-quality examination.

### British Society of Gastroenterology position statement on serrated polyps in the colon and rectum [^113gjp5m]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

- **Detection at colonoscopy**: The prevalence of serrated lesions (SLs), especially sessile serrated lesions (SSLs), is difficult to determine accurately. This is due to variable results in the literature caused by inconsistent diagnostic criteria, inappropriate histological classification of subtypes, variation in polyp detection rates among endoscopists, use of different endoscopic enhancing modalities, and population selection criteria. Several studies have shown that polyps previously labeled as hyperplastic are often reclassified as serrated adenomas upon review. There is also substantial interobserver variation among gastrointestinal pathologists in diagnosing SSLs. Despite these challenges, evidence suggests SSL detection is improving, likely due to increased recognition by endoscopists and pathologists.

- **Prevalence**: Based on autopsy studies, the prevalence of SLs has been reported to be between 13% and 35%, with these lesions accounting for 27%–51% of all colorectal polyps. Recent pathology series demonstrate the most common SL encountered is the hyperplastic polyp (HP), accounting for 24%–42% of all resected colorectal polyps and 83%–96% of all SLs. SSLs represent 2%–4% of all polyps and 3%–11% of SLs. Tubular serrated adenomas (TSAs) are much less common, generally accounting for less than 1% of all polyps and 1%–7% of SLs.

The distribution of SLs also varies with type: HPs and TSAs are usually found in the left colon, while SSLs occur more often in the proximal colon.

### Diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease-associated neoplasia: Considerations in the modern era [^115paDk9]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at an increased risk of developing intestinal neoplasia, particularly colorectal neoplasia, including dysplasia and colorectal cancer (CRC), as a primary consequence of chronic inflammation. While the incidence of CRC in IBD is lower compared to prior decades — due, in large part, to more effective therapies and improved colonoscopic technologies — CRC still accounts for a significant proportion of IBD-related deaths. The focus of this review is on the pathogenesis; epidemiology, including disease- and patient-related risk factors; diagnosis; surveillance; and management of IBD-associated neoplasia.

### Why does intestinal metaplasia develop early on gastric mucosa of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma patients [^115YJNfM]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

There is evidence suggesting that patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the stomach are at increased risk of developing gastric cancer. More specifically, it has been estimated that the risk of metachronous cancer is increased from 6- to 16-fold in these patients. Such risk was attributed to the persistence of lymphoma or to chemotherapy, but a role for the development of intestinal metaplasia (IM) on gastric mucosa following lymphoma remission could be significant. Indeed, IM is a precancerous lesion that increases by 11.3-fold the probability of gastric cancer onset when the incomplete (colonic) IM type is present. According to Correa's cascade for gastric carcinogenesis, IM develops relentlessly following long-lasting chronic active gastritis — mainly caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) — and atrophic gastritis, generally after years or decades. The late onset of IM is further corroborated by the observation that it is distinctly more prevalent in the elderly than in young patients. In contrast, some observations highlighted a very early (within a few months) onset and progression of IM in both MALT lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients following remission. The reasons for this remain unclear. We hypothesize that the lymphoepithelial lesions (LELs) on the gastric mucosa of lymphoma patients may play a role.

### Step section histology of proximal colon polyps that appear hyperplastic by endoscopy [^115Wyd7D]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Recent studies have identified a group of polyps, usually located in the proximal colon, with distinct endoscopic features that predict hyperplastic histology. These polyps may occasionally have foci of dysplastic (adenomatous) tissue. The aim was to define the prevalence of adenomatous foci in these polyps.

- **Methods**: Fifty-one consecutive hyperplastic-appearing proximal colon polyps were sectioned at 1-mm intervals for histological analysis.
- **Results**: All 51 polyps were hyperplastic, but two (4%) had foci of adenomatous tissue.
- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of adenomatous foci in proximal colon polyps with endoscopic features of hyperplastic polyps is low. Whether endoscopic resection of polyps with these features is warranted remains uncertain.

### Endoscopic resection and histological evaluation of colorectal polyps: Is it a definitive treatment [^116P9xQd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Postpolypectomy follow-up colonoscopy was conducted, with only 75 patients (50% of the study group) undergoing follow-up within the 2 years. Among these patients, 35 had normal colonoscopy results. In 30.6% of the cases (23 patients), new small polyps smaller than 0.5 cm were detected and resected. Due to the small size of these polyps, it was challenging to determine if they were previously missed or if they were metachronous ones. Histological evaluation revealed that 10 patients had undergone surgery, and their surgical specimens showed infiltration by adenocarcinoma; however, no patient had lymph node infiltration during the operation. In 7 patients, the colon displayed partial mild inflammation, although without specific histological findings.

- **Other findings**: In 18 patients (12%), diverticula were located in various parts of the colon. Additionally, 15 patients (10%) presented with mild diverticulitis. In 2 cases (1.3%), large colonic masses were found obstructing the intestinal lumen.

### Three pathologic criteria for reproducible diagnosis of colonic sessile serrated lesion versus hyperplastic polyp [^11717F5A]. Human Pathology (2023). Low credibility.

Colonic SSLs are thought to predispose to approximately 30% of colonic adenocarcinomas. This increased risk, compared to benign HPs, makes their distinction vitally important. However, no gold standard exists to differentiate them, and wide observer variability is reported.

We investigated 94 serrated polyps (53 SSLs and 41 HPs) using an easy-to-apply pathologic scoring system that combines, for the first time, three established distinguishing features: polyp morphology, location, and size. Polyp size was assessed by serrated biopsy number compared to endoscopic size. RNA expression profiling served as an additional biomarker. The considerable morphologic overlap across serrated polyps was quantitated for the first time.

Interobserver variability was assessed by 8 expert gastrointestinal pathologists. By ROC analysis, polyp size by biopsy number performed best, followed by polyp location and morphology (areas under the curves [AUCs] = 85.9%, 81.2%, and 65.9%, respectively). Optimal discrimination combined all three features (AUC = 92.9%). For polyp size, the biopsy number proved superior to endoscopic size (AUC = 85.9% versus 55.2%, P = 0.001). Interobserver variability analysis yielded the highest reported Fleiss and Kappa statistics (0.879) and percent agreement (96.8%), showing great promise toward improved diagnosis.

The proposed three-criteria pathologic system, combining size by biopsy number, location, and morphology, yields an improved, easy-to-use, and highly reproducible diagnostic approach for differentiating SSLs.

### Serrated polyps of the large intestine: A morphologic and molecular review of an evolving concept [^112CX197]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Serrated polyps of the large intestine, including traditional hyperplastic polyps, traditional serrated adenomas, and more recently described sessile serrated adenomas, have gained increased recognition in recent years because of growing evidence that one of these lesions, the sessile serrated adenoma, might be the precursor lesion for some cases of microsatellite unstable colorectal carcinoma. Nevertheless, there has been some reluctance to embrace the concept of sessile serrated adenoma, and numerous diagnostic challenges exist.

This article, which grew out of the Roger C. Haggitt Gastrointestinal Pathology Society Forum presented in Vancouver, Canada, on March 6, 2004, as part of the annual meeting of the United States-Canadian Academy of Pathology, reviews the morphologic and molecular evidence for the concept of various polyps in the general category of serrated polyps of the large intestine, in particular the lesion known as the sessile serrated adenoma, and provides a conceptual framework for the diagnosis of these lesions.

### Early lymphoid lesions: Conceptual, diagnostic and clinical challenges [^115GzXrd]. Haematologica (2014). Low credibility.

There are no "benign lymphomas", a fact due to the nature of lymphoid cells to circulate and home as part of their normal function. Thus, benign clonal expansions of lymphocytes are only rarely recognized when localized. Recent studies have identified a number of lymphoid proliferations that lie at the interface between benign and malignant. Some of these are clonal proliferations that carry many of the molecular hallmarks of their malignant counterparts, such as BCL2/IGH and CCND1/IGH translocations associated with the in situ forms of follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma, respectively.

There are other clonal B-cell proliferations with low risk of progression; these include the pediatric variants of follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma. Historically, early or incipient forms of T/NK-cell neoplasia also have been identified, such as lymphomatoid papulosis and refractory celiac disease. More recently, an indolent form of T-cell lymphoproliferative disease affecting the gastrointestinal tract has been described. Usually CD8(+), the clonal cells are confined to the mucosa. The clinical course is chronic but non-progressive. NK-cell enteropathy is a clinically similar condition, composed of cytologically atypical NK-cells that may involve the stomach, small bowel, or colon. Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a cytologically alarming lesion that is self-limited if confined to the seroma cavity. Atypical lymphoid proliferations that lie at the border of benign and malignant can serve as instructive models of lymphomagenesis.

Lymphocytic colitis (LC) is characterized by chronic watery diarrhea and unremarkable endoscopic findings. Only one case of LC presenting as multiple colonic polyps has been reported. We report a case series of histologic LC pattern of injury (LCPI), presenting as endoscopic polyps, and compare them with typical LC cases. Eighteen archived (2009–2019) polypoid LCPI cases without an associated cause of polyp, such as adenoma, hyperplastic change, or lymphoid aggregate, were retrieved from 17 (12 female and 5 male) patients. The clinical history and endoscopic findings were noted. A total of 40 conventional LC cases were used as controls. Fisher's exact test was performed to evaluate associations between two variables.

The mean age of the patients was 61.1 years. The indication for colonoscopy was chronic watery diarrhea (56%), screening/surveillance (33%), and rectal bleeding (11%). The mean number and size of the polyps were 1.6 and 2.9 mm, respectively. Seventy-six percent were located in the left colon, and 48% were sessile. When biopsied (14/18; 78%), the background colonic mucosa showed LCPI. There was no significant difference in age, gender, and the average number of lymphocytes in the two groups. Hypertension and history of malignancy were more common in the polypoid LCPI group than in the control LC group (P < 0.05). LCPI may present as endoscopic polyps, frequently in patients with hypertension and history of malignancy. Polypoid LCPI may be a harbinger of LCPI in the background nonpolypoid colonic mucosa. A subset of polypoid LCPI (56%) cases represents true LC.

### Comparative analysis of mononuclear cells isolated from mucosal lymphoid follicles of the human ileum and colon [^111nqa5Z]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Studies of human mucosal lymphoid follicles are rare and have been limited to children's Peyer's patches, which are visible at endoscopy. We investigated lymphoid follicles in ileum biopsies of 87 patients and surgical colon specimens from 66 cancer patients and examined the phenotype and function of isolated follicular immune cells. Two (0–10) and 12 (0–117) follicles per patient were found in ileum and colon samples, respectively (P < 0.001). The number of lymphoid follicles mononuclear cells (LFMC) that could be isolated per patient was higher from colon compared with ileum specimens [725,000 (0–23 million) versus 100,000 (0–1.3 million), P < 0.001].

T cells were predominant in both LFMC and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC). However, B cells were more frequent and plasma cells were less frequent in LFMC. T cells from mucosal follicles were more frequently CD4-positive and CD62L-positive, but less frequently CD8-positive, CD103-positive, and CD69-positive than lamina propria T cells. LFMC from the ileum compared with the colon showed no differences in mononuclear cell composition.

Anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation induced similar proliferation of LFMC and LPMC from ileum and colon, as well as secretion of high levels of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-2, but lower levels of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10. LFMC from the colon secreted more IL-2 than those from the ileum. Our study shows that mucosal lymphoid follicles can be identified clearly in the adult human colon and yield viable immune cells sufficient for phenotypical and functional analysis.

### Management of neoplastic polyps in inflammatory bowel disease [^113jte4j]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Dysplasia-associated lesions or masses (DALMs) are a heterogeneous population of lesions with different endoscopic and morphologic features. Non-adenoma-like DALMs should be removed via colectomy. Adenoma-like DALMs that occur outside areas of colitis can be treated like sporadic adenomas and removed by polypectomy. Recent data suggest that adenoma-like DALMs located within areas of colitis should be removed by polypectomy with complete excision and multiple biopsies of the site. As long as there is no flat dysplasia or adenocarcinoma elsewhere in the colon, a colectomy is not required. However, this group of patients requires increased colonoscopic surveillance.

### Diagnostic value of distal colonic polyps for prediction of advanced proximal neoplasia in an average-risk population undergoing screening colonoscopy [^116tX5Lp]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

For colorectal cancer screening, the predictive value of distal findings in the ascertainment of proximal lesions is not fully established. The aims of this study were to assess distal findings as predictors of advanced proximal neoplasia and to compare the predictive value of endoscopy alone versus combined endoscopic and histopathologic data.

- **Methods**: Primary colonoscopy screening was performed in 2210 consecutive, average-risk adults. Age, gender, endoscopic (size, number of polyps), and histopathologic distal findings were used as potential predictors of advanced proximal neoplasms, defined as any adenoma greater than or equal to 1 cm in size, and/or with villous histology, and/or with severe dysplasia or invasive cancer. Polyps were classified as distal if located in the descending colon, sigmoid colon, or rectum, while those in other locations were designated proximal.

- **Results**: Neoplastic lesions, including 11 invasive cancers, were found in 617 (27.9%) patients. Advanced proximal neoplasms without any distal adenoma were present in 1.3% of patients. Of the advanced proximal lesions, 39% were not associated with any distal polyp. Older age, male gender, and distal adenoma were independent predictors of advanced proximal neoplasms. The predictive ability of a model with endoscopic data alone did not improve after including histopathologic data. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the predictive ability of models that use age, gender, and any combination of distal findings was relatively low. The proportion of advanced proximal neoplasms identified if any distal polyp was found.

### AGA clinical practice update on risk stratification for colorectal cancer screening and post-polypectomy surveillance: Expert review [^115wiiSJ]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for colon cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening (risk stratification), AGA 2023 guidelines recommend classifying individuals without a personal history of CRC, IBD, hereditary CRC syndromes, other CRC predisposing conditions, or a family history of CRC as being at average risk for CRC.

### Chasing colonic "polyps": Features that predict underlying adenomas in initially nondiagnostic endoscopic biopsy specimens [^117QTXEW]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Initial tissue sections from biopsies of endoscopically apparent colonic polyps may not always demonstrate a lesion to account for the clinical findings. Studies have shown that deeper sections and/or reorientation reveal lesions in 10% to 31% of initially nondiagnostic cases. However, many are clinically inconsequential hyperplastic or inflammatory polyps, and thus, exhaustive efforts to identify them may not be justified.

The aim of this study was to identify clinical parameters that predict the detection of adenomas in initially nondiagnostic endoscopic biopsies of colonic "polyps". We reoriented, reembedded, and obtained deeper tissue levels on 100 initially nondiagnostic biopsy specimens of clinically apparent polyps and found 9% to contain tubular adenomas. Only 3% of polyps smaller than 5 mm proved to be adenomas, compared with 22% of those 5 mm or larger (P < .01). We conclude that nondiagnostic biopsy specimens of polyps measuring 5 mm or more should be further evaluated because they are more likely to represent adenomas, whereas smaller lesions are usually clinically inconsequential.

### Low-grade dysplasia in ulcerative colitis: Risk factors for developing high-grade dysplasia or colorectal cancer [^1141rPub]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

We observed a clear association between the number of risk factors present (i.e. lesion shape, size, and preceding indefinite dysplasia) and the risk of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Of note, patients with only one of these risk factors had a 17.7% risk of progression at five years after the initial low-grade dysplasia (LGD) diagnosis.

The relatively low rate of progression observed in this group is perhaps not surprising, as it represents LGD cases that could be potentially removed endoscopically. For example, 18 patients (without preceding dysplasia) had their large polypoid LGD removed endoscopically (median size, 15 mm; interquartile range [IQR], 10–25 mm). During a median follow-up of 33 months (IQR, 15–49 months), 2 of these patients developed CRC (both Dukes' A) in 6 and 24 months after resection, and 1 patient developed HGD in 6 months (incidence rate, 45.5 per 1,000 patient-years).

Similarly, of 8 patients who underwent endoscopic resection for small (< 1 cm) nonpolypoid lesions, 1 patient developed CRC (Dukes' A) during a median follow-up of 44 months (IQR, 26–66 months; incidence rate, 26.8 per 1,000 patient-years). Thus, these data suggest that colectomy may not always be necessary for this group of patients, provided that the lesion can be resected in full with no evidence of dysplasia elsewhere in the colon. However, given the small number of cases, these data should be interpreted with caution.

In contrast, when patients had two risk factors, their risk of developing HGD or CRC exceeded 50% at five years following their initial LGD diagnosis.

### Colon polyps: Updates in classification and management [^1159eVzW]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Colon polyps are potential precursors to colorectal cancer (CRC), which remains one of the most common causes of cancer-associated death. The proper identification and management of these colorectal polyps is an important quality measure for colonoscopy outcomes. Here, we review colon polyp epidemiology, their natural history, and updates in endoscopic classification and management.

Recent findings indicate that colon polyps forming not only from the adenoma but also from the serrated polyp pathway have a significant risk for future progression to CRC. Therefore, correct identification and management of sessile serrated lesions can improve the quality of screening colonoscopy. Malignant polyp recognition continues to be heavily reliant on well-established endoscopic classification systems and plays an important role in intraprocedural management decisions.

- **Management strategies**: Hot snare remains the gold standard for pedunculated polyp resection. Nonpedunculated noninvasive lesions can be effectively removed by large forceps if diminutive, but cold snare is preferred for colon polyps 3–20mm in diameter. Larger lesions, at least 20mm, require endoscopic mucosal resection. Polyps with the endoscopic appearance of submucosal invasion require surgical referral or advanced endoscopic resection in select cases. Advances in artificial intelligence may revolutionize endoscopic polyp classification and improve both patient and cost-related outcomes of colonoscopy.

Clinicians should be aware of the most recent updates in colon polyp classification and management to provide the best care to their patients.

### Colon polyps: Updates in classification and management [^1153LQ8t]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on colorectal polyps:

- **Definition**: Colorectal polyps are abnormal growths originating from the colonic or rectal mucosa. They can be classified into several types, including adenomatous, hyperplastic, serrated, hamartomatous, and inflammatory polyps, each with varying potential for malignant transformation.

- **Pathophysiology**: The development of colorectal polyps is a complex process involving the abnormal proliferation of epithelial cells in the colon or rectum. This can be driven by various genetic and epigenetic changes, such as chromosomal instability and MSI pathways, leading to the disruption of normal cell growth and differentiation processes. Some polyps, particularly adenomatous polyps, have the potential to progress to CRC through a process known as the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of colorectal adenomas in individuals aged over 50 years is estimated at 20–60% in the US.

- **Risk factors**: Several factors have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal polyps, including age (over 40 years), male sex, a family history of CRC or polyps, certain genetic syndromes, IBD, and lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity, and a diet high in red meat (for rectal polyps).

- **Disease course**: Most colorectal polyps are asymptomatic and are often detected incidentally during routine colonoscopies. Occasionally, large polyps can cause symptoms.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for patients with colorectal polyps is generally good, especially when the polyps are detected and removed early.

### Bowel histology of CVID patients reveals distinct patterns of mucosal inflammation [^113LwZwg]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Daniels et al. had far more patients with lymphoid aggregates in their colonic biopsies (81%), though our proportion (47.8%) is comparable to that of Maarschalk et al, who found nodular lymphoid hyperplasia in 53% of biopsies, of Herbst et al, with 41.2% nodular lymphoid hyperplasia in their small bowel biopsies, and of Oksenhendler et al, who found nodular lymphoid hyperplasia in 55.9% of CVID patients with diarrhea.

Figure 4b shows that NLH, as well as inflammation, often occur as single features, whereas villous flattening predominantly occurs together with other features. Infection, taken as a single group including viruses and parasites, did not have a clear association. However, this may be influenced by sampling: for example, the patient with chronic norovirus infection but "normal" duodenal histology had evidence of villous blunting in other parts of the small bowel on capsule endoscopy.

### Sessile serrated polyp mimicry in patients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome: Is there evidence of preneoplastic change [^112gVj4V]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS) is associated with erythema and ulceration of the rectal wall. Serrated lesions of the colon are divided into conventional hyperplastic polyps and a new set of lesions that are variably called sessile serrated polyps (SSPs) and sessile serrated adenomas. The SSPs are epithelial proliferative lesions that appear to act as a unique pathway to colorectal carcinogenesis. No association between SRUS and SSPs has been previously reported.

- **Objective**: To assess a possible association between SRUS and morphologic features that mimic SSPs.

- **Design**: Twenty-six patients with SRUS, who presented to our institution between January 1, 1999, and November 14, 2004, were retrospectively reviewed for SSP-type morphologic features by three pathologists. Ki-67 and hMLH1 immunohistochemical stains were used. Control tissues included 10 conventional left-sided hyperplastic polyps, 10 right-sided large SSPs, 7 adenocarcinomas with known loss of hMLH1 gene expression, and 4 normal human tonsil tissues.

- **Results**: Ten (38%) of 26 SRUS specimens demonstrated histologic features consistent with SSPs. These features included exaggerated serration within the lower crypt compartments, crypt branching, hypermucinous appearance of epithelium, and horizontal extension of crypt bases along the muscularis mucosa. All 10 cases of SRUS had positive basal Ki-67 staining in 10% to 20% of cells. Two (20%) of the 10 cases demonstrated focal superficial loss of hMLH1 mismatch repair gene expression within areas of serrated morphologic features.

### The proto CPG island methylator phenotype of sessile serrated adenomas/polyps [^114ftnPH]. Epigenetics (2018). Low credibility.

Closure of this gap could be hastened by the identification of robust sets of molecular SSA/P biomarkers: stool-based diagnostic panels for use in noninvasive pre-colonoscopy screening programs, and tissue-based panels for more reliable diagnosis of these lesions in pathology laboratories. DNA methylation changes offer several advantages for use as pre-colonoscopy screening markers. Not only are they the most stable of known epigenetic marks, but they also occur early in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, differentially methylated regions of the genome far outnumber gene mutations in precancerous colon tumors, and they tend to be found across most lesions (unlike mutations, which are likely to be tumor subset-specific).

These considerations prompted us to quantitatively characterize genome-wide DNA hypermethylation in a prospectively collected series of SSA/Ps, each with a paired sample of normal mucosa, and to see how the epigenetic phenotype of SSA/Ps compares with those of cADNs and of CIMP colon cancers themselves. Our primary aim was to identify strong DNA methylation-based biomarker candidates with the potential for improving the identification and differential diagnosis of precancerous colorectal lesions. Our secondary aim was to determine the extent to which changes in the precancer's methylome are reflected in their gene expression profile. To this end, we subjected the same tissue series to RNA-sequencing analysis, which also allowed us to identify numerous lesion-specific transcriptional dysregulations with potential for development.

### Deeper examination of negative colorectal biopsies [^114bBnsZ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Initial histologic sections of specimens from colorectal biopsies of putative lesions may lack polyps. These sections may contain lymphoid aggregates that seemingly correlate with endoscopic findings; however, additional sections might contain polyps. We reviewed 83 specimens from colorectal biopsies of putative lesions for which initial sections lacked polyps. Our objectives were to determine the incidence of polyps within additional sections and to determine whether the presence of lymphoid aggregates within initial sections excludes the presence of polyps within additional sections.

Eight specimens (10%) contained polyps (5 adenomatous, 3 hyperplastic), which remained histologically occult until examination to depths of approximately 120 to 380 microm. Five polyps (62%) were associated with lymphoid aggregates that were present within initial sections. We conclude that additional sections may contain surprisingly large numbers of polyps and that lymphoid aggregates present within initial sections fail to exclude the presence of polyps within additional sections.
